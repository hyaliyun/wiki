He is involved in the preservation of architectural history through film and has worked alongside Millie and Morton Goldsholl in creating a new genre of design-based films in advertising. Boyer studied at the Institute of Design alongside filmmaker Larry Janiak and the filmmaker and photographer Robert Stiegler. Boyer played a central role in the development of Chicago's underground film scene in the 1960s, and he was teaching filmmaking at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Early life  Boyer's first introduction to film was in high school while experimenting with his father's camera. While attending Lane Technical High School in the 1950s, Boyer and Larry Janiak attended two iterations of the International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA). It was at one of these conferences that the two students met Morton and Millie Goldsholl who organized the 1959 conference. After high school, Boyer went on to study at the Institute of Design, along with Janiak who is a film maker in Chicago‚Äôs underground film community and graduated in 1970.  Early work  In 1955, Boyer and his high school peers, Larry Janiak and Ronald Larson, had their animated cartoon films on display at the Tribune Tower Gallery. A 1955 Chicago Tribune article states that all three boys would be ‚Äúinvited to Hollywood to see first-hand film cartoon techniques used in commercial production.‚Äùhttps://search.proquest.com/docview/179422439 The trio ‚Äúdeveloped a specially equipped camera and photography table, valued at more than $1,000‚ÄùFlavin, Genevieve. \\"Tribune Hall shows Art of Lane Pupils.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963), Jun 01, 1955 These accomplishments caught the attention of Disney and the group was flown out to LA to visit the Disney studios.

It has a single thin leaf and up to twenty five dark purplish-black flowers with tiny glandular hairs on the sepals and petals. Description Genoplesium vernale is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin, dark green leaf long and reddish at the base with the free part of the leaf long. Between ten and twenty five dark purplish-black flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long reaching to a height of . The flowers lean downwards and are about long, wide and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, long, wide with a sharply pointed tip and tiny glandular hairs on its edges. The lateral sepals are narrow oblong to lance-shaped, long, wide with a humped base, tiny glandular hairs on its edges and are more or less parallel to each other. The petals are lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped, long, wide with a sharply pointed tip and tiny glandular hairs on the edges. The labellum is narrow oblong to elliptic in shape, about long, wide, thick and fleshy with tiny glandular hairs on its edges. There is a dark purple to brownish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs between September and December. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium vernale was first formally described in 2001 by David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis vernalis. The specific epithet (vernale) is a Latin word meaning \\"spring\\". Distribution and habitat The spring midge orchid grows in shrubby forest between Jervis Bay and Mogo. Conservation Genoplesium vernale is only known from a narrow belt of forest about wide. A survey conducted in 2000 found about 450 plants but the number is probably greater since not all suitable habitat has been surveyed. The main threats to the species are land clearing, forestry operations and inappropriate fire regimes. The species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

In Central Africa the strongest predictors of a decline of elephant populations were proximity to expanding infrastructure and absence of law enforcement. A significant decline in African forest elephant populations between 2002 and 2011, was facilitated by increased road-building rates in Central Africa. In equatorial West Africa, the primary cause of the collapse of gorilla and chimpanzee populations was hunting spurred by a rapid expansion of road networks, which facilitated poaching as well as habitat conversion.Sloan, S., Supriatna, J., Campbell, M.J., Alamgir, M.., Laurance, W.F.

Catastrophic ape decline in western equatorial Africa. Nature 422, 611‚Äì614. Where forest management is weak, road expansion proceeds unregulated, and can be allowed to fragment crucial bioregions and protected areas. In Africa, upgraded and proposed road-development corridors intersected 345 protected areas, of which 69 were high value protected areas (national parks, World Heritage site, RAMSAR site).  Effects on the economy   Market access  Road infrastructure development lowers the costs of accessing markets, especially for remote communities. Increased market access allows producers, such as farmers, to increase the export of their goods, and thereby increase money into the community. Improved road infrastructure has reduced poverty by facilitating higher production and exports in Peru, Bangladesh,Khandker, S., xa, R, Bakht, Z., Koolwal, G., xa, & B. (2009). The Poverty Impact of Rural Roads: Evidence from Bangladesh. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 57(4), 685-722. doi:10.1086/598765 and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Improved market access as a result of improved road infrastructure facilitates a trend from subsistence agriculture to increasing specialized and commercialized agriculture. Increased commercialization of agriculture results in economic gains for communities, however it can also increase dependence on external markets and external sources of goods. This has been shown to either result in improved food security, as communities are not reliant on their own agricultural capacity, or be detrimental to nutritional status as communities no longer produce a diverse range of crops. Facilitating access of remote communities to urban markets has the detrimental effect of allowing urban market influences to affect rural economies. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, urban markets are subject to greater control by soldiers than are rural markets, resulting in hunters and farmers paying more protection money and getting less of a share of profits made. Greater market intensity is also more environmentally detrimental. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, more large- bodied and endangered animals are hunted for sale in urban markets than in rural markets.  Road construction  Roads must be well designed and constructed to reduce impacts on regional geomorphology and hydrology. In undulating terrain, road construction typically proceeds via cut-and-fill activities, in which high parts of the landscape are cut down and the fill (soil and mineral earth) is bulldozed into lower areas, in order to flatten- out the topography along the road route. Concurrently, vegetation is usually cleared along and adjacent to a road footprint. These practices dramatically increases surface erosion and sediment inputs to water courses, altering hydrological patterns, reducing water quality for humans and livestock and elevating water turbidity and temperature.Sidle, R.C., Sasaki, S., Otsuki, M., Noguchi, S., Rahim Nik, A., 2004.

Erosion processes in steep terrain‚Äîtruths, myths, and uncertainties related to forest management in Southeast Asia. Forest Ecology and Management 224, 199‚Äì225. The altered existing hydrological dynamics resulting from cut and fill activities, inadequate drainage, culverts, and bridges associated with road construction can also obstruct surface-water flow, leading to impeded drainage and localized flooding, particularly during high-rainfall episodes.Beevers, L., Douven, W., Lazuardi, H., Verheij, H., 2012.

Road construction in mountainous areas or steep terrain increases the risks of landslides,Leshchinsky, B., Olsen, M.J., Mohney, C., Glover-Cutter, K., Crook, G., Allan, J., Bunn, M., O'Banion, M., Mathews, N., 2017. Mitigating coastal Iandslide damage. Science 357, 981‚Äì982. particularly in wet environments. Site disturbances, vegetation clearing, unstable terrain caused by cut-and-fill activities, and road drainage all contributes to the elevated rates of landslides in mountainous or steep terrain areas with roads[48], with the likelihood of landslides in close proximity to roads being up to five times higher.Larsen, M.C., Parks, J.E., 1997.

In the Brazilian Amazon, ~90% of fires occurred within ‚â§10 km of roads.Adeney, J.M., Christensen, N.L., Jr., Pimm, S.L., 2009. Reserves protect against deforestation fires in the Amazon. PLoS ONE 4, e5014. Road construction in forests leads to an increased frequency of fires. This happens via numerous mechanisms, including intentionally lit fires (leading to deforestation), leaked fires from land management practices adjacent to fragmented forests or roads, and accidental fires due to increased human-ignition sources.Alencar, A., Nepstad, D., Diaz, M.C.V., 2006.

Positive feedbacks among forest fragmentation, drought, and climate change in the Amazon. Conservation Biology 15, 1529‚Äì1535. Increased fire frequency produces direct biomass loss and carbon emissions, and elevated fire regimes alter the species composition and ecological dynamics of the susceptible forests.  Traffic and road maintenance  Funding for new road infrastructure in developing nations is focused on initial road construction, with less money being earmarked for ongoing maintenance.Alamgir, M., Campbell, M.J., Sloan, S., Goosem, M., Clements, G.R., Mahmoud, M.I., Laurance, W.F., 2017. Economic, socio-political and environmental risks of road development in the tropics. Current Biology 27, R1130-R1140. With many new roads being constructed in high-rainfall tropical environments, degradation leading to slumping and pot-holing are rendering expensive paved roads impassable in just a few years. Road degradation increases the cost of using the road, by lengthening travel time or causing damage to vehicles. Poor quality paved roads may cost less on initial construction, but are more costly to maintain and produce greater costs of use over the life of the road. Maintaining roads involves long-term and major investments which are subjected to corrupt practices of those saddled with maintenance responsibilities. Moreover, budgeting high construction costs, but building substandard roads which require higher levels of maintenance is both a common practice and a major drain on public expenditures and private investment. Such activities escalate costs and reduce the usable lifetime of roads, and is particularly evident in many developing countries where corruption is more pervasive and implicitly tolerated.Mahmoud, M. I., Sloan, S., Campbell, M. J., Alamgir, M., Imong, I., Odigha, O., . . . Laurance, W. F. (2017). Alternative routes for a proposed nigerian superhighway to limit damage to rare ecosystems and wildlife. Tropical Conservation Science, 10, 1940082917709274.World Bank. (2010). Cost-benefit analysis in world bank projects. Retrieved from Washington, DC Increased road expansion incentivises people to purchase cars and use roads to a greater degree than previously. This increased use results in further degradation of the roads, leading to higher maintenance costs. Increased vehicle and road use leads to more accidents, particularly in regions where roads are poor quality and motor vehicle use is relatively novel. More roads results in more traffic, due to induced demand, further increasing the rate of road degradation. As such, economic appraisals of road projects in developing countries often find that improving existing road infrastructure is more beneficial than construction of new road infrastructure.  Effects on societies   Access to services  In developing countries especially, goods and services such as health facilities and educational facilities are concentrated in urban regions, with little to no availability in remote and rural areas. Road expansion provides greater accessibility to urban centres, and hence improve educational attainment. In both Bangladesh and Madagascar investments in improving rural roads have led to greater education attainment. Similarly, greater access to urban areas gives remote communities better access to health facilities, including medical supplies and medical information, and has been associated with better health outcomes. Access to urban centres facilitated by road expansion improves employment opportunities. In Indonesia, improved roads allowed job creation in manufacturing industries and an occupational shift amongst workers away from agriculture.Gertler, P.J., M. Gonzalez-Navarro, T. Gracner, and A.D. Rothenberg (2014) \\"The Role of Road Quality Investments on Economic Activity and Welfare: Evidence from Indonesia‚Äôs Highways,‚Äù mimeo. http://sites.bu.edu/neudc/files/2014/10/paper_250.pdf Conversely, a greater supply of people seeking employment can drive down the wages in an area, producing a negative effect on livelihoods.Grant, U. (2008) Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets London: Overseas Development Institute While access to goods and services associated with urban centres is beneficial, increased relocation to already densely populated centres increases the strain on cities already struggling to cope with growing populations, particularly in developing regions.Economic Intelligence Unit. 2013.

Increasing urbanization presents problems including increased crime, increasing inequality, and public health concerns.Malik, A. A. (2016). Urbanization and Crime: A Relational Analysis. J. HUMAN. & Soc. Scl., 21, 68‚Äì69  Migration and culture  Road expansion leads to forced migration of local peoples, with indigenous groups often being highly vulnerable. This happens via the influx of non-indigenous settlers who migrate into the region for employment or to exploit local resources. Non- indigenous settlers can attain or claim the land title through land grabbing, land speculation, and illegal colonization.Koji, T., Hoban, C., 1997 Roads and the environment: a handbook, p. 252.

While migration increases urbanization, potentially leading to increased development, this is at the expense of indigenous populations. Road expansion is particularly threatening for vulnerable remote communities. Large road projects generate an influx of temporary migrant workers, which increases the demand for immoral services such as prostitution and black-market products.Carswell, J.W., 1987. HIV infection in healthy persons in Uganda. AIDS 1, 223‚Äì227. Beyond this, road expansion in remote areas also promotes activities such as illegal logging, illegal mining, poaching, smuggling and illicit drug production.Asner, G.P., Llactayo, W., Tupayachi, R., Luna, E.R., 2013. Elevated rates of gold mining in the Amazon revealed through high-resolution monitoring.

Such activities can have chain-reaction-like impacts on the traditional culture and social structure of local communities. The scale and pace of these impacts are most severe in indigenous communities. The traditional culture and lifestyles of indigenous groups that have lived in remote areas for many generations are substantially altered by new roads. Unprecedented road penetration into their natural landscapes can damage the aesthetic of the landscape and traditional cultural practices, the influx of non-indigenous land settlers violates traditional land rights, and increased commercial poaching alters traditional hunting practices. All such consequences degrade the cultural heritage of the indigenous communities, increasing loss of their traditional identity and culture.Colombijn, F., 2002. Introduction: on the road. Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia 158, 595 ‚Äì 617. Diseases Temporary workers for road building and the influx of settlers resulting from road building bring new pests and diseases into communities. This mechanism is particularly dangerous for indigenous communities that have limited tolerance and immunity to new pathogens. For instance, the construction of the Trans-Amazon highway in the 1970s resulted in the death of 45% of one indigenous community within a single year.Hecht, S.B., Cockburn, A., 2010. The Fate of the Forest: Developers, Destroyers and Defenders of the Amazon, Updated edn. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, USA. Road expansion increases the incursion of common diseases into communities such as malaria and also increase the vulnerability of communities to previously uncommon diseases such as HIV. This occurs as pests and pathogens use roads as a pathway to spread from one place to another place. Human enteric pathogen levels, for instance, were 2‚Äì8-times higher in Ecuadorian villages near roads than in more remote areas and incursions of dengue fever, malaria, and HIV were higher among people living near roads than in remote communities.Dutta, P., Khan, S. A., Sharma, C. K., Doloi, P., Hazarika, N. C. and Mahanta, J., 1998. Distribution of potential dengue vectors in major townships along the national highways and trunk roads of Northeast India. Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health 29, 173‚Äì176.  Conflict  The influx of non-indigenous migrants through road building, and the associated intensification creates inter-group conflicts, such as seen between indigenous Amazonian tribes and loggers or gold miners. Additionally, increased road access increases the spread of conflicting forces in war-torn regions, and the pace at which conflicts escalate. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accessible regions were exposed to more violent events than less accessible regions resulting in a decrease in population welfare.  Reducing the Impacts of Road Expansion  There are a few ways of reducing its impacts. Expanding existing roads Following the ‚Äòfirst-cut-is-the-deepest‚Äô dictum, the expansion or upgrading of roads in previously settled areas is believed to cause less environmental impact per kilometre of road development than where new roads penetrate intact forest landscapes. Beyond this rule of thumb, however, road expansion threatens remnant habitats of endangered species and leads to the loss of remnant areas of rare ecosystems (e.g., lowland tropical forest). This is increasingly common as new major road developments seek to consolidate earlier, rudimentary road networks (often characterized by penetration roads, improvised roads, and rough tracks) to expand agricultural and industrial activities in partially deforested landscapes. Many economic appraisals of road projects in developing countries have found that improving existing road infrastructure is more beneficial than construction of new road infrastructure. Examples of such consolidative road- expansion projects include the various 'development corridors' of Africa, meant to facilitate trans-national economic activities; Indonesia‚Äôs development corridors as per its Master Development Plan,CMEA (2011). Master Plan: Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic Development, 2011‚Äì2025, Jakarta. meant to accelerate agro-industrial development, mining and timber extraction; and China's Belt and Road initiative.Lechner, A.M., Chan, F.K.S., and Campos-Arceiz, A. (2018). Biodiversity conservation should be a core value of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Nature Ecology & Evolution 2, 408‚Äì409. In northern Sumatra, Indonesia, proposed road developments extending the Trans- Sumatran Highway if they were to occur will affect six of the eight local conservation priority areas of the Leuser Ecosystem,Sloan, S., Campbell, M.J., Alamgir, M., Collier-Baker, E., Nowak, M., Usher, G., and Laurance, W.F.

Orangutans and the economics of sustainable forest management in Sumatra. Birkeland Trykkeri, Norway. In fact, Forest conversion due to road development in this region has been projected as a major factor influencing the decline in orangutan populations.Gaveau, D.L.A., Wich, S., Epting, J., Juhn, D., Kanninen, M., and Leader-Williams, N.

Land-cover changes predict steep declines for the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Science Advances 2, e1500789. Limiting road expansion Road planning to limit the extension of existing roads in ecologically vulnerable areas or mitigation measures such as restriction of road width and the inclusion of faunal overpasses is an emerging field of conservation science. Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting road expansion is beneficial for social and economic factors in developing regions. Many roads in remote areas have uncertain socio-economic benefits and surprisingly high economic, social, and environmental risks, and a cost-benefit analysis of 33 planned ‚Äòdevelopment corridors‚Äô in sub-Saharan Africa concluded that less than one-fifth of the projects were clearly justified. Many road developments will be characterized by upgrades to rudimentary road networks, rather than entirely new roads. The Trans-Borneo Highway in Sabah, Malaysia is one example, as virtually all road developments on this route planned for 2033 will coincide with existing logging roads or two-lane access roadways.Campbell, M.J., Sloan, S., Alamgir, M., and Laurance, W.F. (In preparation). Trans-Borneo Highway Development in Sabah Undermines Heart of Borneo Transnational Conservervation Pledge.Ministry of Local Government and Housing (2016). Sabah Structure Plan 2033, (Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malasyia: Town and Region Planning Department of Malaysian Ministry of Local Government and Housing).  Project assessment  The use of more rigorous approaches to project assessment and planning, such as cost- benefit analyses, proactive land-use planning, and strategic environmental- impact assessments are processes important for the improvement of road developments.

He bought his father-in-law's house in Bag Hovedvagten in 1772 Pf√ºzner had back in 1768 acquired two empty lots in Toldbodgade-Amaliegade. He constructed a townhouse for his own use at Amaliegade 8 while the Toldbodgade lot (No. 31) was sold to gehejmer√•d Hieronimus Johann Schultze (1717-1803). Amaliegade 8 was at the time of the 1787 census home to a total of five people: Andreas and Martha Catharina Pf√ºzner, a maid, a female cook and a coachman. Pf√ºzner died in 1793 and the house was the following year sold to Sigfred Victor Raben Levetzau, the holder of the stamhus Restrup in Northern Jutland.

He became known through his work with the BFBS (British Forces Broadcasting Service) during the 1960s and 70s, broadcasting to service Personnel of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) and their families who were stationed in what was then West Germany. He achieved a cult following due to his eccentricities and his ‚ÄòBig Wood Stories‚Äô that he wrote himself and performed live on the radio. BFBS Cologne and 'Kinder Club' Bill Mitchell broadcast from the BFBS studios in Cologne, which opened in 1954 and were based in a large villa at 61 Parkstrasse in the affluent Cologne suburb of Marienburg.Alan Grace This is the British Forces Network: The Story of Forces Broadcasting in Germany (1996) p.107 He was senior programme assistant and continuity announcer, and presented, as 'Uncle Bill', the daily children's radio programme 'Kinder Club'. The show featured music and children‚Äôs stories as well as listener‚Äôs requests, and was originally broadcast live at 5 p.m. after the end of each school day. These broadcasts were received by around 200,000 British listeners stationed in the Rheinland, but also reached a wider radio audience of both West and East Germans, Dutch, Belgian and Danish listeners, who could however not be acknowledged by the station as listeners, due to the terms of the station‚Äôs performing rights.The radio station that is forced to pretend most of its listeners do not exist by Dan van der Vat, The Times 22 Feb 1975 Big Wood Stories Bill Mitchell was best known for his broadcasting voice(s) and his 'Big Wood Stories' that told of the daily lives and adventures of a cast of animals: Owl, Badger, Nightjar and Water Rat amongst many others. He wrote the stories himself and performed an episode each day live on the radio, giving every one of the many characters their own distinctive voice and characteristics. He also hand drew a detailed map of the imaginary world of ‚ÄòBig Wood‚Äô with the sites of all the locations of the various adventures marked on it. Copies of this map were made available at military f√™tes and open days and became a treasured possession for many forces children.Clare Gibson Army Childhood: British Army Children's Lives and Times (2012) p.50 A number of the 'Big Wood stories' have since been uploaded onto the BFBS Radio Show Archive BFBS Radio Show Archive by Juergen Boernig, who was BFBS's archivist in Germany, with the help of Bill Mitchell's former colleague and fellow radio presenter Richard 'Asters' Astbury, MBE. The stories were popular with children and adults alike. When interviewed by Dan van der Vat in 1975 for The Times, Bill Mitchell revealed that he had left England 26 years previously and felt that it had become \\"an alien land\\" to which he had no wish to return. However his stories paint a nostalgic picture of an England from bygone days and helped give listeners stationed abroad during the Cold War era a \\"morale-boosting link with home\\".

These include soldiers referring to each other by nicknames taken from Big Wood characters, drinking games played out whilst the Big Wood story was on air, and a rumour that a remark made after leaving his microphone inadvertently switched on at the end of a broadcast of the show may have led to Bill Mitchell's ultimate retirement from the BFBS.

He then went to New York City (1770) where he was the Senior minister in the Trinity Lutheran Church. He became a Governor of New York College (present-day Columbia University) and a corporator of the New York Hospital. He was one of the addressers Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe. Houseal was an outspoken loyalist and his house and church were burned by the rebels.https://archive.org/stream/historicalnotice00hawk#page/338/mode/1up/search/nova+scotia After 14 years in New York City, he left for Nova Scotia as a loyalist refugee (1784). Rev. Houseal stayed in New York City until the formal evacuation. Before he left the Vestry of Trinity church his congregation presented him with a letter that stated: : We the Subscribers, Members of the Vestry, Elders, Deacons and Trustees of the Antient Evangelical Trinity Church of the City of New York, for ourselves, and in behalf of our whole Congregation, do testify by these presents, that our hitherto beloved minister, the Reverend Bernard Michael Houseal, during his officiating here, for the space of nearly fourteen years ...

It was built from 1892 to 1955. It was formerly known as German State National School and German Station State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2016.  History  Nundah State School (established 1865 as German Station National School) is located in the suburb of Nundah, about eight kilometres northeast of Brisbane's CBD. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. It retains a Depression-era brick school building (1935, 1941, 1946‚Äì51); a suburban timber school building (1915) with extensions (1916, 1955, 1956), and an Honour Board (1916); set in landscaped grounds with concrete retaining walls (, 1940), a playing field, sporting facilities and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with the Nundah and district community. Nundah is the site of the first free European settlement in Queensland. Lutheran missionaries settled there in 1838 on of land granted by Major Cotton, the then commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement. They named their settlement Zion Hill. The group numbered 20, including 2 ministers, 10 laymen and their families, until 4 more laymen missionaries arrived in 1844. By 1849, the group had abandoned their missionary work but most remained farming in the area. They purchased land at Nundah, then called German Station, which was surveyed into blocks by the Queensland Government in 1848, and a small rural community developed.DNRM, Zion Hill settlement Nundah, 1862 map reproduced in Ross Johnston and Helen Gregory, \\"Brisbane: Making it Work\\" in Pamela Statham, ed, The Origins of Australia's Capital Cities, Cambridge University Press, Sydney, 1989, p. 259Queensland Heritage Register (QHR) 601926 The First Free Settlers MemorialQueensland Places, Nundah, , accessed 17 Mar 2016HJJ Sparks, Queensland's First Free Settlement 1838-1938, WR Smith & Paterson, Brisbane, 1938, pp. 17, 18, 42-43. In the early 1860s, local citizens raised towards the cost for the establishment of German Station National School. The school opened on 2 October 1865 on its current site with 62 children enrolled.Nundah State School, German Station State School 1865 - Nundah State School 1965, Nundah State School, Brisbane, 1965, n.p.Queensland Government Gazette, 1871, p. 1357Nundah and Districts Historical Society Inc, From Pioneering Days Nundah Northgate Virginia, Nundah and Districts Historical Society Inc, Brisbane, revised ed 2010, p. 24.

A teachers residence was onsite from the 1860s, located to the north of the school building.'Nundah State School', The Brisbane Courier, 23 Jun 1896, p. 7DPW Plan 1077-5, New Closets for Girls, Alterations to Fencing, 21 August 1912 (with later modifications). The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales, were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p. 2. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 84, 120-1. Architectural plans for extensions to the school and teachers residences located at German Station, circa 1880 The development of Nundah, and increased school enrolments, were stimulated by the opening of the Sandgate railway line in 1882, with a stop at German Station (soon renamed Nundah railway station). Subdivision of land near the station from 1882 led to the formation of the Nundah village.'Classified Advertising', The Brisbane Courier, 26 Jul 1882, p. 4Classified Advertising', The Brisbane Courier, 22 Aug 1882, p. 4. Enrolment at German Station State School rose rapidly from 61 pupils in 1883 to 118 by 1886, resulting in extension of the school building in the same year. When a playshed was built in 1889, the school's enrolment was 200 pupils.Nundah State School, German Station State School, n.p.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Survey Part II, Nundah SS site no 20043, Project Services, Brisbane, January 2008 Another addition in 1892, connected to the northwest of the school building by a verandah, brought the classroom total to three.Nundah State School, German Station State School 1865, n.p.DPW Plan 1077-6, Nundah State School Additions Block Plan, 1 Sep 1909. The school's name changed to Nundah State School in 1896.Nundah and Districts Historical Society Inc, From Pioneering Days, p. 24. A new teacher's residence was built in 1897. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Boyd was critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations stressed the importance of the adding shade trees to playgrounds. Subsequently, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 4, 48-9. Arbor Day was regularly observed at Nundah State School from at least 1892, when 20 plants and shrubs were planted.'Nundah SS', The Telegraph, 23 May 1892, p. 4'Nundah SS', The Telegraph, 2 May 1893, p. 3'Arbor Day Nundah SS', The Brisbane Courier, 3 May 1913, p.6'Nundah SS', Brisbane Courier, 9 May 1916, p.5'Arbour Day Fete', The Telegraph, 1 Oct 1932, p. 7. In 2016 a number of mature trees feature in the school's grounds. From the late 19th century, Nundah became the centre for the surrounding district. It served as the headquarters for the Toombul Divisional Board after its new offices and a hall (Toombul Shire Hall) were built on Sandgate Road at Nundah in 1891.QHR600272 Toombul Shire Hall (former). Similarly, Nundah State School's population expanded and in 1909 another classroom was added to the western end of the school buildings.DPW Plan 1077-6, 1 September 1909; By 1910 the school had an average attendance of 342 pupils while the Nundah and district's population was 1675 in 1911. Early in the 20th century, accommodation for the infants of the school became a priority. In 1912 a new room was erected for the infants, to the west of the early school buildings; it was highset and had north and south-facing verandahs.Nundah State School, German Station State School, n.p. (This was demolished in 1964. See: Project Services, Nundah SS site no 20043 An infants wing (a suburban timber school building, known as Block D in 2016) of \\"substantial finish and ornate appearance\\", was erected to the west of the infants classroom in 1915 at a cost of .Nundah SS, Daily Standard, 18 Feb 1916, p. 6. The building contained three classrooms and had a wide north- facing verandah. The school's enrolment was 700 when the building was opened on 17 February 1916. That year, a teachers room was added to the verandah.DPW Plan 1077-5, 21 August 1912 (with later modifications)DPW Plan 94-15-7, Nundah State School Extension of Room & Erection of New Room for HD Teacher, 10 December 1923. A drawing of the building from 1933 shows it had a large roof fleche.DPW Plan 94A-15-7, Nundah State School Alterations, 26 October 1933. This suburban timber school building, designed by the Department of Public Works (DPW) in 1914, was the culmination of years of experimentation to solve many of the problems of light, ventilation, and classroom size that plagued previous school designs as well as provided the ideal, modern education environment.Type C/T8 as shown in Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 21. This type was introduced around 1909 and was constructed until approximately 1920. From 1893 the DPW had greatly improved the natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors, experimenting with different combinations of roof ventilators, ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. Achieving an ideal or even adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, was of critical importance to educators and consequently it became central to the design and layout of all school buildings. In highset timber buildings had been introduced, providing better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play area underneath. This was a noticeable new direction and this form became a characteristic of Queensland schools. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous ventilation flap on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, combined with a ceiling vent and large roof fleche, improved internal air quality and decreased internal temperatures effectively.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 19-20. During World War I (WWI) Nundah State School commemorated those serving in the war in several ways. An Anzac Arbor Day took place in May 1916, when five hibiscuses (Hibiscus spp.) and one Indian laburnum (Cassia fistula) were planted, the latter being given the name \\"Anzac tree\\". On 14 December of that year the Nundah State School Honour Board was unveiled by the Governor of Queensland, Major Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, in honour of 59 former pupils who were serving at the front.'Anzac Arbor Day', Daily Standard, 7 May 1916, p. 4'Nundah SS', Brisbane Courier, 9 May 1916, p. 5'Nundah State School Honour Board', Brisbane Courier, 14 Dec 1916, p. 7. None of the hibiscus or the laburnum appear to have survived. War memorials, including honour boards, are a tribute to those who served, and those who died, from a particular community. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. After WWI, Nundah and district, and Nundah State School, continued to grow. In 1921 Nundah's population was 3870. To accommodate the school's increased population the head teachers residence was converted into classrooms in 1919. In 1924 more than 800 children attended the school. The school committee worked to improve the playing conditions for the children with swings, seesaws, swinging boats and other playground equipment being provided, as well as a tennis court to the north of the site opened in October of that year.Queensland Places, Nundah , accessed Apr 2016Project Services, Nundah SS site no 20043'Nundah SS Fete', Brisbane Courier, 19 Sep 1924, p. 15School Tennis Court', The Telegraph, 20 Oct 1924, p. 7. The original teachers residence was replaced in 1897. See: Nundah State School, German Station State School 1865, n.p. Another building, of four sectional classrooms (which became Block E), was added in 1927.Project Services, Nundah SS site no 20043. Money was raised to pay for levelling the grounds, and Arbor Day continued to be celebrated with new plantings.'Nundah State School Committee', Daily Standard, 12 Apr 1930, p. 9 Alterations to the suburban timber school building were made in 1933, including: the relocation of large banks of casement windows from the east and west ends to the southern wall, and lining of the openings; relocation of a verandah wall door; and replacement of the fixed partition between the central and eastern classrooms with a new folding partition.DPW Plan 94A-15-7, 26 Oct 1933. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building programme to provide impetus to the economy. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work programme by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 Jul 1929, p.5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 Jul 1929, p.5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930', Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, p.15. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.58. At Nundah State School, intermittent relief workers carried out improvements to the playing field in 1933 for an estimated cost of .'Nundah School Committee', The Courier-Mail, 26 Sep 1933, p. 10. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public works building programme designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building programme included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p. 8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p. 2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p. 7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp. 6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p. 2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier- Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p. 2. Many of the programmes have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland, including the construction of masonry brick school buildings across the state. Most were designed in a classical idiom as this projects the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. The construction of substantial brick school buildingsType E/B1 as shown in Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 59. in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation. The Queensland Public Works Department and Department of Public Instruction were extremely enthusiastic about the brick school buildings designed in the 1930s. They were considered monuments to progress embodying the most modern principles of the ideal education environment.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 60. After years of requests by the school committee and parents for a more up-to-date school, construction of a brick school building at Nundah State School was approved and commenced in 1934. The building would run north- south parallel to Bage Street, with a lateral wing on either end, and would be completed in three stages: north wing (1935); the range (1941); and the south wing (1951, with the boys' toilet block in the southwest corner evident by 1946). The scheme, of brick with concrete foundations and tile roof, was to ultimately accommodate 1000 pupils. Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings, being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah on the north but little concession was made for this and almost all Depression-era brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, toilets and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 59-60. Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were derived from contemporary tastes and fashions, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; and Neo-classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, decorative treatment, and climatic-responsive features. Where other functions, such as infants classes or vocational training, were required, standard rooms designed to accommodate these functions were incorporated into the building plan.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans. The Chief Architect during this period was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966), who was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department from 1910 to 1951, and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951.QHR 601574, Ayr State High School. Construction of the northern wing by day labour commenced after the former head teacher's residence, which stood on the building site, was sold for removal.'New Building', The Telegraph, 19 Oct 1934, p. 10State Library of Queensland (SLQ), E W, Robinson, Recollections of the Nundah State School in the early 1900s, typescript, . The hip-roofed wing, aligned east-west and perpendicular to Bage Street, consisted of two storeys above an undercroft. Each floor comprised four classrooms for 40 pupils, a cloakroom and connecting corridors. By means of folding partitions each floor of this wing could be converted into one large room. One classroom on the first floor was raised to form a stage. The undercroft comprised lavatory accommodation for girls and female teachers and a concreted play area. The building's estimated cost was .DPW, Annual Report for the year ending 30 June 1935, p. 35'Nundah School Addition', The Courier-Mail, 29 Aug 1941 p. 7BCC, 1946 aerial accessed via PD Online'Wing Opening', Brisbane Telegraph, 14 Mar 1951, p. 18'Roasting the bullock', Brisbane Telegraph, 31 Mar 1951, p. 1.

The first stage of Nundah State School's brick school building (now called Block A) was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, Frank Cooper, on 5 October 1935 at the 70th anniversary of the school's commencement.'Nundah State School 70th Anniversary Fine New Wing Opened', The Telegraph, 5 Oct 1935, p. 7. Around the same time, retaining walls to the north and west of Block A were completed, followed by walls along the corner of Bage Street to the east and Boyd Road to the north in 1940. The concrete retaining walls had metal chain wire fences above and the wall to the north of Block A had steps accessing the tennis- basketball court area below.DNRM, aerial ADA8-5616, 1936DPW Plan 44C-22-5-15, Nundah State School Retaining Walls, 9 Apr 1935DPW Plan 83-22-3-2, Nundah S School Retaining Walls & Fencing, 7 Oct 1937DPW Plan 43-1-1, Nundah State School Site Plan, 29 Feb 1940. In 1940, plans for completion of Nundah State School's brick school building were finalised. They were drawn by Douglas FW Roberts who was also responsible for the plans for Toowoomba East State School. Overall the building was to be a strongly axial and symmetrically arranged two-storey structure, above an undercroft, that featured both Neo- classical and Arts and Crafts-style design influences. In addition to the existing northern wing, the 1940 plans show a range that aligned north-south and a southern wing that mirrored the north. The tiled hip-roofed range, with its projecting central entrance bay and lateral hip-roofed wings, addressed Bage Street to the east. The face brick exterior featured rendered stringcourses and quoins framing the windows, and the undercroft had an ashlar finish. Exterior windows comprised banks of eight-light casements, with fanlights, sheltered by continuous tiled hoods that had decorative timber brackets. The front entrance bay had a stepped parapeted gable and a divided staircase that led to a first floor flat-roofed porch. The rear entrance bay had internal stairs, flanked by cloakrooms, and diagonal stairs from the parade ground accessed first floor flat-roofed landings at the junctions between the range and the wings. The first and second floors contained classrooms, offices and storerooms while the undercroft comprised play areas with lavatories in the northwest (girls) and southwest (boys) corners. The range had four classrooms on the first floor, and five classrooms and a teachers room on the second floor. A central hall, flanked by teachers rooms, connected the first floor entrance porch with a corridor that ran along the western side of the range. Mirroring the north, the proposed southern wing contained four classrooms on each floor, separated by folding partitions. All classrooms were wide. Internal stairs and adjacent cloak rooms at the eastern ends of the wings accessed corridors that ran along the southern side of the north wing and northern side of the south wing, and connected with the perpendicular corridors of the range. The corridors were wide and had red oxide concrete floors, six-light double-hung sash windows, and panelled double-leaf classroom doors with fanlights.DPW Plans 18-20-12-3, 18-20-12-4 & 18-20-12-5, Elevations 18-20-12-6 and Sections 18-20-12-7, Nundah State School, Mar 1940. The second stage - the range - was authorised by Queensland's Executive Council on 7 March 1940 and work commenced soon afterwards.'Additions to Schools', The Courier-Mail, 8 Mar 1940, p. 2'¬£122,000 for 7 State Jobs', The Courier-Mail, 28 May 1940, p. 17. This stage was opened on 28 August 1941 by the Minister for Public Instruction, Harry Bruce.'Nundah School Addition', The Courier-Mail, 29 Aug 1941 p. 7. The original stone step of the 1865 school was built into the wall over the front steps of the building. Ground improvements were also undertaken in 1941, with the area in front of the new school wing excavated to a level that conformed with the general scheme.'School Improvements', The Courier-Mail, 1 Mar 1941, p. 3. Soon afterwards, World War II's impact escalated for Australia, with the entry of Japan into the conflict. Due to fears of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in January 1942, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools, including Nundah, often by parents and staff.Ronald Wood, Civil Defence in Queensland During World War II, 1993, p. 79'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 Mar 1942, p. 3'Decisions on Schools', The Courier-Mail, 23 Jan 1942, p. 3Nundah State School, German Station State School, n.p. Typically, schools were a focus for civilian duty during wartime. At many schools, students and staff members grew produce and flowers for donation to local hospitals and organised fundraising and the donation of useful items to Australian soldiers on active service.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 60-62. Nundah State School's grounds were used by Air Raid Precautions (ARP) wardens for drills and meetings from May 1942 until April 1944.'Voluntary War Work', The Telegraph: 31 May 1942, p. 2, 1 Aug 1942, 5 Oct 1942, 31 May 1943, 5 Jul 1943, 2 Oct 1943, 1 Apr 1944'Wardens in Bombs Tests', The Telegraph, 2 Jul 1942, p. 5; Ground improvements and the construction of the brick school building continued during the war years. By 1943 a curved front driveway and central garden bed had been formed. Drawings from 1941 and 1943 detailed the proposed undercroft boys lavatories connected to the southwest corner of the range, indicating that they were to be built in advance of the eastern end and upper stories of the southern wing. The area south of the toilet block was to be excavated and a new bank formed. Works were authorised to be carried out by day labour and the toilet block is evident in aerial photos by March 1946.DPW Plan 615-11-7, Nundah State School, Additions, Third Section, Male Lavatories, December 1941DPW Plan 615-11-7-2, Nundah State School Additions Third Section - Male Lavatories, 7 Sep 1943BCC, 1946 aerial accessed via PD Online. In the post-World War II period, enrolments at Nundah State School escalated. Considerable growth in the area, particularly of housing in the neighbouring suburb of Wavell Heights, increased the Nundah and district population to 11,234 in 1947 and the school population increased as well.Nundah State School, German Station State School'Queensland Places, Nundah', , accessed 17 Mar 2016. At the beginning of 1945 student numbers were about 800 but rose to over 1600 in 1954. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, pp.28-31. 3rd stage under construction, 1950 Construction of the third stage of the brick school building was completed in time for its opening on 31 March 1951 by the Minister for Public Instruction, George Devries. 3rd stage completed, 1951 In the years following World War II the overriding concern for the Department of Public Instruction was the need to build school buildings as expeditiously and economically as possible. Queensland schools were faced with enormous overcrowding and a lack of resources. However, the Queensland Government and community saw education as a low priority and provided the department with only a small budget.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.65. Also, educationalists rejected the previous designs of school buildings, considering them outdated and favoured \\"lighter, loosely grouped, flexible\\" buildings.Annual Report of the Department of Public Instruction, 1944, Appendix A. With increasing enrolments at Nundah State School in the 1950s, it was necessary to erect new buildings and extend existing ones. In 1954 suburban timber school building was connected to a new two-storey, gable-roofed timber building (Block F) by a verandah walkway. Alterations were also made to its teachers room, including the removal of the northern wall and relocation of the northern window to the western wall, to accommodate a new staff room extension with a medical services / store room underneath.DPW Plan 43-553, Nundah SS Additions, 10 Aug 1954. The suburban timber school building was extended in 1955 and again in 1956, sandwiching the existing 1915-16 building. The 1955 extension added a classroom to the eastern end. It had a bank of casements with fanlights on the southern wall and the northern verandah wall had a bank of double-hung sashes with fanlights, which were also added to each of the three existing classrooms. The existing verandah was extended, with steps relocated and enclosed balustrade bag racks added.DPW Plan 1077-07-04, Nundah SS (Infants) Addition, 7 Oct 1955. The 1956 extension comprised a highset timber classroom over a play area, at the western end of the building. The new classroom had doors opening onto the existing verandah and banks of awning windows on the northern and southern walls. The western wall had a single row of awning windows with a shade over. The weatherboard cladding extended to the north, south and western sides of the understorey, which was concreted and had hardwood seating to the perimeter.DPW Plan 1077-22, Nundah SS New Classroom 28' x 20', 2 May 1956. In 1955 a highset, gable-roofed, brick veneer building (Block B) was built on the edge of the concrete retaining wall to the northwest of brick school building. The construction of a high-set brick veneer building (Block C) to the east of the suburban timber school building in 1956, provided a link between it and the brick school building. The demolition of the adjacent 1912 infants classroom building required extension of the verandah balustrade of the suburban timber school building and regrading of ground to the north.DPW Plan 43-979-1, Nundah State School demolition of old classroom, 18 Dec 1964. Improvements to the school's sporting facilities were made post-World War II with the addition of a swimming pool in 1956.BCC JFP4-19, 1961Matthew Wengert, ed, Nundah State School 1865-2015, Catena Collective, Brisbane, 2015, p. 52. Changes to the Depression-era brick school building have occurred during its lifetime; however, the building remains substantially intact and retains a high degree of integrity. In 1962 a tuck shop was built at the southern end of the undercroft. In 1977 part of the first floor northern wing was remodelled for a Remedial Resources Room. Between 1998 and 2000, under the Building Better School initiative, alterations to the central range included demolition forming wide openings in the masonry walls to combine classrooms, replacement of double-leaf doors with singles, division of the northern teachers' room to form a health room and office, and conversion of the cloak rooms to offices and kitchenettes. The classroom at the western end of the second floor of the southern wing was also extended to occupy the corridor, with the corridor wall removed and a partition and doorway inserted.DPW Plans: Block A, First Floor, 20043-17546-A02, 6 Nov 1998Block A, Second Floor, 20043-17546-A03, 6 Nov 1998Block A - Proposed Refurbishment [As Built], First Floor, 20043-03-0043-01, 2 May 2000. Cloak rooms in the wings have been enclosed for use as staff or store rooms, and folding partitions between many of the classrooms have been removed to combine classrooms. Bulkheads remain demonstrating the original layout, and two sets of early folding partitions are retained in the southern wing. The suburban timber school building has been subject to alterations associated with the 1950s additions, but remains fairly intact internally and retains its early three-classroom layout, decorative pressed-metal lined and coved ceilings, square ceiling-rose vents and metal tie rods. The prominent ventilation roof fleche appears to have been removed by 1974 (likely associated with re-sheeting of the roof) but the verandah wall framing retains evidence of former floor-level ventilation flaps either side of the doors. Traces of a partition that divided the central classroom from are also evident in the ceiling.BCC, aerial JFP4-19, 1961DNRM, aerial QAP2757-140, 1974. Modern partitions have formed small offices in the eastern (1955) classroom. Since the major expansion during the 1950s, other buildings have been added to the site. A dental clinic was erected in 1975, and in the 21st century prep school buildings were constructed west of the suburban timber school building (2006‚Äì14), a resource centre (2009) was built to the north of the brick school building, and a school hall (2011) was erected on the double tennis courts' site adjacent to the swimming pool on the northern side of the school, which in 2016 houses the WWI honour board. Nundah State School celebrated its centenary during September and October 1965. Celebrations included a fancy dress ball at Cloudland Ballroom; the opening of a new Centenary Library; a church service in the school grounds, an open day at the school, a concert by Infants School children, an operetta by Grade 7 pupils, an open swim at the school pool, and a procession from Nundah to the school playing field for its Centenary Fete. In conjunction with these celebrations, a centenary publication was produced.Nundah State School, German Station State School 1865 - Nundah State School 1965, Nundah State School, Brisbane, 1965. Other commemorative features exist at the school. A silky oak tree (Grevillea robusta) commemorating 100 years of state education in Queensland (1875-1975) was planted in the northeast corner of school grounds.'100 Years of State Education/ Monument Australia', accessed 10 Mar 2016. Set within the rose garden on the Bage Street side of the brick school building is a memorial commemorating those who served their country during World War II, which was unveiled in November 1995. In 2016, the school continues to operate from its original site. It retains the Department of Public Works Depression-era brick school building and the suburban timber school building with extensions, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, playing areas, retaining walls and mature shade trees. Nundah State School is important to Nundah and its district, as a key social focus for the community, as generations of students have been taught there and many social events held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment.  Description  Site map, 2016 Nundah State School occupies an elevated site within Nundah, a residential suburb approximately northeast of the Brisbane CBD. Facing Bage Street to the east, the rectangular site slopes down to the west and is bounded to the south by Buckland Road, to the west by Park Road and to the north by Boyd Road. The school complex comprises buildings and landscape features from several periods of design and construction. Buildings and other elements of cultural heritage significance are located at the eastern end of the site and include: * a prominent Depression-era brick school building (Block A - 1935, 1941, 1946‚Äì51), addressing Bage Street * a suburban timber school building (Block D - 1915, with 1916, 1955 & 1956 extensions) along Buckland Road * a WWI Honour Board (1916) housed in the modern school hall * a parade ground to the west of Block A * various retaining walls (, 1940) * a curved entrance driveway and landscaped gardens to the east of Block A () * a playing field at the western end of the site; and a variety of mature shade trees  Depression-era brick school building (Block A)  Block A, 2007 Block A is a symmetrical, masonry structure of two storeys, above an undercroft level. The building comprises three sections: a range (1941) running north-south; and two lateral wings, the northern (1935) and southern (1946‚Äì51), projecting on an east-west axis. Three-storey projecting entrance bays are centred on the eastern (front) and western sides of the range; and flat-roofed first-floor bays at the junction of the range and the wings have diagonal stairs that access the parade ground at the rear. The building's intersecting hipped roofs are terracotta-tiled. The building is elegantly composed with a combination of Neo-classical and Arts and Crafts-style detailing. Constructed from load-bearing face brick walls, it has rendered decorative elements on the first and second floors, and rendered walls and piers with an ashlar finish to the undercroft level. The stretcher bond walls comprise bricks in a range of hues (from orange to dark brown), resulting in a textured appearance, and retain areas of tuck pointing. Along the north, east and south elevations, continuous window hoods with decorative timber brackets shelter the first and second-storey windows. Window openings (on all sides except the western end of the wings) are framed by rendered mullions, string courses and quoins, and contain banks of timber- framed, eight-light casement windows, with fanlights above. The front projecting bay frames the main entrance and is topped by a stepped, gabled brick parapet that has rendered capping and a centred rectangular vent. Divided stairs flank a first floor flat-roofed entrance porch. The clear- finished timber double entrance doors are panelled and glazed, with fanlights above. The stairs have concrete treads, and decorative rendered stringers and metal balustrades. A commemorative stone, set within the rendered eastern wall, reads \\"THIS STONE WAS THE STEP OF THE ORIGINAL NUNDAH STATE SCHOOL ERECTED 1865\\", with \\"NUNDAH STATE SCHOOL\\" in metal letters mounted on the brickwork above. The interior layout of the building is symmetrical, with the northern and southern wings mirrored, and the first floor layout approximately repeated on the second floor. Internal stairs are located at the eastern ends of the wings and in the central western bay of the range, flanked by offices (former cloak rooms). Corridors along the western side of the range connect with corridors on the adjacent sides of the northern and southern wings, and provide access to linearly arranged classrooms, offices and storerooms. The range has a central entrance hall, flanked by offices, and two classrooms and a medical room (formerly four classrooms) on the first floor; and three classrooms (formerly five) and a staff room on the second floor. The second floor of both wings and the first floor of the southern wing have two large classrooms each. One classroom on the first floor (southern wing) has been extended to occupy the corridor, with part of the corridor wall removed. The first floor of the northern wing contains a classroom and two large offices (formerly four classrooms); the western office retains a raised floor (former stage). Classrooms throughout the building retain bulkheads that indicate the original layout of dividing partitions. Most classrooms and offices have plaster walls, timber-framed floors covered in modern carpet, and flat-sheeted ceilings with painted timber battens. Stairs are of painted concrete and have metal and timber (range and northern wing) or rendered (southern wing) balustrades. Corridors have concrete floors with coved edges and flat plaster ceilings, with those on the second floor (range and southern wing) featuring painted timber battens. Early timber joinery is retained throughout the building, including: double-hung sash windows (to the corridors); and panelled timber doors. Most windows and doors retain their fanlights and early hardware. Two sets of original timber folding doors, with glazed inserts, are retained in classrooms on the first and second floors of the northern wing, which is rare. The store room (former cloak room) on the second floor of the northern wing retains its early brown stained ceiling battens and red oxide concrete floor. The undercroft level of the range is largely open play-space. Toilets are located at the western ends of the wings; a tuckshop encloses the eastern end of the northern wing; and a storage room encloses the eastern end of the southern wing. The undercroft has a concrete slab floor. Timber framing is exposed in parts of the range's ceiling, with the remainder mostly flat- sheeted. The piers and walls are stop-chamfered face brick.  Suburban Timber School Building (Block D)  Block D is a long, timber-framed building, orientated east-west, with a north-facing verandah. Constructed in phases, it comprises a central section (1915) of three classrooms, between an eastern classroom (1955) and a western classroom (1956), with two teachers rooms (1916 with 1954 extension) attached to the verandah. The building is highset at the western end and lowset to the east, due to the sloping of the site. The gabled roof is sheeted with modern corrugated metal and has five modern ridge vents. The teachers rooms have a hipped roof. The exterior is clad with timber weatherboards. The southern wall of the central section has three large banks of timber-framed casement windows, with pivot and angled fanlights. The 1916 teachers room has two-light double hung sash windows to the west (relocated 1954) and east (which has a battened skillion hood). The verandah has a raked ceiling lined with V-jointed (VJ), tongue-and-groove (T&G;) boards. Floors are timber and bag rack balustrades are clad externally with corrugated metal sheeting. Timber stairs with three-rail balustrades access the parade ground to the north. Verandah steps connect Block D with Block C to the east, and a verandah walkway connects to Block F to the north. The northern verandah walls are lined with a single skin of VJ T&G; boards and have double-hung sashes, with pivot fanlights. Above the flush-panelled double-leaf doors of the central classrooms are pivot fanlights, and the surrounding wall framing retains evidence where floor-level ventilation flaps may have been positioned. The interior of the three central classrooms is lined with VJ T&G; boards. Dividing partitions retain VJ boarded bulkheads, with flat-sheeting lining the openings formerly enclosed by folding partitions. All three classrooms retain highly decorative pressed-metal coved ceilings, with centred square ceiling-rose vents and metal tie-rods. The timber floors of all classrooms are covered with modern carpet and other floor linings. The understorey has a concrete floor and comprises mostly open play space. The building is set on a combination of concrete stumps and metal posts. The southern side is clad with corrugated metal, including a store room at the western end. The 1950s classrooms are detailed externally in keeping with the original building. However, the southern walls have large banks of awning windows, with fanlights, and the western wall has a single row of awnings. The western classroom extends the full width of the building. The understorey of the western classroom and the 1954 teachers room are enclosed, with vertical timber strips indicating the location of extension joins. The interior walls and ceilings are flat-sheeted. The eastern classroom contains small offices with modern partitions.  Landscape Elements  The school grounds are well established, with sporting facilities including a generous playing field () with embankments at the western end of the site. Many mature trees are located within the school grounds, including large fig (Ficus sp.), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), poinciana (Delonix regia) and leopard trees (Libidibia ferrea) surrounding the playing field. Various other mature shade trees across the site include a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), paper bark (Melaleuca quinquenervia), and a 1975 commemorative silky oak (Grevillea robusta) northeast of Block A. The eastern end of the sloping site is terraced by several Depression-era concrete retaining walls. These are located: * north and west of Block A, surrounding the parade ground; * around the northeast corner of the site, along Bage Street and Boyd Road. The main entrance from Bage Street comprises a curved driveway around landscaped rose gardens that are centred to the east of Block A. The parade ground (1936) west of Block A allows significant views to be obtained of the building's eastern elevation. An Honour Board (1916) is located in the modern school hall building, listing the names of former students who served in World War I (WWI). It comprises a decorative, embossed copper plaque with a timber backing board, and reads \\"ROLL OF HONOR 1914-1919, NUNDAH STATE SCHOOL\\" above rows of individual name plaques.  Heritage listing  Nundah State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Nundah State School (established in 1865 as German Station National School) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains fine, representative examples of standard government designs, which were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. The Depression-era brick school building (1935‚Äì51), retaining walls and improvements to the playing field are the result of the State Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The suburban timber school building (1915‚Äì16) represents the culmination of years of experimentation with light, classroom size and elevation, by the Department of Public Works. Later extensions (1955, 1956) represent the Department of Public Works' response to overcrowding in schools due to population growth after World War II. The World War I Honour Board is important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in a major world event. War memorials, including honour boards, are a tribute to those who served, and those who died, from a particular community. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. The large, suburban site with mature trees, sporting facilities, retaining walls and other landscaping features demonstrates the importance of play and aesthetics in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Nundah State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school. These include: teaching buildings constructed to standard designs; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The substantial Depression-era brick school building is an excellent, highly- intact example of its type and retains a high degree of integrity. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of Depression-era Brick Schools, including: its symmetrically arranged two-storey form, with an undercroft; high-quality design with ornamental features; face brick exterior; terracotta- tiled roof; and projecting central entrance bay. The building has a linear layout, with rooms accessed by corridors, and an undercroft accommodating open play space and toilets. The suburban timber school building demonstrates principal characteristics of its type. It retains its highset timber-framed structure with play space underneath, north-facing verandah, banks of casement windows, with fanlights, and projecting teachers room. The interior, with its symmetrical plan form, coved ceiling lined with pressed metal, partition bulkheads and early wall linings, is highly intact. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its elegant composition of formal and decorative elements, substantial size and face brick exterior, the Depression-era brick school building at Nundah State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, by which the Department of Public Works sought to convey the concepts of progress and permanence. The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Standing on an open, elevated site, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.

To the south of Taiwan, oceanic crust of the Eurasian Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate creating an island arc, the Luzon Arc. At Taiwan the oceanic crust has all been subducted and the arc is currently colliding with continental crust of the Eurasian Plate. To the north of Taiwan the Philippine Sea Plate is in contrast subducting northwards beneath the Eurasian Plate, forming the Ryukyu Arc. Within 200 km of this earthquake, there have been nine events of M‚â•7 during the preceding 40 years, including the M 7.7 1999 Jiji earthquake, which caused over 2,400 deaths. Earthquake The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.1 with a hypocentral depth of 32.8 km. The depth and focal mechanism are consistent with moderate angle reverse faulting on the plate boundary interface that dips northwards beneath the western end of the Ryukyu arc. Tsunami A small tsunami (20 cm) was observed on Yonaguni, in the Yaeyama Islands. Damage There was significant damage to buildings in the Taipei area, with three collapsing and the destruction of about 100 houses. A high-rise building in the city, which was under construction, partly collapsed, killing five workers and injuring a further 10 people. There was disruption to supplies of electricity, water and gas. The northeastern coastal areas were affected by many landslides. In total, there were 5 deaths and 213 people reported injured.

In 1935, elections were held for the Mayor of Auckland plus other local government positions including twenty-one city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background The campaign featured a selection controversy when the Labour Party selected local businessman Joe Sayegh over prominent lawyer and MP Rex Mason with the blessing of Auckland Labour Representation Committee executive Fred Young. Sayegh was viewed a respectable individual and competent city councillor, but most gave him little chance of beating Citizens Committee candidate Ernest Davis. As Young had been employed by Davis for many years, John A. Lee and several Labour MPs alleged that Young had been bribed by Davis to ensure the selection of a weak Labour candidate for the Mayoralty which caused a rift in the Auckland Labour Party. Sayegh's campaign was not helped due to continued interference by Lee who tried to discredit Sayegh, slandering him as a \\"dumb wop fellow who could not even speak English\\". Regardless, Sayegh polled extremely well in the election, exceeding predictions and lost to Davis by only 363 votes. Councillor Ted Phelan had earlier declined to seek the Labour nomination for mayor, citing a conflict of interest, as he was also running the Hotel Auckland (which was owned by Davis), who had already declared his candidacy. Despite Sayegh's nomination, the returning officer received a nomination for Mason, whose consent was telegraphed from Wellington, though he later sent a second telegraph to withdraw. Ellen Melville also announced her intention to stand for mayor, but ultimately decided not to stand \\"in view of the confusion of issues.\\" She successfully sought re-election to the council. The main talking point following the election was that the Labour Party had won a majority on the city council winning 15 of the 21 seats. This was the first (and only) time Labour had ever done so. There was also a huge turnout in voters with a record 60.36% of electors casting their votes, much higher than usual, an increase of nearly 12% from the 1933 election.

It is the 27th overall episode of the series and is written by Laura McCreary and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr.. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 2, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet a very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake and Holt are looking for a mole who is seemingly retrieving information from the offices. However, Jake becomes concerned as he retrieved some files and worries he will become a prime suspect in the case. Meanwhile, Terry and Rosa go undercover to a silent disco to investigate the new drug. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.41 million household viewers and gained a 1.7/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, especially Braugher's as well as the writing. For his performance in the episode, Braugher was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Plot The precinct is visited by Lt. Miller (Dan Bakkedahl), who is investigating a mole who has been passing information to criminal organizations. Jake (Andy Samberg) soon finds out that he left some files in his house and asks Amy (Melissa Fumero) for help in retrieving them. After being teased by Wuntch (Kyra Sedgwick), Holt (Andre Braugher) assigns Terry (Terry Crews) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) to lead an investigation into a silent disco which may have customers using \\"Giggle Pig\\". Terry becomes paranoid when he worries about the future of his daughters after finding out that a dealer in the disco attended the same school as his daughters. Jake and Amy stop by Gina's (Chelsea Peretti) house to retrieve files but they run into her and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) about to have sex. Jake takes the files to the precinct but is caught by Miller, who accuses him of being the mole and suspends him. After working with Holt all night to catch the mole, Jake finally realizes that Miller is just in the precinct to get information for Wuntch, as she can't access it. They confront her and blackmail her to leave the precinct alone. Gina later reveals her relationship with Boyle to the whole precinct. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"The Mole\\" was seen by an estimated 3.41 million household viewers and gained a 1.7/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 35% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.22 million viewers with a 2.5/7 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.7 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney and Bob's Burgers but behind The Simpsons, sixth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Madam Secretary, The Simpsons, Once Upon a Time, 60 Minutes, and NBC Sunday Night Football. Critical reviews \\"The Mole\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"'The Mole' is one of those episodes of television where, even though it hits all of its beats well and to satisfaction, there's every chance that extending the episode would somehow make it even stronger. Remember when NBC would 'Super Size' its sitcoms? Unlike those shows, Brooklyn Nine-Nine could actually benefit even more from that.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"The cops on Brooklyn Nine-Nine catch criminals, but the show spent this week tripping up its characters. The episode ran on basic sitcom rules and structures, but it ran on all cylinders, and it was a lot of fun.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"'The Mole' is dead-set on pushing several different plotlines forward, but it may have bitten off more than it can chew for one episode, as a lot of the jokes this go-round feel tired. (A guy so germophobic, he can‚Äôt touch anyone? A ‚Äúgood‚Äù kid secretly selling drugs? Wrecking someone's new car via a powdered doughnut? B99, you can do better.) Even the overall premise is based around a clich√©: The 'somebody's been lying and everyone's under suspicion' episode is a long-standing tradition in sitcom culture, one that's been yielding diminishing returns in recent years.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"I feel like season 2 still has yet to find a higher gear and give us an episode (or, better, run of episodes) as great as we saw the show could be last season, but each outing has been fun and smart, and 'The Mole' did a strong job with all three plots.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode an 8.4 and wrote, \\"There's a lot to laugh about here - Samberg's climactic 'whaaaaaaaa' and Terry's headphone check in the silent disco in particular, but Melissa Fumero's line-read of her texting history with Gina is probably the funniest non-Braugher moment 'The Mole' has to offer. Since Brooklyn Nine- Nines premiere, we've known that Braugher is its secret weapon; now we have proof that he's one of its essential building blocks. But more than that, 'The Mole' reminds us of just how good the show can be when it puts one of its supporting troupe members on center stage, and lets Samberg sit in the passenger seat.

The Commission was responsible for ‚Ä≥forest policy, prevention and suppression of bushfires, issuing leases and licences, planting and thinning of forests, the development of plantations, reforestation, nurseries, forestry education, the development of commercial timber harvesting and marketing of produce, building and maintaining forest roads, provision of recreation facilities, protection of water, soils and wildlife, forest research and making recommendations on the acquisition or alienation of land for forest purposes‚Ä≥. The Forests Commission had a long and proud history of innovation and of managing Victoria's State forests but in November 1983 lost its discrete identity when it was merged into the newly formed Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (CFL) along with the Crown Lands and Survey Department, National Park Service, Soil Conservation Authority and Fisheries and Wildlife Service. After the amalgamation the management of State forests and the forestry profession continued but the tempo of change accelerated, with many more departmental restructures occurring over the subsequent three decades. Responsibilities are currently split between the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), Parks Victoria, Melbourne Water, Alpine Resorts Commission, the State Government-owned commercial entity VicForests and the privately owned Hancock Victorian Plantations (HVP).  Late 1800s - Chaos in the forest  Before European settlement in the early 1800s, around 88% of the 23.7 million hectare colony of what was to become the State of Victoria in 1851 was tree covered.Victoria State of the Forests Report (2013). Dept of Env and Primary Industries. However, the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s combined with widespread and indiscriminate land clearing for mining, agriculture and settlement became one of the major causes of forest loss and degradation.Forest Cover Changes in Victoria 1869-1987. Peter Woodgate and Peter Black. (1988) Conservation Forests and Lands. Remote sensing group, Lands and Forests Division. This caused alarm amongst early foresters and the wider community. alt= Forest management in the late 1800s was chaotic. As early as 1865, the Argus Newspaper took up the cause of ‚Äòprotecting our forests‚Äô arguing the substantial benefits of timber production, avoiding the wasting of soil, conserving natural streams, avoiding adverse climate impacts and beneficially distributing storm runoff. Later on 16 September 1869, the first \\"Overseer of Forests and Crown Land Bailiff\\", William Ferguson was appointed. The second progress report of a Royal Commission on Foreign Industries and Forests in 1872, included a recommendation for the establishment of a State nursery near Macedon railway station \\"with the object of raising useful timber trees for distribution to selectors, and for the planting of reserves denuded of indigenous timber\\". Ferguson then established the first State Nursery at Macedon in 1872. By 1871 the Australian Natives Association (ANA) was formed and joined the campaign and were active on forest conservation for a prolonged period. The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (FNCV) became involved in 1881. It is surprising and perhaps ironic that organised mining interests, including influential mining parliamentarians, were the early public advocates for forest protection, taking up the cause in the 1860s. Their advocacy was based more on the profitability of their mining interests than forest conservation. The miners selfishly wanted well-regulated state forest reserves to ensure a plentiful future supply of mining timbers at reasonable prices. In 1871, local Forest Boards attempted to exercise some control, however the task of regulating wasteful clearing proved formidable and they were abolished in 1876. By 1873 it was estimated that were some 1150 steam engines in the gold mining industry, devouring over one million tons of firewood. In October 1882, the pioneering forester John la Gerche was appointed as one of sixteen Crown Lands Bailiffs and Foresters within the Agriculture Branch of the Department of Lands. Their appointment held out a promise to end the forest destruction under the 1884 Land Act which recognised the significance of forests for public purposes but the budget allocation was a paltry ¬£4000. La Gerche established a nursery at Sawpit Gully in 1887 near what is now the Victorian School of Forestry at Creswick. He went onto become one of the founding Inspectors in the new State Forest Department in 1907.  Inquiries, indecision and inertia  At the urging of the Governor of Victoria, Lord Henry Brougham Loch, who had served in Bengal cavalry and maintained an interest in forests, and had seen there the results of forest management under the great European foresters Brandis, Schlich and Ribbentrop, the Government invited Conservator Frederick D'A. Vincent from the Imperial Forest Service in India to visit in 1887 and make recommendations. But to seek advice was one thing; to take it was another, and while Vincent's scathing report was available to subsequent inquiries and was eventually tabled in the House in 1895, it was \\"so frank and outspoken that it has never been published\\". > I am very unfavourably impressed with the state of the forests .... I am > surprised that some effectual measures have not been taken to prevent > further waste .... present arrangements are quite puerile and so ill- > conceived that they can scarcely be discussed :‚Äî Conservator, Frederick D'A > Vincent, Imperial Forest Service, 1887. Later on 14 June 1888, the first Conservator of Forests, George Samuel Perrin was appointed. He had previous experience in South Australia and Tasmania and despite having little power or authority, was able to appoint a number of foresters over the next 12 years. He produced a report containing a number illustrations to Parliament on 30 June 1890. This visionary report clearly identified the issues and set out reforms to ensure Victoria would have a healthy, diverse and extensive forest estate 130 years later. Perrin was also acquainted with the Government botanist Ferdinand Von Mueller who named, Eucalyptus perriniana after him. Meanwhile, the gold rush was petering out and Melbourne's land boom of the 1880s was inevitably followed by a financial crash in 1891, which combined with the Federation Drought from 1895 to 1902, depressed economic conditions for a decade or more. Not surprisingly, the Colonial Government had little appetite for changing the status-quo and introducing restrictive forest legislation. Matters had come to a head previously on Black Wednesday (9 January 1878) when the State Government sacked over 300 senior public servants and judges suddenly overnight without warning. The sackings were in part directed at the desire of the Premier, Graham Berry, to penalise those in the public service who backed the intransigence of the Legislative Council which was dominated by pastoral and grazing interests and which had resisted land reform. Berry's election manifesto proposed a punitive land tax designed to break up the squatter class's great pastoral properties ‚Äì about 800 men at this time owned most of Victoria's grazing lands. But separately, in a bold and visionary political move, the management of 157,000 hectares of Melbourne's forested water catchments of the Upper Yarra were vested in the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) in 1891 but with a controversial closed catchment policy where timber harvesting and public access was not permitted. Perhaps exemplifying the influence of Indian forestry throughout the British Empire, in 1895 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, Sir Robert Wallace Best, invited Inspector-General Berthold Ribbentrop, from the Imperial Forest Service. His report prompted yet another Royal Commission which commenced in 1897 and produced 14 separate reports before closing in 1901. > \\"State forest conservancy and management are in an extraordinary backward > state\\" .... Inspector-General Berthold Ribbentrop, Imperial Forest Service - > 1896. Departmental restructuring and uncertainty is not new. Between 1856 and 1907 the responsibility for administration of Victoria's forest estate shunted back and forth at least eleven times between three Government Departments including Lands and Survey, Agriculture and Mines.  1900s - Royal Commission findings  E. J. Semmens - Principal of the Victorian School of Forestry, 1928‚Äì51. Source: \\"Fraternity of Foresters\\".alt= In 1900 State forests were still commonly regarded by the general public, and by most of their parliamentary representatives, as the inexhaustible \\"wastelands of the Crown\\" and ready for disposal via alienation into freehold property for the purposes of agricultural settlement. For nearly 50 years there had been Government inquiries, three independent reports from D'A. Vincent (1887), Perrin (1890), Ribbentrop (1895), the Royal Commission (1897-1901) together with impassioned speeches and separate pieces of legislation calling for the conservation of the states forests which had all been brought unsuccessfully before the Victorian Parliament. It was not until the former British colonies combined in 1901 to become the states of a Federal Australia that a Victorian Forest Bill was finally passed.  State Forests Department - 1907  Despite spirited opposition by agricultural and grazing interests the Forest Act (1907) No. 2095 finally constituted the State Forest Department (SFD) which came into effect on 1 January 1908, formally setting aside timber reserves and providing for rehabilitation after mining and logging. The first Conservator of Forests was Hugh Robert Mackay who had been both a Senior Inspector and Secretary to the Royal Commission of 1897-1901 while the first Minister was Donald McLeod and the first Secretary was William Dickson, who was also Secretary for Mines. The creation of the State Forest Department represented the most significant institutional development in Victoria's history of forest management to that point. The fledgling Department had 66 staff on 31 December 1900 including, 1 Conservator, 1 Chief Inspector, 1 Inspector, 23 Foresters and 40 Forest Foremen but foreshadowed that it expected to increase over the years to come. Nonetheless, the challenges facing the new organisation were formidable, including protecting ecosystems about which little was scientifically understood, and responsibility for vast areas of rugged, remote country about which little was known. The next ten years saw a steady expansion in staff numbers, promulgation of controlling regulations, increased production from the forest, thinning and fire protection works such as fire break construction, together with rehabilitation of the native forest which had suffered from indiscriminate cutting.FCV Annual Reports However, frustrated at the lack of progress in forestry and broader forest conservation, several foresters and scientists formed the Australian Forest League (AFL) in 1912 which stayed active for the next 34 years. The inaugural President was notable botanist, Professor Alfred James Ewart from Melbourne University, who oversaw the curriculum at the Victorian School of Forestry. They received valued support from Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson during the war years over political interference in forest management, securing adequate funding, reducing waste, expanding softwood plantations and addressing growing international concern at impending timber shortages.  Forestry training - 1910  The new Forest Act (1907) also recognised that effective management of forests required appropriately skilled staff, stipulating that no person could be appointed to a forestry position without completing a relevant course and passing a special examination, thus paving the way for the establishment of a forestry school. The Victorian School of Forestry (VSF) at Creswick was established in 1910 and was located at the old hospital which had been built in 1863 during the gold rush. The creation of VSF was one of the many recommendations of the 1901 Royal Commission and the school became the first of its kind in Australia.  Forests Commission Victoria - 1918  In December 1918, a comprehensive amendment to the Forests Act created the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) with three Commissioners to lead a new independent organisation. The new Commission first met on 1 October 1919 and the Chairman was a young Welsh Forester, Owen Jones while the first Minister was William Hutchinson. The key principals of the 1918 Act are thought to have been derived from the earlier 1907 legislation and include: # conservation, development and utilisation of the indigenous forests, based on sound forestry principals; # establishment of adequate exotic softwoods plantations; # prosecution of essential research work concerning the natural products of the forests; and # the need for an effective fire prevention and fire suppression organisation. Significantly, the new legislation provided for the establishment of a Forestry Fund so the Commission could raise its own revenue from timber sales and enter into loans and therefore give it some capacity to implement its own policies and programs. Revenue from timber royalties and other sources grew five-fold within the first five years. The Commission was also authorised to recruit, employ and manage its own staff.  Areas permanently reserved as State Forest  Prior to the 1918 legislation, forest areas were reserved by the Minister of Lands and Agriculture who was also responsible for alienating Crown Land for farming and towns. There were obvious conflicts in administering these competing responsibilities. As a result, permanent forest reservation was slow and limited for the period of Victoria's first seven decades. Reservations had been made in 1862, 1873, 1898 and 1903 and the Conservator of Forests, George Perrin, reported the total forested area in 1888 was 4.8 million ha most of which was inaccessible. Only a small proportion was permanently reserved, and some was in Melbourne water supply catchments closed to harvesting and visitors.  1920s - Formative years  climax steam engine Number 1694 in 1928.

Servicemen returning from the First World War renewed pressure on forest clearing with the expansion of various soldier settlement schemes. Between 1903 and 1928 the Crown estate was significantly reduced down to about one third of the State or 8.6 million hectares.  Forest types  Victoria is blessed with a wide diversity of native forest, dominated by eucalyptus (often known as gum trees). These forests contain many diverse habitats and include those found in the cool, mountainous, high rainfall areas in the east of the state, and in the Otways and Strzelecki Ranges near the coast. These wet forests are dominated by stands of alpine ash, messmate, shining gum and mountain ash (the tallest hardwood tree in the world). They remain the major source of high-quality seasoning timber for furniture, flooring, joinery and pulpwood. The dryer foothill forests contain mixtures of messmate and other commercial species, whereas the Murray River has extensive stands of durable red gum along its banks. Large tracts of mallee desert and box-ironbark woodlands are found in the drier northwest.  Tall trees  Tree height is influenced by species, genetics, age, stand density, soil type and depth, rainfall, aspect, altitude, protection from wind and snow damage, fire history and insect attack. Scientists believe that trees have a theoretical maximum height of , even though there are many historical accounts of taller trees. The main physiological factor limiting tree height is its ability to suck a continuous column of water up against the forces of gravity. The crowns of the tallest trees need to lift sap more than 10 times the surrounding atmospheric pressure by combining the complex physics of capillary action and leaf transpiration of the water pathway known as the Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum. Contrary to popular belief, tree roots do not pump water. There had long been recognition of the conservation and aesthetic values of Victoria's large forest trees. As early as 1866 Baron Ferdinand Von Mueller, the Government botanist published some astonishing, and probably exaggerated claims of a mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans - monarch of the eucalypts) on the Black's Spur near Healesville being 480 feet high. There were reports from nurseryman David Boyle and others of trees in the Yarra Valley, Otways and Dandenong Ranges reaching \\"half a thousand feet\\". Doyle was later savagely criticised by Melbourne newspapers in 1889 about a tree he had named \\"The Baron\\" in homage to his friend von Mueller. The tree was growing at Sassafras Gully in the Dandenong Ranges and Doyle had initially measured it in 1879 at 522 feet tall. It was later remeasured for the Melbourne exhibition in 1888 where it had reduced in size to 466 feet. However, when properly measured by Commissioner Perrin and surveyor Mr Fuller from the Water Supply Dept in 1889, it was found to be only 219 feet 9 inches. Its girth had also shrunk from 114 feet to 48 feet. Poor measurement techniques in thick scrub may partly explain the anomalies. In 1982, Ken Simpendorfer, a senior officer with the Forests Commission undertook a search of official Victorian archives. He unearthed a forgotten report from more than a century ago and a claim by William Ferguson, the State Government's first \\"Overseer of Forests and Crown Land Bailiff\\" who was appointed in 1869. In a letter written in the Melbourne Age newspaper from Ferguson to the Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands, Clement Hodgkinson, dated 22 February 1872 he reported trees in great number and exceptional size in the Watts River catchment but his account is often disputed as unreliable.Simpendorfer, K J (1982).

In 1976, a monument was unveiled by the Hon Jim Balfour to the \\"World's Tallest Tree\\" near Thorpdale which in 1884 was measured by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite at 375 feet after it had been chopped down. This account was reported in the Victorian Field Naturalist many years later in July 1918 and is often considered the most reliable record of Victoria's tallest tree. The public remained fascinated by large trees and to celebrate the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888 offered a reward for the tallest tree. Parliamentarian and exhibition organiser, James Munro personally offered an additional ¬£100 for anyone who could locate a tree taller than 400 feet. No such tree was ever found. The tallest tree reliably measured for the exhibition was the \\"New Turkey Tree\\" reported to be near Mt Baw Baw (but probably closer to Noojee on the New Turkey Spur which is not far from the Ada Tree) at 326 feet 1 inch with a girth of 25 feet and 7 inches. Around the turn of the century, Nicholas John Caire named and photographed many on Victoria's remaining giant trees including King Edward VII at Marysville. Some of his photos were displayed in Victorian Railways carriages and made into postcards. However, by this time most of largest and straightest trees had already been removed by timber splitters. A more authoritative list \\"Giant Trees of Victoria\\" was later compiled by Mr A. D. Hardy from the State Forest Department in 1911 identifying numerous trees over 300 feet at Fernshaw and Narbethong with similar heights recorded in the Otways and Baw Baw Ranges.The \\"Sample Acre\\" sign at the Cumberland Reserve near Marysville. The tallest tree was at 301.5 feet. Representative samples of forest were set aside as reference areas in other parts of the State during the 1930s.In 1929, the Forests Commission set aside a \\"sample acre\\" within the Cumberland Scenic Reserve near Marysville. The site only narrowly escaped the 1939 Black Friday bushfires but unfortunately 13 of its big trees were destroyed during a storm later in 1959. The tallest tree on the plot was reduced from 301.5 feet to about 276 feet after a large part of its crown was damaged. Another major storm on 21 December 1973 reduced it further to 267 feet. The Chairman of the Forests Commission, Alfred Vernon Galbraith studied mountain ash for his Diploma of Forestry (Vic) and wrote in 1937 that \\"they can make serious claims to be the world's highest tree\\". His successor, Finton Gerraty personally measured a fallen tree near Noojee after the 1939 bushfires at 338 feet and with \\"its top tantalisingly broken off\\". alt= The Mueller Tree grew on Mount Monda north of Healesville, measured 307 feet, and was made famous after a visit in 1895 by a party including Baron Von Muller, Mr A. D. Hardy, from the State Forests and Nurseries Branch, members of the Geographical Society accompanied by renowned photographer John William Lindt who also was the owner of \\"The Hermitage\\" guesthouse on the Black's Spur. The tree was then \\"rediscovered\\" and renamed by Mr Harold Furmston, an employee of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works in the 1930s. It was remeasured once again by Mr A. D. Hardy in 1933 who proclaimed it to be still in good health, 62 feet in circumference at a height of five feet above the ground and at 10 feet up its circumference was still 50 feet. He estimated its height to be 287 feet (20 feet shorter than his earlier 1895 measurements). There was some debate from the Healesville Tourism Association during this period about its name but either way the Mueller - Furmston Tree was a popular destination inside the Melbourne Water closed catchments until it collapsed in about 2000. Recent measurements between 2000 and 2002 of over 200 of Victoria's trees found the tallest specimen of mountain ash was inside Melbourne Water's Wallaby Creek Catchment at Kinglake being over 300 years old and 301 feet (91.6 m) high. The height was accurately determined using a ground-based laser rangefinder and then verified by a tree climber with a tapeline, however it later perished along with 15 other tall trees during the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. Modern Lidar imagery of the forests is being used to find remaining stands of tall trees. The tallest regrowth mountain ash in Victoria is currently named Artemis which can be found near Beenak at 302 feet (92.1 m) while the Ada Tree at 236 feet (72 m) is thought to be between 350 and 450 years old, but with a senescent crown and is a popular tourist destination in State forest east of Powelltown. Australia's the tallest measured living specimen of mountain ash, named Centurion, stands 100.5 metres (330 feet) tall in Tasmania. Whether a mountain ash over 400 feet high ever existed in Victoria is now almost impossible to substantiate but the early accounts from the 1860s are still quoted in contemporary texts such as the Guinness Book of Records and Carder,Dr. Al C. Carder, FOREST GIANTS OF THE WORLD (Markham, Ontario: FitzHenry and Whiteside, 1995) pp. 76-77 as well as being widely restated on the internet. Currently the world's tallest living tree is a Sequoia sempervirens, named the Hyperion, discovered in California in 2006. It is believed to be between 700 and 800 years old and was measured at 380.3 feet.  Early silviculture  Silviculture is defined as the art and science of controlling the establishment, health, growth, quality, protection and use of forests. It can involve a range of treatments such as planting, seeding, thinning, together with a wide range of harvesting techniques such as clear- felling through to single tree selection. Much of the early silvicultural knowledge was unsuccessfully translated from Europe so in response to some difficulties achieving satisfactory regrowth after harvesting the Commission pioneered much of the early scientific research into the biology of the eucalypts and developed many innovative operational techniques for high intensity slash burning, aerial seeding, planting, thinning and tending. This commitment to silvicultural research continued throughout the life of the Commission.  Steam era  Winches powered \\"high lead' cable systems to snig logs from the forest onto the timber tramways for transport to the sawmill - circa 1940. Source: Jack Gillespie. FCRPA* collection.In an era before all-weather roads and powerful logging trucks, sawmills were steam- powered and often located deep in the forest with logs being snigged short distances by horses or bullocks. As the industry expanded and became more mechanised, tramways with wooden or steel rails spread throughout the bush. These tramways were also used to transport sawn material to local towns and then onwards on the State railway network to markets in Melbourne and beyond. The size of the logs combined with steep terrain and often wet conditions in the mountains limited the use of animals and steam powered winches driving elaborate \\"high lead\\" cable systems later replaced them. The Commission also operated a Washington steam winch, its own sawmill at Erica with timber tramlines and steam engines such as the climax locomotive. The Commission built and operated the Tyres Valley Tramway. Productivity increased enormously with the advent of powered chainsaws after WW2 which replaced axes to fell and crosscut large trees. Around the same time, diesel and electric motors replaced steam, while mobile cranes and crawler tractors replaced dangerous man handling of logs and timber but sawmills and logging still remained a dangerous workplace.  Bushfires - 1926  Bushfire had been a major focus for the newly formed Forests Commission. Throughout February 1926 uncontrolled bushfires burned across Gippsland and the Central Highlands and destroyed large areas of valuable mountain forest. Sixty lives were lost in addition to widespread damage to farms and homes. The fires came to a head on 14 February, with 31 deaths recorded at Warburton. Other areas affected include Noojee, Kinglake, Erica and the Dandenong Ranges. The Minister for Forests, Mr Horace Frank Richardson and a couple of the Commissioners, William James Code and Alfred Vernon Galbraith were on tour in Gippsland and were almost dangerously caught in the fires on 4 February near the Haunted Hills west of Moe. The Commission later produced a film to raise money for fire victims. During the same decade the earliest recorded use of fire by a Government land manager to reduce fuel levels on public land occurred in Victoria.  Victorian timbers  Victorian Timber Display - Great Britain exhibition. circa 1890. Source: State Library of Victoria. Early foresters, sawmillers and timber merchants recognised the unique qualities of Victorian hardwood timbers and the Government was keen to promote them to the world market. Research into native timbers began sometime after Federation in 1901 and progressed with the publication of Richard Thomas Bakers's important work \\"Hardwoods of Australia and their Economics\\" in 1919. Two of the Principals from the Victorian School of Forestry, first Charles Edward Carter in the 1920s, followed by Alan Eddy in the 1950s did foundation research into the properties of timber. Herbert Eric Dadswell worked with both Carter and Eddy at the Forest Products Division of the CSIRO at Highett in Melbourne from 1929 until 1964. He tested thousands of timber samples and his authoritative descriptions of Australian hardwoods included engineering properties such as strength, hardness, appearance, suitably for joinery, resistance to termites, durability and so on. The huge Dadswell wood collection now resides with the CSIRO and contains over 45,000 samples representing 10,000 species while a subset are kept in the Forestry School museum at Creswick. Some eucalypts, particularly mountain ash, were very prone to suffer from collapse in the seasoning (drying) process and work focused on steam reconditioning. This problem created some initial reluctance from Victorian sawmillers to invest in timber seasoning so an experimental workshop and kilns were established by the Commission at the Newport Seasoning Works from 1911 until it closed in 1956 under controversial circumstances. By far the greatest proportion of dressed timber for internal work, joinery and furniture was imported in the 1920s mainly from America and Scandinavia. The Commission sought to improve the position of native hardwoods in the market and put the Victorian industry on a sound footing. The pioneering work at Newport together with the CSIRO bore fruit and by 1931 it was estimated that 80% of flooring laid down in Melbourne was kiln-dried Mountain Ash milled from the State's forests. Some of the finished timber from Newport was shipped to London to feature as flooring in Australia's High Commission building. But despite these efforts, as late as the 1960s there was still some resistance from architects, builders, joiners and home owners to Australian hardwoods so the Commission constructed a timber display pavilion at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds in 1966. This initiative led to the establishment of the Timber Promotions Council (TPC) in 1969 in partnership with Victorian Sawmillers Association and timber merchants. The TPC undertook research and development, marketing and training into the use of Victorian timber. It also offered an advisory service to builders, architects and the public. A levy was generated from sawlog sales to fund the TPC until it was revoked in 2005. The Victorian Association of Forest Industries (VAFI) in now the peak industry body.  Timber licensing  During the late 1800s the absence of clear forest policies and regulations generally encouraged a sawmillers free-for-all. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture in a report to Parliament described the licence system as ‚Äúno more effectual method of legalising the destruction of timber could have been devised‚Äù. However, new controls resulted in sawmills and sleeper cutters being allocated sole rights to an area of forest to exploit but by the early 1920s this system was gradually replaced by one where royalty was paid based on the quantity of sawn timber produced. A more modern licensing arrangement was formally introduced in 1950.  Towards a national forest policy  1920 saw Australia's first Premiers Conference that was to consider \\"forest\\" matters. The meeting concluded that 9.8 million hectares nationally should be permanently reserved as forest to secure timber supplies. The Victorian component was to be 2.2 million hectares. Later in 1928/29 the first British Empire Forestry Conference was held in Australia. The conference, among other things, helped focus attention on the need for the establishment of more secure forest reserves. Meanwhile, the Forests Commission, sawmillers and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works all lobbied for more land. The 47000 ha Upper Yarra catchment was added to the existing Board managed watersheds in 1928. By the start of the 20th century, most of the giant trees reported by Von Mueller and others were being lost to bushfires, timber splitters or clearing and efforts were mounting by local communities and conservation groups such as the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria and the ANA to set aside forests near Marysville and protect them against logging. Prominent individuals such as painter Arthur Streeton noted the \\"endless beauty of the green and living forest\\" while Professor Ernst Johannes Hartung of Melbourne University proclaimed the Valley ought to be preserved as a rare botanical and zoological sanctuary. The Minister for Forests, Horace Frank Richardson responded by creating a one square mile reservation (640 acres) in January 1929 to be known as the Cumberland Memorial Scenic Reserve, dedicated to returned soldiers. It included both the Cora Lynn and Cumberland Falls as well as a \\"sample acre\\" of tall trees set aside by the Commission. A sawmill was then established on the eastern edge of the new scenic reserve which operated until 1970. But the new reserve did not placate the critics and the dispute dragged on for more than 20 years and was never satisfactorily resolved. The reserve survived the 1939 bushfires. Furthermore, the Minister for Lands, David Swan Oman, stated in 1921 that he would no longer consult with the Forests Commission over land settlement. The test came in 1923 in the densely forested Otway Ranges over a proposal to clear 27,000 acres for farming near the Heytesbury Soldier settlement scheme. In June 1925, after pressure from sawmillers, conservation groups and Melbourne newspapers the Government finally rejected the idea. It is claimed this dispute contributed to the early resignation of the Forests Commission's first Chairman, Owen Jones, who had been a strong and vocal opponent. Also during the 1920s experiments with eucalyptus pulp and timber treatment occurred, concerns about imports of timber (from interstate and overseas) continued to be expressed.  1930s - Great Depression  The trajectory of the Forests Commission from its inception in 1918 until the beginning of WW2 was one of periodic political conflict, varying budgets but almost continuous organisational expansion and relative autonomy. The Commission established a network of fire lookouts (hill tops) and fire towers (built structures) from the 1930s and accelerated after Black Friday. Source: Annual Report 1945. Although revenue from timber sales declined during the Great Depression the Government channelled substantial funds to the Commission for unemployment relief works which were well suited to unskilled manual labour such as firebreak slashing, silvicultural thinning, weed spraying and rabbit control. By 1935-36 the Commission employed almost 9,000 men in relief works and a further 1,200 boys under a \\"Youth for Conservation Plan\\". One success story was at \\"Boys Camp\\" near Noojee which was made possible with the support of two prominent Melbourne businessmen and philanthropists, Herbert Robinson Brooks and George Richard Nicholas together with the Chairman of the Forests Commission Alfred Vernon Galbraith. A large amount of effort was directed towards building supporting infrastructure, often in remote areas such as works depots and offices, houses for staff, roads, water supply dams and fire spotting towers. One example was Bill Ah Chow who was a legendary bushman of East Gippsland and became fire lookout at Mt Nugong in the late 1930s. By the eve of the Second World War, Victorian community attitudes had turned away from the century-long campaign to unlock ‚Äòthe waste lands of the Crown‚Äô for private settlement.  Black Friday bushfires - 1939  Considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life, the Black Friday bushfires on 13 January 1939 fires were one of the worst disasters to have occurred in Australia and certainly the worst bushfire up to that time. In terms of the total area burnt, the 1939 Black Friday fires remain the states second largest, burning 2 million hectares, 69 sawmills were destroyed, 71 people died, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Among those killed were four men from the Commission.right > It is with very deep regret that the Commission records the tragic deaths of > four officers and employees of the Department in the bush fires of January > last.

Putting aside large conflagrations of cities like the Great Fire of Meireki or the Great Fire of London, perhaps the world's worst bushfire was at Peshtigo in Wisconsin in 1871, which burnt nearly 1.2 million acres, destroyed twelve communities and killed between 1500-2500 people. Now largely forgotten, Peshtigo was overshadowed by the Great Fire of Chicago that occurred on the same day.  Stretton Royal Commission  The subsequent Royal Commission conducted by Judge Leonard Stretton has been described as one of the most significant inquiries in the history of Victorian public administration. Its recommendations led to sweeping changes including stringent regulation of burning and fire safety measures for sawmills, grazing licensees and the general public, the compulsory construction of dugouts at forest sawmills, increasing the forest roads network and firebreaks, construction of forest dams, fire towers and aerial patrols linked by the Commissions radio network to ground observers. The Commission developed a strong relationship with the RAAF from the 1930s through to the early 1960s.

Source: Athol Hodgson. FCRPA* collection. Prior to 13 January 1939, many fires were already burning. Some of the fires started as early as December 1938, but most of them started in the first week of January 1939. Some of these fires could not be extinguished. Others were left unattended, or as Judge Stretton wrote, the fires were allowed to burn \\"under control\\", as it was falsely and dangerously called. Most of the fires Stretton declared, with almost biblical gravity, were lit by the hand of man. There was a huge wave of criticism in the press of the Government, the Forest Commissions and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for an overly zealous fire- suppression policy. The Commission, in turn, blamed landholders for recklessly setting fires at dangerous times.glass magic lantern slide collection. Circa 1940. As a consequence of Judge Stretton's scathing report, the Forests Commission gained additional funding and took responsibility for fire protection on all public land including State forests, unoccupied Crown Lands and National Parks plus a buffer extending one mile beyond their boundaries on to private land and its responsibilities grew in one leap from 2.4 million to 6.5 million hectares. Stretton also examined the inevitability of fire in the Australian bush and heard evidence from foresters, graziers, sawmillers and academics whether it was best to let fires burn because they were a part of a natural protective cycle or to combat them to defend people and the forests. Importantly, his balanced deliberations officially sanctioned and encouraged fuel reduction burning to minimise future risks. The newly appointed Fire Protection Officer, Alfred Oscar Lawrence immediately set about the huge challenge of rebuilding a highly organised and motivated fire fighting force, lifting staff morale, introducing more RAAF fire spotting patrols, new fire towers and lookouts, modern vehicles, fire tankers and equipment such as powered pumps and crawler tractors, as well as a statewide radio communications network, VL3AA. The Commission's communication systems were regarded at the time to be more technically advanced than the police and the military. These pioneering efforts were directed by Geoff Weste. Further major fires later in the 1943-44 Victorian bushfires season and another Royal Commission chaired by Judge Stretton was a key factor in the founding of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) for fire suppression on rural land. Prior to the creation of the CFA the Forests Commission had, to some extent, been supporting individual volunteer brigades which had formed across rural Victoria in the preceding decades. Alf Lawrence was appointed a member of the new Board of the CFA. Significantly, the tragic losses and Stretton's inquiries shaped and cemented Victoria's deep-seated approaches towards bushfire. Both the Forests Commission and CFA adopted clear policies to detect and suppress all bushfires and became very focused and skilled at doing it.  Inventory and Assessment  It was recognised by Sir William Schlich in his summary of British Empire forest policy in 1922 that Australia lacked many of the skills to undertake inventory needed to prepare proper working plans. So in 1927‚Äì28, the Commission made concerted effort to recruit trained foresters from Norway. They included Bernhard Johannessen, Kristian Drangsholt and Bjarne Dahl who formed the nucleus of a forest assessment branch. In an era before there were many roads, these foresters travelled on horses into the remote forests of Victoria. Base lines were surveyed and the forest divided into one-chain (20 metre) strips. It was arduous work with an axeman clearing a straight path through the bush, a chainman following to measure distances while an assessor counted and assessed the trees. An aneroid barometer was carried to mark out 50 feet contour levels. Later, by joining-the-dots, they produced the first hand-drawn and coloured topographical maps of the forest which were rare before the War. Often working in trackless bush accidents were common and help was far away. Drangsholt almost drowned as he tried to cross the flooded Thomson River to reach the sanctuary of Aberfeldy. During Bjarne Dahl's long career he probably saw more of Victoria than most foresters ever did. He died in 1993 and left his entire estate, a sizable sum, to the Forests Commission which is now managed in a trust to focus on the eucalypts. He wrote:Hand drawn forest assessment map of Mt Blowhard by Bjarne Dahl. Circa 1940.

Bjarne Dahl. Owen Jones, the young Welsh Chairman of the newly formed Forests Commission had enlisted as one of Britain's original \\"Warbirds\\" in the Royal Flying Corps during WW1 and had long championed the idea of forest surveying, mapping and assessment from aerial photographs so in 1928 the Commission undertook its first major aerial photography project over 15,000 acres of forest. During the second world war, large areas of Victoria were photographed by RAAF aircrews and later used by various state government authorities to produce orthophoto maps. By 1945 aerial photography of 13,000 square miles (3.4 M ha) of forest was completed, including much of the inaccessible forest in the eastern ranges.leftAfter the War, stip assessments continued but were focused in the eastern ranges, with forest mapping and classification carried out using interpretation of aerial photography undertaken by the RAAF. Assessments were in remote locations with access by 4WD tracks, but also still by pack horse, with staff based in canvas tents in the mountain forests often in grassy clearings in high elevation snow gum woodland. From the mid-1950s, there was a transition from strip assessments to using fixed sample plots combined with new computer programming techniques to calculate volumes of both sawlog and pulpwood. In 1964, a network of Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) plots were established for measuring periodic growth, commencing initially in the Wombat forest, then Mt Cole, Barmah Forest and also conifer plantations. As aerial photographic cameras developed and got cheaper in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s all forest services began purchasing their own 70 mm medium format camera equipment and modifying small civilian aircraft to undertake regular surveys collecting information on things like vegetation, logging areas, new road works and bushfire history. Photos were interpreted using steroplotting equipment such as a Zeiss Aero Sketchmaster. The Commission continued to make a sizable effort in aerial photography, forest inventory, mapping, tree measurement, growth monitoring and analysis. This information was used not only to identify timber resources but also to monitor forest health and calculate sustainable yields and allowable harvesting levels.  Pulpwood  From its earliest days, the Commission had promoted using forest and sawmill waste for the production of wood pulp. Industry eventually began to show some interest and in December 1936, the Commission led by A.V. Galbraith and Sir Herbert Gepp from Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd (APM) finalised a pioneering legislated agreement which gave certain pulpwood rights to the company for fifty years over about 200,000 ha of State forest. The Commission retained control over the pulpwood harvesting operations to ensure that pulpwood remain secondary to the utilisation of the more valuable types of produce such as sawlogs, poles and piles, the main source being of the ash eucalyptus from both mature trees and thinning's. The company proceeded to establish a plant at Maryvale in Gippsland for the manufacture of Kraft papers. It came into production in October 1939 and for some years much of its feedstock came from the 1939 fire-killed ash forest.  1940s - Bushfire recovery and the war years  alt=Many Commission employees, timber workers and those from forest sawmills volunteered for military service in WW2 with some joining units deployed to the UK and other places as the 2/2 Forestry Company in the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) who served with distinction to produce timber for the war effort. Others served back at home by continuing the salvage of the fire killed forest as well as producing firewood and charcoal for domestic use.  Fire salvage  thumb Mundic savage log dump near Noojee in West Gippsland - 1941. Source: FCRPA* collection alt=left Victoria's forests were devastated to an extent that was unprecedented within living memory and the impact of the 1939 bushfires dominated management thought and action for much of the next ten years. Salvage of fire-killed timber became an urgent and dominant task that was still consuming resources and effort of the Commission a decade and a half later. It was estimated that over 6 million cubic metres of timber needed to be salvaged. A massive task made more difficult by labour shortages caused by the Second World War. In fact, there was so much material that some of the logs were harvested and stockpiled in huge dumps in creek beds and covered with soil and treeferns or wetted down with sprinklers to stop them from cracking only to be recovered many years later.  Reforestation  See also: Plantations and Nurseries sections below.left Reforestation of degraded mining areas near Creswick had begun with John la Gerche in the 1890s. Considerable effort also went into reforestation at Powelltown and the Toorongo Plateau near Noojee during the 1940s and 1950s. These mountain forests of Eucalyptus regnans, E. delegatensis and E. nitens had been killed by bushfire in 1926, and then regenerated naturally. However, significant bushfires again in 1932 and 1939 killed the young eucalypt regrowth before it was old enough to produce enough seed and the area was replaced by scrubland. The program lapsed but was renewed in the late 1980s and early 1990s with funding from the Timber Industry Strategy. The steep hills of the Strzelecki Ranges in South Gippsland had been cleared in the 1880s, but abandoned because it proved too hard to farm successfully. The scrub, blackberries, rabbits and weeds then took over and the area became known locally as the Heartbreak Hills. So the Commission commenced a massive reforestation scheme in the 1930s which continued for the next 60 years or so. The Commission purchased derelict farmland at Allambee (1947‚Äì49), Childers (1946‚Äì48) and Halls Rd at Boolarra (1949) and by June 1986 the FCV had purchased over 400 properties with a total area of 28000 ha. At the same time, APM held a similar estate of 24000 ha purchased land plus 8600 ha of crown land leasehold. Californian redwood plantation established as a trial in 1936. Photo 1959. Source: Roger Smith. Similarly, degraded farmland in the Otway Ranges was purchased and replanted from the early 1930s, including a trial plot of Californian Redwoods, Sequoia sempervirens in the Aire Valley planted in 1936. Their initial growth was disappointingly slow but they are now about 60 metres tall and have become a popular tourist destination in the Otways National Park. Most of the planting work was done by postwar immigrants and refugees from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The first batch of \\"Balts\\" as they became known, arrived at Colac in April 1949 and lived in a Forests Commission camp next the Redwoods. Reforestation was achieved by clearing the scrub using heavy machines and either broadcast seeding, or by planting with seedlings. The reforestation of the Strzelecki Ranges and the Otways proved successful and the plantations were included in the area vested with the Victorian Plantations Corporation in 1993. Reforestation works using Cypress Pine Callitris, were carried out in the dry Hattah - Kulkyne forest in northwest Victoria in 1937-38 to combat soil erosion resulting from the excessive clearing of mallee woodlands for farming. However this work was severely hampered by large rabbit populations and the vagaries of the weather.  Firewood emergency  Up until the late 1930s, coal was the main fuel for domestic heating and cooking, industry and electricity for metropolitan Melbourne as well as Victoria's steam trains. But World War II drew large numbers of men, led to a major escalation in Australia's heavy industry, placing urgent demands for fuel and power as well as a reduction in the supply of black coal from both New South Wales and overseas. Imported petrol and oil were also severely rationed. (see Charcoal). One of the pressing requirements on the Forests Commission during the War was to organise emergency supplies of firewood for military and civilian heating and cooking, and as a substitute for coal for locomotives exacerbated by earlier explosion at the State Coal mine at Wonthaggi in 1937. In response, the Commission established the State Fuel Branch to increase production and control distribution which was housed at the Flinders Street railway buildings. The Victorian Railways provided special firewood trains but transport and distribution of the bulky firewood dogged the project.Paddle Steamer Hero was purchased by the Commission in 1942 to transport redgum firewood from Barmah Forest to Echuca. Prior to the War, less than 1,000 imperial tons of firewood came into Melbourne each week and estimates ranged up to a 300,000 ton short-fall, but in its first year of operation, the Forests Commission dispatched some 253,668 tons into the City. Much of the firewood came from 1939 bushfire salvage operations, but later in 1942, the Paddle Steamer Hero and two barges (John Campbell and Canally) were purchased by the Commission from Arbuthnot Sawmills to transport much needed redgum firewood from Barmah Forest to the Echuca wharf and then by rail to Melbourne. Most of the labour was provided by some 700 Italian and German POWs and internees who were accommodated in special forest camps at Echuca, Mt Disappointment, Tatura, Rushworth and Graytown. By the end of 1943 they produced 148,844 tons at an average rate of 11.3 tons per man each week. Closer to Melbourne, the Country Roads Board undertook special construction projects to provide access to firewood areas. And firewood depots were set up in conjunction with Victorian Railways at Brookwood, Toorak, Fitzroy and Kew. The City of South Melbourne provided a facility where one-foot blocks of wood were cut from 5-foot and 7-foot billets and stored. Four-hundred-and-ninety- six fuel merchants were registered to distribute the firewood across suburban Melbourne. Later, large bushfires in 1944 near Yallourn open-cut mine caused further restrictions on coal and briquettes. Homeowners were only permitted to buy coal for heating water and firewood was provided to the Victorian Railways for locomotives shunting in marshalling yards throughout the State. After the War, a seven-week national coal miners‚Äô strike in 1949 brought industry to a grinding halt and black coal was no longer available to Victoria from interstate. The State Electricity Commission could not keep-up full production of briquettes. There were also restrictions with electricity which were not lifted until 1953. In December 1950, a fire at the Brookwood depot destroyed over 3,300 tons of firewood. The Emergency Firewood Project continued long after the war and over the period from 1941 to 1954, nearly 2 million tons of firewood was produced by the FCV.  Charcoal  left During WW2, petrol was rationed and largely reserved for essential services or the military.Petrol rationing in Australia during the Second World War. AWM. Issue 36. In 1941 the Government restricted motorists to 1,000 miles per year (32 km/week) so many simply put their cars up on blocks for the duration and switched to public transport. Others were offered an alternative source of energy: charcoal to burn in gas converters attached to their cars. They had a reputation for being inefficient, underpowered, dirty, belching black smoke, catching fire and occasionally exploding.Producer gas and the Australian motorists. Don Bartlett 2008. Engineering Heritage Victoria. http://consuleng.com.au/Producer%20Gas%20&%20the%20Aussie%20Motorist%201939-45.pdf Forests Commission firefighting vehicles were exempt from the petrol restrictions. District Foresters were authorised to issue petrol coupons for timber industry trucks, which, in the absence of private cars and utes, often served as family transport too. Country school buses were fitted with gas converters and on declared days of Acute Fire Danger they were banned. Some of Melbourne's buses also ran on charcoal. The task of ensuring adequate supplies of charcoal fell to the Commission. It subsequently formed the State Charcoal Branch to organise the increased production of charcoal, to build up reserves to meet emergencies and to regulate the cost to consumers. The assistance of an expert Advisory Panel, representing charcoal producers, manufacturers and distributors of vehicle gas equipment, the Department of Supply and Development, and the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, was enlisted under the Chairman of the Forests Commission, Alfred Vernon Galbraith. Preliminary arrangements were made for bag supplies, for railway sidings in Melbourne, and for processing of charcoal bought by the Branch in excess of the requirements of private grading firms. In its first year, 17,421 tons of charcoal were produced compared with 1,650 tons before the War.Forests Commission Victoria - Annual reports Production peaked at 38,922 tons in 1942‚Äì43. An estimated 221 kilns and 12 pits were producing charcoal by the middle of 1942. Some of the labour was provided by Italian wartime internees. There were also over 600 commercial kilns operating mostly on private property. At least 50 to 60 private charcoal retorts were operating in the Barmah forest alone. Kurth Kiln was built by the Commission near Gembrook as the only commercially sized charcoal facility in Victoria which could operate continuously. The kiln was in full production by mid-1942, but transport difficulties and an oversupply of charcoal from private operators meant the kiln was used only intermittently during 1943 and was shut down soon after. The unique site is now of historical and scientific significance.  Minor forest produce  alt= In addition to the main commodity of sawlogs and pulpwood, the Commission supplied a wide assortment of minor forest products including salt, eucalyptus oil and tea tree from the mallee deserts, wattle bark for tanneries. gravel, sand, charcoal, railway sleepers, clothes line props, split fence palings, chopping blocks for country shows, power poles, fence posts and rails, timber for wood distillation to produce chemicals, Christmas trees as well as specialty durable timbers for boats and marine jetties. They controlled licences and leases, cattle grazing along the Murray River and some alpine areas as well as hundreds of apiary sites. Cork oak plantations were trialled but proved unsuccessful. But the Commission owned a number of poplar plantations along the Murray River and the timber was used to make redhead matches untilBryant and May switched its manufacturing operations from Richmond to Sweden in the 1980s. Baron Ferdinand von Meuller, the Government Botanist encouraged Joseph Bosisto, a Victorian pharmacist, to investigate the essential oils of the eucalyptus during the 1850s. Based on the success of this work eucalyptus oil became an important industry in the box-ironbark forests during the post gold-rush era of the 1870s. It was a very labour-intensive operation with coppice cut by hand and placed in steam stills. The oil was often described as Australia's natural wonder and was exported to a growing international market, mostly for medicinal purposes. Eucalyptus oil was in particularly big demand during the global influenza pandemic of 1918-19. A distillation plant that was established by the Forests Commission at Wellsford State Forest near Bendigo in 1926. The Principal of the Victorian School of Forestry, Edwin James Semmens, undertook much of the pioneering chemistry into the composition of eucalyptus oil. His steam extraction kilns are in the museum at the school. Australian production peaked in the 1940s but sources from Spain and Portugal began to dominate supply from the 1950s. The world consumption of eucalyptus oil is now estimated to be about 3000 tonnes per annum and China supplies about 75%, although Australia continues to produce high-grade oils, mainly from blue mallee (E. polybractea).  1950s - Post war housing boom  In the immediate postwar period the Forests Commission increased its intake of students at the Victorian School of Forestry to meet the demands on the States forests and the timber needs of the housing boom.Carron, L T (1985). A History of Forestry in Australia. Aust National University. . An interactive map reveals the extent Melbourne's suburban post-war growth. The destruction by the 1939 fire in the Central Highlands around Melbourne and conclusion of the massive salvage operation forced a major movement of timber production into East Gippsland and northeast Victoria. The demands of the new sawmills in regional towns, and the shift of the timber industry to the vast untapped forests transformed logging of Victoria's native forests from small operations to ones with large capital investments in machinery and trucks. The advent of more powerful bulldozers, crawler tractors and geared haulage trucks dramatically changed logging practices. It became feasible for log trucks to haul directly from the landing in the forest to town-based sawmills within a few hours. Country towns then became the hub of activity, rather than the mills deeper in the forest that was characteristic of the earlier period, and settlements like Heyfield, Mansfield, Myrtleford, Orbost and Swifts Creek grew into busy centres based on the timber industry. Moreover, after learning valuable lessons from the 1939 bushfires and tragic loss of life the Commission used its Licensing and Royalty powers to regulate where new mills could be built.  Road and bridge building  300x300px The result of the eastwards shift was a massive expansion of the forest roads and tracks network by almost a thousand kilometres in some years. Major construction projects such as the Tamboritha and Moroka Roads north of Licola in Gippsland and the Big River Road in northeast Victoria were blasted through the rugged mountains to access new timber resources and provide much needed fire access. However, the ever- expanding road and wooden bridge network and the need for expensive maintenance in remote locations created long term funding headaches. Winter snows and storms caused large trees to fall and flash floods proved havoc that required a big engineering program each spring and summer. Large works crews with a fleet of trucks, bulldozers and graders were needed to keep the roads and 4WD fire tracks open and to repair or replace damaged timber bridges. The Commission's own powder monkeys blasted and crushed rock from large quarries in the forest to provide much needed surfacing gravel.  Vehicles and equipment  White scout car as well as several Blitz trucks set up as 4X4 tankers from the RAAF base at Amberley. A few Norton Dominator 77 motorbikes with sidecars were purchased.

Also acquired were Coventry Climax and Pacific Marine fire pumps as well as new radio equipment. Source: Jim McKinty. FCRPA* collection. 300x300px The advent of motor vehicles, aircraft, radios and telephones extended the knowledge and reach of management as well as operational surveillance and control. It gave the Commission better scope to deal with its greatly increased area of bushfire responsibility. The Commission acquired several surplus WW2 army vehicles and equipment as the forest road network rapidly expanded in the wake of the Stretton Royal Commission into the 1939 Black Friday bushfires and the appointment of the new Chief Fire Officer, Alfred Oscar Lawrence. The Forests Commission acquired a large fleet of surplus 4WDs after WW2 such as heavy American armour-plated White scout cars, Blitz trucks and 4X4 tankers from the RAAF base at Amberley. A few Norton Dominator 77 motorbikes complete with sidecars were also purchased but these were progressively replaced by British Series 1 Land Rovers in the 1950s and then by Toyota 40 series Land Cruisers in the early 1960s. Army surplus Coventry Climax and Pacific Marine fire pumps as well as new radio equipment were also purchased. The Commission placed increased emphasis on fire research and development right through the 1960s and 1970s and undertook some innovative work with aerial fire bombing and fire equipment. Initially, fire fighting appliances such as Bedford tankers and locally designed rubber Slip-On-Units that fitted onto a tray bodied 4WD vehicle were rugged and rudimentary but developed over time at its Altona workshops.  Changing relationships with the timber industry  During the 1950s, a number of factors led to a realignment of the relationship between the timber industry and the Forests Commission. These included post war housing boom, the movement eastwards after the end of the 1939 fire salvage, larger sawmills situated in small country towns, rather than deep in the forest, combined with more powerful logging equipment and haulage trucks. The Commission focused on its legislative and regulatory responsibilities of managing the states 7.1 million hectare forest estate. In addition to land management, conservation and fire protection the key commercial tasks involved inventory and assessment, mapping, preparing working plans, growth monitoring, calculating sustainable yield and allowable cuts, marketing and sales, licensing and approvals. Timber harvesting roles involved setting standards and prescriptions, construction and maintenance of major roads and bridges, supervision and compliance of logging operations. The Commission also took responsibility for all post-harvest regeneration treatments and depending on the forest type and technique required, this included seed collection and extraction, site preparation, slash burning, aerial seeding and follow up surveys. The timber industry centred on private sector business, harvesting and cartage contractors engaged directly by sawmills and APM pulpmill, all with large capital investments in plant and machinery. The Commission meanwhile progressively divested itself of its logging equipment, timber tramways, the State sawmill at Erica and the Newport seasoning works during the later part of the 1950s to create a much clearer separation between itself and the timber industry. In January 1950, a new royalty equation system was introduced that took account of the distance that logs were hauled from the forest to the sawmill, the quality and size of the logs together with the distance to central markets in Melbourne. It was intended to reduce wastage but also be simple and equitable and with various modifications still operates today.  Department restructure - 1956  A limited road network and access to vehicles defined forest district boundaries for many years. Ford Model TT with C cab - Circa 1924. Source: Brian Fry. While there had been many administrative changes in the late 1800s, the structure of the Forests Commission had remained relatively stable since its formation in 1918. Until about 1926, there were no defined boundaries and management was based on how far foresters could travel by bike or horse from their offices in small country towns because there were very few motor vehicles or forest roads. Major reorganisation commenced in 1956 under the direction of Commissioner, Alfred Oscar Lawrence, and officially took effect from 1 July 1957, foreshadowing proclamation of the Forests Act 1958. The Plantations and Hardwood Forest groups were amalgamated and the State subdivided into 56 Forest Districts, to become the basic units of all field management which were led by District Foresters Officers (DFOs). Districts were grouped into seven territorial Divisions, each with a Divisional Forester replacing the previous Chief Inspector position. Head Office was arranged into six divisions; Forest Management, Operations, Protection, Economics and Marketing, Education and Research, and Administration. Most of the Commissions 1400 staff and crew were field-based with a small Head Office cohort of about 300 people. This configuration remained largely unchanged until the creation of Conservation Forests and Lands (CFL) in 1983. District boundaries still exist to this day and follow natural topography such as ridges and streams as well as the forest road network.  Legislation change - 1958  1958 saw a major revision of three pieces of complementary legislation - the Forests Act, Country Fire Authority (CFA) Act and the Land Act. The aim was to set a bold new framework for the future of Victoria's public land estate and provide a suite of supporting regulations. It also aimed to bring all the legislation into alignment, give clarity, avoid duplication and confusing overlaps. For example, many of the legal powers for Forests Commission staff relating to fire suppression are drawn from the CFA Act. The legislative package proved robust and remains largely intact today. The first National Parks Act was passed only two years earlier in 1956 but had a major revision in 1975. In 1959, building on a similar model to APM at Maryvale, a legislative agreement was reached to supply timber to Bacchus Marsh for the Masonite Corporation for the manufacture of hardboard products.  1960s - Consolidation  The Commission had dominated forest management during the 1950s post war housing boom and this proved to be the peak of its influence. It entered the 1960s increasingly confident, politically powerful and well-resourced with about 130 staff.  Softwood and hardwood plantations  leftEarly foresters discovered that the physical properties of native forest hardwoods were unsuitable for some applications and plantation-grown softwoods offered the chance to replace expensive imports of Baltic Pine, Oregon and other timbers with domestic supplies. Several exotic softwood species had been trialled but Pinus radiata had been found that its growth in Victorian conditions was sufficiently promising for commercial planting to begin from 1880. Initially, the goals were simply to rehabilitate land cleared during the goldrush, provide timber and avoid cost and unreliability of imported timber, generate revenue and create jobs through local sawmills. Commercial financial returns became a more important objective following increased investment with the plantations expansion program. Planting was limited in the early years but accelerated from 1910, but unfortunately, large areas of the early plantings established in coastal areas between 1910 and 1930 failed due to the unsuitability of the sites. Activity picked up once again in the 1930s with unemployment relief schemes during the Great Depression. The war years saw activity again fall away sharply while after the war there was a new focus on developing native forests in eastern Victoria owing to the conclusion of the 1939 fire salvage and to provide timber for post-war housing construction. However, the Strzelecki reforestation program got underway in the 1930s with planting of both softwoods and hardwoods on abandoned farmland. In 1949 the Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau proposed a national planting program to make Australia more self-reliant in timber products after the shortages experienced during the war. The threat of introduced sirex woodwasp in the early 1950s and its eventual discovery on the Australian mainland in 1961 brought the softwood plantation program into question. However, quarantine and control measure was put in place. Separately in 1952 a private company, Softwood Holdings, began to establish its own plantations in South West Victoria. This was followed shortly after by construction of a new sawmill at Dartmoor in 1954 which drew logs from both government plantations and private sources. Associated Kiln Dryers (AKD) mill at Colac followed in 1954. It was a similar pattern across the border near Mt Gambier in South Australia and the beginning of what became known as the \\"green triangle\\". But the big step came in 1961, when the Chairman of the Forest Commission, Alf Lawrence attended the World Forestry Conference in S√£o Paulo Brazil and upon his return took a bold decision to commit Victoria to a massive Plantation Expansion (PX) program which initiated nearly four decades of rapid plantation establishment. At that stage, softwoods were still being imported in large quantities and it was also believed that softwoods could not only relieve the pressure on native forests but make Australia self-sufficient in timber resources. A new Ministerial Australian Forestry Council was formed in 1964 with one of its first decisions being to further raise the national softwood target, with the Commonwealth agreeing to provide loan monies to the States to plant 30,000 hectares of softwoods per year for 35 years. Victoria took up the challenge by establishing and maintaining its plantations at nearly half the average cost of the other States.alt=Planting peaked in 1969 with a record 5,183 ha and by the end of 1982, the Commission had established 87,000 hectares of softwood plantations, a five-fold increase since 1940. Softwood plantation zones were concentrated around Bright and Myrtleford in the Ovens Valley, Portland- Rennick, Latrobe Valley-Strzelecki Ranges, Ballarat-Creswick, Benalla- Mansfield, Upper Murray near Tallangatta-Koetong, the Otways and Central zone near Taggerty.FCV Annual Report 1982-83 The majority of the plantation estate consisted of Pinus radiata, with a smaller area of native hardwoods ‚Äì mostly Eucalyptus regnans in the Strzelecki Ranges. As the plantation base expanded and matured agreements were reached private mills such as Bowater-Scott (now Carter Holt Harvey) at Myrtleford in 1972 and Australian Newsprint Mill at Albury in 1980. But there was growing disquiet from environment and community groups about the clearing of native forests and conversion to pines, together with the use of chemical sprays. So in the 1970s the Commission commenced major environmental studies in North East Victoria into the effects of plantations. The studies included surveys of the biology of existing plantations compared to adjoining native forests as well as the impact of plantations on the catchment hydrology. Subsequent Land Conservation Council reviews, beginning in the 1970s, restricted the areas of new plantations on public land and by 1987 degraded farmland was being purchased for the PX program and the clearing of native forest halted. In addition to the Commission's estate, there was considerable private investment in plantations, most notably from APM that purchased farmland close to its pulp mill at Maryvale. The company also established trees on Crown Land in the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges on long term lease from the Commission. In 1992 Australia's one-millionth hectare of softwood was planted at the Ovens plantation while at the same time the Victorian Plantations Corporation (VPC) was formed to manage Victoria's publicly owned softwood plantation estate. The \\"cutting rights\\" (i.e. not the land base) were later sold to Hancock Victorian Plantations (HVP) in 1998 for $550 million.  Farm Forestry Loans  To encourage small landholders to establish woodlots, not only improve farm income but also, to contribute towards Victoria's plantation targets, legislation was enacted in late 1966 for the Commission to provide financial assistance of up to $5,000, on interest-free terms for 12 years, under the Farm Forestry Loans Scheme. By 1980, the Commission reported that 300 agreements were in place covering about 6000 ha. A separate benevolent scheme was in place to assist state schools to establish small plots of pine trees with the intent of the school retaining the revenue once they were harvested.  Nurseries and extension services  The Creswick Nursery was established by John La Gerche in 1887 to grow plants to rehabilitate degraded mining areas. The Commission operated a number of nurseries across Victoria. Circa: 1920 The first State nursery was opened by William Ferguson at Macedon in 1872 while a nursery at Creswick opened shortly after by John La Gerche in 1887. By the late 1960s regional nurseries were located at Tallangatta (Koetong), Benalla, Trentham and Rennick near Mt Gambier to produce softwood seedlings for the Commission's Plantation Extension (PX) program, Farm Forestry Agreement holders and other private land owners. A large nursery at Morwell River attached to a low-security prison produced over one million eucalypt seedlings each year while another prison at nearby Yarram at Won Wron grew pines. The prison inmates did much of the planting in the Strzeleckis. Other extension nurseries were situated at Creswick, Macedon, Mildura and Wail near Horsham growing nearly one million native plants each year to support the trees on farms initiative (a precursor to Landcare which started later in 1986). Private plantations companies like Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM) operated their own nurseries in Gippsland.  Aerial firefighting  Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly at Erica 1949.

Aircraft were used for fire bombing, crew transport, aerial incendiary work, aerial photography, infrared cameras and reconnaissance.

(RAAF Westland Wapiti) and the first helicopter (RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly) was trialed at Erica not long after WW2 in 1949. The organisation had been at the forefront of aircraft technology ever since. The Snowy Range airfield north of Heyfield, which is Australia's highest at 1600m (5300 feet) ASL, was built by the Commission in 1961 to help fight fires across the remote alpine area. Its success led to the development of other firebombing airstrips such as the Victoria Valley in the Grampians.Getting firefighters into difficult and inaccessible terrain quickly was a perennial problem. The development of the rappelling ‚Äì lowering of firefighters from a hovering helicopter, was first trialled at Heyfield in 1964, an Australian first, using a Bell 47G helicopter and a two-man crew.DSE (2010). History of helicopter rappel operations in Victoria. Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment. 28 pp. (Page 7). The system was in place for the following two fire seasons but lapsed until the advent of more powerful helicopters like the Bell 204 and Bell 212 in the early 1980s.  An Australian milestone - Benambra 1967  Piper Pawnees that flew Australia's first operational firebombing mission from Benambra in February 1967. Source: National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC). On 6 February 1967, two Piper Pawnees from Benambra near Omeo made Australia's first operational drop of fire retardant on a small lightning-strike. The drops were able to contain the remote fire long enough to enable ground crews to walk many hours across rugged terrain to reach it and make it safe. Up to that time there had been a remarkable range of experiments with different aircraft such as heavy military four engine bombers, single seat fighters and small agricultural aircraft with differing drop materials, techniques and equipment. But this was the first real firebombing job, and the beginning of modern aerial firefighting operations in Australia.  Water catchments  The Royal Commission of 1897-1901 identified the importance of protecting forested water catchments. Many areas were identified for stock and domestic consumption and some large reservoirs such as Eildon and Dartmouth were primarily fed from State forest. The Commission used small speed boats to access the lake edge for fire protection and recreation patrols. Smaller weirs like Lake Glenmaggie on the Macalister River had a network of channels which fed diary irrigation districts. The water infrastructure was managed by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC). Agreements and policies were progressively put in place between the Forests Commission, the SRWSC and the Soil Conservation Authority (SCA) from the 1940s to ensure water catchment protection. Melbourne's water supply catchments were treated differently and had been vested in the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works in 1891. Some catchments such at the Kiewa and Rubicon were important for hydroelectricity. left The 1960s again saw more prolonged droughts and deadly bushfires on the fringes of Melbourne in 1962 and again in 1968. There were growing concerns about long term water supply security so in 1965 a Parliamentary Public Works Committee began an inquiry into future water supplies for the growing city and reported in 1967. In response to the inquiry, the Bolte Government immediately approved works for a 20 km diversion tunnel from the Thomson River and planning to begin for the construction the massive Thomson Dam in Gippsland to add considerably to water storage capacity (the Upper Yarra Dam had been completed in 1957). In addition to the Thomson, a number of smaller diversion catchments known as the Yarra Tributaries were set aside under a lease agreement between the Commission and the MMBW in 1968 to augment water supplies. Five small concrete weirs on the Armstrong, Starvation, McMahons and Cement Creeks were built to divert water directly into the Silvan Conduit that connected the Upper Yarra Reservoir to Melbourne. All the newly designated Yarra Tributaries as well as the Thomson Catchment were on State forest, unlike the vested MMBW water catchments set aside in 1891. They were closed to public access and gates were erected. The Forests Commission had long opposed the closed catchment policy of the MMBW arguing that timber harvesting, controlled public access and the protection of water supplies were all compatible. Previously, in 1958‚Äì60, the State Development Committee held an inquiry into the utilisation of timber resources in the watersheds of the State and the Commission advocated strongly for logging access to closed catchments. However, on this occasion they were more concerned that access to timber resources in Thomson would be restricted with construction of a new reservoir and advanced as evidence to the parliamentary inquiry its successful conduct of harvesting in many proclaimed catchments across Victoria. The State Government had no appetite to overturn the MMBW closed catchment policy that had stood since 1891 but it was resolved that timber harvesting would continue in the Yarra Tributaries and Thomson catchments but with some additional protections. Construction on the new Thomson Dam commenced in the early 1970s and was completed in 1984. The MMBW had begun research into forest cover on water supplies as early as 1948. In the early 1960s it set up a new series of paired catchment experiments in wet mountain forests near Healesville to measure the long term impacts of timber harvesting and bushfire on water quality and quantity. It took another 10 years for the results to emerge more clearly. It was found that while timber harvesting had an impact, the most dramatic threat to stream flows remained catastrophic bushfires like those on Black Friday in 1939.  The Woodpeckers  A timber bridge built by alt= Much has been written about the socially turbulent 1960s and the Cold War with its nuclear threat from the Soviet Union but a major geopolitical feature was Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War and the controversial matter of conscription. The forestry profession was not exempt from National Service and a number of Commission staff were called up to serve in Vietnam. In the post-WW2 era, from 1947 to the mid-1980s, the Forests Commission sponsored Australia's only military sawmilling unit, the 91 Forestry Squadron, which was a special reserve unit of the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) . Established and commanded by FCV forester and WW2 veteran, Major Ben Benallack, the \\"Woodpeckers\\" as they were known comprised a small pool of specialised soldiers capable of rapid mobilisation in the event of a need. Several other Victorian departments such as the State Electricity Commission (SEC) did the same thing by supporting a construction squadron based at Newborough in the Latrobe Valley. It created a very active and capable part-time military group that completed many worthy projects across the State. The 91 Forestry Squadron operated bush sawmills, built timber bridges along the Murray River, the suspension bridge at Tarra Bulga National Park, the Snake Island jetty, logging roads and various demolition tasks. Numerous Commission employees and others from the forestry sector served long periods in the unit.  1970s - Rising environmental tide  Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s a series of environmental controversies emerged across Australia that were different in nature and more adversarial than those that had gone before. Development proposals at Lake Pedder in Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Little Desert among them.  Land Conservation Council (LCC)  The electoral backlash from the proposal to clear public land in Victoria's Little Desert for agriculture galvanised the conservation community which led Sir Henry Bolte's State government to begrudgingly create the Land Conservation Council (LCC) in 1971. Its main role was to independently assess public land and make recommendations to government on its balanced use. The Council's processes were rigorous and ninety six percent of all its recommendations were accepted over its successful period of operation to 1997. As a result, the area of National Parks and other reservations expanded rapidly with a corresponding reduction in the area of State forests. In late 1973 Australian National University (ANU) published \\"The Fight for the Forests\\" a critique of forestry aimed at intensive timber production, wood chipping and the clearance of native forests for pine plantations. The publication of \\"The Alps at the Crossroads\\" in 1974, was unmistakably directed at the Victorian Government and the policies and practices of the Forests Commission and other Victorian agencies. For most of the preceding century the forestry profession had been synonymous with conservation and the combined principles of sustainability and multiple-use as first set out in Schlich's \\"bible\\" on forestry written in 1904 but, for the first time, this notion was coming under frontal and forensic attack. A different view of conservation based on the primacy of intrinsic ecological values, particularly of wildlife, was being vigorously asserted by non-government environmental organisation and some staff were dismayed by its stridency. The debate was sometimes heated and divisive and many staff felt their loyalty to the Forests Commission and justifiable pride as having been the long term stewards of the forest together with their status in local communities was coming into question. The tight- knit cohort of FCV staff had always felt a strong commitment to protection and conservation of the forests and their hurt and frustration was reflected repeatedly in staff association meetings and newsletters. The tide of environmental criticism had turned and is what is commonly described as the second wave of the Australian environmental movement. It was sometimes unfairly alleged that the Commissions' senior leaders struggled to adapt nimbly enough to the changing community attitudes and stuck too doggedly to the doctrine of multiple-use of forests as the solution.  Forest Environment and Recreation (FEAR) Branch  Mt Donna Buang was developed for snow play - 1947 In an innovative move at the time the Commission established a specialised Forest Environment and Recreation (FEAR) branch in the early 1970s to focus on community education, the environment, conservation and recreation. This included engaging overseas landscape architects which was believed to be an Australian first. Other State Forest agency's soon followed suite with similar models. Providing for forest recreation became a significant focus for the Commission from the late 1960s onwards, although it had first developed a substantial interest in recreation with the development of Mt Buller as a ski field from the early 1940s. The Commission also pursued alpine resort and snow play development at Mt Baw Baw, Mt Donna Buang and Lake Mountain near Marysville with vigour. The challenge of establishing roads, communications, water and sewerage, accommodation and other services in a remote location was well suited to the Commission's experience and skills.The Commission managed a number of significant gardens in the Dandenong Ranges such the William Ricketts sanctuary at Kalorama.Whereas, ornamental gardens, arboretums, a golf course at Olinda and picnic grounds were developed in the Dandenong Ranges and elsewhere. The Commission was also active in providing access for orienteering, car rallying and developing the long-distance Alpine Walking Track. In addition to many smaller recreation sites, walking tracks and picnic grounds on State forest the Commission ran major forest parks at Sherbrooke, You Yangs, Macedon, Grampians and the Lerderderg Gorge. Eventually, many of these areas were transferred in various reviews by the Land Conservation Council (LCC) to be managed either by the Victorian National Park Service (now Parks Victoria) or the Victorian Alpine Resorts Commission (ARC). During the remaining years of the Commission, it steadily broadened its focus on non-timber aspects of forest management, strongly promoting recreation, tourism, flora and fauna conservation, water catchment protection, farm forestry, biological research, community education (including the construction of a dedicated pavilion at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds), production of what was to become a popular series of forest display posters and the management of the landscape impacts of forestry. World Forestry Day was proclaimed in 1971 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. It was set down for 21 March each year to coincide with the vernal equinox or the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. For many years the Commission's staff celebrated the occasion by staging various community events.  Metrication - 1974  There were many confusing measures for a stack of firewood before metrication of the forest and timber industry began in 1974. Decimal currency was introduced to Australia on 14 February 1966, but it took another 8 years before metrication finally came to the forest and timber industry and the measurement of logs and sawn timber changed over from traditional imperial and confusing measures such as super feet of sawn timber, billets and cunits (100 cubic feet) of stacked pulpwood, cords of firewood and hoppus log volumes to simpler cubic metres. For example, before metrication a standard cord of firewood had a volume of 128 cubic feet, measured as a pile 8 feet long, 4 feet high and 4 feet wide. In Victoria, an imperial or long ton (by measure) of green firewood was a stack 5 feet long billets (2 axe lengths at 2' 6\\" each), one axe length high (2' 6\\") and two axe lengths long (5 feet) equalling 62.5 cubic feet. There was also a cubic ton (40 cubic feet) which equaled 1.133 cubic metres. Australia did not use the American short ton. Other terms, such as standing cord, stove cord, kitchen cord, running cord, face cord, fencing cord, country cord, long cord, and rick were all subject to local variations and sometimes used to describe a stack of wood measuring 4 feet high and 8 feet long but with a piece length shorter than 4 feet. A common firewood piece was 16 inches long, or one-third of a full cord, but other lengths are also available. Whereas, one cubic metre was equal to one stere (1 m¬≥ = ~0.276 cords) and a standard 6 feet by 4 feet trailer tightly stacked with firewood was roughly equivalent to 1 cubic metre. Just about all eucalypts have about the same energy content (19-20,000 kJ/kg) while softwood has more energy (21-22,000 kJ/kg) but is less dense. Green firewood has 100% moisture content (i.e. holds its own weight in water), while air dried firewood has between 10% to 19% and weighs about one metric tonne per cubic metre. Red gum and box are heavier, while pine is lighter. Adding to the confusion of measuring firewood was varying moisture content and how well the wood was stacked (generally about 30-35% air space depending on piece size). A few redundant imperial measures also existed like a faggot or bundle of sticks but weren't in common usage. The Commission reported satisfactory preparations for metrication in June 1973 but the transition was not without its challenges along the supply chain for foresters, overseers, logging contractors, sawmillers, hardware stores and builders alike. Timber lengths changed from feet to metres but were still sold in multiples of one foot or 0.3 m, while a classic lump of 4 by 2 inch became 100 by 50 mm. Full conversion took two years and was completed by 1976. Measurement and calculations of area was so much easier in hectares rather than complicated acres, roods and perches.  Bushfires  300x300px Internationally, south- eastern Australia is considered one of the three most fire-prone landscapes on Earth, along with southern California and the southern Mediterranean. Bushfires have undoubtedly always been a feature of Australian summers. In an average year, more than 600 bushfires occur in Victoria's National Parks and State Forests which burn about 110,000 hectares. Major Victorian bushfires occurred on Black Thursday in 1851, where an estimated 5 million hectares were burnt, followed by another blaze on Red Tuesday in February 1891 in South Gippsland when about 260,000 hectares were burnt, 12 people died and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. The deadly pattern continued with more major fires on Black Sunday on 14 February 1926 sees the tally rise to sixty lives being lost and widespread damage to farms, homes and forests. Once again in February 1932, large fires burnt large areas of forest at Gilderoy, Noojee and Erica in where six people were killed. However, the bushfires on Black Friday 1939 were one of the worst natural disasters to have occurred in Australia and certainly the worst bushfire up to that time. The 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria burnt 2 million hectares, 69 mills were destroyed, 71 people died, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Only the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia in the summer of 1983 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 have resulted in more fatalities. The spate of major bushfires on state forest and national parks continued unabated. The summer of 1977-78 was characterised by a build-up of extreme fire danger in most areas of the State. There were 606 outbreaks of fire, of which 77 occurred over a period of three days from 15‚Äì17 January. Lightning caused most of these in the alpine areas of the State. Many were controlled quickly but eight developed into major fires and stage 2 of the State Disaster Plan was enacted. Then the Army and Airforce were called to assist the Commission staff and employees. A notable feature was the very important part played by military helicopters in moving crews and supplies to combat multiple fires in the alpine area.FCV Annual Report 1976-77 Wessex at Mt Murray. Mt Feathertop in the background. An army Chinook helicopter was also deployed. January 1985. Source: Peter McHugh. FCRPA* collection. Lightning is the main cause of bushfires in mountainous areas of Victoria followed closely by deliberate and careless ignitions. Direct attack was the normal tactic in the early phases of a bushfire. This involved walking a small crew to the edge and then building a hand trail with rakehoes and chainsaws. It was possible to control a small fire using this technique provided flame height was less than a metre or so, the fire was accessible on foot, the scrub wasn't too thick and the weather was stable. Sometimes a load of retardant dropped from a small agriculture aircraft could be used to buy time for ground crews, particularly if the fire was small or a single tree that had been hit by lightning. A small D4 first attack bulldozer (FAD) transported on a truck was often used to construct control line close to the fire edge. Bigger FCV D6 machines, as well as contractor machinery, were called in as the fire escalated. This initial attack technique was not without its risks but proved very effective over the decades at keeping fires small, particularly in remote locations. As more powerful helicopters developed in the 1960s and 1970s crews were often rappelled into the fire or a helipad was cut. 300x300pxThis aggressive direct attack technique was known as dry firefighting and as the name implied involves having limited or no access to water. It was hard physical work but an essential skill to fight remote forest fires. It was something that Commission staff were historically renowned and very few people, other than their families, were even aware that they might spend weeks away deep in the mountains. Initially, simple basecamps were set up in a small clearing in the forest near a river and close to the fire. They were fairly primitive and crews were expected to remain self-sufficient for the first 48 hours or so until better arrangements for food and supplies could be made. But over time basecamps became more comfortable and well organised with hot showers, toilets, power, medical services and decent cooked food. As fires got larger and more difficult to control by direct attack or if the weather or terrain was unfavourable crews often were forced to pull back, sometimes many kilometres, to a road or ridgeline and backburn when conditions were safer. This had the negative effect of making the fire area much bigger and more importantly the perimeter much longer to patrol. The first use, anywhere in the world, of DAIDs (Delayed Action Incendiary Devices - similar to large double ended matches with a length of safety fuse in between) to backburn a large 49,800 acre fire in northeastern Victoria was undertaken by the Commission in 1968.  Fuel reduction burning  Experience and research have shown that reducing available fuel influences the rate of spread and intensity of bushfires. Other factors such as the weather, wind speed, relative humidity and temperature cannot be controlled.Forests Commission, Victoria (1970). Air Operations for Forest Fire Control. Fuel reduction burning (FRB) goes by many names including prescribed burning, planned burning, controlled burning, hazard reduction burning, candling, edge burning and sometimes even ecological burning. However, the objective is generally the same: to reduce available fuel safely. FRB is very different from high intensity slash or regeneration burning after logging operations. 300x300px The upper limit at which a bushfire can be handled safely by either ground crews alone or ground crews supported by fire tankers, graders, bulldozers, is a heat intensity of about 2,000 kW/m. Severe bushfires, such as on Black Saturday, generated intensities in excess of 100,000 kW/m. Whereas fuel reduction burning is usually less than 500 kW/m. For comparison, a large household radiator emits about 1 kW. frameless All burning is subject to seasonal conditions and varies greatly year-to-year. Burning operations require considerable skill and experience as well as large investments of people and equipment to achieve them safely within the short timeframe available during spring and autumn. Reviewing over 40 years of FCV annual reports reveals that in 1944‚Äì45, strip and patch burning was conducted on , the 1954-55 report has fuel reduction burning at , and 10 years later in 1964-65 a similar figure of was achieved. By 1974-75 the area fuel reduced had increased to nearly . In the last full financial year of the Forests Commission, 1982-83 (the year of droughts and the deadly Ash Wednesday bushfires), fuel reduction burning was carried out on , which was about one- third of the fifteen year average of . By contrast, burning targets set after the Black Saturday Bushfires Royal Commission lifted to 5% of the National Parks and State Forests estate, about . The planning and approvals process for fuel reduction burning was not very sophisticated or bureaucratic up to the late 1970s. If fuel conditions were suitable, and after checking the weather figures on a McArthur Meter, it was common for the local district forester or experienced forest overseer to simply light-up the bush in late autumn or even winter by using a drip torch or by throwing large fusee matches out of the vehicle window late in the afternoon on their way home from work. For larger operations in the remote mountains or desert, a helicopter would fly along ridgetops and ignite hundreds of hectares by dropping DAIDs. The fire would be allowed to then trickle slowly down the north facing slopes in the evening until it went out overnight with the dew the following morning or ran into a wet gully. But the 1970s were a relatively wet decade so the gullies were damp and full of soggy tree ferns which would stop most burns. Also, there weren't many people in the bush other than loggers and cattlemen so it was possible to do this with minimal risk. However, the crash of a helicopter conducting aerial ignition in autumn 1978 with the death of two forest officers and the pilot profoundly shook the small \\"Fraternity of Foresters\\". It led to better accident insurance for staff involved in air operations and the development of a safer aerial incendiary machine.  Land buyback  The devastating January 1962 bushfires in the left History has shown that after each major bushfire, particularly if there has been a significant loss of life and property, there are loud calls from affected communities and media commentators for State and Local Governments to stop permitting land subdivision, to apply restrictive building standards and buyback high risk homes on the forest fringe. The 2009 Black Saturday Royal Commission was no exception and included a \\"retreat and resettlement strategy\\" as one of its most controversial recommendations. The most notable buyback scheme commenced in the Dandenong Ranges on the outskirts of Melbourne after the 1962 bushfires which killed 33 people and destroyed more than 450 houses. More deadly fires in the same vicinity during the summer of 1968‚Äì69, and also at Lara near Geelong, strengthened the Government's resolve. High fire risk areas such as those on the steep and exposed western face of the Range and also below the prominent TV Transmission Towers on the summit of Mt Corhanwarrabul were identified as the priority for acquisition. Private properties were progressively purchased by the State Government over the next 50 years or so, the houses were demolished or removed and the land incorporated back into the adjoining State forest (now the Dandenong Ranges National Park). William (Bill) Archibald Borthwick was the local Member of State Parliament between 1960 and 1982 and lobbied to sustain momentum, focus and funding throughout his tenure. He was also the Minister for Conservation and then Deputy Premier during the difficult latter stages. The Dandenong Ranges buyback scheme was administered for many decades by local Forests Commission district staff at Kallista together with the Estates Branch in Melbourne. Overall, the scheme was effective, protracted, costly and divisive but not all residents were happy. A large softwood plantation in Olinda State Forest was also burnt in 1962 and after lengthy community consultation local Commission staff and crews began replanting the area in the mid 1970s with exotic non-flammable species such as oaks and elms based on the advice of Nurseries Branch. It was later named the R J Hamer Arboretum on 22 April 1977 after the State Premier who had supported its development and was patron of the \\"Victoria - The Garden State\\" campaign that began in 1977. The arboretum adjoined the 34 hectare Olinda Golf Course and the National Rhododendron Gardens which were also managed by the Commission at the time and collectively they acted as a unique strategic firebreak. The State Government then established the Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority (UYVDRA) in 1976 to develop new planning schemes to assist local shires tackle the fire risk problem along with other environmental issues. As a major land and fire manager, the Forests Commission had a seat on the Board. The impacts of bushfires are only expected to rise as a result of population pressures and housing growth along the interface between forests and rural communities. Also, while the impacts of global warming are not fully known, Victoria is very likely to experience an increased number of days of extreme fire danger. Other land buyback schemes were for reforestation and softwood plantations in the Strzelecki Ranges and the Otways or for conservation purposes.  Changing technology  The 1970s was an era before information technology created the most profound changes on the forestry profession with powerful computers, internet, iPads, smartphones, accurate Global Positioning Systems (GPS), digital maps, plotters, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), live weather data, video conferencing, digital cameras, satellite imagery and Phoenix fire modelling. Basic navigation, surveying and map making were essential skills of a field forester. Large sheets of A0 parchment, a light table, Derwent coloured pencils, Rotering ink pens and a steady hand were needed for mapmaking. Once produced, these hand- made maps were carefully stored in antique wooden map drawers or modern vertiplan cabinets. A pocket stereoscope was needed to interpret pairs of dog- eared black and white aerial photos before Google maps was invented. Mathematics, triangulation and theodolites for accurate surveying or dumpy levels for setting out construction of bridges and culverts in the field. Trees were measured with a variety of instruments such as large callipers, a special diameter tape or basal area wedge for girth and a clinometer or a Biltmore stick for height. A range finder to gauge distance, an aneroid barometer to estimate elevations and follow contour lines or a sextant to obtain accurate latitudes and longitudes before accurate GPS became widely available in May 2000 when selective availability was switched off by the US military. Having a good sense of direction, being able to read a map and use a measuring chain, prismatic compass and dead reckoning were essential skills, as well as a stout pair of walking boots, to somehow navigate through the bush to get back home at the end of a long day. But getting lost was embarrassingly common, particularly in broken or undulating terrain with few roads or tracks, and in the days before GPS walking up to a hilltop or ridgeline to get a better view and reset your bearings was often the most practical solution. There were no mobile phones in the 1970s but simple HF radio sets were fitted to the 4WD vehicle fleet and some bulky handheld portables were available. The technology was primitive and the reception poor unless the user was on a high point somewhere. The radio signal was \\"line-of-sight\\" and bounced between fire towers and relay transmitters across the mountains back to the district offices. Safety became a real concern if someone was injured or stuck in a remote valley somewhere in a radio \\"dead spot\\". Nokia the largest worldwide developer and producer of hand-held mobile phones in the early 1980s, was initially a Finnish forestry company. The warm and wet conditions during the 1970s aided the spread of the notorious soil and water borne fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi, particularly in Victoria's coastal and foothill forests where extensive areas suffered from tree dieback. Widespread surveys and ground breaking scientific research was carried out by FCV scientist Dr Gretna Weste to try and better understand the biology of the pathogen and develop practical methods to control its spread. The fungus was also a major problem in Western Australia's jarrah forests.  Role in rural communities  By the end of the 1970s the Commission employed some 300 foresters plus a further 500 technical and administrative staff and over 1000 works crew spread across country Victoria in 48 districts and 7 divisional offices with a total expenditure of over $32M which was offset by revenue from timber sales of $16M.FCV Annual Report 1969-70 More importantly, there was a growing recognition of the significant social and economic contribution that the Forests Commission staff, and their families, had long made simply by living in small country towns and being part of the fabric of rural society. Along with other professionals such as school teachers, bank managers and police, foresters often volunteered for important community leadership roles in local sporting, social and civic groups such as CFA brigades or service clubs like Rotary. In addition to its permanent workforce, the Commission offered a considerable number of employment opportunities for young people as firefighters during the summer season. And as far as possible purchases of materials and stores were made to support the local economy.FCV Annual Report - 1977  1980s - Structural change  The social concern for the environment and protection of native forests that had burgeoned in the late 1960s and 1970s then moved into mainstream political discourse by the 1980s. Issues and confrontations erupted on many fronts over the protection of flora and fauna, leadbeater's possum, landscape, temperate rainforest, water catchments, old growth and fuel reduction burning. Questions were also being raised over sawmill licensing levels, sustainable yield calculations, forest growth rates (MAI), wood chips and providing certainty to the timber industry as wells as contentious silvicultural techniques such as clearfelling and softwood plantation expansion dominated much of the often polarised forestry debate. To some degree the forestry profession became marginalised in the debate with the common understanding of forestry being eroded to simply mean timber harvesting and sawmilling and not broader forest management or conservation. It was suggested by many that forestry had lost its social licence. The conflicts became increasingly marked, when in 1983, the Australian Conservation Foundation declared its policy that ‚Äòwood production should be transferred from native forests to plantations established outside the current forest estate‚Äô. Meanwhile, buoyed by their success in the Franklin Dam dispute in Tasmania in the early 1980s, groups of environmental activists later took matters into their own hands, particularly in far east Gippsland, to confront timber harvesting and mount a prolonged protest campaign and forest blockades. Meanwhile, the Victorian School of Forestry at Creswick continued to be administered by the Forests Commission until 1980 when it amalgamated with the University of Melbourne. 1980 also saw the graduation of the last group of its three-year diplomates funded by Forests Commission scholarships, bringing the total since the schools inception in 1910 to 522 students. This also marked the end of a steady stream of graduates entering the Commission which was to have significant staffing consequences over the next few decades. leftthumb300x300px Trial of Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS) - 1982. Source: Brian Rees. FCRPA* collection.  MAFFS  The Commission's dedicated core of aviation staff had accumulated considerable expertise at using and managing Victoria's expanding fleet of firefighting aircraft over many decades and once again led the innovation of new aerial firefighting techniques in Australia. During the summer of 1981-82 equipment was borrowed from the United States Forest Service for evaluation under operational conditions in Victoria. The equipment known as \\"Modular Airborne Firefighting System\\" (MAFFS) was trialed bombing bushfires with a slurry of chemical fire retardant in quantities up to per drop. This was much greater than the volume possible with the smaller agricultural aircraft contracted to the Commission at the time. A C-130 Hercules was obtained from the Royal Australian Air Force for the trials. MAFFS was used effectively in the suppression of bushfires at Broadford, Bright and Orbost. It paved the way for modern Large Air Tankers (LAT's) that are now commonly used in Australia each summer. NSCA Bell 205's fitted with firebombing belly tanks hovering over Lake Catani, Mt Buffalo National Park - 1985. Source: Brian Rees. FCRPA* collection. While light helicopters like the Bell 206 Jet Ranger were used for reconnaissance, medium helicopters such as the Bell 204 (the civilian version of the military huey) were routinely used for crew and equipment transport.  Rappelling  In 1982, after nearly 18 years absence, rappelling operations recommenced using specially equipped and trained crews, usually in multiples of 4 or 6 lowered from larger Bell 212 helicopters to attack small fires in remote locations. Rappell crews were also used to construct helipads at larger fires where there was no vehicle tracks so other crews and supplies could be ferried in and out by helicopter.  Medium Helicopters  These medium helicopters could also be fitted with Canadian built belly tanks, which although had a limited water bombing capacity of about 1400 litres, were still very effective in tight mountainous terrain providing close support for ground crews working near the fire edge. Their ability to pick up from small dams, tanks or streams, and make accurate drops, particularly with short turn-around-times made them an invaluable firefighting tool. The introduction of heavy firebombing helicopters like the Erickson S-64 Skycrane (Elvis) that could lift and carry 9500 litres of water didn't occur until much later in 1997. Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR) cameras mounted on light helicopters became available and proved very useful at identifying smouldering hot spots through thick smoke and to direct ground crews during the mop up phase. Another development previously researched and tested operationally, \\"came of age\\" in the 1984/85 season. An infrared line scanner mounted in a Kingair 200C aircraft was used to monitor the spread of the major fires and the progress of backburning. Scanning was usually done between midnight and 2 am and the imagery made available to the fire controller by 5 am. This enabled firefighting tactics to be developed well before the day shift crews were due to leave base camps. Victorian forest firefighters have rarely ever had such accurate and detailed information available to them at that time of the day.  Ash Wednesday bushfires - 1983  Extensive areas of mountain ash forest around Powelltown were all killed by the fire. This resulted in a massive timber salvage operation - February 1983. Source: Peter McHugh. FCRPA* collection.The Ash Wednesday bushfires occurred in south-eastern Australia on 16 February 1983. Over its twelve-hour rampage, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to caused widespread destruction across Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days since Black Friday in 1939. In Victoria, 47 people died that day, while in South Australia there were a further 28 deaths. Many fatalities occurred because firestorm conditions were caused by a sudden and violent wind change in the evening which rapidly switched the direction and size of the fire front. The speed and ferocity of the flames, aided by abundant fuels and a landscape immersed in smoke, made fire suppression and containment impossible. In many cases, residents fended for themselves as the fires broke communications, cut off escape routes and severed electricity, telephones and water supplies. Up to 8,000 people were evacuated in Victoria at the height of the crisis and a state of disaster was declared for the first time in South Australia's history. Over 16,000 firefighters combatted the blaze, including staff and works crews from the Forests Commission, National Park Service, and volunteers from the Country Fire Authority. Also involved were over 1,000 Victoria Police, 500 Australian Defence Force personnel and hundreds of local residents. A variety of equipment was used, including 400 vehicles (fire- trucks, water tankers and dozers), 11 helicopters and 14 fixed wing aircraft. And just like the 1939 bushfires before it, the Ash Wednesday fires resulted in another government inquiryS.I. Miller, W Carter and R.G. Stephens (1984).Report of the Bushfire Review Committee: On Bushfire Disaster Preparedness and Response in Victoria, Australia following the Ash Wednesday fires 16 February 1983. Melbourne, Australia. and massive timber salvage program across the Central Highlands.  End of an era - 1983  Not long after the Ash Wednesday bushfires, Victoria's long and distinctive use of statutory authorities like the Forests Commission was repudiated by the newly elected John Cain Labor Government seeking to assert control over policy and spending. So in a surprise move, the Forests Commission, along with many others like the MMBW, was replaced by central executive control and a departmental model. The formation of Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (CFL) was announced in mid 1983 and came into legal effect on 2 November 1983 with a short Act of Parliament. The Commission was then merged into a newly created department along with the Crown Lands and Survey Department, National Park Service, Soil Conservation Authority and Fisheries and Wildlife. The last Liberal Government Minister of the Forests Commission was Tom Austin, MLA and the first Labor Minister of CFL was Rod MacKenzie, MLC. However, the appointment of a British academic, Professor Tony Eddison, as the new Director-General of CFL took most by surprise. The new mega Department managed 38% of Victoria's land area with approximately 4500 staff and in its first full financial year of operation, 1984/85, had a budget of $154 million. Just under half of the staff of CFL had come from the Forests Commission. The amalgamation and restructure was a protracted and disruptive process over the next three years. Each of the component parts of the new department had its own challenges in the amalgamation but some foresters and technical staff in particular struggled to make the transition from a powerful, highly regularised and homogenous culture to the new blended organisation. Others saw it as a career opportunity to diversify and were ultimately appointed to many of the senior policy, conservation, operational and regional manager roles in the newly emerging organisation. Significantly, the Forestry Fund which had existed successfully since 1918, was withdrawn and all timber royalties and revenue returned to the State Treasury. The Department then needed to compete with other agencies and rely on annual budget allocations with little ability to save and invest.  Conservation, Forests and Lands (CFL) - 1983 to 1990  The pace of change in forests management accelerated with the new State Government impatient to implement their policies and institutional reform including: * Creating 18 new integrated Conservation, Forests and Lands (CFL) Regions with new overarching legislation. * The establishment of a Board of Inquiry, led by Professor Ian Ferguson, into Victoria's Timber Industry in December 1983. * Timber Industry Strategy (TIS) in 1986 that provided for a new wave of policies including integrated forest planning with unprecedented levels of community consultation, regional sustainable timber yields, a Legislated Code of Forest Practice, Forest Operator Licences and 15 year sawlog licences. * The State Conservation Strategy was released in June 1987, to complement the already-released Economic Strategy and Social Justice Strategy. * Initiating the Silvicultural Systems Project (SSP) to examine alternatives to the controversial practice of clear felling of native forests. Also the new departmental arrangements and resources were severely tested during the summer of 1984/85 when 111 fires started from lightning in just one day. Only some of the people from agencies other than the former Forests Commission had previous firefighting experience. Many of the lightning strikes started in remote, inaccessible mountains where firefighting was difficult, hazardous and time-consuming. They burnt more than 150,000 ha with a perimeter in excess of 1,000 km before they were brought under control. At its peak more than 3,000 people were on fire fronts or support roles including 2,000 from CFL, 500 CFA volunteers, 449 Armed Services personnel, 120 sawmill employees and 50 State Electricity Commission employees. Major equipment used included 75 bulldozers, 400 tankers, 20 helicopters and 16 fixed-wing aircraft.Hodgson A, PRESENTATION to AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION OF RURAL FIRE AUTHORITIES. PERTH 6-9 MAY 1985  1990 - New beginnings  Following the initial turmoil of amalgamation, CFL enjoyed a period of relative stability and consolidation over the next seven years until 1990. But departmental fortunes then became increasingly tied to State political upheavals, firstly coinciding with the appointment of the new Labor Premier, Joan Kirner in August 1990 and then later when Jeff Kennett's Liberal government swept to power in October 1992. This pattern continued over the next three decades with seven more major departmental name changes: # Department of Conservation Forests and Lands (CFL) - 1983, # Department of Conservation and Environment (DCE) - 1990, # Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (CNR) - 1992, # Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) - 1996, # Department of Primary Industries (DPI) - 2002, # Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) - 2002, # Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) - 2012, # Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) - 2014. Moreover, during the period beginning with the formation of CFL in 1983 through to 2018, the Department experienced no less than seven State Premiers (both Liberal and Labor), 15 Government Ministers and 13 Director-Generals / Secretaries all of whom wrought their own changes which added to the instability. In addition to the major changes, there were many more minor internal restructures and each brought disruption, loss of staff morale and reduced productivity. Many were driven by austerity measures and the need to shed staff. At each break in continuity, many experienced staff chose to take redundancy packages, resign or retire which resulted in an accelerated loss of valuable corporate knowledge and memory. Coupled with the cessation of a steady stream of new graduates coming from Creswick and other tertiary institutions from 1980 onwards led to shortages of experience and skills and worrying succession planning problems, particularly finding enough experienced staff to develop sound forest policy and for fire suppression. This loss of corporate memory and reduced depth of practical field experience in combination with high managerial turnover gave many seasoned staff reason for concern for the future. Combined with reduced investment in forest research and science-based decision-making, many also felt their knowledge and skills acquired over many years wasn't recognised or valued.  Significant events and policy initiatives  Some of the significant events and policy changes from 1990 to 2018 include: * Creation of the Victorian Plantations Corporation (VPC) in 1992 to manage all of Victoria's public plantation estate leading to its eventual sale to Hancock Victorian Plantations (HVP). The state retains ownership of the land while HVP owns the rights to harvest the trees. *Expansion of the State Forest road network. Construction of the South Face Road on the Baw Baw ranges * The National Forest Policy Statement signed by all state and federal governments in 1992. * Montr√©al Process on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of forests - 1994. * In 1995 Australia's first Code of Practice for Fire Management on Public Land was ratified by Parliament. * Creation of Parks Victoria (PV) as a separate entity in 1996 and expansion of the National Parks and Reserves system. Winding up Melbourne Parks and Waterways. * The Environment Assessment Council replacing the LCC in 1997 followed by the creation of the Victorian Environmental Assessment Council (VEAC) in its place in 2001. * The passing of Federal ‚ÄòNative Title‚Äô legislation, following earlier landmark judgements by the Australian High Court ‚Äì Mabo in 1992, and Wik in 1996. * Federal Government intervention in forest management and export woodchip licences in 1995 following a blockade by logging trucks of Parliament House in Canberra leading to Regional Forest Agreements. * The Victorian State government's \\"Our Forest Our Future\\" program in 2002 which resulted in a major restructuring of the timber industry, with $80M allocated to buy back 50% of all the sawlog licences. Timber harvesting on State forests stopped in Western Victoria and the Otway's altogether; private plantation companies and the VPC weren't affected. * Creation of VicForests in 2004 to manage the remaining commercial aspects of forestry on State forest. * The tempo, size and severity of bushfire incidents in southern Australia intensified throughout the 1990s and into 2002-03, 2006-07, Black Saturday in 2009 and 2013-14. For example, the 2006-07 Great Divide Complex Fires in Victoria was referred to by some commentators as a \\"mega fire\\" with the campaign lasting for nearly three months and burning over . * The Black Saturday Bushfires in 2009 and subsequent Royal Commission, leading to major changes in the way fires are managed in Victoria with coordination through Emergency Management Victoria EMV. Additional government funding was provided to recruit more staff to deliver an expanded burning program together with money for a fleet of 48 aircraft over summer, new generation firefighting vehicles, as well as upgrades to roads and bridges in parks and State forests. * The escape of a planned burn at Lancefield in 2015 leading to more internal restructuring and formation of Forest, Fire Management (FFM) within DELWP. Responsibilities for managing Victoria's forest and parks estate (nearly one-third of the State is public land) is now split between the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), Parks Victoria, Alpine Resorts Commission, Melbourne Water the State Governments‚Äô commercial entity VicForests and the privately owned Hancock Victorian Plantations. The 100 tumultuous years since the creation of the Forests Commission Victoria in December 1918 and its \\"sad but dignified end\\" in 1983 leave lasting traditions and a legacy for the future of the forestry profession with the next generation. Commissioners Beginning with its inception in 1908 the State Forest Department was headed by a Conservator of Forests then later after the amendments to the Forest Act in December 1918 by a Chairman of a three-person Commission. {  !Chairman !Mandate !Notes - Hugh Robert MacKay81x81px 1908‚Äì1924 The first Conservator of Forests.

Reception In a mixed review, Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"Too long by half, awkward and obvious but not unlikable, the series is a cocktail mixed from stock characters and situations and whatever could be found in the folks' liquor cabinet the weekend they were away. You are free to interpret its allusiveness as intentional homage or as copying off one's neighbor's work. And of course, there is a portion of the hoped-for audience that will not be familiar with the many things that this is like, and a portion that will greet its familiar elements like old beloved friends.\\" In another mixed review, Deciders Lea Palmieri recommended that viewers \\"skip\\" the series saying, \\"It might be hard to place yourself back in a time where the summer before you head off to college was the biggest hurdle in the world, and while it's not a frivolous concern for many, it's not quite enough of a hook to draw you in or make you care about the stakes at play, considering, you know, all the other stuff going on in 2018. In that sense, it is a fun escape viewing that doesn't really run the risk of making you feel overly emotionally attached to anyone or anything taking place.\\" References External links * * Category:2010s American high school television series Category:2010s American teen sitcoms Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:AwesomenessTV Category:Hulu original programming Category:Television series about teenagers ","title":"All Night (TV series)"},{"id":"56545622","text":"The Plant Journal is a peer-reviewed scientific journal of plant science published by Wiley-Blackwell for the Society for Experimental Biology.

Delays in the passage of the bill caused a nine- hour funding gap. The bill is the third in a series that increased spending caps originally imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011; the first two were the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.  Provisions  The bill combined several provisions, including: * It included a continuing resolution (with short title Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018) lasting until March 23, 2018. * Spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 were increased for both defense and nondefense spending, although defense spending was increased more. The defense discretionary funding cap was increased by $80 billion in FY2018 and $85 billion in FY 2019, while the non-defense domestic discretionary spending cap was increased by $63 billion in FY2018 and $68 billion in FY2019. * It included almost $90 billion for hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Florida, and Texas, as well as for the 2017 California wildfires. * It includes an additional four years of authorization for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on top of the six years that was authorized earlier in 2018. * It suspended the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. * It removed 20 year old health care therapy cap related to physical and occupational therapy. * Several tax provisions were included, which would cost $17.4 billion over four years. The endowment tax that had been imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was narrowed slightly to affect only schools with at least 500 tuition-paying students. The bill also creates or extends tax breaks for racehorses; film, television, and live theater productions; advanced nuclear power facilities; whistleblower awards; plug-in electric motorcycles; fuel cell motor vehicles; biodiesel, energy- efficient home construction, and many renewable energy facilities. * It repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) that was part of the Affordable Care Act. * For the 2017 tax year only, several provisions affecting relatively large numbers of individual taxpayers, including the \\"above-the-line\\" deduction for certain post-secondary tuition costs (Form 8917), the exclusion from gross income for discharged mortgage debt for a principal residence (Form 982), and the Schedule A itemized deduction for mortgage insurance premiums were retroactively restored. The IRS updated several 2017 tax forms to reflect these extensions on February 23, 2018; taxpayers affected by the change who filed a return before this date can file an amended return (Form 1040X) to claim these tax adjustments. * The BBA of 2018 reinstated the nonbusiness energy property credit for 2017, and it reinstated the residential energy efficient property credit for qualified small wind energy property costs, qualified geothermal heat pump property costs, and qualified fuel cell property costs to the end of 2021. These had expired in 2016, and the 2017 Form 5695 available prior to the passage the bill had 8 lines of \\"Reserved for Future Use.\\" https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs- pdf/i5695.pdf * It expanded the availability of hardship withdrawals from Section 401(k) retirement plans.

Early life Heller was the eldest of four children. Her mother was Taube Rebecca (n√©e Litwin), and her father was a merchant, Aryeh Leib \\"Leo\\" Broddo (or Braude; died 1928). After matriculating from school in 1906, she studied at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Geneva, Switzerland and began medical studies at Zurich. She obtained her medical degree in Berlin in 1912 and continued her studies in St Petersburg, and went on to practise in Russia for a period of time before returning to Poland. Back in Poland, Heller (a.k.a. Hellerowa) co-founded the W≈Çodzimierz Medem Sanatorium in Miedzeszyn near Warsaw. She moved to Warsaw in 1913, practicing at the Bersohn and Bauman Children's Hospital, originally endowed in 1872 by Mejer Bersohn, for whom the hospital was named. It was located at 60 Sienna/52 ≈öliska Streets. Initially a small facility, it closed in 1924, but later reopened in 1930 as a larger facility with the assistance of the Society of Friends of Children (Polish: Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Dzieci, or TPD), which Heller had co-founded. She was named chief of medicine and a director of the hospital board.Blady Szwajer, Adina. I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance, New York: 1990. Marriage and family In 1916, Anna Braude married Eliezer Heller (1885‚Äì1934), an engineer; the couple had two sons, Ari Leon Heller (1917‚Äì2008), and Olum Heller, nicknamed \\"Olo\\" (1921‚Äì1926). Her husband died of complications of surgery in 1934, aged 49. Heller/Hellerowa's brother, Jossell Abraham Braude, died in 1931. The deaths of her youngest son, her husband, and her brother inspired her to devote her life to medicine. World War II Heller moved into the hospital, now part of Warsaw's Jewish ghetto, at the start of World War II. The hospital was prohibited by the Nazi occupiers from treating non-Jews and all government disbursements and support ceased. The hospital was reduced to seeking funding from Jewish self-help institutions and/or individual donations. The ghetto was quarantined due to a typhus epidemic which lasted from 1939‚Äì40. Conditions were dire in the ghetto, with poor sanitation, disease outbreaks, and violent clashes with guards. Many casualties also resulted from attempts by Jews to smuggle food and other necessities into the ghetto. The hospital's mortality rates were unavoidably high, despite the best efforts of the hospital's staff and workers.Roland, Charles G. Courage Under Siege: Starvation, Disease and Death in the Warsaw Ghetto. New York: 1992. Last years and death In 1942 and 1943, Heller refused to leave the hospital and the children she was trying to care for but did help her surviving son and his family escape the ghetto; they survived the war. Most of the doctors and nurses were sent to concentration camps; only a few (Teodozja Goliborska, Henryk Kroszczor, Rachela Kroszczorowa, and Adina Blady Szwajer) survived. Heller (aged 55) and her sister, Sara Aftergut (aged 54, whose husband and daughter had been murdered in Treblinka), remained in the ghetto and were murdered there on or around 19 April 1943. Legacy After the Holocaust, a plaque commemorating Heller was raised at the Jewish cemetery at Okopowa Street, on the joint tombstone of her husband and younger son. In April 2001, on a wall where the Bersohn and Bauman Children's Hospital had once stood, a similar plaque was unveiled.

It worked by triggering Luftwaffe's FuG 25a Erstling identification friend or foe (IFF) system and then using the response signal to determine the enemy aircraft's direction and range. This allowed RAF interceptors to track the Germans without the need for a radar system of their own, and in contrast to the earlier Serrate radar detector that lacked range information. The resulting rapid ramp-up of night fighter losses in late 1944 alerted the Germans that the RAF was deploying a system to track them, and suspicion immediately fell on the Erstling. Pilots were told to leave their Erstling units turned off until they approached friendly airbases, where it was needed in order for their flak units to avoid firing on them. This resulted in further chaos as crews often forgot to turn them back on, and flak units became increasingly paralyzed as friendly fire incidents mounted.

The distillery was named for a stream which ran along the back of the distillery, the Bishop's Water, said to possess \\"various occult properties derived from the blessings of the sainted Bishop of Ferns\\". Constructed at a cost of ¬£30,000, the distillery was reported to be ‚Äúreckoned the most perfect and complete of the kind in Ireland‚Äù. In 1833, just a few years after it opened, the distillery recorded an output of about 200,000 gallons per annum . However, output had fallen to just 110,000 gallons per annum in 1886, when the distillery was visited by Alfred Barnard, as recorded in his seminal 1887 publication \\"The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom\\". This was amongst the lowest output of any distillery operating in Ireland at the time, and far below the potential output of 250,000 gallons per annum reported when the distillery was offered for sale as a going concern in 1909. The distillery's whiskey, Barnard noted, was highly appreciated locally, and in the British cities where it was exported. In the early 20th century, with the Irish whiskey industry in decline, Bishop's Water distillery, like the majority of distilleries in Ireland at the time, suffered serious financial difficulties, and entered bankruptcy. Following its closure, the distillery was initially converted into an iron works (Pierce Ironworks). However, much of the site was later demolished, and little evidence of the distillery still remains. Some mementos can still be found in locals pubs, while a stone archway known to have been extant in 1903 and now bearing the inscription \\"Casa Rio\\", possibly in reference to the location of a Pierce ironworks office in Buenos Aires, marks the entrance to the site where the distillery once stood, on Distillery Road.  History  An 1830 newspaper article reporting on the accidental death at the distillery In 1827, a whiskey distillery was established on what is now Distillery Road, Wexford by a consortium of businessmen. The consortium which traded under \\"Devereux, Harvey, and Co., Distillers\\", comprised a number of local businessmen, including Nicholas Devereux, his father John Devereux, and Maurice Crosbie Harvey. John Devereux had previously operated a small distillery in the area in the late 1700s, but will little success. In 1830, one of the partners, Maurice Harvey, was accidentally killed at the distillery by an excise man who was taking aim at some birds flying overhead. A few years later, in 1836, the partnership was dissolved at the mutual consent of the remaining partners, with Nicholas Devereux taking sole ownership of the distillery, after which the distillery traded under the name Nicholas Devereux & Son. On his death in 1840, operation of the distillery was taken over by his son Richard. Nichloas Devereux's daughter, Mary Anne Therese was also deeply involving in the distilling industry. She married John Locke, founder of the larger Kilbeggan distillery, and successfully took over the business operations of the distillery on his death in 1868. According to Alfred Barnard, the British journalist who visited Bishop's Water in the 1880s, the distillery produced triple-distilled \\"old pot still whiskey\\", which was sold locally in Ireland, and also exported to London, Liverpool, and Bristol. At the time of his visit, the Malt Warehouses on-site contained over 16,000 barrels of pure malt. In addition, upwards of 3,000 casks of whiskey were undergoing maturation at the distillery. Whiskey from the distillery is also noted to have been used in the production of blended whiskeys in later years. In the early 20th century, the distillery suffered financial difficulties. In 1907, an attempt was made to appoint a receiver, and in 1909, the distillery was put up for sale, but no takers could be found. In 1914, distilling eventually ceased at the site, and the remaining stocks were sold off.

He played college basketball at Washington State University, where he is the school's all-time leader in rebounds and double-doubles. Early life Hawkinson was born in Seattle, Washington, to Nels and Nancy Hawkinson. He has one younger sister Carlyn, and his family lives in Shoreline, Washington. Both of his parents played basketball collegiately; his dad at Trinity Western University and his mom at the University of Washington. Hawkinson grew up to become one of the best players in the Seattle area and attended Shorewood High School in Shoreline. Over his junior and senior seasons, Hawkinson led his team to a 32‚Äì14 record and averaged 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks per game. Hawkinson was very lightly recruited out of high school with no Power 5 conference schools interested in him, besides Washington State. College career Hawkinson began his college career in 2013 for Washington State and played limited minutes in a supporting role as a freshman. He served as a backup to upperclassmen D.J. Shelton and Jordan Railey and went on to average 1.2 points, and 1.6 rebounds in just 6 minutes per game. Following his freshman season, Washington States head coach Ken Bone was fired and replaced by new and current head coach Ernie Kent. Hawkinson thrived under the new head coach Ernie Kent in his sophomore season at Washington State. His minutes per game skyrocketed from 6 to 33, and he became the second most improved scorer in the nation; from 1.2 to 14.7 points per game, and the most improved rebounder in the country; from 1.6 to 10.8 rebounds per game. Hawkinson would go on to lead the league in rebounding and his 334 total rebounds and 20 double-doubles set single season Washington State records in both categories. He led the Pac-12 and NCAA in defensive rebounds per game at 8.7, and earned Pac-12 Most Improved Player of the Year and All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention honors. As a junior, Hawkinson was given Team Captain responsibilities and once again led the league in rebounding and Double-Doubles. He improved both his points per game from 14.7 to 15.4, and rebounds per game from 10.8 to 11.1 and tied his own single-season Washington State record with another 20 Double Doubles. He earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention for the second straight season and was named a Finalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center of the year award. In his senior campaign, Hawkinson retained his team captain status and led his team to a sweep of the Washington Huskies for the first time since the 2010-11 season. Hawkinson went on to average 15.5 points per game and 10.2 rebounds per game earning him All-Pac-12 Second Team honors. Hawkinson would also be selected to the Second Team All-District 20 team by the NABC and was named as a finalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center of the year award for the second straight year. For his outstanding achievements both on and off the court, Hawkinson became the first Washington State player ever to be named a Senior CLASS Award First Team All-American. and followed that up by winning the Tom Hansen Conference Medal; given to the Pac-12's \\"most outstanding senior student-athlete based on the exhibition of the greatest combination of performance and achievement in scholarship, athletics and leadership.\\" Academically, Hawkinson completed his bachelor's degree from Washington State University in just three years, receiving his degree in Management Operations in the summer of 2016 while being a three-time Pac-12 All-Academic honoree. His senior year, Hawkinson finished his Master's of Business Administration in Data Analytics, completing both his Bachelor's and master's degrees in four years and was named the 2017 Pac-12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year. Hawkinson concluded his career tenth in points scored with 1,414 and set school records in double-doubles with 56 and rebounds with 1,015. He became the first Washington State player ever to amass 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds and was the 13th player in Pac-12 history to reach those marks.

Constructed in 1911 by the Empire of Japan, it was the first bridge built across the Yalu River and connected the Chinese city of Dandong with the Korean city of Sinuiju, linking Japanese- ruled Korea to the Eurasian rail network. The bridge originally consisted of twelve truss spans supported by stone foundations in the riverbed. During the Korean War, the eight spans over the Korean side of the river were badly damaged by American bombing, and were subsequently dismantled. The bridge was not rebuilt. Instead, the remaining four spans over the Chinese side of the river were converted to a walkway, a viewing platform, and a historical site.  Location and dimension  The railway bridge is located in Dandong, Liaoning, China, across the Yalu River from Sinuiji, North Korea. It was a steel truss bridge long and wide, with 12 spans. Its fourth span was a swing bridge that could be rotated to allow the passing of tall ships.  History  Aerial photograph taken in November 1950 during air attacks by US bombers. The Broken Bridge is on the left. The bridge was built by the Empire of Japan in 1911, to connect Japanese-ruled Korea with the Eurasian rail network. With its completion, the southern Korean port of Busan became connected by rail all the way to Calais, France. The Japanese began building the bridge in 1909, before the Qing dynasty government of China granted permission for its construction. By April 1910, with the Korean side of the bridge already half completed, Japan applied heavy pressure on the weak Qing government, then in its last throes, to authorize construction on the Chinese side. It was opened in October 1911, the first bridge across the Yalu River. In April 1937, when Northeast China was ruled by the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, Japan built a bigger bridge less than upstream, now known as the Sino‚ÄìKorean Friendship Bridge. During the Korean War, the United States Air Force repeatedly bombed the Yalu River bridges to disrupt the transportation of Chinese troops and supplies into North Korea. On November 8, 1950, the US dispatched more than 100 B-29s to bomb the bridges, and six days later, another 34 bombers attacked and destroyed three spans of the older bridge. The aerial attacks were suspended on December 5 because the Yalu was frozen over and the Chinese could easily cross the river at many points. In February 1951, the US resumed bombing and damaged the bridge except four spans on the Chinese side. From then on it became known as the Broken Bridge.  Heritage and tourism  Close-up view of the disused swing-span rotation mechanism, now viewable from a walkway added in the 1990s Looking onto the bridge from its north end After the end of the Korean War, North Korea dismantled its side of the severely damaged bridge. Four spans on the Chinese side, pockmarked by shrapnel, were left in place and preserved. In 1988, the City of Dandong declared Broken Bridge a municipal heritage site. In 1993, the local government invested 3 million yuan to refurbish the bridge and opened it as a tourist attraction. Visitors can walk on the bridge to the middle of the Yalu River. The end of the Broken Bridge has become a viewing platform for visitors to get a closer look at North Korea. The Broken Bridge is now a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China.

It consists of an irregular newsletter with original reporting and a digest of Stanford-related news. Unlike other publications serving the Stanford community, it is fully independent, taking no money from either the University or the student union. The Fountain Hopper has broken several stories of national importance, including People v. Turner. History The Fountain Hopper was founded in September 2014 by Ilya Mouzykantskii, then a junior at Stanford University majoring in symbolic systems. The publication operated on a shoestring budget of under $5,000 for its first 24 months, and continues to be funded entirely by student donations. Notable reporting In January 2015, The Fountain Hopper broke the Brock Turner story. Three years later, The Fountain Hopper reported that Stanford repeatedly rejected the victim's choice of quotes for a memorial plaque that the university had promised to place at the site of the crime. Later in 2015, The Fountain Hopper initiated a campaign informing Stanford students to of their right to access their admissions files through an obscure provision in FERPA, a federal law governing access to educational records. Over 2,800 Stanford students submitted FERPA requests. Students at colleges around the US filed FERPA requests of their own, leading to universities across the US releasing previously private records relating to college admissions and changing their file retention policies. In March 2015, The Fountain Hopper collaborated with Vice to break the story of a Stanford Medical School student who, over the course of several months, poisoned her classmates with paraformaldehyde. The story garnered significant attention in Singapore, as the accused was an A*Star scholar. In January 2018, FoHo reported on a Stanford admissions officer, Karen Alonzo, who used the official Stanford Instagram account to like her personal photographs. Stanford subsequently removed her name from the list of admissions officers, reassigning her applicant territories to another admissions officer.

Biography  Theodore Fyfe was born on 3 November 1875 in the Philippines, second son of James Sloan Fyfe and Jane Charlotte Abercrombie Fyfe. After the deaths of his parents, Fyfe was brought up by his aunt Jane Sloan Fyfe, and uncle John Alexander Fyfe, in Glasgow. He was educated at The Glasgow Academy. In 1890, he became an apprentice of the architect John James Burnet, then Burnet's assistant after completing his apprenticeship. He took classes at the Glasgow School of Art where he was awarded the Haldane Bursary in 1894. He moved to London in 1897 and studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, then at the British School at Athens. room of the stone bench. In 1899‚Äì1900 he travelled in the Mediterranean region studying classical architecture. During this period, he joined Arthur Evans‚Äôs team as an architect for the excavations at Knossos. On 23 March 1900, the team broke ground at the site of Knossos. Fyfe made a fresco copy of the room of the stone bench. In August, he went back to British School. Later he made a study tour in Bologna, Ferrara and Florence, and a further study tour in Constantinople and Bursa. Fyfe returned to Crete with Evans. In 1902, he described the principles of restoration of the Palace of Minos. Much of his time in 1903 was spent for the reconstruction of Knossos. He worked on both the graphic reconstruction of the rooms and their preservation. The Throne Room, particularly prestigious, underwent several reconstructions before the one done in 1930 in the antique style. From 1904 onwards, Fyfe was working mainly for John James Burnet at the British Museum. He was responsible for the designs of the Shaftesbury Institute, hall and classrooms at Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside, Chester Cathedral, Memorial Chapel at Ashton Hayes and built houses in Cambridge and elsewhere. In 1919, he was appointed architect to the chapter of Chester Cathedral, in 1921, he was lecturer in classical archaeology at Cambridge. From 1922 to 1936, he was Director of the Department of Architecture, University of Cambridge. He revisited Knossos in 1926 and then directed the excavations of a mediaeval church at Glastonbury. He started to travel to Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria and Egypt in 1932, to study ancient architectural remains. The results of studies are presented in his book Hellenistic Architecture: An Introductory Study, published in 1936. He died in a skating accident in 1945.

The aircraft was part of a larger Israeli aerial dispatch which Israel said was sent in response to detection of an Iranian drone spying on Israel. Two hours after the downing of the jet, Israel began attacking additional targets inside Syria, including air defense sites and Iranian targets near Damascus. Israel stated it destroyed the Syrian military‚Äôs main command and control bunker. Iran dismissed the Israeli allegation of Iranian drone incursion into Israeli territory as \\"ridiculous\\" and a pro-Syrian military alliance said that Israel actually hit a drone base which was used in the fight against ISIS. It was the first time Israel and Iran confronted each other directly since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the beginning of the Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict. Israel stated that it was \\"the biggest and most significant attack the air force has conducted against Syrian air defenses since the 1982 Lebanon War\\". Hezbollah said that the downing of the F-16 was the beginning of \\"a new strategic phase\\", as it was the first occasion on which Israel lost a jet to an enemy combatant since 1982.  Timeline  At 4:30am on 10 February 2018, an Israeli AH-64 Apache helicopter shot down an Iranian-produced copy of the RQ-170 drone (Saegheh) near the northern town of Beit Shean.The drone was not destroyed so we could study it , Channel 2 news, 11 Feb 2018Israel: Iranian drone we shot down was based on captured US drone , CNN, 12 Feb 2018 The Iranian drone was sighted taking off from a base in Syria, flew along the Jordanian border, and was intercepted 90 seconds after crossing the Israeli border.Israel Hits Back at Iran and Syria as Border Region Boils , Bloomberg, 10 February 2018IDF reveals UAV launched from Iran-operated Syrian base , YNET, 10 Feb 2018FROM THE EUPHRATES TO BEIT SHE‚ÄôAN: THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC‚ÄôS DANGEROUS GAME , Jerusalem Post, 12 Feb 2018Israel Air Force says seized Iranian drone is a knockoff of US Sentinel, Defense News, 12 Feb 2018 Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai said that the Iranian drone was sent to test if the Israeli air defense systems could detect a stealth drone ‚Äì a test which had failed. In response to the sighting of the drone crossing the Israeli border, 8 F-16s of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) struck Tiyas Military Airbase from which the Israeli military said the drone had launched, very likely with standoff weapons.https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast- africa/2018/02/13/syrian-downing-of-f-16i-begs-question-why-didnt-israel- deploy-f-35s/ This base was attacked by the IAF in the past (March 2017), despite warnings from Russia due to its proximity to Russian military personnel.Ron Ben-Yishai The attack prompted a response from Syrian Air Defense systems, which after firing on the Israeli jets, shot down an Israeli F-16I fighter jet over northern Israel. Two weeks later, Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) stated that the F-16I was hit by a S-200 surface-to-air missile (SAM) with the crew failing to take proper evasive actions. The same statement reported that 13 SAMs had been fired at the 8 F-16Is which took part in the initial attack, with another 14 SAMs fired during the subsequent attack flights, resulting in a total of 27 missiles fired on the attacking jets. The F-16I was flying at high altitude to verify the results of the strike on Syrian targets, which made it easy to track by Syrian air defenses.  Aftermath  Sirens were heard in the early morning in northern Israel and flights at Tel Aviv's international airport were briefly halted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held security consultations following the incident, and Israel conducted several attacks against the Syrian Aerial Defense System and targets which Israel says are Iranian targets in Syria in response to the downing of the F-16. The Wall Street Journal cited Syrian media reporting that 25 people were killed by the Israel airstrikes. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu said \\"They dispatched an Iranian drone from Syrian territory into Israel. ... Israel holds Iran and its Syrian hosts responsible.\\" The Syrian Assistant Foreign Minister, Ayman Sussan said that they \\"have full confidence the aggressor will be greatly surprised, because it thought this war‚Äîthis war of attrition Syria has been exposed to for years‚Äîhad made it incapable of confronting attacks.\\" He said Israel will meet new surprises should they attack Syrian again. In Syria the events were viewed as a game-changer given that it was the first time the Syrian government made good on promises to respond to violation of its territory. The government supporters celebrated the downing of the Israeli jet and hailed the Syrian army and President Bashar Assad. Benjamin Netanyahu presents part of the downed Iranian drone at the Munich Security Conference. At the Munich Security Conference, Netanyahu showed an object that he said was part of the downed drone.  Strategic significance  This incident is extremely unusual, as it is the first time Israel and Iran confronted each other directly since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the beginning of the Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict. Israel stated that it was \\"the biggest and most significant attack the air force has conducted against Syrian air defenses since the 1982 Lebanon War\\". Hezbollah said that the downing of the F-16 is the beginning of \\"a new strategic phase\\", as it was the first occasion on which Israel lost a jet to an enemy combatant, since 1982. Hezbollah suggested that the incident put an end to Israel's long-standing air superiority. An Israeli army assessment stated that the twelve retaliatory air strikes destroyed nearly half of Syria's aerial defense systems. A day earlier, the Israeli military put the number of destroyed aerial defense batteries at three. On 14 February, Haaretz reported that the Israeli strikes only ended after an afternoon phone call between Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu.  Reactions  * Israel: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated \\"Israel wants peace but we will continue to defend ourselves with determination against any attack on us and against any attempt by Iran to entrench itself militarily in Syria or anywhere else.\\" * Syria: The Ministry of Defense stated \\"The Israeli enemy has resumed its aggression against some military positions in the southern region. Our air defenses have been attacked and the aggression has been thwarted\\". * Iran: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted saying \\"Reports of downing an Iranian drone flying over Israel and also Iran's involvement in attacking an Israeli jet are so ridiculous... Iran only provides military advice to Syria.\\" * United States: \\"The Department of Defense did not participate in this military operation... Israel is our closest security partner in the region and we fully support Israel's inherent right to defend itself against threats to its territory and its people.\\" * Russia: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that \\"of particular concern is the danger of escalation of tension within and around de-escalation zones in Syria, the creation of which has become an important factor in reducing violence on Syrian soil. We urge all parties involved to exercise restraint and to avoid any actions that could lead to an even greater complication of the situation. We consider it necessary to unconditionally respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria and other countries of the region. It is absolutely unacceptable to create threats to the lives and security of Russian servicemen who are in Syria at the invitation of its legitimate government to assist in the fight against terrorists.\\" * : Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a response, expressing concern at the developments, but supporting Israel's right to defend itself: \\"We support Israel's right to defend itself against any incursions into its territory. We are concerned at the Iranian actions, which detract from efforts to get a genuine peace process underway. We encourage Russia to use its influence to press the regime and its backers to avoid provocative actions and to support de-escalation in pursuit of a broader political settlement,\\" said Johnson. * Hezbollah: Hezbollah hailed Syria's response to Israel‚Äôs attack on Iranian and Syrian bases in Syria, saying it signals \\"a new strategic phase\\" that puts an end to violation of Syrian territories. * Lebanon: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants condemned \\"the raids on Syria\\" and stressed the right of \\"legitimate self- defense against any Israeli aggression.\\" The statement added that \\"this aggressive policy practiced by Israel threatens stability in the region,\\" calling on \\"the countries concerned to rein in Israel to stop its aggression.\\" * United Nations: Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said he was following closely the alarming military escalation throughout Syria and the dangerous spillover across its borders and called for an immediate and unconditional de- escalation of violence in Syria.

The Fortifications of Fez (also spelled Fes) comprise a complex circuit of ramparts and gates surrounding Fes el-Bali and Fes el-Jdid, two urban agglomerations that compose the old \\"medina\\" of Fes, Morocco. They also include a number of kasbahs (citadels) and forts which were built both to protect and to control the city. These fortifications have been built up over many centuries and the extensive remnants today date from many different periods.  Role of the city walls  As with other pre-modern city walls, the ramparts of Fes served both a defensive and a controlling function. They protected the city from attack and kept out strangers. City gates were typically closed and locked at night; travelers would not generally have been able to enter the city at a late hour. The walls and gates also controlled the comings and goings of the city's own inhabitants, preventing anyone from leaving if the authorities desired. One of their most important functions in controlling access was to control the flow of goods and to ensure they were properly taxed. This ensured the efficient collection of revenues on behalf of the authorities (keeping in mind that all the important souqs (markets) were within the city). Finally, a more subtle or symbolic function of the city walls was to formally define the borders of the urban space, within which certain rules, principles, or regulations might apply. With the advent of gunpowder, the medieval walls became partly redundant as military defenses against other armies; however they remained essentially unchanged in the following centuries and were not rebuilt or redesigned to protect against artillery. This is partly because Fes was a central inland city and rarely faced external threats from armies equipped with such weapons, unlike the Atlantic coastal cities of Morocco which were frequently threatened or occupied by Portuguese and Spanish forces. Only on one occasion was Fes taken by a foreign army: the Ottomans, with the help of a Wattasid dynasty survivor, occupied it in 1554 for less than a year before the Moroccan Saadians took it back. The Saadians later built the only fortresses in Fes designed to resist gunpowder technology, and even these seem to have been intended more to impose Saadian control on the often rebellious city. By contrast, local Bedouin or other potential raiders from the countryside were rarely equipped with artillery, so the existing walls were sufficient to defend against them. The walls continued to play their more administrative functions. The city gates accordingly came to be seen as more formal and decorative in purpose, sometimes serving as monumental entries to the city; the 20th-century construction of the strictly ornamental gate of Bab Bou Jeloud by the French colonial administration can be seen as the logical outcome of this shift in purpose.  Constructions methods and maintenance  General example of rammed earth (pis√©) wall being built (with metal instead of wooden scaffolding). pis√© wall near Bab Guissa, in Fes el-Bali. The walls of F√®s, like those of Marrakesh and most historic cities in Morocco, were generally built in rammed earth, an ancient building technique found across the Near East, Africa, and beyond.\\"Pis√©\\", in The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 5th edition (1998). p.439 It is also known as \\"pis√©\\" (from French) or \\"tabia\\" (from Arabic). It generally made use of local materials and was widely used thanks to its low cost and relative efficiency. This material consisted of mud and soil of varying consistency (everything from smooth clay to rocky soil) usually mixed with other materials such as straw or lime to aid adhesion. The addition of lime also made the walls harder and more resistant overall, although this varied locally as some areas had soil which hardened well on its own while others did not. (For example, the walls of Fes and nearby Meknes contain up to 47% lime versus around 17% in Marrakesh and 12% in Rabat.) The technique is still in use today, though the composition and ratio of these materials has continued to change over time as some materials (like clay) have become relatively more costly than others (like gravel). The walls were built from bottom to top one level at a time. Workers pressed and packed in the materials into sections ranging from 50 and 70 cm in length that were each held together temporarily by wooden boards. Once the material was settled, the wooden restraints could be removed and the process was repeated on top of the previously completed level. This process of initial wooden scaffolding often leaves traces in the form of multiple rows of little holes visible across the face of the walls. In many cases walls were covered with a coating of lime, stucco, or other material to give them a smooth surface and to better protect the main structure. This type of construction required consistent maintenance and upkeep, as the materials are relatively permeable and are more easily eroded by rain over time; in parts of Morocco, (especially near the Sahara) kasbahs and other structures made with a less durable composition (typically lacking lime) can begin to crumble apart in less than a couple of decades after they've been abandoned. As such, old structures of this type remain intact only insofar as they are continuously restored; some stretches of wall today appear brand new due to regular maintenance, while others are crumbling.  Historical evolution of the city walls   Early history of Fes: dual cities  The exact details of the foundation of Fes are debated by modern scholars, based on sometimes conflicting historical sources. Though the dates vary slightly, all accounts agree that Idris I founded the first urban settlement, Madinat Fas, on the eastern shore of the Oued Fes (Fes River; now also called Oued Bou Khareb) while his son Idris II founded a second settlement, al-'Aliya, on the western shore. Historical sources agree that these two early cities had their own walls, their own separate mosques and institutions, and were often rivals. This urban center nonetheless served as the Idrisid capital and remained one of the main cities of Morocco even after the decline of the Idrisids.center  Almoravid and Almohad era: the unification of the two cities  left Bab Mahrouk, the Almohad-era western gate of the city. In 1069, the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashin ordered the walls of the two cities to be demolished and for a new wall to be built around both cities, thus unifying them for the first time. Although the Almoravids made their capital at Marrakech, Fes was one of their most important cities. They constructed a fortified kasbah (citadel) in the eastern end of the city, likely on the same site as the later Kasbah Bou Jeloud. In 1145 the Almohad leader Abd al-Mu'min besieged and conquered the city during the Almohad overthrow of the Almoravids. Due to the ferocious resistance they encountered from the local population, the Almohads demolished the city's fortifications. However, due to Fes's continuing economic and military importance, the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur ordered the reconstruction of the ramparts. The walls were completed by his successor Muhammad al-Nasir in 1204, giving them their definitive shape and establishing the perimeter of Fes el-Bali to this day. (Although according to another author, the reconstruction of the walls was ordered by Muhammad al-Nasir in 1212, following his defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in Spain.) Many of the main gates of the city were built around this time. Since the city had grown in the meantime, the new Almohad perimeter of walls was larger than that of the former Almoravid ramparts. Like other Moroccan ramparts, it was built in rammed earth with stone foundations, and was reinforced with rectangular towers. The Almohads also built the Kasbah Bou Jeloud on the site of the former Almoravid kasbah in the western end of the city (just west of Bab Bou Jeloud today), and also built the initial kasbah occupying the site of the current Kasbah an-Nouar. Not all the land within the city walls was densely inhabited; much of it was still relatively open and was occupied by crops and gardens used by the inhabitants. Today, the northern sections of Fes el-Bali's city walls are believed to be the oldest remaining parts of the walls of Fes and are thought to date all the way back to this Almohad period. The fortified city gates of Bab Mahrouk and Bab Guissa also retain their forms from the Almohad period.The walls of Fes under the center  Marinid era: the creation of Fes el-Jdid  Marinid remparts on the northern side of Fes el-Jdid. Bab Dekkakin, originally the main northern entrance to Fes el-Jdid. The main structure dates from the Marinid period but the gate was modified and redecorated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1248, Fes was in turn conquered by the Marinids under Abu Yahya, expelling the Almohads. In 1250, however, while the sultan was out on campaign, the inhabitants of Fes rebelled and the city had to be reconquered after a 9-month siege. Perhaps due to this recurring streak of rebellion and resistance, the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub decided, in 1276, to build an entirely new royal city to the west of the old city, on higher ground overlooking it. This became known as Fes el-Jdid (\\"New Fes\\"), and included the royal palace of the sultans (Dar al-Makhzen), the administrative quarters of the state, and the headquarters of the army. Fes el-Jdid had its own set of fortified walls and gates. Its northern entrance, at the beginning of the road to Meknes, consisted of a fortified bridge (now the Old Mechouar) over the Oued Fes. This bridge was set between two gates: Bab es-Sebaa (the current Bab Dekkakin) and Bab el-Qantara (or Bab el-Oued; now replaced by the gate of the Dar al-Makhzen). The southern gate of the city, Bab 'Oyun Sanhaja (later Bab Semmarine), and the western gate, Bab Agdal, all shared a similar defensive layout with Bab es-Sebaa by having a bent entrance and flanking towers. Inside, the city was further subdivided into different districts, some of which, including the Dar al-Makhzen, had walls and gates separating them from the others. Another district, initially known as Hims and later converted into the Jewish Mellah, was also added to the south of Bab Semmarine, between the city's inner and outer walls on this side. Most of Fes el-Jdid's outer perimeter was protected by a set of double walls; a tall inner wall with heavy square towers at regular intervals and a smaller outer wall with minor towers. Today, an original section of these walls has been well-preserved between the Lalla Mina and Agdal Gardens, inside the perimeter of the Dar al-Makhzen. On the city's north side, the smaller outer wall appears to have actually extended outwards from the city in order to enclose the vast Mosara Garden, a royal pleasure garden created by the Marinids in 1287, nearly as large as the city itself. The raised aqueduct which provided water to this garden ran between Bab Dekkakin and the gate of Bab Segma to the north (composed of two massive octagonal towers still seen today), and was later incorporated into the much more recent walls of the New Mechouar. The eastern perimeter of Fes el-Jdid, facing Fes el-Bali, was more heavily fortified: both the inner and outer walls were equally massive, and between them ran a long military corridor for troop movements. The extra fortification on this side has been interpreted has an indication that the royal city's defenses were as much about protecting the regime from the restive inhabitants of old Fes as they were aimed at warding off external invaders. Nonetheless, the Marinids did also restore and repair the walls of Fes el-Bali, in addition to devoting their attention to the construction of prestigious madrasas and other embellishments in the old city. The heyday of the Marinids thus translated also into a golden age for Fes as well. Today, Fes el-Jdid's walls and gates still date to a large extent from the Marinid period, generally from Abu Yusuf Ya'qub's initial construction. However, some sections have been expanded over the years, with those of the Dar al-Makhzen, in particular, being extended multiple times to accommodate new gardens and extensions of the palace.center  Saadian era: controlling Fes  The fortress of Borj Nord, on the northern hills overlooking Fes el-Bali. Following the decline of the Marinids and their Wattasid successors, Fes in turn entered a period of relative darkness. The Saadian sultan Muhammad ash-Sheikh besieged and conquered Fes in 1549, after strong resistance. In 1554-55 a surviving member of the Wattasid dynasty reestablished control over Fes and the Saadians wee forced to once again besiege and reconquer Fes right away. Upon retaking the city, the Saadian authorities took revenge upon some of the local leaders and treated the general population poorly, further enshrining the inhabitants' hostility to the new dynasty. Presumably as a result of this persisting tension, the Saadians built a number of new forts and bastions around the city which appear to be aimed at keeping control over the local population. They were all located on higher ground overlooking Fes el-Bali, from which they would have been easily able to bombard the city with canons. These include the Kasbah Tamdert, just inside the city walls near Bab Ftouh, and the forts of Borj Nord (Borj al-Shamali) on the hills to the north, Borj Sud (Borj al-Janoub) on the hills to the south, and the Borj Sheikh Ahmed to the west, at a point in Fes el-Jdid's walls that was closest to Fes el-Bali. These were built in the late 16th century, mostly by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur. Two other bastions, Borj Twil and Borj Sidi Bou Nafa', were also built along Fes el-Jdid's walls south of Borj Sheikh Ahmed. The Borj Nord, Borj Sud, and these bastions (sometimes referred to as the bastioun in Arabic) of Fes el-Jdid are the only fortifications in Fes to demonstrate clear European (most likely Portuguese) influence in their design, updated to serve as defenses in the age of gunpowder. Some of them may have been built with the help of Christian European prisoners of war from the Saadians' victory over Portuguese at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578.center  Alaouite era: linking Fes el-Jdid with Fes el-Bali  The entrance of the Kasbah Cherarda today. The founder of the Alaouite dynasty, Moulay Rashid, took Fes in 1666 and made it his capital. He set about restoring the city after a long period of neglect. He built the Kasbah Cherarda (also known as the Kasbah al-Khemis) to the north of Fes el- Jdid and of the Royal Palace in order to house a large part of his tribal troops. He also restored or rebuilt what became known as the Kasbah an-Nouar, which became the living quarters of his followers from the Tafilalt region (the Alaouite dynasty's ancestral home). For this reason, the kasbah was also known as the Kasbah Filala (\\"Kasbah of the people from Tafilalt\\"). After Moulay Rashid's death Fes underwent another dark period, but from the reign of Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah onward it regained its power and prestige. The Alaouites continued to rebuild or restore various monuments, as well as to expand the grounds of the Royal Palace a number of times (generally westward). The final and most significant change to Fes's topography was made during the reign of Moulay Hasan I (1873-1894), who finally connected Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali by building a walled corridor between them. Within this new corridor, between the two cities, lay new gardens and summer palaces used by the royals and the capital's high society, such as the Jnan Sbil Gardens. The outline of Fes el-Jdid (and of the Royal Palace inside it) was also altered many times in this period. In the 19th century, the creation of the vast Agdal Gardens to the west and the addition of the Bab Bou Jat Mechouar and the New Mechouar to the north all extended the perimeter of city and required the diversion of the Oued Fes river further north as well.Alaouite-era additions (outlined in red). Moulay Rachid added the Kasbah Cherarda north of Fes el-Jdid, while Hassan I finally linked Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali with walls in the late 19th century. The area of the Royal Palace was also extended to enclose vast gardens to the west.alt=center  Major structures   Kasbahs and forts  A number of fortresses and fortified enclosures were built across the city over many eras. The term \\"kasbah\\" () was used to denote a large number of fortified enclosures ranging from small garrison forts to larger citadels, many of them named after the ethnic or geographic origin of the soldiers posted there. The term borj (), generally meaning \\"tower\\", was applied to a number of heavily fortified military structures and bastions, especially those of the Saadian era. The following includes a list of the most important structures of either kind: * Kasbah Bou Jeloud: This kasbah is no longer fortified today, but preserves its footprint in the layout of the area, which includes the Almohad-era Bou Jeloud Mosque. It was once the citadel of the Almoravids and then the Almohad authorities, and continued to be used as the governor's residence even up to the 20th century. * Kasbah an-Nouar: Also known as Kasbah Filala, it dates from the Almohad and Alaouite periods. * Kasbah Cherarda: Also known as Kasbah al-Khemis, it dates from the Alaouite period. * Kasbah Tamdert: Near Bab Ftouh gate in the southeast, it dates from the Saadian period. * Borj Nord: This Saadian fort bears the clearest signs of European influence in its structure, and stands on the hills north of the city, near the Marinid Tombs. Today it houses an Arms Museum. * Borj Sud: The \\"sister\\" of Borj Nord, it stands on the hills overlooking Fes el-Bali from the south. * Bastions of Fes el-Jdid: These three massive towers were built by the Saadians along the eastern and southeastern corners of Fes el-Jdid's walls. **Borj Sheikh Ahmed: The northernmost and easternmost bastion, this one was built at the corner of the walls closest to Fes el-Bali. Today it can also be prominently seen overlooking the southern edge of the Jnan Sbil Gardens. ** Borj Twil: The southeastern bastion, located between the other two. ** Borj Sidi Bou Nafa': The southernmost bastion, located on the south side of what used to be the gate of Bab Jiaf (also known as Bab Sidi Bou Nafa; now occupied by a main road).

The major gates of Fes el-Bali include the following: * Bab Mahrouk: The main northwestern gate, off Place Bou Jeloud, dating from the Almohad era. * Bab Guissa: The main northwestern gate, dating from the Almohad era. * Bab Ftouh: The main southwestern gate, originally Almohad but since rebuilt in the Alaouite period. * Bab Bou Jeloud: A formerly minor gate in Fes el-Bali's western entrance, but rebuilt as a monumental ornamental gate in 1913 by the new French administration. The major gates of Fes el-Jdid include the following: * Bab Semmarine: The main entrance to Fes el-Jdid's \\"Grande Rue\\" and the historically muslim and christian districts of the city. * Bab al-Amer: The western gate of Fes el-Jdid, leading the historic Jewish mellah. * Bab Dekkakin: The monumental gate between the Old Mechouar and New Mechouar at the entrance to the Dar al-Makhzen (Royal Palace).

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1920 to 1928. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017.  History  Buranda State School, established in 1918, is located in the suburb of Woolloongabba, approximately three kilometres southwest of the Brisbane CBD. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. It retains its suburban timber school building (1920, 1928) with WWII honour boards (1944, post-1945); set in landscaped grounds with a swimming pool, dressing shed and terraces (1926); sports oval; retaining walls (1926‚Äì36); and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with the Buranda-Stone's Corner-Woolloongabba community. Traditionally the lands of the Turrbal and Jagera people, suburban development around the Buranda State School site began in the 1880s. The nearby Stone's Corner Hotel opened in the late 1880s and by the 1890s industries were established in the area. The Cleveland railway line ran to the north of the future school site from 1889 and from 1897 electric trams operated along Logan Road to Stones Corner. By 1908 the population had grown sufficiently for the Department of Public Instruction to commence planning a school to serve the district.Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Cultural Heritage Database and Register, , accessed 3 Mar 2017Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM), Survey Plan 11960Brisbane Tramway Museum. \\"History of Electric Tramways in Brisbane\\" < http://www.brisbanetramwaymuseum.org/morwoodtrams.php >, accessed 3 Mar 2017Centre for the Government of Queensland, The University of Queensland, Australia. \\"Buranda\\", , accessed 11 January 2016Merle D Grinly, Stone of Stone's Corner.

The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of new communities and integral to their success. Schools became a community focus, with the school community contributing to maintenance and development; a symbol of progress; and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.84, 120-1. Buranda State School was established as a separate Girls and Infants School (1918) and a Boys School (1920) to provide primary school education for the growing population in the locality of Logan Road. Its site, formed from Crown land, purchased land, and a South Brisbane City Council quarry, was proclaimed as a school reserve in 1916. The timber Girls and Infants School building occupied high ground at the northwest of the site, and was accessed via Martin Street. The school's name was taken from the nearby Buranda railway station. Establishment of the school was intended to relieve the enrolment pressure on East Brisbane, Dunellan (later Greenslopes), Junction Park and Dutton Park state schools.Betty Barron, Buranda SS 1918-1993: 75th Anniversary, Buranda SS, Buranda, 1993, pp. 7, 8QSA Item ID2032969, 'Brisbane Regional Reserve for State School Buranda R1087';Subdivisions 11, 13 to 25 of Section 3 of Portion 173, also Portions 225 and 246, parish of South Brisbane, County of Stanley: see: DNRM, Survey Plan B.3.613Government Gazette 1916, vol. 2, p. 1545'New School at Buranda', The Brisbane Courier, 23 Feb 1918, p. 4Centre for the Government of Queensland, The University of Queensland, Australia. \\"Buranda\\", , accessed 11 January 2016.

The Buranda Boys School opened on 27 September 1920 with an enrolment of 173 pupils. Its suburban timber school building (Block A), positioned in the lower southwestern portion of the site and accessed via Cowley Street, was a high- set, timber building with a continuous north verandah, and central, projecting teachers rooms. The building comprised a central wing with two side wings, each with a Dutch gable roof of shingle tiles and central fleche. It seated 320 boys in eight classrooms. The central wing was divided into four classrooms and each side wing into two similar-sized rooms separated by fixed glazed partitions. The undercroft was utilised for play space and lavatories.Suburban Timber School Building Type C/T8Department of Public Works, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1920, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1920, p. 4Memorandum, Deputy Govt Architect, 22 Sep 1919 cited by Barron, Buranda SS, p. 8. This building type, introduced in 1914, was the culmination of years of experimentation that solved many of the problems of light, ventilation, and classroom size, which had plagued previous school designs, as well as providing the ideal, modern education environment.Building Type: C/T8. Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.21. From 1893 the Department of Public Works greatly improved the natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors, experimenting with different combinations of roof ventilators, ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. In high-set timber buildings had been introduced, providing better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play area underneath. This was a noticeable new direction and this form became a characteristic of Queensland schools.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.19-20. Prior to the widespread adoption of electricity and artificial lighting, achieving an ideal or even adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, was of critical importance to educators and consequently it became central to the design and layout of all school buildings. From around 1909 windows were rearranged and enlarged to provide a greater amount of gentle, southern light into the room and desks were rearranged so that the light would fall onto students' left hand sides to avoid throwing shadows onto the pages; this presupposed that all students were right-handed. Windows were larger and sills were lowered to let in more light generally. Smaller classrooms were preferred as they were easier to light correctly. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. These features - large banks of south-facing windows and smaller classrooms - are retained at Buranda State School. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Alexander Boyd was critical of tropical schools and his recommendations stressed the importance of the adding shade trees to playgrounds. Subsequently, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 4, 48-9. Arbor Day celebrations at Buranda State School commenced in 1918 and were conducted up to at least the late 1950s. By 1958 there were 63 planted trees alive in the school grounds.'Arbor Day at Buranda', Daily Standard, 24 Aug 1918, p. 2'Girls' School Sports', Courier-Mail, 4 May 1936, p. 16QSA Item ID 14035: letter from S.N.

Buranda State School's Committee undertook an active programme of fund-raising events to improve the school's facilities. This included an annual combined schools' fete, fancy dress balls, socials, euchre parties and excursions. One major outcome of its efforts was the school swimming pool with dressing shed, goldfish pond and landscaping, completed for and opened debt-free. At its opening during a school fete on 30 October 1926, Alderman Lawry acknowledged that the baths were \\"a splendid record of voluntary work, teachers, parents and pupils all assisting in the hard work of clearing and excavating the ground....[while] the Public Works Department...suppl[ied] the materials\\".'Swimming.

When opening the pool, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, William Jolly, stated \\"Not only was it a perfect pool but the terraced lawns, flower beds, goldfish pond, and dressing shed created an environment which could not fail to inculcate a love of the beautiful in the children\\". The establishment of swimming pools in Queensland state schools was a growing trend in the early decades of the 20th century. The perceived benefits of learning to swim for pupils were expounded from 1915 onwards: as a particularly appropriate physical exercise during summer; of value to children's physiques; and for water safety reasons to prevent drownings.'Wooloowin State School', Brisbane Courier, 8 Oct 1915, p. 10'School Swimming Pool', The Telegraph, 25 Sep 1916, p. 10: \\"Swimming\\", The Telegraph, 11 Dec 1922, p. 3'Buranda Baths', Daily Standard, 1 Jul 1924, p. 1'Swimming Buranda School Pool Official Opening', Sunday Mail, 31 Oct 1926, p. 9: \\"Buranda State School Fete for Swimming Pool\\", The Telegraph, 31 Oct 1927, p. 4.

Growth in pupil numbers at both Buranda schools resulted in extensions in 1928. The Boys School gained a two-storey addition to accommodate 80 pupils, which was approved in April 1928, with a cost of . A school fete on 22 September 1928 celebrated its completion. This extension comprised two classrooms on each floor and the upper-level rooms had folding partitions for assembly room purposes. Circa 1940, the area under the west wing was enclosed as a music and art room. Enrolments reached a peak with an average attendance of 1217 in 1934, leading to the opening of a separate Infants' School, fronting Salisbury Street, on 30 January 1934, with 225 pupils.'School Improvements, Yeronga and Buranda', The Telegraph, 20 Apr 1928, p. 9Department of Public Works, Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1920, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1920, p. 7photograph, Barron, Buranda SS, p. 12'Buranda SS Committee Report for the Period Ending 31 December 1934' cited by Barron, Buranda SS, p. 118:ePlan, Drawing 16095079, 1939. Meanwhile, the school committee continued to work to improve the schools. Between 1926 and 1929 they erected a shelter shed at the lower tennis courts, improved drainage on the site, formed lawns and improved flower beds, and built a concrete retaining wall and steps near the oval (-29). This is the retaining wall running north of the eastern wing of the Block A, which appears in aerial photography available from 1936. The sports oval and parade ground were completed by December 1934. A driveway, rockeries and flower beds for the Boys School Entrance, via Cowley Street, were completed by 1934. A remnant of this is the low retaining wall in the south- western corner of the site near the Cowley Street entrance, apparent on aerial photograph from 1936. Rows of fig trees near the Martin Street entrance appear on aerial photography from 1936.'Buranda SS Committee Report for the Three Years Ending March 1929' cited by Barron, Buranda SS, p. 118'Buranda SS Committee Report for the Three Years Ending March 1929' cited by Barron, Buranda SS, p. 123'Buranda State Schools Committee', The Brisbane Courier, 19 Feb 1930, p. 13DNRM, aerial, ADA9-6146, 1936DNRM, aerials: ADA9-6146, 1936DNRM, BCC2-34654,1946BCC5-39399, 1951QAP732-8, 1958QAP1043-15, 1960QAP1590-7395, 1964QAP1880-220, 1969QAP2757-73, 1974QAP3090-173, 1980QAP5484-142, 1997. World War II affected Buranda State School in similar ways to other Queensland state school. In January 1942 due to the fear of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools. At Buranda State School about of these trenches were dug.Ronald Wood, Civil Defence in Queensland During World War II, Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol 15, 1993, p. 79'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p. 3SLQ Photograph 42866Barron, Buranda SS, p. 18. Typically, schools were a focus for civilian duty during wartime. At many, students and staff members grew produce and flowers for donation to local hospitals and organised fundraising and the donation of useful items to Australian soldiers on active service.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 60-62. Students at Buranda State School attended War Funds concerts at the Brisbane City Hall; contributed to Red Cross Appeals and a Prisoner of War Fund; and purchased war savings certificates.'At Concert', The Courier-Mail, 10 May 1940, p. 13'War Funds.

In recognition of former students of the school serving in the armed forces during World War II, the school community organised an honour board, which was funded by a swimming carnival held in March 1944. Unveiled on 25 July 1944 by James Larcombe, Minister for Public Instruction, the Honour Board displayed the names of 456 former pupils serving in the armed forces. The large timber board, measuring , has been mounted in the easternmost wall of the eastern understorey classroom since at least 1993.Barron, Buranda SS, p. 92. A second, smaller honour board, beside the large honour board, lists a further 14 former pupils who served during WWII. Children reading in the library, circa 1950 After World War II, enrolments at the Buranda Schools fell from the 1930s' peak. Total enrolments in 1959 were 798. Pupil numbers continued to fall due to developmental and demographic changes in the school's catchment area. Families moved from inner city to outlying suburbs in this period; a large number of houses in the Thompson Estate to the west of the school were resumed for the construction of the Southeast Suburbs Freeway (1967‚Äì75); and residential areas underwent commercial development.Patrick Francis Laurence Mullins, 'The Struggle Against Brisbane's Freeways, 1966-1974: An Australian Case Study of Urban Development, Residential Life and Urban Politics', University of Queensland doctoral thesis, 1979, pp. 260, 299, 301Centre for the Government of Queensland, The University of Queensland, Australia. \\"Buranda\\", , accessed 11 Jan 2016Helen Wyatt cited by Barron, Buranda SS, p. 30.

Falling student numbers led to the combining of the Girls and Infants Schools, on the Girls School site in Martin Street, from January 1963 when the Buranda Infants School site was taken over by Narbethong School for the Visually Handicapped.Heather Grainger, ed., Narbethong State Special School, 1963-2013, Narbethong State Special School, Buranda, Queensland, 2013, pp. 7, 9. Buranda Girls and Infants School and Buranda Boys School were combined as Buranda State School on the Boys School site from 1 January 1967. Average attendance in 1967 was 314 pupils, but fell to 50 in the 1990s.Barron, Buranda SS, p. 9Centre for the Government of Queensland, The University of Queensland, Australia. \\"Buranda\\", , accessed February 2017. Buranda Opportunity School (later Buranda Special School) was established on the Girls School site.Grainger, Narbethong, p. 9. Sometime between July 1974 and July 1979, the original Infants School building was demolished to make way for a new building for Narbethong School, which was opened in July 1979.Grainger, Narbethong, p. 14. The Girls School building has also been demolished. Alterations to the suburban timber school building have taken place over time. Changes include enclosure of part of the east verandah of the eastern wing for a storeroom in 1980; and enclosure of the north verandah of the eastern wing, with demolition of its verandah wall and internal partitions to create larger classrooms.Project Services, Buranda State School' in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp. 5, 6. In 1999 changes to classroom sizes in the central wing were made through removal of dividing walls.ePlan Drawing No 16974287, \\"Buranda SS: Building better schools: classroom upgrade: Block A: first floor plan\\". In 2017 the suburban timber school building is largely used for staff and office purposes. Community involvement in Buranda State School has been continuous since its establishment. Annual combined schools' fetes were held from the 1920s to 1939, and recommenced in the post-war period. Other fundraising and social events were popular in the pre-war period such as fancy dress balls, \\"socials\\", euchre parties and excursions. The school's 75th anniversary was commemorated with the publication of a school history and the holding of a school reunion. In 2017, Buranda State School continues to operate from its original site. It retains its suburban timber school building, swimming pool and dressing shed, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, playing areas, retaining walls and mature shade trees. Buranda State School is important to its district as a key social focus for the community. Generations of students have been taught there and many social events held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment.  Description  Site map, 2017 Buranda State School occupies a site in Buranda, a locality within the suburb of Woolloongabba, approximately three kilometres southwest of Brisbane CBD. The site is bounded by Cowley Street, Norman Creek and the Eastern Busway (south), Martin Street (northwest), Salisbury Street (northeast), Churchill Street (east), and light industrial and residential properties (west, north and east). The school shares its site with Narbethong State Special School, which is located at the northeast end of the site and is excluded from the heritage register boundary. Buranda State School's significant buildings are located on a plateau in the southwestern corner of the site, edged by steep rocky cliffs along the western and northern sides. Access is via a main entrance from Cowley Street and a secondary entrance from Martin Street. Pedestrian access from the south is provided via a footbridge over Norman Creek. Situated adjacent to the Cowley Street entrance is the earliest remaining building - a suburban timber school building (Block A; 1920, with 1928 extension). An early swimming pool, dressing shed and concrete terraces (1926) are located south of the eastern end of Block A. Other significant elements within the school grounds include a concrete retaining wall and stairs (1928-9), a stone retaining wall on two sides of the swimming pool (1926-7), World War II (WWII) Honour Boards in Block A (1944 and post-WWII), rock-edged gardens beds and walls (-1936), and mature trees.  Suburban timber school building (Block A)  The suburban timber school building (Block A) is a highset, timber-framed and weatherboard-clad structure. Orientated on an east‚Äìwest axis, it comprises three, symmetrically-arranged wings - central, eastern and western - with two adjacent teachers rooms on the northern side of the central wing. The eastern wing is longer due to a two- storey extension (1928) to the eastern end, which has its first floor aligned with the 1920 building and the ground floor set at a lower level than the understorey. The three wings have Dutch gable roofs and the teachers rooms has a gable roof. All roofs are clad in corrugated metal sheeting and the gablets are infilled with weatherboards. The north-facing wall of the teachers rooms has batten infill to the gable and two timber-framed, skillion-roofed window hoods which retain original asbestos tile cladding. Ground floor windows along the southern side of the 1928 extension are sheltered by wide timber-framed, skillion-roofed window hoods clad in corrugated metal sheeting. The building's raked eaves have exposed rafters and are lined with tongue-and-groove (T&G;), V-jointed (VJ) timber boards. The building is set on brick piers and stumps, and a north-facing verandah, accessed by sets of timber stairs, provides circulation for the whole building. Non-significant elements of the exterior include: steel roofs over the eastern wing verandah stairs; roof-mounted solar panels; modern awnings to enclosed verandah windows; a deck area and ramp constructed on the southern side of the 1928 extension; airconditoning units; modern security screens to windows; and modern pipes and service conduits. The verandah has a raked ceiling lined in T&G;, VJ timber boards; sections of surviving two-rail slat balustrade (other sections have been replaced by bag racks); and square timber posts that are linked by curved timber arches. All verandah walls are single-skin, with T&G;, VJ timber board linings and externally-exposed stud-framing; with hat hooks attached to some walls. Non- significant elements of the verandah include: recent enclosures at the far eastern and western ends of the verandah; a store room adjacent to the west wall of the eastern wing; a replacement staircase and lift attached to the north verandah of the western wing; and a staircase inserted within the verandah space at the eastern end of the western wing. In 2017, the central wing comprises office and staff rooms (from west to east - the Principal's office, administration office, sick bay and conference room), with original partitions removed and new partitions inserted. The teachers rooms are intact and contain two small offices. The western wing contains a double classroom space with the dividing partition removed and incorporates a section of enclosed verandah (used for after school care in 2017). In the eastern wing, all first floor rooms incorporate enclosed verandah space and have had the verandah walls removed. The 1920 section contains two former classrooms (used for staff and teaching purposes in 2017). The first floor of the 1928 section contains a double classroom (used as a music room in 2017) and a store room at the verandah end. The ground floor contains a single large room (used as a staff room in 2017) and the enclosed verandah retains the verandah wall and a former hat room at the verandah end. Interior spaces throughout the building retain bulkheads that indicate the original layout of dividing partitions. Most spaces have timber T&G;, VJ board-lined walls and ceilings - the ceilings of the wings are coved and those in the teachers rooms are flat. The rooms retain their timber floor boards, simple timber skirting boards, exposed metal tie rods and latticed, square ceiling ventilation panels. Non-significant features of the interior include: a set of stairs leading down to the verandah of the 1928 section; recent carpet and linoleum floor linings; kitchenettes; and modern partitions, doors and cupboards. A range of original and early timber joinery is retained throughout the building, including: high-level, centre-pivoting windows to the eastern and western end walls of each wing; double-hung sashes to the verandah walls (early additions); and double-leaf doors with tall horizontally centre-pivoting fanlights to most classrooms. Large banks of windows to the southern elevations are casements along the bottom row and horizontally centre-pivoting windows and fanlights above. Fanlights in the 1920 wings are set in inclined frames. Windows to the teachers rooms are tall, three-light casements with square fanlights. One set of original folding timber doors survives on the first floor of the 1928 section. The understorey has a concrete slab floor, with concrete surface drains, and glazed, brown brick piers with rounded edges. A low brick retaining wall runs along the northern edge of western wing with batten screens above, fixed between piers. Most of the understorey is used as open play-space, with the remainder enclosed by partitions to create classroom, store room and tuckshop spaces. An early enclosure which survives beneath the western wing (originally a pre-1939 art and music room) has timber walls lined with vertical VJ boards with timber-framed, four-light, horizontally centre- pivoting windows set high in the southern and western walls. Steel beams inserted to support the floor above were inserted . An early braced and ledged timber board door survives in the eastern wall, and modifications have been made to the northern end of the room to create a separate uniform shop (such as replacing the timber windows with louvres). Beneath the 1920 section of the eastern wing are former toilets (now storerooms and a workshop) enclosed by timber walls lined with vertical VJ boards (west and north sides), brick (adjoining the 1928 extension) and rendered masonry walls (southern side). These walls retain timber batten doors and early fixed louvres in timber frames. Other understorey enclosures, including the tuck shop and storeroom beneath the central wing () and the store rooms beneath the teachers rooms, are not of heritage significance.  Swimming pool (1926)  Directly south of the eastern end of Block A is a rectangular, in-ground concrete swimming pool, with a timber dressing shed along its northern side. The sloping ground between the pool and shed is terraced with a series of concrete retaining walls and stairs. The swimming pool, which measures , has tiled edges and is surrounded by a concrete slab. Non-significant elements include the diving blocks, metal rails and ladders, and a smaller pool to the west (constructed ). The dressing shed is a long, rectangular building, lowset on concrete stumps and clad in timber weatherboards. The gable roof is clad in corrugated metal sheeting. It has a verandah along the southern side (overlooking the pool) with a timber floor, two-rail balustrade, and a single-skin wall, with T&G;, VJ timber board lining and externally-exposed stud-framing. A doorway in the centre of the verandah wall is ornamented with a timber fretwork arch. All windows are set high in the walls - those in the north wall are fixed louvres in timber frames; windows in the verandah wall and end walls appear to be modern fixed or awning windows. Internally, a central entrance area is flanked by identical dressing rooms with shower rooms at each end of the building. Walls are lined with T&G;, VJ timber boards and have a flat-sheet dado. The ceiling is lined with flat sheets with batten cover strips in a square grid pattern. Metal hooks and timber seating line the walls of the dressing rooms. Non-significant element of the interior include: modern tiles lining the floor and walls of the shower rooms; modern doors and shower fittings; and linoleum floor linings. The terraces comprise: two long retaining walls; a central stairway flanked by square concrete posts; an eastern stairway and pathway; a set of steps heading west from the lower terrace level; a section of wall heading south from the stairs; and garden bed edging adjacent to the dressing shed verandah. All walls and curbing have a rounded top surface. Round drainage holes are regularly spaced along the retaining walls. Non-significant elements of the terraces include metal fences and handrails, and steel posts supporting shade structures.  Landscape Elements  Numerous walls and garden features are found throughout the school grounds. A tall, battered stone retaining wall (1926‚Äì27) is located to the south and east of the swimming pool. To the west of the dressing shed are early stone-edged garden beds (1926). A low stone wall () is located along the south-west perimeter facing Cowley Street, part of an early garden scheme at the entrance to the school. A concrete retaining wall (1928-9) runs north from the 1928 extension of Block A, intersected by two sets of concrete stairs. Stone-edged garden beds are located on the north side of the teachers rooms and the eastern wing staircase (by 1936). Large mature trees, including fig trees (ficus, sp.), are located to the east of the swimming pool, north of the 1928 extension to Block A, and to the south and east of the Martin Street entrance. A playing field on low-lying ground to the east of the main school complex is edged by Norman Creek and vegetation to the southeast, and an arc of school buildings and structures on the higher ground around the western and northern sides. A large timber Honour Board (1944) and a smaller Honour Board (post-WWII) are hung on the eastern wall of the most easterly ground floor classroom of the 1928 section of Block A. These boards list the names of former students who served in World War II (WWII). A small timber Memorial, south of the large Honour Board, is dedicated to Adrian Blair, a former student. An early school bell hangs from a corner of the verandah eaves of Block A's western wing.  Heritage listing  Buranda State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Buranda State School (established 1918) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent, representative example of a standard government design that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies, honour boards, and an early swimming pool complex, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, retaining walls and mature trees. The suburban timber school building (1920, 1928) represents the culmination of years of experimentation by the Department of Public Works (DPW) with natural light, classroom size and ventilation. The early swimming pool, dressing shed and landscaping (1926) reflect the growing popularity of children learning to swim for health and safety reasons. These features comprise a rare remaining 1920s swimming pool complex. The World War II Honour Boards (1944, post-1945) are important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in a major world event. War memorials, including honour boards, are a tribute from the community to those who served and those who died. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. The large suburban site with mature trees, retaining walls and sporting facilities demonstrates education philosophies which promoted the importance of play and a beautiful environment in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Buranda State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school with later modifications. These include: teaching buildings constructed to standard designs; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, retaining walls and sporting facilities. The large suburban timber school building is an excellent, intact example of its type, with its symmetrical plan of three wings, highset form with play space beneath, Dutch- gable and gable roofs, continuous northern verandahs, large banks of south- facing windows providing classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation, projecting teachers rooms, single-skin verandah walls, and early joinery including one folding partition. The swimming pool and dressing shed in their landscaped site are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early state school pool complexes in size, form and layout. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The suburban timber school building at Buranda State School has aesthetic significance identifiable by its symmetrical layout; consistent form; scale; materials; elegant composition; finely crafted timber work; and decorative treatment. Views of the attractive north elevation of the building are obtained from the north. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Buranda State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Buranda community. It developed from 1918 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Buranda children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

KPLP has the task of formulating and execute policies, standards, norms, guidelines, criteria and procedures, as well as technical guidance, evaluation and reporting on patrol and security, safety monitoring and Civil Service Investigator (PPNS), order of shipping, water, facilities and infrastructure of coastal and marine guarding. KPLP is under the Directorate General of Sea Transportation of the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, KPLP reports directly to the Minister of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia. KPLP is not associated or part of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. KPLP, however often conduct joint- exercise and joint-operations with the Indonesian Navy. During the Dutch colonial era, an agency under the colonial government called the Sea and Coast Guard Service () was formed to protect the sea and coast of the Dutch East Indies. After the recognition of the independence of Indonesia by the Dutch, the agency was handed to the new Indonesian government and was renamed to Marine and Coast Guard Service (). The agency then changed its name several times resulting in its present name. KPLP is not associated with the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency (). While the former is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, the latter is under the jurisdiction of the Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs. Both agencies however have similar roles and functions and often conduct joint operations and joint maneuvers and simulation exercises together.  History  During the Dutch colonial era, two agency of the colonial government called the Governments's Navy (Dutch: Gouvernementsmarine) and the Shipping Agency (Dutch: Dienst van Scheepvaart) was formed to protect the sea and coast of the Dutch East Indies. The two organisation was briefly dissolved in 1942 during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in World War II. After the Surrender of Japan, the two organization was recreated to continue their main function. In 1947, at the midst of the Indonesian National Revolution, the two agency was merged becoming the Sea and Coast Guard Service (). In parallel to the Dutch agency, the Indonesian government who was then waging war against the Dutch formed their own organisation which has the same role as the Dutch Sea and Coast Guard called the Shipping Service of the Republic of Indonesia (Indonesian: Jawatan Pelayaran Republik Indonesia). After the Dutch recognition of Indonesia, the Dutch handed the Sea and Coast Guard to the new Government of Indonesia. The Indonesian government then merged the Sea and Coast Guard and the Shipping Service of the Republic of Indonesia into the Marine and Coast Guard Service (). The agency was immediately placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation. During the turbulence period in the 1950s as well as the rising of secessionist groups around the country, the government decided to hand the agency with the Indonesian Navy on 31 January 1950. In 1952, the agency was again separated from the Indonesian Navy and was again placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation. The agency however still works together to put down secessionist group around the country until the early 1960s. In 1962, the agency was renamed to Operasi Polisionil di Laut ( OPDIL ) and was placed under the Directorate of Sea Operations of the Ministry of Transportation. In 1965, OPDIL was renamed again to Assistant Special Operations of Government Transport (AOKAP) based on SK.Menhubla Number Kab.4 / 9/16/1965. Based on SK. Minister of Transport No.M.14 / 3/14 Phb dated June 20, 1966, the agency changed its name to the Bureau of Shipping Safety (BKP) with the task of organizing the Special Police in the Sea and SAR. Based on SK. Maritime Minister: No. Kab.4 / 3/14 dated December 13, 1966 BKP was incorporated into the Operations Unit Command (KASOTOP) which later became the Directorate of Shipping while maintaining Police duties at sea. With the change of the Maritime Department into the Department of Transportation, based on SK. Minister of Transportation M.b./14/7 Phb dated August 24, 1968, the Special Duties of the SAR was incorporated into the Directorate of Navigation, and by the Minister of Transportation was renamed back to the Marine and Coast Guard with the task of organizing the Special Police in the Sea and the Special Security of the Port. Based on SK Dirjen Hubla No.Kab.4 / 3/4 dated 11 April 1970 DPLP became the Command of Sea and Coastal Operation Command (KOPLP). Based on Decree of the Minister of Transportation No.KM.14 / U / plib-73 dated 30 January 1973 KOPLP became Sea and Coast Guard (KPLP)., which is the agency's present name.  Roles and Function   Roles  KPLP has the task of formulating and execute policies, standards, norms, guidelines, criteria and procedures, as well as technical guidance, evaluation and reporting on patrol and security, safety monitoring and Civil Service Investigator (PPNS), order of shipping, water, facilities and infrastructure of coastal and marine guarding.

These ship have smaller size than class 1 or 2. In the next 5 years or until 2019. KPLP are planning to acquire at least 500 patrol vessel from different size to strengthen its patrol fleet. In order to support the scope of work with the development of new bases across Indonesia, KPLP will be strengthened with a range of patrol boats that match, both types of first class vessels and third class. In addition, the ships will be equipped with weaponry for the security of both personnel and even the fleet of bad possibilities while operating in the oceans. Shipbuilding plans until 2019 will build 100 units of first and third class vessels to be deployed throughout Indonesia for the reinforcement of existing vessels and refurbishment of ships. Minister of Transportation Ignasius Jonan is targeting for the next five years the Marine and Coastal Guard Organization (KPLP) has 500 patrol boats of various sizes. The government will also add about 100 units of first class patrol boats (about 60 meters in size) and 150-200 units for grade two to five (size 42 meters to smaller). A total of 400 units of ship KPLP class patrol IV and V will also be replaced from the previous fiber made into rigid inflatable boat. In addition it will expand the patrol area and also add more personnel.  Identification  The KPLP uniform is dark blue, darker than the Indonesian Navy uniform. If members are former Indonesian Navy personnel, they may retain their previous navy rank and specialty rating. All personnel use black beret with KPLP logo. Civil personnel wear the rank and insignia of their civil service grade.  Future   Separation from the Ministry of Transportation  Based on Law No. 17/ 2008 on Shipping, mandated establishment of Sea and Coast Guard, a government agency that carries out the function of sea and coast guard and execute law and regulation related to sea and coast guard, the agency would be under the President's responsibility and will run operationally by the Minister. Government regulation regarding sea and coast guard which will define details and technical application should be issued. However, due to the debate and pros and cons, since 2008 until present10 March 2018 the government regulation has not been finalized and issued yet. This debate concerns the dilemma between the statute and harmonious or overlapping maritime patrols, oversight and law enforcement, which is also carried out by the Maritime Security Coordinating Board (which by the end of 2014 has become the Maritime Security Agency), Directorate General of Marine and Fisheries Resources Surveillance under Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and several other institutions. Minister of Transportation Ignatius Jonan supported the creation of Maritime Security Agency, but rejected of a KPLP under Maritime Security Agency because of KPLP mandated by Law No. 17/ 2008 and KPLP is the agency recognized by IMO (International Maritime Organization). Minister Jonan also had proposed KPLP raised from Echelon II to Echelon I (Directorate General), although this reaped controversy from experts.

It requests payment within one hour; otherwise, it will delete files from the infected computer.  History  Hitler-Ransomware was first developed in 2016. The ransomware activates with a lock screen with an image of Adolf Hitler giving a Nazi salute. The message on it states \\"This is the Hitler-Ransonware. (sic) Your files was encrypted! Do you decrypt your files?\\". It then demands payment in the form of a ‚Ç¨25 Vodafone mobile phone gift card and gives the owner of the computer one hour to pay with a countdown timer accompanying. Failing to pay the ransom when the one hour countdown timer reaches zero results in the system crashing with a blue screen of death and when the computer reboots, all of the files in the computer's user profile folders have been deleted. Contrary to what it claims, the ransomware does not encrypt the computer files; instead, it runs a script to mislead people into thinking their files have been encrypted. The virus was discovered by the AVG Technologies analyst Jakub Kroustek. Upon further investigation of it, he determined that it likely originated in Germany as a prototype given that the batch file associated with it had the words \\"Das ist ein Test\\" (German: This is a Test) in it. It is noted that while the Hitler ransomware's demand for payment in gift cards instead of Bitcoin was uncommon, it was not unique to this ransomware. Spelling mistakes made in the demands have led technology journalists to joke that it could upset Grammar Nazis.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and built in 1906 by C Risdale. It was formerly known as Mount Tarampa Provisional School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 May 2015.  History  Mount Tarampa State School opened in 1906 as Mount Tarampa Provisional School on a site within the small agricultural settlement of Mount Tarampa in the Brisbane Valley, to serve the sparse but growing rural population. As settlement increased, the provisional school building was extended () and a teacher's residence was built (1918). Other structures and landscape elements were added including a play shed (1912), a tennis court (pre-1925) and plantings. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. European occupation of the Brisbane Valley dates from 1841. Charles Cameron established Tarampa station, a large pastoral lease stretching from the D'Aguilar Range to Glenmore Grove and from Prenzlau to Coominya, in the 1840s.Ruth S Kerr, Confidence and Tradition: A history of Esk Shire, Council of the Esk Shire, Esk, 1988, p. 11. Tarampa Station was later sold to James E England who developed the station before selling it to Kent and Wienholt. Settlement in the Mount Tarampa area occurred when the Tarampa Repurchased Estate, comprising divided into 144 properties, opened for selection in 1903.'Closer Settlement in Qld - the Opening-up of the Tarampa Estate by the Government', Town and Country Journal, 5 Aug 1903, p. 31-2.

The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which standardised curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, Chapter 9: Educating Queenslanders, 2007 (rev.2013 by EHP), p. 2. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and the establishment of the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp. 4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 84, 120-1. In colonial Queensland, provisional schools were a convenient means of providing an elementary education for the small, scattered and often transient rural population and became an integral part of the educational landscape. A provisional school could be opened with as few as 15 (later 12) pupils. The Board of Public Instruction gave financial assistance to local committees to set up and maintain these schools. The local committee provided a building and found a teacher, while the Board paid the teacher's salary relative to the number of pupils. If the local population declined, the provisional school closed at little expense to the Board. If the district or town developed, the provisional school was raised to state school status and provided with purpose-designed school buildings. By 1892 the condition of provisional school buildings, which formed almost half of the colony's schools, was an embarrassment to the Department of Public Instruction.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 14. A recommended plan was introduced in 1892 to try to improve matters. This standard type (B/T6) was for a small low-set timber framed and clad building with a gable roof. It accommodated one large classroom with a front verandah, although a rear verandah was sometimes provided. The building was of single-skin construction and lined externally with chamferboards. The building had few windows and ventilation was provided by a high-level louvred vent in the gable end wall. These were often a huge improvement over the previous provisional school buildings and were constructed until .Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, p. 14. The Mount Tarampa building was a typical provisional school building (type B/T6) similar to the standard plan introduced by the Department of Public Instruction. It was a single room, gable roofed structure of the above dimensions, with a front verandah, , and a central doorway. A water tank and outbuildings were also provided.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. Mount Tarampa Provisional School was re-designated as a state school in 1909.'Transfer of Teachers', The Queenslander, 2 Jan 1909, p. 33'Mount Tarampa State School', Queensland Times, 2 Oct 1909, p. 4. In that year, the Department of Public Instruction upgraded the majority of provisional schools to state school status by lowering the required minimum average number of pupils for a state school from 30 to 12, gradually providing these schools with new buildings designed and constructed to government standards.Eddie Clarke, Provisional Schools in Queensland. A Brief History, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1987, pp. 2-3. At Mount Tarampa, a rear verandah and a new central doorway were added to the school building, with partial corner enclosures for hat rooms. The school was also painted.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. The Queensland education system recognised the importance of play in the school curriculum and, the need for all-weather outdoor space. Playsheds were designed as free-standing shelters, with fixed timber seating between posts and earth or decomposed granite floors that provided covered play space and doubled as teaching space when required. These structures were timber-framed and generally open sided, although some were partially enclosed with timber boards or corrugated galvanised iron sheets.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 16. The hipped (or less frequently, gabled) roofs were clad with timber shingles or corrugated iron. Playsheds were a typical addition to state schools across Queensland between s and the 1950s, although less frequently constructed after , with the introduction of highset school buildings with understorey play areas. Built to standard designs, playsheds ranged in size relative to student numbers.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 21, 97. A playshed, constructed at Mount Tarampa School by C Risdale, was completed by March 1912.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. The playshed was built to a standard 6-post design. It was , constructed of exposed timber framing and had a hipped roof.Department of Public Works Drawing, 1911 in Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. By 1914 there were 52 children attending Mount Tarampa State School, necessitating the use of the verandahs for teaching and prompting the School Committee to request an extension to the 1906 building. These extensions completed in July 1916 at a cost of ¬£226 comprised: addition of a northern classroom, ; lining of the classrooms and rearrangement of windows reusing the original windows; centring the stairs at the front (east) and rear (west) of the extended building; and installing new wash basins at either end of the rear verandah.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. The tall, timber-framed casement windows from the eastern and western verandah walls were repositioned to the gable end walls. Sunshades protecting the gable end casement windows were extended from one to three bays wide to accommodate the additional windows. Two timber-framed casement windows were installed at a high level at the northern end of the western verandah wall, and two at the southern end of the eastern verandah wall. These alterations were designed to allow maximum natural light to enter from the left hand side of each student.Department of Public Works Drawing, 1914Mt Tarampa State School, Mt Tarampa State School 1906-2006, p. 18. From 1893 the Department of Public Works greatly improved the natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors, experimenting with different combinations of roof ventilators, ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. Achieving an ideal or even adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, was of critical importance to educators and became central to the design and layout of all school buildings. From around 1909 windows were rearranged and enlarged to provide a greater amount of gentle, southern light into the room and desks were rearranged so the light would fall onto students' left hand sides to avoid throwing shadows onto the pages; this presupposed that all students were right-handed. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing buildings. Windows were larger and sills were lowered to let in more light generally. Smaller classrooms were preferred as they were easier to light correctly. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 19-20. In 1918 a teacher's residence was constructed for ¬£588 and was ready for occupation by February 1919.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II ReportQueensland Times, 4 Feb 1919, p. 2. This two bedroom teacher's residence (type C/R2) was one of three standard designs created between 1894 and 1914.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. From the outset, teacher's residences were built to a standard regulated by the Board of General Education rather than a specific design, so the form varied with each commissioned architect.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 2. Initially, residences were most often attached as annexes to the classroom building, but from the 1880s were built as detached residences. These residences were similar to the vernacular Queensland house with few, if any, education-specific requirements or features. Residences designed by the Department of Public Works' architects, were typically of a higher-quality in design, materials and construction than most similarly-scaled private residences. The detached teacher's residence was located within the school grounds at a distance from the teaching buildings, usually with a separate, fenced yard with gardens and trees. The designs ranged from one to four bedrooms and evolved simultaneously with the teaching buildings to keep up with modern needs and styles. Mount Tarampa State School's growing student population resulted in additions and improvements to the school grounds during the 1920s. The average number of children attending increased to 67 in 1925, prompting the Committee to purchase of land in 1922 for additional play space and a horse paddock.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. By 1925 a tennis court had been built, which was used for school grade tennis matches.Brisbane Courier, \\"Coominya\\", 3 Nov 1925, p. 10. The provision of outdoor play space was a result of the early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school. Trees and gardens were planted as part of the beautification of the school. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Boyd was critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations was the importance of the addition of shade trees in the playground. In addition, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Landscape elements were often constructed to standard designs and were intrinsic to Queensland Government education philosophies. Educationalists believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land. Aesthetically designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 44-5. Some mature trees exist in the Mount Tarampa State School's grounds, including a Bunya tree (Araucaria Bidwillii) and a large bottle tree (Brachychiton rupestris). Three large date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) stand in the residence garden. In the post-war years, there was little change to the school. Although planned in 1937, a verandah and bathroom addition on the northern side of the teacher's residence wasn't completed until about 1955, to a cost of ¬£994. With this addition, windows along the northern wall were replaced by half-glazed, six-light timber French doors.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. Between the 1960s and the 1980s a modernisation of Queensland education occurred. The Education Act 1964 was a turning point and the first major update of Queensland education's governing legislation since 1875. Effectively, a new era of state education evolved with new architectural responses needed. The Department of Education (as it had been renamed in 1957) continued to give the responsibility of building design to the architects of the Department of Public Works. Due to new materials, technologies, educational philosophies, government policies, architectural styles, and functional requirements, the evolution of standard designs became more fragmented. Rather than \\"improving\\" on the previous designs, architects began to design on a relatively clean slate, inspired by new precedents. Fundamentally, timber construction was no longer favoured and buildings were no longer predominantly high-set. The mid-1980s brought additions to Mount Tarampa State School with a modular building and an extension to library added in 1986, while in the following year a covered play area was constructed.Project Services, \\"Mount Tarampa State School, West Moreton District, Site No 21111\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. In 1981, 75th anniversary celebrations were held on 18 July, including an official luncheon and a book printed for the occasion. In 2006 the school celebrated its centenary and produced a history of the school.Mount Tarampa State School. \\"Mount Tarampa State School\\", , accessed 27 Oct 2014Mt Tarampa State School Centennial Committee, Mount Tarampa State School 1906-2006, p. 32. Between 2005 and 2014, the playshed was enclosed on all sides with part-height corrugated metal sheeting. A glass sliding door was installed on the northern elevation and sliding glass windows were added to the eastern and western walls. The timber posts are still visible on the interior, although the roof framing is concealed by a ceiling of flat sheeting. In 2015, Mount Tarampa State School continues to operate and retains the provisional school building, playshed and teacher's residence. The school is important to the area, having operated from the site since 1906 and as generations of Mount Tarampa students have been taught there. Since establishment, it has been a key social focus for the Mount Tarampa community with the grounds and buildings being the location of many social events.  Description  Site map, 2015 Mount Tarampa State School stands on an elevated, approximately site on the corner of main thoroughfares, Profkes and Mount Tarampa roads, in Mount Tarampa, approximately northwest of Ipswich. The school comprises a complex of small buildings, including an early provisional school building (1906, extended 1916), teacher's residence (1918, extended ), playshed (1912), tennis court (pre-1925) and established trees. The school is conspicuous in its rural setting.  Provisional School (1906)  Provisional school building, 2014 Set well back from and facing east to Profkes Road, the early Provisional School building is a small one-storey, lowset, timber-framed structure; axially aligned with the school entrance. The building is clad in timber weatherboards and is sheltered by a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It has a front and rear verandah and accommodates two rooms. The northern and southern gable ends each retain original tall, timber-framed casement windows sheltered by timber hoods with battened cheeks. Stop-chamfered brackets supporting the centre of each hood are possibly original. Packed weatherboards at the gable end apexes vent the interior. Both the front (east) and back (west) verandahs are accessed by centrally located timber stairs. The front verandah has exposed roof framing, square timber posts and a timber two-rail balustrade. A join in the fascia identifies the extent of the 1916 northern extension. The southern end of the front verandah is enclosed to form a staff kitchen; and the rear verandah is enclosed for use as staff offices. The front and rear verandah walls retain early timber-framed casement windows with high sills. Access to the interior is via original braced and ledged board doors (not in their original locations). Originally one large classroom, the interior is divided into two rooms separated by a central hallway of part-height modern partitions. The interior walls and coved ceilings are lined with v-jointed timber boards. A continuous break in the ceiling boards over the central hallway delineates where the 1916 extension was attached. Timber tie beams are exposed within the spaces and timber lattice ceiling vents are in the northern and southern rooms.  Teacher's Residence (1918)  Teacher's residence (rear view), 2014 The teacher's residence is a highset timber-framed, weatherboard-clad building that stands on concrete stumps and is protected by a corrugated metal-clad hipped roof. The building addresses Profkes Road to the east, with bedrooms and living rooms along the north and east sides, and a kitchen with projecting stove alcove at the southwest corner. The interior is accessed via central front (east) and rear (west) timber stairs that lead to verandahs. The front verandah has timber posts and a two-rail battened balustrade, and the rear verandah has been enclosed with weatherboards to form a living space. The extension on the north side comprises a living space with a bathroom in the northwest corner. Verandah walls are single-skin, lined with v-jointed tongue- and-groove boards. The building has a variety of timber-framed windows, including original double-hung windows-those on the southern elevation are sheltered by original timber-framed hoods with battened cheeks. The understorey has timber batten screens fixed between concrete stumps; the southwest corner has been enclosed to form a utility room. The internal layout of the residence is highly intact, comprising a central corridor running east- west between the entrance doors, with two rooms to either side. The front two rooms are bedrooms, and a bedroom and kitchen are at the rear. The kitchen has a stove recess and pantry. Internal walls are single skin with exposed studwork, and most walls are lined with v-jointed tongue-and-groove boards. Ceilings are lined in flat sheeting, and modern carpet and linoleum line the floors. Skirting, cornices and architraves are narrow with simple profiles. Retaining early hardware, internal doors are low-waisted with two-light fanlights, and doors to the northern extension are half-glazed, six-light French doors, with single-light centre-pivoting fanlights. The bathroom, toilet and kitchen fitouts are not of cultural heritage significance.  Playshed (1912)  The playshed is located to the south of the Provisional School building. It is a 6-post, timber-framed shelter with braced posts and a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The formerly open-sided structure has been enclosed with modern part-height corrugated metal sheets. It has a concrete floor and a ceiling of flat sheet material has been inserted. Timber brackets are internally attached to the southwestern posts for storage of a wooden trestle table. Modern window and door openings are not of cultural heritage significance.  Grounds  The grounds of Mount Tarampa State School are well established and include mature trees. These include: three well-established date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) within the teacher's residence yard; a large bottle tree (Brachychiton rupestris) adjacent to the fence-line separating the school and residence; a mature Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) at the front of the school near Profkes Road; and other established trees lining the boundary of the site. A tennis court, located northwest of the provisional school building, has a modern surface and is surrounded by high chain wire fencing.  Heritage listing  Mount Tarampa State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 May 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mount Tarampa State School (established in 1906 as Mount Tarampa Provisional School) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. It retains representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. These are a Department of Public Works-designed provisional school building (1906), a playshed (1912), and a teacher's residence (1918) set within school grounds with significant landscape elements including mature plantings and a tennis court. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Mount Tarampa State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state school complex, comprising buildings constructed to standard designs by the Department of Public Works, located on a large landscaped site with mature trees and a tennis court. The school is a good example of a modest, regional school with its small, simple teaching building that has been modified over time. The Department of Public Works designed provisional school building (1906, extended 1916) is an excellent, intact example of its type that retains its lowset form with front and rear verandahs (now partly enclosed), timber-framed and -clad construction, gable roof, coved ceiling, early doors and windows, and natural lighting and ventilation features. The playshed (1912) has a hipped timber-framed roof supported on braced, timber posts (all sides are now enclosed). The teacher's residence (1918) is an excellent, intact example of the residence type of its period - a highset timber-framed and -clad building with hipped roof, comprising three bedrooms, a kitchen with stove alcove, and front and rear verandahs (rear verandah is now enclosed). The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Mount Tarampa State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Mount Tarampa community. Operating since 1906 generations of Mount Tarampa children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Mount Tarampa and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social events with widespread community support.

The club has changed from previous club JK Rolling Doors in 2011. The club plays in III Liiga. In 2012 the Estonian Cup the club reached to the 1/16 finals, losing to a II Liiga club FC Elva at home 1‚Äì2. In 2018 the team decided to start cooperating with a nearby club called SK T√§√§ksi and the two started playing under the name P√µhja-Sakala. History Beginning (2011 ‚Äì today) Suure-Jaani United is a sports club established on 27 January 2011. Many of the players came from earlier club JK Rolling Doors, which previously ended. After many players wanted to play football in Suure-Jaani, local coach Sergei Vassiljev, who was training the same players in JK Rolling Doors, decided to create his own club: SK Suure-Jaani United. This is the reserve team of T√ºri Ganvix JK. First season SK Suure-Jaani United started the first season at 2011 in the VI Liiga. VI Liiga is the fifth football league in Estonia and also the lowest. Surprisingly Suure-Jaani started to lead the league straight away and was in the top of the league over half the season. Leading must have made them sleepy, because United lost one of the last game in the season to T√µrva Warrior 3:0, and they fell into second place, where they finished the season. The season was won by Tartu Quattromed by 33 points, second was SK Suure-Jaani United with 31 points, and third was the close neighbour SK T√§√§ksi with 30 points. Second season By the second season SK Suure-Jaani United had risen to III Liiga. The men knew, that none of the points came easy. After half of the season things didn't look so good. Only 1 point had come from SK T√§√§ksi, who had also risen to III Liiga, and many games were lost in the final minutes. Games looked bright until last 15 minutes when goals were let in. The first three games were lost on the second half of the season and it all went downhill faster. Then United won two games in a row, amazingly in one game 11‚Äì1. At the end of the season, United won 4 games and had one draw. It meant 13 points and the (11th) second to last position, which meant that the same league continues in the next season.

History and definition  Clevosaurus brasiliensis Although members of this group have been known since 1910, only recently has the group received a formal name. In the late 1990s, Victor-Hugo Reynoso established that three particular genera of Sphenodontia (Clevosaurus, Brachyrhinodon, and Polysphenodon) were closely related to each other. He gave the informal name \\"clevosaurs\\" to these three genera, after the most numerous and well-known genus, Clevosaurus. He considered clevosaurs to be members of the family Sphenodontidae, the family of rhynchocephalians containing the only living member of the order, the tuatara (Sphenodon). In 2006, Bonaparte and Sues finally gave \\"clevosaurs\\" a formal name and taxonomic rank as the family Clevosauridae. They defined Clevosauridae as the last common ancestor of Clevosaurus, Brachyrhinodon, and Polysphenodon, and all of its descendants. In 2015, the definition of this family was revised to be \\"all taxa more closely related to Clevosaurus than to Sphenodon\\". However, the erection of this family conflicts with their position within Sphenodontidae, as a taxonomic family cannot be within another family. Sources which use Sphenodontidae as a wide group of sphenodontians do not use the term Clevosauridae, instead continuing to use the informal term 'clevosaurs'. On the other hand, sources which use Clevosauridae do not use Sphenodontidae. Some do not use either family, instead opting for 'clevosaurs' and 'advanced sphenodontians'.  Description  Clevosaurs were among the first major groups of sphenodontians to evolve, and had a worldwide distribution in the Late Triassic and early Jurassic. Clevosaurus was particularly widespread and diverse, surviving the Triassic-Jurassic extinction and being known from numerous species. Adult clevosaurs are notable among sphenodontians for their short, boxy snouts. The antorbital region of the skull (the portion in front of the eyes) only occupies a quarter of the length of the entire skull in most clevosaurs, although a few species of Clevosaurus reacquire a slightly longer skull. Like other rhynchocephalians, they possessed two pairs of large holes called temporal fenestrae in the back part of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae (on the sides of the skull) are very large in most clevosaurs, about a quarter the length of the skull. All clevosaurs have very long jugal bones which extend back as far as the squamosal bones in the back of the head, forming the entire upper edge of their lower temporal fenestrae in the process. Uromastyx, a present-day equivalent of clevosaurs. Like other sphenodontians, clevosaurs had several rows of teeth on the roof of the mouth. Their teeth were acrodont, meaning that they grew directly from the bone rather than from tooth sockets. The large outermost row of teeth were attached to the maxillae bones while the small innermost teeth were clustered in rows on the pterygoid bones. Between the maxillary and pterygoid teeth, clevosaurs characteristically had one row of large teeth on each palatine bone, as well as an additional isolated tooth at the inner front corner of each palatine. Clevosaurs also had a row of teeth on the edge of their dentaries (lower jaws). In young individuals, these teeth were spike-like, well-adapted for consuming insects and other invertebrates. However, as individual clevosaurs grew older, their jaws became shorter and more robust. In addition, both their maxillary and dentary teeth wear down into a sharp cutting edge, creating a \\"beak\\"-like jaw structure somewhat similar to the jaws of modern Uromastyx lizards. It is likely that adult clevosaurs may have been omnivorous or herbivorous, similar to Uromastyx in ecology. Classification Below is a cladogram of the relationships within Clevosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis of Hsiou et al. (2015): \\"Clevosaurus\\" latidens was recovered outside of Clevosauridae, as the sister taxon of Opisthodontia.

Life  Werner K√ºchenthal was born in M√ºnchehof, a small manufacturing country town focused on limestone extraction and cement production, positioned in the countryside between Braunschweig to its north and G√∂ttingen to its south. After leaving school he studied jurisprudence, passing his Level 1 national law exams in 1903. As a student he became a member of what became the \\"Alte Turnerschaft Eberhardina-Markomannia T√ºbingen\\" student fraternity. He received his doctorate at the University of Leipzig in 1907 His dissertation concerned property and possession rights in respect of game killed by poachers and the duties and rights of lawful huntsmen and gamekeepers against poachers (\\"√úber den Eigentumserwerb am Wilderergute und die Anspr√ºche und rechtlichen Befugnisse des Jagdberechtigten gegen den Wilderer\\"). K√ºchenthal entered the public service a court assessor, and shortly afterwards joined the public prosecution service. Later he became a judge in the regional court and a permanent member of the Berlin-based Imperial Oversight Office for Private Insurance. He volunteered to fight in the First World War and was also active in the Ministry of War. After his promotion to the higher ranks of the public service (als \\"Oberregierungsrat\\") in 1920 he worked in the tax department of the Regional Finance Office in Hanover. He joined the German National People's Party (\\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\\" / DNVP) in 1919, remaining a member till 1933. From 22 January 1926 till 13 December 1927 he served in the regional government under Gerhard Marquordt as Minister for Finance and the Economy. His term in office was characterised by attempts to cut back on public spending. Between 1928 and 1930 he took over as head of the Regional Finance Office, based in Hanover. Following the election results of September 1930 the moderate left-wing coalition in the regional parliament was replaced by a broadly constituted coalition headed up by the DNVP and NSDAP. On 1 October 1930 these two, with the other smaller parties to the new governing coalition, voted Werner K√ºchenthal in as chair of the Council of Ministers / Minister- president of Braunschweig, the duties to be combined with departmental responsibilities for Finance and Justice. The Interior and Education ministry went to the NSDAP member, Anton Franzen who was succeeded by fellow-Nazi Dietrich Klagges on 15 September 1931. Klagges expanded his portfolio, replacing K√ºchenthal as Braunschweig's Minister-President, on 9 May 1933. Adolf Hitler surrendered his Austrian citizenship in 1925 and submitted an application for German citizenship. Under the Weimar constitution (Art. 41 para. 2) he would never be able to become President without it. A (bizarrely, anonymous) application was quietly submitted on Hitler's behalf in Thuringia.Manfred Overesch: Die Einb√ºrgerung Hitlers 1930, in: Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, 40. Jg., H. 4, M√ºnchen 1992, S. 544 f. Fn 8. The application was not successful. Over the next seven years applications for German citizenship were submitted by or on behalf of Hitler in various other parts of Germany, but it became increasingly clear that they were all being blocked by Berlin, mindful of Hitler's attempt to overthrow the government back in 1923. Along the way, it was discovered by eagle eyed readers of the constitution that if Hitler could be found a job in government service, German citizenship might be conferred automatically. Various attempts to find the Nazi leader a low profile appointment floundered, partly because of resistance in the political establishment and partly because Hitler had more important preoccupations than accepting a low profile appointment in government service. In 1932 the focus of those attempting to obtain citizenship for the party leader switched to the Free State of Brunswick/Braunschweig. Braunschweig was small and for most purposes outside the usual ambit of political commentators. More importantly, it was a state where the Nazi Party already held power, albeit in coalition with other parties. The political leadership, including Minister-President Werner K√ºchenthal of the DNVP, were supportive. K√ºchenthal suggested that Hitler might be appointed mayor of the little town of Stadtoldendorf. That was rejected by other parties in the coalition, however. In the end it is not clear whether it was the support of the regional government under K√ºchenthal that secured Hitler's appointment to a government post in Braunschweig, and how far it was the implicit threat of the Nazi Party to pull out of the governing coalition which would have triggered new regional elections (which all parties had good reason to fear at that point). On 26 February 1932 Adolf Hitler was duly appointed to the appropriately obscure post of \\"Regierungsrat der braunschweigschen Gesandtschaft beim Reichsrat\\" (loosely \\"Government official of the Braunschweig delegation to the National Council\\"). Citizenship for Adolf Hitler followed, backed by the practical support of the Free State of Brunswick/Braunschweig led by Werner K√ºchenthal. It was, in its way, an important contribution. On 1 May 1933 Werner K√ºchenthal joined the Nazi Party less than two months after the Enabling Act of 1933 which enshrined in statute the transformation of Germany into a one-party state. After Oskar St√ºbben had been persuaded to resign the position, K√ºchenthal took over as president of the board at the Braunschweig State Bank. (St√ºbben was not Jewish and he was certainly not a communist, but he was not a Nazi either.) K√ºchenthal remained in charge at the bank until relieved of his duties there on 13 August 1945 in the aftermath of another national military defeat. He spent the rest of his life as a farmer in Hedeper.

The text provides a list of the Hellenistic political institutions of the Balaites, the ecclesia and the presbyters, whereas the prytaneis and the tamia (tax collector) are even mentioned by name. The social organization of the Balaites suggests a developed Hellenistic community which, according to the scholars, might have been located within the radius of cultural influence of Apollonia, the Greek polis on the Illyrian coast, most likely close to the Amantians' or the Bylliones' territory.

The series premiered on ABS-CBN's Primetime Bida evening block and worldwide on The Filipino Channel on February 12, 2018, replacing Wildflower. Dreamscape is the unit helming the production of The Blood Sisters. It was the initiative of Dreamscape Entertainment Head Deo Endrinal to deliberately create a show that is somewhat similar to the 1999 TV series, Saan Ka Man Naroroon. Where he served as one of the series' creative consultants. He suggested recreating Claudine's top-rating series but with a different touch. After numerous brainstorming sessions and careful deliberations, the creative team came up with The Blood Sisters concept about the triplets- Erika, Carrie and Agatha. The main difference between Saan Ka Man Naroroon and the series is that the story tackles the issue of surrogacy. Series overview Legend ' is the highest rating of the entire series.

It has a single thin leaf and up to twenty three dark purplish-black flowers which lean downwards. Description Genoplesium simulans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long with the free part long. Between five and twenty three dark purplish-black flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The flowers lean downwards and are wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, long, wide and purple with darker bands. The edges of the dorsal sepal are densely hairy, the hairs up to long. The lateral sepals are linear to lance- shaped, about long, wide, dark reddish purple and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and greenish- purple with darker stripes and a few hairs on the edges. The labellum is narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base and is long, about wide with dark purplish-black hairs on the edges. There is a purplish-black, tapered callus in the centre of the labellum and covering about half of its surface. Flowering occurs from January to March. Taxonomy and naming The Blue Mountains midge orchid was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis simulans. The specific epithet (simulans) is a Latin word meaning \\"imitating\\" or \\"copying\\", referring to the similarity of this species to G. morissii. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium simulans grows in forest and with mosses in shallow soil over sandstone in the Blue Mountains and south to Mount Keira.

Thymus represents an origin of T cell development and its responsibility is to select functional but also safe T cells which will not attack self tissues. Self-harmful T cells, further referred to as autoreactive T cells, originate in the thymus because of the stochastic process called V(D)J recombination which conducts the generation of T cell receptors (TCRs) and enables their limitless variability. Two processes of central tolerance take place in thymic medulla, namely clonal deletion (recessive tolerance) and T Regulatory cells selection (dominant tolerance) which force autoreactive T cells to apoptosis or skew them into suppressor T regulatory cells (TRegs), respectively, in order to protect body against manifestations of autoimmunity. These processes are mediated especially by unique subset of stromal cells called Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) via presentation of Tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) that represent self tissues from almost all parts of the body.  mTECs  mTECs are not only capable to present TRAs as efficient APCs. They are also potent in production of these TRAs via unique process called promiscuous gene expression (PGE) and might serve as their reservoir.  Drawbacks of antigen presentation  mTECs as APCs reveal some drawbacks on population level. Their numbers in thymic medulla reach only 100 000 per 2 week old thymus. Furthermore, average lifespan of mTECs doesn¬¥t exceed 2‚Äì3 days, probably due to only known PGE activator Autoimmune regulator (Aire), which requires for its proper function generation of DNA double strand breaks. And last but not least, each TRA is expressed only by 1-3% of mTEC population. These facts decrease the chance of efficient recessive or dominant tolerance.  Relevance of antigen transfer  Unidirectional spreading of mTEC-derived TRAs onto additional APCs via antigen transfer increases the probability of encounter between potential autoreactive T cell and its corresponding TRA and therefore enhances processes of central tolerance. Furthermore, antigen transfer enables TRA processing and presentation by different cellular microenvironments. Despite relevance of antigen transfer, seminal study was published, showing mTECs to form fully established central tolerance without support of additional APCs.  Antigen transfer enables indirect presentation of TRAs  First article which touches antigen transfer was published in 2004. Experiments from this study reveal that clonal deletion of autoreactive CD4+ T cells, apart from CD8+ T cells, requires indirect presentation of TRAs by bone marrow (BM) derived APCs. Direct presentation of TRAs by mTECs was shown to be insufficient in this case. Requirement of indirect presentation of some mTEC-derived TRAs in the case of recessive tolerance was perceived also by additional studies which both firstly demonstrated antigen transfer as an instrument that enables this process. Need of TRA indirect presentation is probably closely related with above mentioned \\"processing of TRAs by different microenvironments\\". N.B.: BM derived APCs don¬¥t express TRAs, this process is uniquely dedicated to mTECs. Exception is represented by thymic B cells which were shown to express TRAs and Aire.  Thymic dendritic cells  Systemic ablation of dendritic cells (DCs) was shown to cause fatal manifestations of autoimmunity which points to their importance in central tolerance. Indeed, as mTECs represent exclusive donors of TRAs, experiments with first antigen transfer mouse models discovered thymic dendritic cells (DCs) to be so far the only known TRAs acceptors involved in antigen transfer. Indispensability of DCs for the establishment of central tolerance was further verified by recent analysis, which revealed that DCs mediate both recessive and dominant tolerance, with preference for the latter, via presentation of more common TRAs.  Subsets  = tDCs = The most efficient subset in TRA presentation and both modes of central tolerance was found to be CD8Œ±+ thymic-derived DCs (tDCs). This subset was also shown to express XCR1 and to be attracted by mTECs via XCL1 chemokine expression. tDCs rise intrathymically and constitute approximately half of thymic DCs population. = mDCs = SirpŒ±+ migratory DCs (mDCs) form second subset of thymic DCs. They rise extrathymically, and were shown to present self antigens, especially blood-borne antigens, in the thymus, which they acquire in the periphery. They were also shown to be more efficient in T regulatory cells selection than clonal deletion. = pDCs = The last abundant subset of thymic DCs is represented by B220+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) which also rise extrathymically and transfer peripheral antigens from the periphery to the thymus to mediate selection processes. All these thymic DC subsets were shown to participate in antigen transfer. Nevertheless, only tDCs and mDCs were observed to utilize transferred TRAs for indirect presentation which led to the processes of central tolerance.  Mechanism  The unambiguous mechanism of the antigen transfer is still unknown. However, there are three possible ways: I. acquisition of mTEC apoptotic bodies, which could possibly be related with low mTEC lifespan II. acquisition of exosomes and III. acquisition via trogocytosis, how antigen transfer can be mediated. There is also an evidence, that antigen transfer and therefore indirect presentation by thymic DCs are regulated by PGE activator Aire.

It was first released in North America on June 7, 2002 by Disney Interactive. Ubisoft distributed the game in Europe on October 4, 2002, and in Australia on March 24, 2005. Gameplay The game takes place at an unknown point of time after the original film. An extraterrestrial bounty hunter kidnaps Lilo (vocal effects by Daveigh Chase) and brings her aboard the spaceship laboratory of a robotic, mosquito-like alien named Dr. Pestus, who plans to use her as food for his genetically- modified mosquito army. Stitch (vocal effects by Chris Sanders) must go out into space to rescue Lilo and defeat Dr. Pestus. In most levels, the player takes control of a four-armed, plasma blaster-wielding Stitch who must run and gun his way past enemies and various other obstacles to complete the level. He can also acquire special ammunition for his plasma blasters that allow him to fire more powerful plasma blasts and can acquire pineapple bombs to throw at enemies. In a couple puzzle-platform-styled levels, the player takes control of Lilo as she sneaks around the spaceship to find a way to escape and contact Stitch. In a couple tube shooter-styled segments, Stitch must fly a spaceship to reach the next level, shooting down other enemy ships and dodging obstacles along the way. Reception Disney's Lilo & Stitch was met with mostly positive reviews, with critics favorably comparing the game to SNK's Metal Slug series, but criticizing Stitch's inability to shoot while crawling or crouching and the game's use of a password save system. Critics also expressed concern that the game's high difficulty would frustrate its intended audience of young players. GameRankings and Metacritic gave the game aggregated review scores of 75.58% and 80 out of 100, respectively. Sales In the United States, the game sold 620,000 copies and earned $14 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 46th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country. Sequel In 2004, Disney Interactive released a standalone sequel developed by Climax Studios titled Lilo & Stitch 2: H√§msterviel Havoc, which is based on Lilo & Stitch: The Series.

The film features Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in the lead roles with Jimmy Sheirgill, Zarina Wahab, Sonya Jehan, Vinay Pathak and Parvin Dabas playing supporting roles. Set in the United States, the film's story focuses on Rizwan Khan (Khan), a non-resident Indian suffering from Asperger syndrome whose wife, Mandira (Kajol), has a child, Sameer, from a previous relationship. During the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Sameer dies as a result of a racist assault by school bullies. Mandira blames Sameer's death on Rizwan due to his religion, and tells him not to come back until he can convince the President of the United States that he is not a terrorist. Rizwan takes Mandira's words literally and tries to meet the President so as to win her back. My Name Is Khan was co-produced by Johar's brother, Hiroo Yash Johar, and Khan's wife, Gauri Khan, under the Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment banners respectively. Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy composed the soundtrack while Niranjan Iyengar and Javed Akhtar wrote the lyrics for its songs. Ravi K. Chandran, Deepa Bhatia and Sharmishta Roy handled the cinematography, editing and production design respectively. Produced on a budget of ‚Çπ850 million (about US$19 million in 2010), My Name Is Khan was released on 12 February 2010 and received positive reviews. It was commercially successful, grossing ‚Çπ2.048 billion (about US$45 million in 2010) worldwide.

Retrieved February 10th, 2018. According to IDEAS/RePEc, she belongs to the 2% of most cited economists. Key areas of her research include the following:  Research on the economics of ethnic diversity and economic inequality One major strand of La Ferrara's research studies how differences in terms of income or ethnicity between members of a community (i.e. the community's heterogeneity) affects the formation of groups, participation in social activities, and trust in others. Investigating the effect of heterogeneity on group formation and participation in social activities in US communities, La Ferrara and Alberto Alesina found that social participation is lower the more unequal and ethnically diverse a community is. Moreover, individuals who oppose racial mixing tend to be increasingly isolated the more racially diverse their community is. Despite very different standards of living, the effect of income inequality seems also to hold in developing countries: in rural Tanzania, La Ferrara found that village-level inequality overall decreases participation in groups, especially for relatively wealthy people. However, she also found that this aggregate effect masks the importance of whether access to groups is open or restricted: if the growth in inequality is mostly due to some of the very poor becoming slightly wealthier, participation in open groups decreases, but if the growth in inequality is instead driven by average income earners becoming relatively wealthy participation in groups with restricted access increases, with both processes affecting group functioning. One channel through which a community's diversity affects its social life is through the trust (or lack thereof) between its members. In the U.S., La Ferrara and Alesina find that low trust of others is pervasive among individuals who (i) live in a racially mixed and/or highly unequal community, (ii) are members in a group that has historically been discriminated against (e.g. African Americans and, to a lesser degree, women), (iii) are unsuccessful in terms of income and education, and/or (iv) recently had a series of traumatic experiences; by contrast, religious beliefs or ethnic origins don't affect trust of others.  Research on the relationship between violent conflict and financial markets In another strand of her research, Eliana La Ferrara studies the relationship between violent conflict and financial markets; examples therein include the development of a method to detect illegal arms trade, the analysis of whether violent conflict is bad for private firms, and financial markets' reaction to the news of violent conflict: In their research on illegal arms trade, Eliana La Ferrara and Stefano DellaVigna speculate that events that affect the intensity of violent conflicts (and, by extension, the demand for arms) in countries which are under international arms embargoes may be reflected in arms manufacturers' stock prices if they are violating these embargoes. Investigating this hypothesis, they show that the stock returns of arms manufacturers headquartered in highly corrupt countries with an intransparent arms trade business indeed mirror these events and are able to substantiate many of these links through UN investigations and online news stories. In another study on the relationship between violent conflicts and financial markets, La Ferrara and Massimo Guidolin exploit the sudden, unexpected end of the Angolan Civil War in 2002 (due to the death of UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi) to assess the effect of the conflict in diamond- rich Angola on private firms. In particular La Ferrara and Guidolin find that the event caused the abnormal returns of diamond mining firms holding concessions in Angola to decrease by 4pp but had no effect on diamond mining companies not active in Angola. In light of this finding, they suggest that violent conflict may benefit incumbent firms in the extractive sector by creating additional barriers to market entry, weakening governments' bargaining power with regard to the distribution of natural resource rents, and making the licensing of mining concessions less transparent. Finally, in another study taking a global perspective, La Ferrara and Guidolin find that for 101 violent conflicts during 1974‚Äì2004, MSCI stock indices of the U.S., British, and French stock markets, overall commodity indices (though not for oil futures, agricultural products or gold), and the U.S. dollar exchange rate tend, on average, to react positively to the news of conflict onset, whereas stock markets in Japan as well as indices of agricultural commodities, oil futures and gold don't. In general, stock markets are found to react particularly strongly to news of international conflicts as well as to news of conflicts in Asia and the Middle East, the latter being driven by the extremely strong (and mostly negative) reactions of oil futures.  Research on the impact of television on social norms in Brazil A third strand of La Ferrara's research addresses the \\"export\\" of alternative social norms through the expansion of access to modern media, e.g. television. Together with Alberto Chong, Eliana La Ferrara exploits the gradual expansion of the television network Rede Globo across Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s to explore whether exposure to Rede Globo telenovelas, which tend to portray modern social norms (including the possibility of divorce) had an effect on divorces. Indeed, La Ferrara and Chong find that the availability of the Globo signal significantly increases the share of separated or divorced couples. In another study but again exploiting Rede Globo's gradual expansion in Brazil, La Ferrara, Chong and Suzanne Duryea analyse the impact of Globo's telenovelas, which also portray comparatively small families, on fertility and find a significant negative impact, with the effect of Globo's telenovelas on parents being further substantiated by the fact that the frequency of child names in regions with access to Globo strongly reflects naming patterns in the telenovelas. The effect of the soap operas on fertility is particularly strong for women from poor households and during the central and late phases of fertility, thus suggesting that households adjusted their views regarding the desired number of children and stopped having more children after reaching it.  Research on reciprocity and attitudes towards redistribution  Further work In her study of informal credit transactions within kinship based networks in Ghana, La Ferrara finds that repayment of loans is effectively induced through social enforcement, e.g. the sanctioning of defaulters' offspring, and that kin members sometimes adjust their lending behaviour (e.g. offering favourable terms of credit) on the characteristics of a creditor's parents in the expectation of reciprocity, i.e. that others will do the same with their offspring. Alesina and La Ferrara find that preferences for redistribution in the U.S. depend considerably on individuals' expected gains and losses from redistribution (which are strongly determined by their socioeconomic background) but also by their subjective beliefs about individual economic agency, i.e. people who don't believe that American society offers \\"equal opportunities\\" for social mobility are less averse to redistribution.

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the House of Representatives. Candidates were expected to be either for or against President Rodrigo Duterte. As the Philippines has a multi-party system, those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as safe seats may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, gerrymandering on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of political dynasties make competitive races in so-called swing seats rare. The Liberal Party is expected to lead the opposition against PDP‚ÄìLaban. The pro- Duterte parties overwhelmingly won most of the seats in the House. Pro-Duterte party-list ACT-CIS emerged as the topnotcher in the party-list election. There was infighting among the pro-Duterte parties on who should be elected Speaker. Alan Peter Cayetano agreed on term-sharing with Lord Allan Jay Velasco for the speakership, with the former serving for the first 15 months, while the latter serving for the last 21 months.  Electoral system  The Philippines uses parallel voting for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the plurality voting system from single- member districts. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \\"soft\\" election threshold, with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met. Campaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an election slate that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign. Party-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though. Participating parties Contesting district elections {class= - !colspan=2Party !! Leader !! House leader !! Support of Duterte's policies!! Total seats !!

Contesting via the party-list system The parties under the Makabayan bloc was formerly supportive of Duterte's policies until Duterte suspended peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines. Akbayan is seen as opposed to Duterte's policies. Other parties are generally supportive of Duterte's policies.  District changes  Reapportioning the number of seats is done via national reapportionment after the release of every census or via piecemeal redistricting for every province or city. National reapportionment has not happened since the 1987 Constitution took effect, and aside from piecemeal redistricting, the apportionment was based on the ordinance from the constitution, which was in turn based from the 1980 census. {class= style=\\"font-size:92%;\\" + House Bills (HB) and Senate Bills (SB) related to redistricting bills - !Bill No. !!

Consolidated/Substituted in the Committee Report  Pedro Acharon Jr.  NPC - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Approved districts !8 ! colspan=\\"4\\" Potential new districts !31 } In total, seven new district seats were created. Two were in Isabela, where the entire province was redistricted from four districts to six, and one each in Cavite, where the sixth and seventh districts were redistricted into three, Aklan and Southern Leyte, which were split into two districts, Laguna, where Calamba was separated from the second district and South Cotabato, where General Santos was separated from the first district. As there are now 245 districts; therefore, there are 61 party-list seats (at least 20% of the total), an increase from 59. The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to rescheduled elections, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the unified Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election. This left the number of districts to 243, with still 61 party-list seats.

After defending the naval base of Scapa Flow against air attack in the early part of the war, the regiment went to India and later took part in the Burma Campaign in the anti-aircraft role and with heavy howitzers in support of ground forces, even on occasion fighting as infantry. It was reformed in the post-war TA (as 501st HAA Rgt) and continued until the abolition of Anti-Aircraft Command in 1955. Origin The regiment was formed in August 1939 from two previously independent anti-aircraft (AA) batteries of the Royal Artillery (RA): 226th (Caithness and Orkney) AA Bty and 297th (Inverness) AA Bty. The regimental headquarters (RHQ) was at Inverness. (AA Regiments and Batteries equipped with 3.7-inch and larger guns were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) on 1 June 1940 to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) units that were being formed).Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì60, 771, 773, 779.Monthly Army ListLitchfield, p. 286. 226th (Caithness and Orkney) HAA Bty All the Territorial Army (TA) units recruited in the Orkney Islands had been disbanded during World War I, but with the deteriorating international situation in 1937 the part-time TA was expanded, and the first new unit in the Orkneys was part of an AA battery, with the remainder recruited from Caithness on the mainland of Scotland.Rollo, p. 27. The first officer commanding (OC) of 226th (Caithness and Orkney) AA Bty (appointed 1 February 1938) was Brevet Colonel G.D.K. Murray, OBE, MC, TD, formerly commanding officer (CO) of 4th/5th Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders, (although in his new role he only received the rank and allowances of a Major).Glasgow Herald 13 January 1938.London Gazette, 11 February 1938.London Gazette, 20 October 1936.Murray at Generals of World War II. The battery had its headquarters (HQ) at Kirkwall on Orkney.AA Command Order of Battle 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 297th (Inverness) HAA Bty At the beginning of 1939, 297th (Inverness) Battery, based at Margaret Street in Inverness, was part of 75th (Highland) Field Regiment; prior to 1920 it had been the Inverness-shire Royal Horse Artillery, first formed in 1908. It was commanded by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel J.A. Mackintosh. By May 1939, it was being converted into a AA battery.Frederick, p. 673.Litchfield, pp. 270, 285. Mobilisation and Phoney War The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939, the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. In the case of 226th (Caithness and Orkney) Bty, this was at the vital naval base of Scapa Flow, which consists of an anchorage virtually surrounded by the Orkney Islands. On the outbreak of war the battery's eight guns were the base's only land-based AA defence, though the Royal Navy estimated that at least 24 were required to protect the unarmed tankers and storeships, and the shore facilities.Collier, Chapter 4.Routledge, Table LIX, p. 377. 101st HAA Regiment, under the command of Bt- Col G.D.K. Murray, formed part of 36th (Scottish) Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 3 AA Division. 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. Scottish naval bases received the initial attacks by the German Luftwaffe: first Rosyth on the Firth of Forth on 16 October, then Scapa Flow the following day, when 14 hostile aircraft in three waves attacked the warships in the anchorage. Although there was as yet no early-warning radar for Scapa, 226 HAA Bty was able to engage the raiders, shooting down one, which crashed on the island of Hoy, although the decommissioned former Fleet flagship HMS Iron Duke (being used as an AA platform) was hit and had to be beached. These attacks prompted calls for stronger AA defences at Scottish bases and 3 AA Division was strongly reinforced with 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch HAA guns, searchlights, and a few LAA guns. Among the reinforcements was the first new HAA battery formed in the Royal Artillery after the outbreak of war, 317 Bty of 101st HAA Rgt, formed at Inverness. But the problems at Scapa were formidable: the anchorage is so large that parts were beyond the range of HAA guns, and the guns had to be laboriously emplaced on rugged islands that were only accessible by boat. The next attack, on 16 March 1940, caught these increased defences only half prepared. About 15 Junkers Ju 88 bombers approached at low level at dusk, half attacking the warships and the rest attacking the airfield. Forty-four HAA guns engaged, but the predictors were defeated by the bombers' erratic courses amidst the gun-flashes and low light, and none were shot down, while the Navy suffered further losses.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence- UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-5.html Collier, Chapter 5.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 16.Rollo, p. 28.Routledge, pp. 374‚Äì5. Home Defence By the time the Phoney War ended and the Battle of Britain began in July 1940, the Orkney and Shetland Defence Force (OSDEF) had 88 HAA guns at Scapa Flow and 12 in Shetland, under 58 and 59 AA Brigades. While 226 HAA Bty remained on Orkney operating under RHQ of 81st HAA Rgt, RHQ of 101st HAA Rgt with 297 and 317 HAA Btys was in Shetland. Together with 60 LAA Bty (of 19th LAA Rgt) and a S/L Bty, the regiment was the sole AA Defence of Shetland.Collier, Appendix IX.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 105.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/114. 3 AA Divisional sign The regiment remained in OSDEF, latterly with 136 Z Battery (equipped with rocket projectors) under its command, until June 1941, when it crossed back to North Eastern mainland Scotland, where it joined 51 AA Bde in 3 AA Division.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 3 March 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/115. The regiment sent a cadre to 210th Training Regiment at Oswestry to provide the basis for a new 389 Bty; this was formed on 14 November 1940 and later joined 111th HAA Rgt. On 18 June 1941 317 HAA Bty left to join 71st (Forth) HAA Rgt and was replaced by 379 HAA Bty transferred from 108th HAA Rgt in 51 AA Bde.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. In the summer 101st HAA Rgt was joined by a fourth battery, the newly raised 427 HAA Bty. This battery had been formed at 211th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, on 24 April 1941 from a cadre supplied by 54th (City of London) HAA Rgt, then joined 64th (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt on 22 July before transferring on to 101st HAA Rgt on 6 August.Frederick, p. 771.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. 101st HAA Rgt provided another cadre for 481 (Mixed) Bty formed at 210th HAA Training Rgt on 18 September 1941, which joined 137th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ('Mixed' units were those into which women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated.) The regiment supplied a further cadre to 211th Training Rgt for 525 (M) HAA Bty formed on 22 January 1942 for 155th (M) HAA Rgt. In June 1942, RHQ moved to South East England to join 56 AA Bde in 6 AA Division, with 226, 379 and 427 HAA Btys, while 297 HAA Bty remained in Scotland, temporarily attached to 52 AA Bde in 3 AA Division. On 10 July 427 HAA Bty left the regiment and joined 147th HAA Rgt, reducing 101st to the three-battery establishment for overseas service. Shortly afterwards 101st HAA Rgt moved to 35 AA Bde in 5 AA Division covering central Southern England, while 297 HAA Bty was attached to 3 AA Bde in Northern Ireland. Finally, in September, the regiment joined 26 (London) AA Bde in 1 AA Division. India These rapid moves and the reduction to a three-battery establishment were characteristic for AA units being prepared for overseas service, when they were loaned back to AA Command between training camps. In January 1943, 101st HAA Regiment left AA Command and came under direct War Office Control, with 226, 297, 379 HAA Btys and its own 101 HAA Workshop Section, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), under command. It embarked for India and left by mid March. 101sth HAA Regiment landed at Bombay at the beginning of July 1943 and moved to Avadi where it came under the command of 3 Indian AA Bde. 226 and 297 HAA Batteries were mobile, while 379 Bty manned static guns. 297 HAA Battery was soon detached to Madras, but returned on 10 August in time for the regiment to move back to the Bombay area. From 15 October 1943 to 27 January 1944, the regiment came under the command of 1 Royal Marines AA Bde, and from 16 April under 9 AA Bde.Routledge, Table XXXIX, pp. 254‚Äì5. Burma In September, it moved up to the front, arriving in the Imphal area on 27 September, where it joined XXXIII Indian Corps in time for Operation Capital. This operation was designed to throw the Japanese off the Manipur heights and establish bases on the Chindwin River. As the force struggled forward through the Monsoon, the corps' AA gunners followed closely behind, moving east from Imphal to Tamu, and down the Kabaw Valley to meet 5th Indian Division at Kalemyo at the end of November.Farndale Far East, p. 230.Routledge, pp. 246‚Äì8.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 4, 39‚Äì51, 106‚Äì8, Appendix 18. With the almost total elimination of the Japanese air force in the theatre, Fourteenth Army increasingly used its 3.7-inch HAA guns as medium artillery against ground targets. As 11th East African Division forced its way through the Myittha Gorge to Kalewa, a troop of 101st HAA Rgt was directed by Air Observation Post (AOP) aircraft to fire at the town. This was at , extreme range for a 3.7-inch gun, but the AOP pilot observed the first shot land exactly in the confluence of the Myittha and Chindwin rivers and was quickly able to correct the fire onto the nearby track junction. Throughout the following nights the guns fired harassing fire (HF) tasks against this bottleneck, causing severe disruption to the Japanese movements. Kalewa fell on 2 December.Farndale Far East, p. 234.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 153‚Äì4. The Bailey Bridge across the Chindwin at Kalewa While XXXIII Corps bridged the Chindwin at Kalewa, 101st HAA Rgt provided AA protection for the bridgehead. Although Japanese air attacks had been slight, now they made determined efforts to destroy the Bailey bridge, but the HAA and LAA guns fired intense concentrations that broke up the attacks and shot down several aircraft; the bridge remained intact.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, p. 160. In December, 'A' Troop of 226 HAA Bty took over four 7.2-inch howitzers. Moving these heavy guns through the jungle and Paddy fields into firing positions took enormous labour, and often required extra recovery vehicles and bulldozers. Normally the howitzers went forward at first light to join the infantry, who would identify the target, usually a bunker. This would be engaged over open sights, sometimes after an air strike or field guns had blown away any camouflage to reveal the target. There was pressure to achieve early hits and to couple the gun up to its tractor and withdraw before the Japanese retaliated with mortar fire.Farndale, Far East, p. 244‚Äì5.Routledge pp. 250‚Äì1. That month, XXXIII Corps launched its main drive from Kalewa towards Mandalay down two routes. The Corps Commander Royal Artillery (CCRA) decentralised control over 101st HAA Rgt, so that 226th Bty accompanied 2nd Division on the left, heading through the jungle for Shwebo, while 297 Bty went with 20th Indian Division on the right down the Chindwin towards Monywa. 2nd Division made good progress to Shwebo in January 1945, with 226 HAA Bty providing route protection and cover for airstrips and field gun positions. Japanese aircraft raided the airfields in greater numbers than had been seen for some time. 20th Indian Division had rougher going along the river valley, and then a stiff six-day battle to take Monywa.Farndale Far East, pp. 242, 251, 266.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 172‚Äì9. 7.2-inch howitzer in action at night in Burma, February 1945. The CCRA then organised a strong artillery group to support the two divisions in their assault crossing of the wide Irrawaddy River, with 101st HAA Rgt operating both its 16 x 3.7-inch and 4 x 7.2-inch equipment. The long-range 3.7s were used for a long programme of counter-battery (CB), Interdiction and HF tasks, with half the guns capable of immediate reversion to the AA role if enemy aircraft appeared. One 3.7-inch HAA gun, detached to 16th Field Rgt with 2nd Division, could just reach Mandalay. 20th Indian Division began its crossing on 12 February 1945, supported by a corps fire programme including 'bombard' tasks from 3-7-inch guns at using AA Fuzes. It took 20th Indian Division two weeks to establish a firm bridgehead and beat off counter-attacks, then 2nd Division began its assault upstream, supported by the Corps artillery in similar fashion.Farndale, Far East, pp. 246, 269.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 260‚Äì3. By the first week in March, XXXIII Corps' divisions were closing in to capture Mandalay from several directions, and 101st HAA Rgt's batteries were once more decentralised to the divisions, moving and fighting with the infantry, often under heavy shellfire. 19th Indian Division reached the outskirts of the city on 7 March and began a siege of Fort Dufferin. After that citadel fell on 20 March, 2nd and 20th Indian Divisions began to clear the city.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 288‚Äì94, 299‚Äì304. Now that the Irrawaddy was crossed and Mandalay captured, the country was more open, and Fourteenth Army could drive towards Rangoon. 101st HAA Regiment remained as Corps HAA regiment with XXXIII Corps, used mainly in the ground role, though 297 and 379 HAA Btys were posted to defend Magwe airfield when it fell to 19th Indian Division on 19 April (XXXIII Corps was depending on supply by air). During the advance on Prome, gunners of 101st HAA Rgt fought for a while as infantry, guarding the gap between XXXIII and IV Corps. They sent out fighting patrols and fought several actions with Japanese troops trying to escape eastwards. The regiment was then concentrated at Allanmyo for rest before returning to ground and air defence artillery tasks.Routledge, Table XL, pp. 255‚Äì6.Farndale Far East, pp. 282‚Äì4, 296.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 324‚Äì5, 362‚Äì6, 372‚Äì5, Appendices 21, 23.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 2‚Äì3, 11‚Äì2. By 20 May, 101st HAA Rgt was supporting 268th Indian Infantry Brigade in its advance along the east bank of the Irrawaddy. The weather broke and made all movement difficult, but opposition was light, and the force established a cordon along the river to catch the retreating Japanese, who made determined attempts to break through until the fighting ended on 30 May. June was spent clearing up pockets of Japanese in the Irrawaddy area.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 380.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, p. 13. In June 1945, XXXIII Indian Corps was disbanded (its HQ became the basis for the new Twelfth Army) and the AA organisation in Burma was regrouped. By the end of the month, 101st HAA Rgt was at Meiktila under 24 AA Bde, and 379 HAA Bty disbanded on 14 July 1945.Farndale Far East, p. 305.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 27‚Äì9. After the Japanese surrender on 15 August, the regiment was at Rangoon with just its original batteries (226 and 297), where it was placed in suspended animation between 1 September and 1 December 1945. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed as 501 (Mobile) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, now based at Fairfield Camp, Aberdeen. It formed part of 78 AA Bde (the former 52 AA Bde at Perth).Frederick, p. 1018.Litchfield, p. 272.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson TA 1947. In March 1955, AA Command was abolished, and there were wholesale disbandments and amalgamations among its units. 501 HAA Regiment merged into 275 Regiment, RA (the former 75th (Highland) Field Rgt from which 297 HAA Bty had originally been transferred).Frederick, p. 1000.

Population SH4. The county has 43,000 inhabitants. Gjirokast√´r is home to an ethnic Greek community that according to one source numbered about 4000 in 1989, although Greek spokesmen have claimed that up to 34% of the town is Greek. Gjirokast√´r is considered the center of the Greek community in Albania. Greek population Given the large Greek population in the town and surrounding area, there is a Greek consulate in the town.Country profile: Bulgaria, Albania. Economist Intelligence Unit, 1996. \\"Greece has also opened a consulate in the southern town of Gjirokaster, which has a large ethnic Greek population.\\" In fieldwork undertaken by Greek scholar Leonidas Kallivretakis in the area during 1992, the district of Gjirokast√´r had 66.000 inhabitants of which 40% were Greeks, 12% Vlachs and an Orthodox Albanian population of 21%. These communities are Orthodox and collectively made up 63% of the district's Christian population. While 28% were Muslim Albanians. Overall the Greek community was the most numerous ethno-religious group (40%), while Albanians, irrespective of religious background, in 1992 were a plurality and collectively consisted 49% of the district's total population. Gjirokast√´r district Within Gjirokast√´r district, Greeks populate all the settlements of both former municipalities of Dropull i Sip√´rm and Dropull i Posht√´m and also all settlements of Pogon municipality (except the village of Selck√´).Dalakoglou, Dimitris (2010). \\"The road: An ethnography of the Albanian‚ÄìGreek cross‚Äêborder motorway.\\" American Ethnologist. 37.

Epirus: the Geography, the Ancient Remains, the History and Topography of Epirus and Adjacent Areas. Clarendon Press. p.27. \\" Albanian-speaking villages The present distribution of the Albanian-speaking villages bears little relation to the frontier which was drawn between Greece and Albania after the First World War. In Map 2 I have shown most of the Greek speaking villages in Albanian Epirus and some of the Albanian-speaking villages in Greek Epirus. The map is based on observations made by Clarke and myself during our travels between 1922 and 1939.\\"; p.28-29. In Llunxheri√´ the villages are more compact but smaller, Shtegopul and Saraginisht√´, for instance, having only fifty houses each; the people of Llunxheri√´ are all Albanian Orthodox Christians, except those of Erind, who are partly Christian and Mohammedan, and the men, but not the women, know some Greek. Zagori√´ has the same characteristics, its ten villages extending from Doshnic√´ to Shepr; the group is endogamous and does not marry with the people of Llunxheri√´. Pogoni, or Paleo-Pogoni as some people call it, consists of seven Greek-speaking villages nearly 3,000 ft. above sea-level (Poli√ßan, Skor√´, Hlomo, Sopik, Mavrojer, √áatist√´, and, on the Greek side of the frontier, Drimadhes), the biggest, Poli√ßan, has a population of 2,500 persons and Sopik has 300 houses. The Pogoniates normally marry only within their group, but occasionally a bride may be taken from Zagori√´ and then she is taught Greek.\\" Mixed population Gjirokast√´r has a mixed population consisting of Muslim Albanians, Greeks and an Orthodox Albanian population while the city in 1992 had an overall Albanian majority.Kallivretakis, Leonidas (1995). \\"Œó ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ œÖœÄœå œÑŒø œÄœÅŒØœÉŒºŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ≥ŒµœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±œÇ [The Greek Community of Albania in terms of historical geography and demography.\\" In Nikolakopoulos, Ilias, Kouloubis Theodoros A. & Thanos M.

In English it was sometimes called the Aurangian College, in Dutch , , or , and in French . History left Breda was the seat in the Netherlands of the House of Orange-Nassau, although the city was several times lost to the Spanish. At the Siege of Breda of 1637 the city was finally recaptured by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and in 1646 he founded the college, modelling it on Saumur, Geneva, and Oxford, to train young men of good family for the army and the civil service.Lodewijck Huygens, The English Journal: 1651-1652 (Brill Archive, 1982), p. 13 As its home he provided the Kloosterkazerne, previously a nunnery.Bulletin van den Nederlandschen Oudheidkundigen Bond (Nederlandsche Oudheidkundige Bond, 1914), p. 119 Jan van Vliet travelled to Breda, taking his whole family with him, to be present at the inauguration of the college on 16 September 1646.Cornelis Dekker, The Origins of Old Germanic Studies in the Low Countries (1999), p. 72 Andr√© Rivet, the learned French Huguenot tutor of the future William II of Orange, was the first Rector of the college.C. D. Andriesse, Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle (2005), p. 80 At the time the college was founded, Breda was a town of only about 4,000 inhabitants, not counting the soldiers.Dror Wahrman, Mr Collier's Letter Racks: A Tale of Art and Illusion (2012), p. 171: \\"The years of civil unrest in England, especially following Charles I's execution in 1649, intensified Breda's English and Stuart connections. The town, whose population was no more than four thousand people without counting the soldiers, became a haven for numerous English royalists and their families who were forced into exile in large numbers in the 1640s and 1650s.\\" Six months after its establishment, the college had fewer than sixty students, and its level and status were still unclear. In the event, it proved to be \\"a general training-centre for young men of quality, many of whom were to be officers or already held that rank in the Prince's army\\". However, a high proportion of those taught were French Huguenots and English expatriates.Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London Volume 22 (Huguenot Society of London, 1976), p. 33 Christiaan Huygens was admitted in March 1647 to study law, transferring from Leiden, and proved to be the most brilliant of Breda's students.C.C.

It was used primarily for office buildings, residences and movie theaters, during a period when India was part of the British Empire. On 30 June 2018, an ensemble of such buildings were officially recognized as a World Heritage site by the UNESCO World Heritage committee held in Bahrain as the Victorian and Art Deco Ensemble of Mumbai. Mumbai is believed to have the second-most number of Art Deco buildings in the world, after Miami. History The Indian Institute of Architects, founded in Bombay in 1929, played a prominent role in propagating the Art Deco movement. In November 1937, this institute organized the 'Ideal Home Exhibition' held in the Town Hall in Mumbai which spanned over 12 days and attracted about one hundred thousand visitors. As a result, it was declared a success by the 'Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects'. The exhibits displayed the 'ideal', or better described as the most 'modern' arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models. The exhibition focused on various elements of a home ranging from furniture, elements of interior decoration as well as radios and refrigerators using new and scientifically relevant materials and methods. Guided by their desire to emulate the west, the Indian architects were fascinated by the industrial modernity that Art Deco offered. The western elites were the first to experiment with the technologically advanced facets of Art Deco, and architects began the process of transformation by the early 1930s. Bombay's expanding port commerce in the 1930s resulted in the growth of educated middle class population. It also saw an increase of people migrating to Bombay in search of job opportunities. This led to the pressing need for new developments through Land Reclamation Schemes and construction of new public and residential buildings. Parallelly, the changing political climate in the country and the aspirational quality of the Art Deco aesthetics led to a whole-hearted acceptance of the building style in the city's development. Most of the buildings from this period can be seen spread throughout the city neighbourhoods in areas such as Churchgate, Colaba, Fort, Mohammed Ali Road, Cumbala Hill, Dadar, Matunga, Bandra and Chembur. Characteristics Eros Cinema (1938) Regal Cinema Streamlining and rounded corners Rounded corners and streamlined designs influenced by the design of airplanes, ships, trains, and automobiles in the early 20th century, made buildings appear aerodynamic, fast, futuristic and sleek. This was done with the intention to make Art Deco buildings appear modern and sophisticated. Nautical features Being a port city, Bombay was influenced by the era's new ocean liners: Bremen (1929), Queen Mary (1936) and Queen Elizabeth (1940). As a result of this enchantment with the luxury and grandeur that these ocean liners brought with them buildings were manifested with nautical features such as porthole windows, ship deck-style railings and observatory towers. The frozen fountain The motif of the frozen fountain, a historical symbol for eternal life was popularized by the French Glass designer Rene Lalique. Some of his best-known works were seen in his designs at the 1926 Paris exposition. This symbol soon became a prevalent feature in building facades and metal grills on Art Deco buildings across Bombay Influences alt=While Art Deco buildings in Bombay were associated with futurism, as seen in their streamlined and sleek facades, certain buildings also integrated themes of traditional Indian mythology into their design. Depictions of toiling Indian farmers, Hindu gods and goddesses and figures from Indian mythology were often incorporated into facade reliefs. Egyptian and classical Elements The discovery of the tomb of King Tutakhamun in Egypt lead to a worldwide fascination with ancient Egyptian themes and symbols. Sphinxes, hard edged geometry and hieroglyphic styles made their way into the Indian urban Landscape. Influences of the features of traditional Greek and Roman temples could also be seen in buildings across Bombay. Tropical imagery Influenced by the city's abundance of tropical vegetation, Bombay's Art deco buildings are externally decorated with stylized forms of waves, sunburst rays, tropical flora and fauna which can be seen in porch railings, facades, metal balcony grilles, ornamental gates and porch railings. Eyebrows Eyebrows are projecting edges or \\"shelves\\" above a structures portico to shade from direct sunlight and keep the interior cool. These also highlighted the rhythmic horizontality of buildings. Architectural lettering Art Deco lettering on buildings took on the sleek and streamlined appeal of the structure of these buildings. Typefaces consisted of a combination of straight lines and segments of circles. Ziggurats and zigzags In the 1930s, the height of buildings in Bombay was limited by strict developmental regulations over reclaimed land. In order to evoke allusions to the verticality of skyscrapers whilst being restricted in their height, Art Deco architects used the concept of stepping up and stepping back of roof lines, used to mimic a ziggurat (a temple tower design adopted by Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians of ancient Mesopotamia). Materials The Art Deco movement encouraged the replacement of materials such as stone, brick and concrete with steel columns, beams and reinforced concrete. The advent of Reinforced concrete in the early 1900s proved to be a boon in disguise providing a changeover to high- rise buildings to accommodate increasing population density in Bombay. Notable buildings \\"In Malabar and Cumbala hills, attractive Art Deco homes were built for the rich\\". Other parts of the city such as Fort, Apollo Bunder, Colaba, Dadar, and Mahim also witnessed the construction of office buildings, homes and apartment buildings created to fit the style of Art Deco. Soon the construction of a forty foot wide road and a ten-foot wide pavement on Marine Drive began. This was accompanied by the construction of Art Deco apartment blocks looking out onto the Arabian Sea. The street behind these apartment blocks was lined with modern buildings of steel and concrete that were separated from the medieval Victorian structures by the Oval Maidan. The centerpieces of the Art Deco glorification of modernity were the grand new Cinema theatres: Regal, Eros and Metro. These were followed by the construction of the New Empire and Liberty cinemas, after the Second World War. Art Deco architects A majority of Art Deco buildings in Mumbai were built by a breed of architects (mostly Indian) who were trained along the ideologies of modern architecture of the time. Other than their education, most of these architects were also sponsored by their clients to travel to world cities such as London, Paris and New York to experience and understand the architectural style (Art Deco) prevalent at the time. Upon their return, these architects designed buildings that very skillfully combined the design aesthetics of Art Deco with cultural context of India. These buildings were thoughtfully designed keeping in mind the climatic conditions prevalent in the Indian sub-continent. Climate responsive architecture and Bombay Deco were born. Preservation The oldest Art Deco precinct in the city lies along the western boundary of Oval Maidan in Fort, Mumbai. Presence of administrative buildings, educational institutions, research institutions and cultural spaces along with clusters of residential buildings encourages the local (and global) population to engage with its built heritage. This has led to the creation of various citizen groups who actively participate in safeguarding these built resources for the future generation like Urban Design Research Institute, NAGAR, The Oval Trust, Art Deco Mumbai and Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens' Association, to name a few. One of the significant steps taken by these groups and other professionals have been to petition to secure UNESCO World Heritage Site status. This petition in the form of nomination was successfully adopted during the 42nd Session of the World Heritage Committee and the site \\"Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensemble of Mumbai\\" was inscribed as a World Heritage Site on 30 June 2018 in Manama, Bahrain. Oval Maidan (the historic cricket grounds) attracts locals to play cricket on the grounds during holidays and the weekend. Closeness to Marine Drive (one of the largest open spaces in the city) also attracts many tourist and locals to enjoy the view and breeze along the art deco promenade.

The town was named after the local indigenous meaning for wild duck. White settlers moved to the district in the 1860s and by the next decade there was enough population for two schools and a hotel to be opened in the 1870s, it remained a farming district until the 1970s when demand for urban housing began. Mitchell River The Mitchell River flows into Lake King and Jones Bay at Eagle Point Bluff. The Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson rivers deliver a combined discharge of 1.1 gigalitres per year into the lakes system. The Strategic Management Plan quotes that about 100,000 tonnes of suspended solids (excluding bottom sediments) are estimated to enter the Gippsland Lakes each year from the catchments of the Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson rivers alone. Sediment loads from the western catchments (discharging to Lake Wellington) deliver two to three times the nutrient and sediment loads than from the eastern catchments (Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers). Comparison of aerial photographs spanning 1935 to 1997 demonstrate that the vast majority of shorelines are eroding at an average of less than 10 cm per year. The lower reaches of the Latrobe River, Thomson River and Mitchell River flow into the Gippsland Lakes and have extensive floodplains in which there are large wetlands, often separated by natural levees from the main river channels. The Mitchell river flats were always prone to flooding and 1891 bore witness to the flood that was only second in extent to the great floods of 1870. The biggest floods recorded were in 1893‚Äì94 with them being 76 mm higher than the 1870 water levels. All floods caused the township great suffering with loss of life, infrastructure and crops. The flooding that occurred in the 1893‚Äì94 was notable for the gallantry of Patrick Piggott and George Brooks who both worked to rescue people. However, on their last trip their boat tipped as they moored it and both men were swept into the river and drowned. A witness remonstrated that; \\"‚Ä¶to the very last, they fought bravely for their lives against fearful odds\\". Both men are remembered upon a marble tablet installed at the Mechanics' Hall (The Bairnsdale Library). The Mitchell Delta is represented as a type-L under the Ramsar wetland type classification framework, which means that it is a permanent inland delta. The Mitchell Delta is a classic form of digitate delta (from Latin digitƒÅtus, having finger or toes and is located near the western shoreline of Lake King at Eagle Point Bluff, extending into the lake as silt jetties formed by alluvial deposition of sediment. The Mitchell Delta represents one of the finest examples of this type of landform in the world and is a site deemed of international geomorphological significance and is one of the finest examples of a classic digitate delta in the world.  Football  The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the East Gippsland Football League. One of the founding clubs of the league in 1974, they are known as the Tigers. They have been premiers three times, 1992, 2003, & 2015\\\\.

More MPs were sent, up to 120 in total, and Park Street was closed with buses. In subsequent confrontations an MP was stabbed, a black GI was shot dead, and several others were wounded. Background During World War II, African-Americans formed 10 per cent of US Army servicemen in Britain, a total of about 150,000 in 1944. Most were in labour companies, engineers, stevedores and transport units. Many were based in the Bristol area because of the docks there. They had their barracks in Bedminster, Brislington, Henleaze, Shirehampton and the Muller Orphanage at Ashley Down. The US Armed Forces were still racially segregated, and the soldiers of the labour companies were almost entirely black, while most of their officers were white, as were the MPs. Military commanders tended to treat these service units as \\"dumping grounds\\" for less competent officers, and leadership in the labour companies was poor. The British government did not approve of segregation but decided they could not interfere in the treatment of African-American people enlisted in the US army. The British authorities would not organise segregated facilities nor enforce segregation in non-US Army facilities. In response the US Army administration encouraged separate days along the week for black and white troops to have leave passes. The US military actively developed a policy that involved the segregation of many facilities in Britain. Two separate Red Cross centres existed in Bristol: St George Street for coloured GIs; and Berkeley Square for whites. Earlier incidents There were frequent clashes between black and white GIs. A US survey of soldiers' mail during the war revealed that white troops were particularly indignant about the public association of white women with black soldiers, which was unremarkable in Britain. In June 1943 a significant racial incident, the Battle of Bamber Bridge, led to one death, 7 wounded and 32 court martialled; this followed the riots in Detroit earlier that week. In September 1943 at Launceston in Cornwall there was another armed confrontation between black GIs and MPs which left two MPs wounded; 14 black GIs were court martialled. The days before the Park Street Riot saw an increase in tension between the black and white GIs. On 10 July at the Muller Orphanage, where some of the black troops were billeted, several white paratroopers arrived. The black soldiers claimed that they were insulted and then beaten by the paratroopers. 545th Port Company mutiny On the night of 12‚Äì13 July the 545th Port Company, an all-black segregated unit that was billeted at Sea Mills, mutinied. On the morning of 13 July the company refused direct orders to report for duty and remained in the barracks. They demanded better treatment from their officers, better accommodation for the soldiers in the guardhouse, and a halt to the paratroopers chasing black GIs through the streets of Bristol. The mutiny ended the same evening, without violence. One black soldier, Robert Davis of 542nd Port Company was accused of inciting the mutiny, and was court martialled on 6 September 1944 in Newport. He was sentenced to hard labour for life. Riot On the evening of Saturday 15 July approximately 400 black GIs gathered in the area of Park Street. Some of them were accompanied by white British women and a US military policeman stopped them. This caused a minor disturbance which prompted the deployment of more policemen. In total 120 armed military policemen attended. The black soldiers were gathered to march back to the trucks that were to drive them to their barracks. The MPs tried to disarm some of them who had knives. The black soldiers refused to hand them over, their colleagues intervened and in the resulting confrontation one policeman was stabbed and his attacker shot dead. The MPs restored control by closing off the street with buses and shooting several GIs in the legs. Many black GIs were arrested and several were sent to the local hospital. A curfew was established in Bristol for many days afterwards.

The story follows Kate Madison and her family. The title for the novel comes from the idea that she cannot keep her children from ‚Äúplaying against the odds‚Äù in their choice of romantic partners. The novel peaked at No. 3 on the New York Times Best Sellers List. Characters *Kate Madison- A mother and a businesswoman. Kate's husband died years ago, leaving her with four small children and an uncompleted education. Years later, she became a successful businesswoman. *Bernard Michel- A French man and Kate's love interest *Isabelle- Kate's confident lawyer daughter who falls for a client, Zach Holbrook, that she is representing in a criminal case *Zach Holbrook- A drug dealer who has recently been cut off from his trust fund and refuses to get a real job *Willie- Kate's youngest son *Julie- Kate's daughter. A meek fashion designer who abandons her career and moves across the country to be with her new husband *Justin- Kate's son and Julie's twin. He is a writer and the most together of Kate's children. He and his partner Richard deal with the struggles of parenthood. *Peter-Julie's husband. He was perfect before the marriage then started to maltreat Julie when they got married. Plot The book revolves around Kate Madison, a widow who owns a successful retail shop in SoHo. Kate is dedicated to her four adult children, but grows frustrated with their choice of partners that are seemingly not right for them. Kate learns to allow her children to make their own decisions, and be there for them unconditionally. Kate also has a brief love affair of her own, falling for the Frenchman Bernard Michel. However, she later finds out that he is married, and realizes she is in the same position of choosing an ill-suited partner as her children. Reception James Kidd of the South China Morning Post gave the book two out of five stars, stating that the novel was propelled more by the heroine's children then the heroine herself, and that much of the novel consists of the protagonist contemplating ‚Äúher brood‚Äôs stupidest decisions as if they are Nobel Prize acceptance speeches.‚Äù Kidd concluded his review by adding ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, if predictable.‚Äù Marilyn Gore of The Free Press Journal criticized the novel for its slow beginning and called the writing ‚Äúphoned-in.‚Äù She also criticized the novel for its lack of character development, saying ‚ÄúThese horrible partners ‚Äî the deadbeat druggie manchild, the abusive future murderer and the cheat ‚Äî come off as caricatures rather than rounded characters.‚Äù References Category:2017 American novels Category:Novels by Danielle Steel ","title":"Against All Odds (novel)"},{"id":"56548262","text":"Ward P√©tr√© (born 30 January 1997) is a Belgian short track speed skater.

E. van Vogt, originally published in Astounding in March 1946. It was included in several anthologies, including 1952's Destination: Universe!. Plot Dr. Alexander Latham is a Washington-based psychomedician, one who studies human reactions to the point they can almost read minds. At a dinner party, another guest is defending his argument that in these modern times anything can be made artificially. When someone objects that the human mind is too complex, he responds that the psychoactive drug known simply as h effectively makes a second mind. The hostess invites Latham to recount a story of its use. In the post-war era, a number of European nationalities were barred from the United States except for medical reasons, and the government began to suspect they were using hospitals to set up clandestine meetings. Latham is part of a program to canvas hospitals looking for these meetings. He finds the secret meeting space in a hospital in Middle City, but the group, The Committee, is prepared for his arrival. He only just manages to escape. Meeting his secretary in a diner to plan their escape from the city, they find themselves the topic of a police bulletin on the television. Latham attempts to call his superiors, but the call is intercepted and rerouted to a member of The Committee. They manage to make it to an air-taxi stand, only to find the driver immediately recognizes them as well. They take off and force the driver to parachute from the cab. Pondering how the group could have possibly hypnotized everyone they meet, Latham finally realizes they must have used the \\"h-drug\\", developed by his former professor, which induces a sort of hypnosis. He surmises The Committee has put it in the water supply and then triggered it through radio and television. The chase continues until his secretary suddenly changes emotionally and pulls a gun on him, also under the influence of h. He is returned to the Committee's meeting room, where it is explained that their group has existed for hundreds of years, plotting to build a ruling elite. Minor events like Napoleon and the US's independence have set their plans back over the years, but with the use of h, they finally have the tool needed to complete their domination of the US and England. Given a chance to speak, Latham notes they have missed an important point about h. It is not a hypnosis drug in the common sense of the term, it actually releases a second personality, one that is highly suggestible. He goes on to note that there is a third such personality, which can also be released with h. The Committee members realize what he is implying too late; as they rush to trigger a weapon to kill him, Latham orders the guards to shoot the device. Back at the dinner party, the other guest concedes that he did not truly understand h. Reception The Rulers has not been widely reviewed. One of the few to mention it was a 1952 review of Destination: Universe in Galaxy Science Fiction which mentions the \\"coldness of his writing and the woodenness of his characterizations\\" and calling the story as one \\"from his Complicated Periods\\".

Having suffered from ill-health as a juvenile she recorded an emphatic win in the Epsom Oaks on her second racecourse appearance. She went on to win the Coronation Stakes and three other races as well as finishing second in the Jockey Club Stakes and a possibly unlucky fourth in the St Leger. She failed to win in the following year and was retired from racing. As a broodmare she produced the St Leger winner Keysoe and was the female-line ancestor of Display and Ballymoss. Background Keystone was a bay mare bred in England by her owner Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby. The filly was sent intotraining with George Lambton at Bedford Lodge stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by Persimmon, whose wins included the Derby, St Leger, Eclipse Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup and who went on to be British champion sire on four occasions. Her dam Lock and Key was a minor winner and a descendant of the influential British broodmare Splitvote. Racing career 1905: two-year-old season Keystone was troubled with a respiratory infection in 1905 and made her only appearance in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. She ran with some promise although she finished sixth of the eight runners behind the colt Achilles. 1906: three-year-old season 16th Earl of Derby, Keystone's owner and breeder On her first run as a three-year-old Keystone was partnered by the American jockey Danny Maher in the 128th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 1 of June. Despite her lack of experience she was made the 5/2 ahead of the Duke of Portland's Quair (3/1) and William Bass's Gold Riach (5/1). The race began in \\"very threatening\\" weather conditions and finished in a hailstorm. Keystone took the lead two fulongs out and never looked in any danger of defeat, winning the race \\"in very easy style\\" by three lengths from Gold Riach with a gap of six lengths back to Snow Glory in third. Later in June the filly was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. With Maher again in the saddle she won at odds of 8/13. On 12 September at Doncaster Keystone was matched against male opposition in the St Leger and started the 5/4 favourite. In a very close race she joined the leaders in the straight but after being hampered in a very rough race she faded in the final strides and finished fourth behind the colts Troutbeck, Prince William and Beppo, beaten less than a length by the winner. Two weeks after the Leger she finished second to Beppo in the ¬£10,000 Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmarket. In October she returned to form to take the ¬£5,000 Sandown Park Great Foal Stakes, starting at odds of 1/4 and winning easily from Wombwell and Prince William. She won at least two other races that year including a minor race at Liverpool at the end of the year. 1907: four-year-old season Keystone remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recapture her best form and did not win a race. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Keystone an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Keystone was the biggest winner of first-place prize money in England in 1906, with her five wins yielding ¬£12,832. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Keystone became a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. On her owner's death in 1908 she passed into the ownership of his son the 17th Earl. She produced at least eight foals between 1911 and 1924: *Lock Up, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1911, sired by Bridge of Canny *Keynote, filly, 1912, by Radium. *Hemlock, bay filly, 1913, by Spearmint. Granddam of Display *Trestle, brown filly, 1915, by Swynford. Granddam of The Nile (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) *Keysoe, brown filly, 1916, by Swynford. Won the St Leger. Female- line ancestor of Ballymoss *Archaic, chestnut colt, 1917, by Polymelus. Runner-up in the Derby *Phalange, bay filly, 1921, by Phalaris *Bythorne, brown filly, 1924, by Swynford Pedigree * Keystone was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Lord Clifden,menaing that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1914 to 1940. It was also known as Murgon Provisional School and Murgon Rural School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 October 2015.  History  Murgon State School opened in 1908 as Murgon Provisional School (changing to Murgon State School in 1909) within the small agricultural settlement of Murgon, to serve its growing rural population. A new teaching building replaced the original provisional school building in 1917 and shortly afterwards, in 1925, the school began operating as a rural school. By the mid-1930s the school complex had grown to include a range of vocational teaching buildings, including a blacksmith's shop (1930, extended 1935-36) and domestic science building (1935‚Äì36). Due to the loss of the southern portion of the original school reserve in 1915 for the construction of the Murgon-Proston railway line, school expansion occurred to the north between 1959 and 1972, resuming part of Fryar Street and acquiring the former Murgon Court House (1940) for educational purposes. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. The first European settlers arrived in the Murgon area, the traditional land of the Wakka Wakka people, in the 1840s, taking up land which is now known as Barambah Homestead.'Murgon State School', in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008. In 1901 part of Barambah pastoral station became the Barambah Mission Station - known as Cherbourg from 1932.'Cherbourg Aboriginal Shire Council', http://queenslandplaces.com.au/cherbourg-aboriginal-shire-council, accessed 4 August 2015. The nearby town of Murgon, about to the north, grew around the location of an unattended timber loading siding, which opened in 1903 on the Nanango railway line from Kilkivan to Kingaroy. The railway, which facilitated the transport of local produce - maize and pumpkins, pigs, cattle and dairy products - to markets, spurred an influx of selectors who took up land excised from Barambah Station in 1902 and again in 1913.'Murgon Civic Centre', QHR 602812. Murgon was surveyed and the sale of town lots took place in 1906. Murgon's development was stimulated by the creation of the Shire of Murgon in 1914, with Murgon as its administrative centre; and the construction of a railway line from Murgon to Proston (commenced 1916, completed 1923), with a branch line to Windera (1925).'Murgon Civic Centre', QHR 602812'Work for Unemployed', The Brisbane Courier, 22 April 1916, p.4. The early basis for the prosperity of Murgon was the dairy industry. During the interwar period dairying expanded greatly in Queensland, and by the 1930s it was the state's most widely spread agricultural industry. While butter factories enabled the production and export of dairy products, numerous small farms, reliant on family labour to milk herds twice daily for generally modest returns, were the backbone of the industry.'South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory (former)', QHR 602811. Cream from Murgon's dairy farmers was initially railed to the Tiaro butter factory, which relocated to Murgon in 1913. Murgon's butter factory (the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory) was extended in the late 1920s, and by 1931 it was Queensland's fourth largest butter producer. By the mid- to late-1930s Murgon was rapidly expanding as a service centre for its surrounding agricultural community, and a new and impressive Art-Deco style Murgon Civic Centre was built in 1938. In 1911 Murgon's population had been 706;'Murgon and Murgon Shire', http://queenslandplaces.com.au/murgon-and-murgon-shire, accessed 4 August 2015. however by 1941 it was the second largest centre (after Kingaroy) in the South Burnett, with a population of 1091. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. Steps towards the establishment of a school in Murgon began in 1906. In September of that year George Arnell, president of the Murgon Progress Association, wrote to the Minister for Education about opening a school in Murgon. A building committee was later formed and a site for the school reserve was selected on the north side of town.75th Anniversary (1908-1983) 26 February 1983, Murgon State School, 1983, n.p. The reserve of , bounded by Gore, Fryar, Bell (now Krebs) and Stephens streets, was proclaimed in August 1907.'Crown Lands', The Queenslander, 10 August 1907, p.34Survey Plan Fy352, 1907. Contractors McKewan and Woods were the successful tenderers for the erection of the school at Murgon, and it was completed in November 1907. Located in the southern quarter of the school reserve, the school building comprised a single classroom with verandahs front and back.'Notes and News', Gympie Times and Mary River Mining Gazette, 4 July 1907, p.375th Anniversary (1908-1983) 26 February 1983, Murgon State School, 1983, n.pDepartment of Public Works Plan 871/439/1, \\"Murgon State School Block Plan\\", . The school opened as Murgon Provisional School on 24 February 1908 with an enrolment of 40 pupils, increasing to 67 pupils by the end of March.'Murgon', Gympie Times and Mary River Mining Gazette, 4 April 1908, p.4. Provisional schools, which could be opened with as few as 15 (later 12) pupils, were regarded as interim measures until state schools were built. If the district or town developed, provisional schools were raised to state school status, with larger, purpose- designed school buildings and teacher residences constructed, attracting better qualified and more experienced teachers. Murgon Provisional School became a State School in 1909, only a year after opening. Over time the building was enlarged and raised, with space underneath used for classes and later partially enclosed.The Brisbane Courier, 17 December 1909, p.2Project Services, \\"Murgon State School\\", heritage report, 2007Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p.2Hector Holthouse, Looking Back. The first 150 years of Queensland schools, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1975, pp.16-17. In 1914 a teacher's residence was added to the site, fulfilling \\"a long felt need\\"'New Buildings', Queensland Times, 24 July 1914, p.3. Most Queensland state schools incorporated a teacher's residence on the site, particularly in rural areas. In Australia, only Queensland offered free accommodation to teachers, the government policy applying to male teachers (only) from as early as 1864. This was partial recompense for a low wage, an incentive for teacher recruitment in rural areas and provided onsite caretakers.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p.4Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp.33-5. From the 1880s they were built as detached residences and were similar to the vernacular Queensland house. Designed by the Department of Public Works and constructed to the high standard demanded by the state, teacher's residences were typically of a higher-quality than most similarly-scaled private residences. The residence was located within the school grounds at a distance from the teaching buildings, usually with a separate, fenced yard. Residence designs varied in size and evolved to keep up with modern needs and styles. In May 1914, W Bytheway was announced as the successful tenderer for the construction of the teacher's residence at Murgon State School, for a cost of ¬£686.'Public Works', The Brisbane Courier, 30 May 1914, p.5. A standard Department of Public Works design,Type C/R3, according to type classifications contained within Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, 1996. the residence was timber-framed and -clad with a hipped roof. The layout comprised: a front verandah with central staircase; a four-room core containing a sitting room, dining room and two bedrooms; an internal semi-enclosed dining verandah (running the full width of the residence); and a rear wing containing a kitchen, pantry, bathroom and servants bedroom. The residence was located northeast of the teaching building, facing Gore Street.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study: Conservation Management, p29Department of Public Works Plan 871/439/1, \\"Murgon State School Block Plan\\", Department of Public Works Plan 871/505/2A, 'Murgon State School Head Teacher's Residence', 1964. The following year, confirmation that the route of the proposed Murgon-to-Proston railway line would pass diagonally through the centre of the School Reserve meant that major changes were needed at the school. The newly completed teacher's residence could remain in place; however the teaching building was now partly overlapped by the railway reserve. A new School Reserve was surveyed in 1915 and assented to by the Department of Education. Now triangular in shape, it occupied the north-eastern half of the block, on the corner of Gore and Fryar streets, with the main entrance from Fryar Street. Construction of the railway line began in 1916.'The Murgon-Proston Railway', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 10 July 1915, p.9'Murgon-Proston Railway: Turning of the First Sod', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 1 February 1916, p.4Survey Plan RP28463, 1915 Prior to the removal of the original teaching building,Part of the Provisional School building was relocated in to Hillsdale State School, source: Judy Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways: 100 years of education at Murgon State School\\", 2008, p.9. a new State School building of a standard government design was constructed in 1917 within the new school reserve. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in their response to climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.84, 120-1. From 1893 the Department of Public Works greatly improved the natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors, experimenting with different combinations of roof ventilators, ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. High-set buildings, introduced , provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play area underneath. This was a noticeable new direction and this form became a characteristic of Queensland schools. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous ventilation flap on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, combined with a ceiling vent and large roof fleche, improved internal air quality and decreased internal temperatures.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.19-20. Achieving an adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, became central to the design and layout of all school buildings. From around 1909 windows were arranged to provide gentle, southern light into the room and desks positioned so that the light would fall onto students' left hand sides to avoid throwing shadows onto the pages; this presupposed that all students were right-handed.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.19-20. In 1914 the suburban school type was introduced, combining these new features and providing an ideal, modern education environment.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.21. The new Murgon State School building (now Block A) was a standard suburban school type.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.40. A highset timber building with a gable roof, it comprised: three classrooms divided by glazed, folding partitions; a northern verandah with hat room enclosures at each end; and an attached teacher's room. The arrangement of windows and desks ensured that left-hand light entered the classrooms, with large banks of casements in the end walls and in the centre of the southwest wall. The interior walls were lined with v-jointed (VJ), tongue-and-groove (T&G;) timber boards and the ceiling with pressed metal. Classrooms were vented by a continuous hinged ventilation board at floor level and ceiling vents which linked to a prominent roof fleche. A concrete play area was provided beneath the school with lavatories battened off under the hat rooms.Department of Public Works Plan 71/20/4/1, \\"Murgon State School\\", 1916Department of Public Works Plan 71/20/4/2, \\"Murgon State School\\", 1916Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", pp.6-8. Constructed by day labour for an estimated cost of ¬£1560, the building was opened on 18 October 1917. It was located northeast of the teacher's residence, facing Fryar Street.Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", pp.6-8'Day Labour Works', The Telegraph, 24 February 1917, p.9 Less than two years after opening, in May 1919, the school was closed temporarily due to a local outbreak of the worldwide influenza pandemic. The school building was converted for use as an isolation hospital and a kitchen erected, at a cost of ¬£30. In early June there were over 17 patients at the hospital, with the doctor also affected. By the end of June the epidemic was abating.'Murgon', Queensland Times, 29 May 1919, p.5'District Reports', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 9 June 1919, p.3'District Reports: Epidemic Waning', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 23 June 1919, p.3. Murgon continued to prosper in the 1920s, with dairying and pig rearing the mainstays of the district. In August 1923 the chairman of Murgon Shire Council met with the Minister for Education and asked that a rural school be erected at Murgon. The Minister responded that if the district raised sufficient money a rural school would be built. A committee of shire councillors was formed to raise the necessary funds.'In the Cotton Fields', The Brisbane Courier, 30 April 1923, p.12'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 23 August 1923, p.7. Despite the importance of the rural sector in the Queensland economy, rural education and training was slow to develop, with no significant action taken until the 1890s.Moreton Bay Courier, 6 July 1850. In 1897 the Queensland Agricultural College was established at Lawes near Gatton, providing agricultural and related scientific training for young men.Hector Holthouse, Looking Back. The first 150 years of Queensland schools, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1975, p. 128. Under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Stock, the college was part of a wider scheme of introducing \\"scientific agriculture\\" to the colony that also included experimental farms and travelling model dairies.Greg Logan, \\"American Prophet among Queensland Farmers: the troubled career of EM Shelton, 1890-98\\" in Educational Historian, 3:1, 1990, pp. i-iv. Within the school system, a limited form of rural instruction was introduced in syllabus changes made in 1905 and 1915. However, the success of \\"nature studies\\" in state schools was dependent on the enthusiasm of individual teachers. A new approach, utilising central agricultural primary schools, staffed with trained experts and drawing students from nearby state schools, was envisaged. The purpose of rural schools was to educate children to enable them to develop rural areas and to provide a means of extending country children's education beyond the compulsory years with an additional year of agricultural and domestic studies.Tony James Brady, The Rural School Experiment: Creating a Queensland Yeoman, QUT, doctoral thesis, 2013, p. 167'Nambour's Rural School', Nambour Chronicle, 29 October 1915, p. 5 cited by Brady, The Rural School Experiment', p. 10. John Douglas Story, Under Secretary of Public Instruction from 1906,J D Storey was Acting Secretary of Public Instruction from 1905 before being made permanent in 1906. believed that Queensland's future depended on agricultural development, and between 1914 and 1916 he finalised a plan for three tiers of agricultural education - rural schools, state high schools, and an Agricultural Department at the University of Queensland.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p.4. In 1910 Story appointed James Clement Stubbin to provide expert guidance as Queensland's Teacher of Agriculture. Stubbin promoted the notion of a scientific approach to agriculture by writing a textbook on the school garden, agricultural bulletins, and constantly touring schools to personally give lessons on topics such as milk and cream testing, planting and pruning. The first rural school was established as an adjunct to Nambour State School in 1917. The success of this venture prompted the expansion of rural schools and courses in Queensland.Blake, \\"Chapter 9: Educating Queenslanders\\", p. 12. Altogether 30 rural schools opened in Queensland between 1917 and 1939, with three, including Murgon, opening in 1925. Each was located in prime fruit-growing, dairying or agricultural areas and functioned \\"as a central school for the surrounding district schools, teaching domestic, commercial, agricultural and vocational classes\\".Brady, The Rural School Experiment, pp. ii152. Vocational training subjects required a variety of purpose-built facilities and were initially gender segregated - for example, woodwork, metalwork and leather work classes for boys, cooking, sewing and laundry classes for girls.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, pp.3-5'Murgon Rural School: An Immediate Success', The Brisbane Courier, 11 July 1925, p.15. Many rural schools were opened in sectional school buildings, however it was not always possible to construct new vocational buildings, with some schools altering or converting existing buildings.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study p.108For example, at Marburg Rural School [QHR 650002] in 1923 a former school building was cut in half and refitted to form vocational buildings. Standard, purpose-designed vocational buildings were first introduced in 1928. In 1936 the Minister for Education permitted students to take vocational subjects in lieu of geography or history in the Junior Examination, increasing the subjects' popularity.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study p.58. The Murgon community raised the necessary funds for a rural school by January 1924.'Marvellous Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 29 January 1924, p.4. In order to accommodate the rural school classes, the understorey of the 1917 teaching building was enclosed and divided into three spaces. The external walls were clad in weatherboards, with casement windows providing light and ventilation. Domestic Science was taught in the southeast room, and had a stove alcove and a sink installed along the southeast wall. The remaining two rooms were dedicated to leather and wood work and sheet metal work.Department of Public Works Plan 43/16/5, \\"Murgon State School Proposed Additions Under\\", 1924. Murgon Rural School was officially opened by Undersecretary McKenna on 30 March 1925, and began operating, with 160 pupils, from 1 April.Brady, The Rural School Experiment' p.234. From 1924, local communities were expected to equip their Rural Schools themselves, and also fund any new buildings that were required (Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p.224.) The new rural school was praised as an immediate success. The school was well equipped by the Department of Education with tools and materials, and pupils were charged a few pence each week to attend. The boys produced useful articles from scrap, while the girls provided a well cooked meal every day, which pupils could buy at lunchtime. As the rural school operated in conjunction with the state school, overcrowding soon resulted.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p.235. Transport was often an issue for those pupils who travelled to Murgon from other state schools, as train timetables did not necessarily match the days their classes were scheduled. Various attempts between 1925 and 1929 to provide a bus service for children to attend Murgon - from Boat Mountain, Windera, Merlwood and Cloyna - did not last, and for the more remote schools branches of Murgon rural school were set up and staff were sent out to teach vocational and domestic science classes; including at Kingaroy from 1926, and Kilkivan from 1927.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p.237. In 1927 a playshed was constructed in the school grounds, fulfilling a \\"long-felt want\\".The 1925 enclosure of the underfloor area of the 1917 building meant that the school no longer had undercover play space. Department of Public Works Plan 43/16/5, \\"Murgon State School Proposed Additions Under\\", 1924. The Queensland education system recognised the importance of play in the school curriculum and the provision of all-weather outdoor space was needed. Playsheds were designed as free- standing shelters that provided covered play space and doubled as teaching space when required. Built to a standard design and ranging in size relative to student numbers, these structures were timber-framed and generally open sided, although some were partially enclosed with timber boards or corrugated galvanised iron sheets.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.16v. The usually hipped roofs were clad with timber shingles or corrugated iron. Playsheds were a typical school addition between s and the 1950s, although less frequently constructed after , with the introduction of highset school buildings with understorey play areas.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.21, 97. Fundraising for the playshed had been undertaken by the Murgon School Committee, who sent away for copies of plans in 1926. It was constructed by contractor J. Krebs, and an official opening was held during Arbor Day celebrations on 5 August 1927.'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 30 October 1926, p.8'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 4 August 1927, p.8'Murgon', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 17 August 1927, p.6. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890, and trees and gardens were regularly planted to shade and beautify schools. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. Arbor Day celebrations in the early years of Murgon State School included activities such as tree planting, gardening lessons, picnics and games.'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 5 September 1924, p.3'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 1 October 1925, p.13. The school grounds were greatly improved in the early 1920s. By 1924, 12 large experimental vegetable plots, covering about a quarter of an acre, had been laid out, with flowers planted around the edges and rose beds in the centre. An experimental plot of cotton plants had also been established, as well as seed bed boxes for vegetables. A school tennis court, \\"one of the best in Murgon\\", had also been constructed by this time.'Murgon', The Brisbane Courier, 25 March 1924, p.12. At some point prior to the 1940s several Pepperina trees (Schinus molle) were planted in the northern school grounds, two of which survive.According to recollections of past students, air raid trenches dug in the playground during WWII were under the Pepperina trees. Source: Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", p.52-3. By April 1929 the inconvenience of holding the rural classes beneath the main teaching building, where the noise from tin-smithing and carpentry was a distraction to children studying above, prompted calls for new facilities to be constructed. The Department of Education promised that the matter would be speedily remedied, and in October 1930 two new buildings were opened - a blacksmith's shop and a manual training building.'Murgon and District', The Brisbane Courier, 18 April 1929, p.20'Murgon School: new buildings opened', The Brisbane Courier, 18 October 1930, p.22. Designed by the Department of Public Works, the blacksmith's shop was a rectangular, timber-framed shed , with a skillion roof and earth floor. Access was through two large double doors on the southern side, while the remaining walls were clad in corrugated metal sheeting.Department of Public Works plan 43/16/5, \\"Murgon Rural School Blacksmithing Building\\", 1929. The manual training building was a standard government design.Type D/T4, according to type classifications contained within Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, 1996. It was lowset, timber-framed and -clad with a front verandah and gambrel roof, containing a large room for woodwork and a smaller room for sheet metal work. The manual training building was located at the corner of Gore and Fryer streets but the original location of the blacksmith's shop is unclear.Department of Public Works plan 43/16/5-2, \\"State School - Murgon: Manual Training Building\\", 1928Department of Public Works plan 817/265, 'Murgon State School New Septic System, 1953Aerial photograph, QAP183-25, 1951, (c) The State of Queensland (Department of Natural Resources and Mines) 2015. At the opening ceremony, the Minister for Education, Reginald King, said that the school was extremely lucky that the work was done, as financial difficulties within the Department meant that no more work of this class would be undertaken for some time. Further additions to cope with growing student numbers were needed, however, particularly as classes still held beneath the main teaching building were \\"most uncomfortable\\" due to the concrete floor and insufficient natural daylighting. In 1935-36 a major building program was undertaken, which included the extension of the 1917 teaching building (Block A), the construction of an additional teaching building (part of Block C) and a domestic science building, and the relocation and extension of the blacksmith's shop. Construction began in mid-1935, with the work being carried out by day labour under the supervision of the Department of Public Works.'Contracts for School Buildings: Day Labour undertakings', Daily Standard, 8 March 1935, p.5'Murgon', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 10 July 1935, p.2'Murgon', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 9 August 1935, p.3 Additions to Block A included two extra classrooms at the northwest end, additional verandahs to all but the southwest side, and a second teacher's room. As part of the process of remodelling the building, banks of windows in the 1917 building were removed from the end walls and installed along the southwest wall, so that all classrooms now had southern light. This modification brought the building closer in form to the popular sectional school type. Other alterations included relocating the hat rooms on the verandahs and removing the stove alcove from the former domestic science room beneath.Department of Public Works Plan 2A/22/11, \\"Murgon State School Proposed Additions\\", 1934Department of Public Works Plan 2B/22/11, \\"Additions to State School at Murgon\\", 1934'Murgon School Additions', The Queenslander Pictorial, 28 May 1936, p.30. The sectional school type was introduced to Queensland schools in the 1920s. This fundamentally new design combined all the best features of previous types and implemented theories of an ideal education environment. Practical and economical, it proved very successful and was used unaltered until 1950. Its most important features were that it allowed for the orderly expansion of schools over time (due to removable end walls), and that its strict east-west orientation, with large areas of glazing along the southern wall, provided maximum natural light from the south. Before the sectional school, solar orientation was not given prominence and all school buildings were oriented in relation to the street and property boundaries.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.38-40. The additional teaching building (now part of Block C) comprised a single classroom with verandahs on the southeast and northwest sides and windows in the end walls. A small school building,Type E/T1, according to type classifications contained within Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, 1996. this type of building was constructed between 1930 and 1946 and was a continuation of earlier types of country schools. Unlike sectional schools, they were not designed for expansion.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.61. The building was linked to the northwest end of Block A by an extension of its south-eastern verandah, which featured decorative timber brackets. The domestic science building, like the manual training building, was a standard vocational building type.Type D/T3, according to type classifications contained within Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, 1996. It was a lowset timber building with a gambrel roof and a northern verandah. Internally it comprised two rooms - a large room with two stove recesses projecting from the northwest wall, used for dressmaking and cookery, and a narrow room along the southwest side used as a laundry and ironing room. The building was located along the Fryer Street boundary, northwest of the manual training building. In 1937 the verandah was enclosed and a corner cupboard constructed.Department of Public Works plan 871/379/22-12, \\"State School - Domestic Science Building\\", 1928Department of Public Works plan 223/22/4, \\"Murgon State Rural School Alterations\\", 1937Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", p.7. The extension of the blacksmith's shop doubled the length of the structure and replicated the framing and materials of the 1930 section, including double doors along the southwest side. Its new location was between the playshed and the domestic science building, along the Fryar Street boundary.Department of Public Works plan 8A/24/4, 'Murgon State School Prop. Addition to Blacksmith's Shop', 1934 The new buildings, which cost a total of ¬£2500, were officially opened by the Minister for Education, Frank Cooper, on 21 February 1936. As part of the celebrations afternoon tea was served by the domestic science teacher and pupils. Mr Cooper was presented with a leather pocket wallet produced by the rural schoolboys, and Mrs Cooper with a \\"beautifully iced cake\\" from the domestic science class.'Murgon School Progress: Additions Opened by Minister', Courier Mail, 22 February 1936, p.15'Murgon State and Rural School: ¬£2500 spent on Additions: Opened by Minister', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 25 February 1936, p.5. On the opposite side of Fryar Street, a new Court House was completed in 1940. The court house was built to replace a 1914 combined court house and police station, which stood to the east of the new court house until being removed in the mid-1970s.Margaret Cook, August 2011, \\"Police and Justice Study\\", Report for DERM, p.87 (1914 court house)Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", p.11 (1970s removal). The 1940 court house, like most early timber court houses in Queensland, was built in a T shape, with a single courtroom as the base of the T, and offices arranged along the crossbar. From 1912, court house design included gabled and hipped roofs over the courtroom and offices.Margaret Cook, August 2011, \\"Police and Justice Study\\", Report for DERM, pp.72-79. Unlike the similar Nanango Court House (1936),Department of Public Works plan \\"Court House, Nanango\\", October 1936, in site file for QHR 601571. Murgon's courtroom was at the rear, and the portico entrance led to a veranda running along the office wing. The Murgon Court House had six offices, including offices for a veterinary surgeon, dairy inspector, Police Magistrate, Court of Petty Sessions, and a general office.'New court house at Murgon', Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 27 January 1940, p.9. Between the 1940s and 1960s the rural school scheme was phased out due to a move to larger farms by the late 1940s and the consequent decline in government emphasis on closer settlement, and the transfer of domestic, vocational and commercial subjects to the curriculum of the growing number of state high schools.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, pp. 270-1. Murgon State School ceased to be a rural school in 1959, coinciding with the opening of Murgon High School.Queensland State Archives, Agency ID 5561, Description of Murgon State SchoolMickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", p.8. Dairying declined as a major industry in Queensland after World War II. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from to between 1957 and 1972 as margarine increased its market share. The transition towards the production of milk rather than cream, requiring larger herds and new equipment, saw many smaller scale farmers leaving the industry. Export opportunities also became restricted, culminating with the end of preferential trade agreements with Britain following its entry into the European Common Market in 1973. The late 1960s saw the beginning of closures of butter factories in the Burnett region, and with the closure of the Nanango and Kingaroy butter factories in 1977, all cream supplies were diverted to Murgon factory, the last remaining dairy factory in the South Burnett until its closure in 1995. However, although local dairy farming declined, beef and pork production continued. The South Burnett Meat Works operated just outside Murgon between 1962 and 2007. The decline in Queensland dairying also coincided with the closure of most of the small state schools in a radius around Murgon, between the 1940s to the 1970s, including a burst of closures in the 1960s.Queensland State Archives, closure dates for the Redgate, Merlwood, Silverleaf, Manyung, Crownthorpe, Boat Mountain, Oakdale, Wooroonden, Barlil, and Sunny Nook state schools. Conversely, the school buildings at Murgon were extended during the 1950s and 1960s, as remaining students from the closed schools travelled to Murgon, aided by a school bus service (referred to as the 'Monkey Bus').Department of Public Works plan 871/385, \\"Murgon State School Additions\\", 1959Department of Public Works plan 871/584/1, \\"Murgon SS Site Plan\\", 1967Centenary Celebrations Committee, Murgon Centenary: 1904 to 2004, 2004, p.14-29. After the closure of the rural school the vocational buildings continued to be used and adapted for other purposes. In 1959 the domestic science building was converted into a library. At some point the stove alcoves in the northwest wall were removed and large banks of awning windows installed in the northwest and southwest walls.Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", pp.10-11. Also in 1959, the manual training building was moved, raised, and its structure incorporated into a new linear block of classrooms (now Block B). During this process it was extensively altered, with all original linings and joinery removed. Linked by a high level walkway to Block C and extending in an easterly direction, Block B forms a courtyard area with Block A.Department of Public Works plan 871/439, \\"Murgon State School Additions\\", 1960. Block C, which originated with the 1936 single classroom linked to the western end of Block A, was extended to the west in stages between 1966 and 1969. In the process, features such as the northwest verandah and windows in the northeast wall were removed.Department of Public Works plan 871/533, \\"Murgon State School One Additional Classroom\\", 1966Department of Public Works plan 817/584/1, \\"Murgon SS Site Plan\\", 1967Department of Public Works plan 871/SP, \\"Murgon State School Site Usage Plan\\", 1969. The south- eastern verandah of Block A (constructed in 1936) was enclosed in 1960 to form a staff room. In 1973 this verandah was removed for the construction of a new brick administration building adjoining Block A. Toilets beneath the verandah were removed and a staircase installed in the northeast corner of the 1917 verandah. In 1981 Block A was upgraded, which involved the partial removal of internal partitions and the insertion of two store rooms in the central classroom. The northern verandah was enclosed and most windows in the verandah wall removed.Department of Public Works plan 871/707/1, \\"Murgon State School New Administration Block A\\", 1972Department of Public Works plan 871/962/1, \\"Murgon SS Upgrading of Block A\\", 1981. In the early 1970s the school reserve was expanded to approximately . Fryar Street was closed in two stages - the western end in 1959 and the remainder in 1972, when the whole school reserve was resurveyed to include most of the land north to Dutton Street. The new grounds were landscaped to create a playing field and tennis courts.Department of Public Works plan 871/SP, \\"Murgon State School Site Usage Plan\\", 1969Department of Public Works plan 20871/1A, \\"Murgon SS Architectural Record Site Plan\\", 1975Survey Plan FY352, 1907 (handwritten notes on plan)Survey Plan M55131, 1962Survey Plan M55143, 1972Aerial photographs QAP2230, 1971 and QAP4425, 1986, (c) The State of Queensland (Department of Natural Resources and Mines) 2015. A new court house was built elsewhere in Murgon in 1967,Cook, \\"Police and Justice Study\\", p.104. and the 1940 Court House building on the north side of the former Fryar Street was included within the expanded school reserve. The building was used as an Opportunity School until it was renovated to become a preschool in 1981.Mickan, \\"Looking Both Ways\\", p.11. It remains in its original location and in 2015 houses many school and community functions, including a play group. Today, Murgon continues to be a service centre for the surrounding area, with a population of 2496 in 2011. Murgon State School celebrated its centenary in 2008, and commemorated the event by publishing a revised school history book. Recent additions to the school grounds include the construction of ramps to improve accessibility. The school is important to the area, having been a focus for the community, and generations of Murgon students have been taught there. Since establishment it has been a key social focus for the Murgon community with the grounds and building having been the location of many social events.  Description  Site map, 2015 Murgon State School is located on the northern side of the small town of Murgon in the South Burnett region. The gently sloping, site is bounded by a railway reserve to the west, Gore Street to the southeast, Dutton Street to the northeast and Krebs Street to the northwest. A former road reserve (now part of the school grounds) runs through the centre of the site, with most school buildings located within the triangular-shaped area to its south. The teacher's residence is located in the far southern corner of this area; Blocks A and C in the centre; and the former domestic science building, former blacksmith's shop and Playshed along the northern edge. The former Court House is located on the north side of the former road reserve. The remainder of the northern school grounds contain playing fields and are not included within the heritage boundary. The school is accessed by several entrances from Gore Street and a secondary entrance from Krebs Street. All of the significant buildings are timber-framed with roofs clad in metal sheeting. With the exception of the playshed and former blacksmith's shop, all buildings have been re-stumped, so that they now stand upon a combination of square concrete piers and round metal posts.  Teacher's residence (1914)  Teacher's residence, 2015 The teacher's residence occupies a wedge-shaped yard and faces southeast to address Gore Street. It is highset, clad in weatherboards, with a front verandah and a hipped roof. It contains: a four-room core of three bedrooms and a living room, connected by a short hallway; a former dining verandah (now enclosed); and a rear wing containing a kitchen, bathroom and former servants bedroom. The understorey is enclosed by timber batten screens and has a laundry room enclosure at the northwest end. The eaves have exposed rafters and are lined with v-jointed (VJ) tongue and groove (T&G;) boards. A side staircase and landing are later additions and not of heritage significance. All windows are modern replacements; however skillion-roofed timber window hoods are retained on the southwest and northeast sides. The front verandah has a timber floor, a single-skin verandah wall, a two-rail balustrade with vertical rail infill, and a raked ceiling lined with VJ boards. It is accessed by a set of centrally-located timber steps. Two sets of half-glazed French doors opening on to the verandah have had the door leafs replaced, however they retain their early framing and two-light fanlights above. The main entrance has a low-waisted, four panel timber door with original hardware and a single-light fanlight above. The internal layout has remained largely unchanged, apart from the enclosure of a doorway between the dining verandah and the northwest bedroom; the addition of a toilet and cupboards to the northern end of the dining verandah; and the demolition of the former pantry to create a larger bathroom. The kitchen retains its projecting stove alcove in the western corner. Walls and ceilings are lined with VJ, T&G; boards, and round ceiling vents with decorative grilles are located in the centre of each room. Internal partitions are single skin and have belt rails with beaded edges. The rooms retain original joinery, including modest skirtings, cornices and architraves. Internal doors are generally four-panel timber doors with rectangular, horizontally-centre pivoting fanlights. A low-waisted, half- glazed French door connects the dining verandah and the living room, and doors to the former servant's room and the toilet are braced and ledged board doors. All early doors have original door hardware.  Block A (1917, extended 1935-36)  Block A, from north-east, 2015 Block A is a long, rectangular building, clad in weatherboards, with enclosed verandahs on the northeast and northwest sides and two projecting teacher's rooms. The building was constructed in two phases - the southern end in 1917, and the northern end in 1935-36 - with some differences in joinery and interior detailing. The gable roof has raked eaves lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Gable end walls to the main building and teachers rooms have vertical batten gable infill and packed weatherboards at the gable peak. Two sets of timber stairs access the northwest verandah. A third staircase (c.1972, not significant) is located within the verandah space at the southeast end, linking Block A to the adjacent Administration building. Early joinery includes five large banks of windows in the southwest wall; casement windows to the teachers rooms; and two surviving sets of casement windows in the northeast verandah wall. Windows from the 1917 building are generally single-pane casements or vertically centre-pivoting windows with two-light fanlights above, while windows from the 1936 additions are tall, two-light casements with three-light fanlights. The 1917 teachers room has tall, three-light casements. Timber-framed, skillion- roofed window hoods shield the northeast-facing windows of the teachers rooms. The enclosed northeast verandah has a single skin verandah wall and a raked ceiling lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Ventilation boards run along the base of the 1917 section of the verandah wall, and sections of bag hooks survive in places. The balustrade has been replaced by bag racks or modern kitchen cabinets. All doors have been removed from the verandah wall, however the openings remain with tall, two-light, horizontally-centre pivoting fanlights above. Additional doorways have been created in the location of former windows. The enclosed northwest verandah has been turned into a store room. The southwest corner contains fabric from a 1917 hat room which was relocated there during the 1936 extension. The teachers rooms are the same size and have similar design features and ornamentation. Both are accessed by a single door from the northeast verandah. The 1917 room is clad in weatherboards on the verandah-facing side, while the same wall on the 1936 room is single skin. Internally, both are clad in VJ, T&G; boards on the walls and on the ceiling of the 1936 room. The 1917 room has a pressed metal ceiling. Originally containing five classrooms, a portion of the central classroom has been turned into store rooms by modern partitions. The boarded bulkheads of the original classroom partitions survive, with modern partitions and folding doors installed beneath. The 1917 classrooms have pressed metal-clad hipped ceilings with centrally-located, square ventilation panels. The 1936 classrooms have VJ board-lined coved ceilings with metal tie rods and square lattice ventilation panels. All classrooms have VJ board-lined walls. The understory has a concrete slab floor and is partially enclosed, with: weatherboard-clad walls along the southwest side; a weatherboard-clad room beneath the 1917 teachers room; and a former toilet block at the northwest end (now a storage area).  Block C, southeast classroom (1935-36)  Block C from the south-east, 2015 The significant portion of Block C is the southeast classroom, a highset building with a gable roof and enclosed southeast verandah. Adjoining classrooms to the northwest and a verandah to the northeast (added in the 1960s) are not of cultural heritage significance. The southwest wall is clad in weatherboards, with vertical batten gable infill and packed weatherboards at the gable peak. It retains a bank of early windows, comprising two-light casements with three-light fanlights above, shielded by a timber, skillion- roofed window hood. The northeast wall has been re-lined below the verandah roof and early joinery removed, however above this level it retains its weatherboard cladding, vertical batten gable infill and packed weatherboards. The verandah retains its timber posts with decorative, arched brackets; raked ceiling lined with VJ boards; and single skin verandah wall. The balustrade has been replaced with bagracks. An early four-panel timber door with two- light fanlight and original hardware survives in its original position in the centre of the verandah wall. The interior is lined with VJ boards on the walls and ceiling (except for the northeast wall, which has been relined in flat sheeting). The ceiling is coved with a metal tie rod and central, square lattice ventilation panel. A four-panel timber door remains in the location of an original door at the southern end of the northwest wall. The understorey is partially enclosed with weatherboard-clad walls and has a recent concrete slab floor. A small section of corrugated metal sheeting-clad wall is located beneath the walkway to Block A.  Playshed (1927)  Playshed (left) and former Blacksmith's Shop (right), 2015 The playshed is a 6-post timber structure with a hipped roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. It is enclosed on the northwest and northeast sides with vertically mounted, corrugated metal sheeting. The earth floor is paved in the northwest bay. Notches in the posts possibly indicate the location of a former balustrade around the southeast and southwest sides. The purpose and former location of a corrugated metal-clad shelving unit, standing in the centre of the playshed, is unclear.  Former blacksmith's shop (1930, extended 1936)  The former blacksmith's shop is a timber-framed, skillion-roofed shed of four bays with a corrugated metal-clad roof and an earth floor. Open along the southwest side, it is enclosed by timber-framed, corrugated metal-clad walls on the remaining three sides, with the whole structure resting on round concrete stumps.  Former domestic science building (1935-36)  Former domestic science building, from west, 2015 The former domestic science building is a lowset timber building, clad in weatherboards and orientated to face southwest. It has a gambrel roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting, with louvred ventilation panels in the gablets. Access is via by two sets of timber steps with timber handrails. The building is divided by single-skin partitions into three rooms - a large room in the centre and narrower rooms (one an enclosed verandah) at either end. Walls and ceilings are lined with VJ boards. The main room has a picture rail and a flat ceiling with square lattice ventilation panel in the centre. The end rooms have raked ceilings. Early windows, including two-light casements and three- light fanlights, survive in the southwest and northeast walls and in the northeast verandah wall. Internal doors have been removed, but two-light fanlights survive above the doorways. Windows and the former stove alcoves in the side walls have been replaced by large banks of awning windows. Two external doors survive - a high-waisted, part-glazed door in the southeast wall and a boarded door in the centre of the southwest wall.  Former Court House (1940)  Former court house, from south-east, 2015 The former Court House is a lowset, timber building with a hipped and gabled roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. T-shaped in plan and surrounded by wide verandahs, it is orientated to face southwest, with a gable-roofed entrance portico located in the centre of the main fa√ßade, accessed by timber steps. A single row of six rooms (former offices) forms the front of the building and the large former court room is located at the rear. Rooms are accessed via the front and rear verandahs, with internal doorways connecting the central two rooms with the court room (doors leafs have been removed and a larger opening created in one wall). The verandahs have a two-rail slat balustrade, raked ceilings lined with VJ boards, and single skin verandah walls. Timber verandah posts along the southwest verandah are paired and feature decorative cornices. The building retains nearly all of its original timber joinery, including six- light double-hung sash windows with three-light fanlights, and half-glazed French doors with four-light fanlights. The northwest and southeast end walls are clad in weatherboards and have six-light casement windows with fanlights protected by skillion-roofed window hoods with battened brackets. Internally, walls and ceilings are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove boards. Skirting boards are stepped with bullnose edges. The former offices have flat ceilings while the former court room ceiling is coved with a central square lattice ventilation panel. Non-significant internal features include modern carpet and linoleum floor linings, flat sheeting re-lining some partitions, windows in partition walls, and post-1970s fit-outs including a kitchen and former children's bathroom (now a store room). The understorey has been partially enclosed with weatherboard-clad walls at the northern end, where the slope of the ground allows for enough head height. A separate storage area is enclosed with battened screens.  Grounds  Pepperina tree beside the former domestic science building, 2015 A variety of mature trees survive within the school grounds, including eucalypts, jacarandas and elms (species unknown). Two mature Pepperina Trees (Shinus Molle) are remnants of an early planting scheme. One is located to the south of the former blacksmith's shop, and the other to the east of the former domestic science building.  Heritage listing  Murgon State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 October 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Murgon State School (established in 1908 as a provisional school) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. The Suburban Timber School building (1917, extended 1935-36, Block A) demonstrates the evolution of timber school building designs to provide adequate lighting and ventilation; while its 1930s modifications, in particular the rearrangement of windows to provide southern light, illustrate the adaptability of timber schools and the influence of the highly successful sectional school type upon Queensland school designs from the 1920s to 1950s. The teacher's residence (1914) demonstrates the Queensland Government's policy of providing residences for married male head teachers in rural areas. The Playshed (1927) demonstrates the education system's recognition of the importance of play in the curriculum. The domestic science building (1935‚Äì36) and blacksmith's shop (1930, extended 1936) are important surviving evidence of the establishment of rural schools in Queensland, a popular initiative to provide a practical education for country students and encourage them to stay on the land. They demonstrate the Queensland Government's focus on vocational education as a way of ensuring the state's economic prosperity. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former blacksmith's shop and domestic science building are rare and important surviving examples of building types that were once common, and demonstrate the emphasis placed on vocational training in Queensland Schools in the early-20th century, particularly in rural communities. The former blacksmith's shop (1930, extended 1936) is a very rare and intact example of its type. No other surviving Queensland example with this level of intactness has been identified to date. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Murgon State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools with their later modifications. These include: highset timber-framed teaching buildings of standard designs that incorporate understorey play areas, verandahs, and classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation; and generous, landscaped sites with mature shade trees and assembly/play areas. The school is a good, intact example of a regional school complex comprising a range of standard and vocational teaching buildings. The Suburban Timber School building (1917, Block A) with its later additions (1935‚Äì36) is a good, intact example of its type, retaining its highset form with play space beneath, timber-framed and -clad construction, generous verandahs (now enclosed), gable roof, teachers rooms, surviving early joinery, coved ceiling lined with pressed metal sheeting, and natural lighting and ventilation features. The small timber school building (1935‚Äì36, part of Block C) retains its gable roof, southeast verandah (now enclosed), some early joinery and decorative timberwork. The teacher's residence (1914) is an excellent, intact example of the residence type of its period, retaining its hip-roofed, timber-framed and -clad form and comprising a front verandah, a four-room core, large dining verandah and rear wing containing a kitchen, bathroom and former servant's room. The former domestic science building (1935‚Äì36) is a rare, intact example of a vocational building built to a standard plan, retaining its lowset form, gambrel roof, and large, airy classroom flanked by a former laundry room and an enclosed verandah. The blacksmith's shop (1930, extended 1936) is a very rare and intact example of its type, retaining its skillion-roofed and corrugated metal-clad form, earth floor, and its location away from the main teaching building to minimise noise disruption. The Playshed (1927) retains its hipped, timber-framed roof form supported on timber posts, and two walls enclosed with corrugated metal sheeting. These buildings are set within landscaped school grounds with mature plantings, including Pepperina trees (Schinus molle). The former Court House (1939‚Äì40) is an excellent, intact example of a regional timber court house, retaining its T-shaped plan of former offices and courtroom, hipped and gabled roof, generous verandahs, and early joinery and decorative features. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Murgon State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Murgon community. It was established in 1908 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Murgon children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Murgon and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Appointed in 1892, he worked on a variety of agricultural production and chemistry related issues in India. Biography Leather was born at Rainhill, Lancashire on 26 December 1860. After school he joined his father's chemical factory at St. Helens. In 1883 he went to study chemistry at Bonn under August Kekule. He received a PhD in 1886 and became an assistant to J A Voelcker. His work included methods to detect castor seeds in animal feed. In 1891 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the Harris Institute, Preston but in the next year he was appointed chemist to the agricultural department in India at the recommendation of Voelcker. In 1906 he was designated as the Imperial agricultural chemist, a position he held until his retirement in 1916. His work included the analysis of Indian soils, foodstuffs and other matters of interest. He served as the head of the chemical department at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute established in 1904 at Pusa in Bihar. The institute itself was established partly due to the indigo industry in India. The synthesis of indigo dye in Germany made it necessary to examine methods for a possible revival of the indigo industry in Bihar. Leather was sent on a tour to the indigo districts in 1899 and the location in Pusa was close to the main indigo plantations in northern Bihar. After his retirement he returned to England and lived in Malvern. Publications Leather published extensively in government reports. Some of Leather's key publications as books and in journals include the following: * Leather, John Walter, and Jatindra Nath Mukerji (1914) The Indian saltpetre industry. No. 24.

Business career In 1934, following the death of his father, D'Aguiar became the managing director of the family business, D'Aguiar Bros. Ltd. The Guyanese business, which was involved in the production of rum and soft drinks, became the first in South America to bottle Pepsi-Cola in 1942. D'aguiar created Banks Breweries Ltd. in 1955, which in contrast to the family business was a public company. However, D'Aguiar Bros. went public in 1966 and merged with Banks Breweries Ltd. in 1969, resulting in D'Aguiar Bros. (D.I.H.) Ltd. Meanwhile, D'Aguiar formed a brewery in Barbados, Banks (Barbados) Breweries Ltd., which opened its doors in September 1961. This was made possible by the capital injection of over 3000 Barbadians who had purchased over 1.5 million shares in 1959. Not before long, the two businesses in Guyana and Barbados were arguing over the \\"Banks\\" brand. After 40 years of battle, they \\"finally came together\\" in 2005, bought shares in each other's companies, and agreed to a joint export strategy. Political career D'Aguiar unsuccessfully contested the 1953 elections in British Guiana on the slate of the National Democratic Party. D'Aguiar declined to participate in the 1957 elections, but by 1959 he was the leader of the \\"Defenders of Freedom\\", an anti-Communist group affiliated with the Catholic Church. That year, D'Aguiar's group began negotiations with Forbes Burnham, the leader of the People's National Congress (PNC). According to the Stabroek News, \\"D‚ÄôAguiar‚Äôs ambition was to contest the general elections due to be held in 1961 with his money and the PNC‚Äôs masses.\\" The negotiations collapsed in late 1960. In August 1960, \\"Defenders of Freedom\\" came to the attention of United States officials. The Eisenhower administration was increasingly alarmed by the prospect of a domino effect in South America after the radicalisation of Fidel Castro's Cuba, and sought to nip it in the bud in British Guiana. The U.S. soon began providing D'Aguiar's network with anti-Communist material created by the U.S. Information Agency, which was shown on Georgetown street corners without attribution. On 5 October 1960, D'Aguiar formed a new political party, the United Force (UF). The party compensated for its elitism by soliciting the Amerindian vote, and went on to win 16.38% in the 1961 elections, gaining four seats on the Legislative Assembly, including D'Aguiar himself. The elections were won decisively by Cheddi Jagan's People's Progressive Party (PPP), which won the majority of the seats in the Legislative Assembly, despite only winning a slim plurality of the votes. Nevertheless, the elections demonstrated that a D'Aguiar-Burnham coalition could win if the electoral system was changed to proportional representation. Also in 1961, D'Aguiar bought the Daily Chronicle. D'Aguiar was prominently involved in the riots which rocked British Guiana in February 1962. A commission of inquiry sent by the British on Jagan's request found that D'Aguiar \\"seized every opportunity of attacking Dr. Jagan's government and inciting the crowds during the week of disturbances\\" and \\"intended to use every means of bringing down the government\\". The commission also called the Daily Chronicle‚ÄîD'Aguiar's newspaper‚Äîan \\"unashamed and remorseless protagonist of [the United Force]\\". Thanks in no small part to a plot imposed on the United Kingdom by the United States, new elections were held in 1964, this time with proportional representation. PNC (40.5%) and UF (12.4%) won enough to form a coalition government on 15 December 1964 which oversaw decolonisation in 1966 in which D'Aguiar became finance minister and Burnham prime minister, but they distrusted each other from the beginning. D'Aguiar resigned from the cabinet in September 1967, disgusted by Burnham's corruption. In October 1968, D'Aguiar joined hands with Jagan in walking out of the National Assembly, prompted by Burnham's electoral fraud in preparation for the fake elections of 1968, to be held in December. D'Aguiar appeared with Jagan in a January 1969 documentary by Granada Television, The Making of a Prime Minister, bewailing the fate of Guyana. D'Aguiar then retired from political life.

She progressed to become one of the most consistent Paralympics Nordic skiers of Russia as she claimed 16 medals in her Paralympic career including 6 gold medals. She was also the recipient of the Order For Merit to the Fatherland and Order of Friendship awards. Early life Mikhalina Lysova was born on 29 March 1992 and had a weak vision since her birth. Her father worked as a fitter and her mother worked in a kindergarten. She was encouraged to take the sport of skiing by her elder sister, Aleksandra Lysova, in 2002 when she was just ten years old though her parents did not like it. She was married to a Ukrainian Paralympic Nordic skier, Dmytro Shulga, who has represented Ukraine at the Paralympics in 2010 and 2014. Career Lysova made her first Paralympic appearance during the 2010 Winter Paralympics representing Russia and had a successful Paralympic event claiming 5 medals in her debut Paralympic event including a gold medal and 2 silver medals in the cross-country skiing events and 2 bronze medals in the biathlon events. She was awarded the IPC Athlete of the Month for April in 2011 due to consistent performances at the 2011 IPC Biathlon and Cross-Country Skiing World Championships as she claimed 7 medals in the World Championships. She was also qualified to compete at the 2014 Winter Paralympics which was held in Russia and claimed 6 medals in the Paralympic event including 2 gold, 1 silver medals in the biathlon events and 1 gold, 2 silver medals in the cross-country skiing events. Mikhalina Lysova was also the flagbearer for Russia at the closing ceremony during the 2014 Winter Paralympics.

Defamation lawsuit In April 2018 after the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Paralympics on 18 March 2018, a German daily newspaper called Bild, falsely claimed Mikhalina Lysova for doping by blaming her for being indifferent to fellow Russian athletes who have been caught for doping issues and also filed a complaint against her at a court. The newspaper also believed that Mikhalina would have used banned substances to boost her performance at the 2018 Winter Paralympics where she managed to pick up 5 medals. However, Mikhalina Lysova managed to prove herself as an honest and innocent person after winning the court case against the German newspaper.

During term time, it primarily hosts the work of Durham Student Theatre's 27 resident companies, and also presents the work of external and touring companies at other points in the year. The theatre is managed by Experience Durham, a department of Durham University, and is run by two full-time members of staff alongside a team of student volunteers.  History  Built in the eighteenth century, the Assembly Rooms Theatre originally functioned as a ballroom, before being chosen to be redeveloped as a theatre after Durham's Theatre Royal burnt down in a fire in 1869. Its first dramatic performance, Il Trovatore, was presented in 1891. In 1903, the theatre hosted what is believed to be Durham's first film showing, with W.S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery. After their first production of H.M.S. Pinafore in 1909, the theatre continued to be used extensively by Durham Amateur Operatic Group in the early twentieth century, until its acquisition by Durham University in 1930. Further renovation was carried out in the 1950s in order to enable theatrical performances to be hosted in The Assembly Rooms Theatre once again. From 2007-9 the theatre was refurbished once again, funded by the Gillian Dickinson Trust. This included a complete refurbishment of the auditorium, foyer and box office.  Shows  During term time, The Assembly Rooms Theatre usually hosts at least one production per week These student performances are programmed by the Durham Student Theatre committee, and can feature any of the society's 27 different theatre companies. The theatre annually participates in Durham Drama Festival in February. The theatre also participates in Durham Festival of the Arts in June, a collaborative venture between Music Durham and Durham Student Theatre to present a programme of musical and theatrical performances from Durham University students. Outside of term time, the theatre hosts external companies and touring productions.

Initial reports were that the aircraft had hit debris on the water. Aircraft The aircraft CF-IHA was a Canadian-built variant of the Consolidated Catalina built by Canadian-Vickers in 1944. It was built for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with serial number 11058 until it was sold in 1947. Investigation A technical investigation concluded that the nose wheel doors had not closed properly probably due to mechanical failure. With a gap of 70mm, the doors were torn off on landing letting water into the nose wheel bay, the pressure of water caused a bulkhead to fail and the aircraft to sink.

He became known for his independent reporting during British rule in India, and in particular for his decision to publish graphic photographs, in August 1943, of the Bengal famine of 1943, which claimed between 1.5 and 3 million lives. The publication of the images, along with Stephens' editorials, helped to bring the famine to an end by persuading the British government to supply adequate relief to the victims. When Stephens died, Amartya Sen wrote in a letter to The Times: \\"In the subcontinent in which Ian Stephens spent a substantial part of his life, he is remembered not only as a great editor (with amiable, if somewhat eccentric, manners), but also as someone whose hard-fought campaign possibly saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.\\" Early life and education Born in London, the first son of Euphemia Elizabeth Cornwall Stephens (n√©e Glasfurd) and John Alexander Melville Stephens, Stephens was brought up with his younger brother, D'Arcy Melville Stephens, in the Old Parsonage in Fleet, Hampshire, where the family lived with several servants. His father had worked in the tea industry; he described his profession in 1911 as a retired \\"tea planter\\". The family on his mother's side had strong military and Indian connections: Stephens' maternal grandfather, Charles Glasfurd, had been Deputy Commissioner in the Central Provinces of British India, and his mother's paternal grandfather was Major-General John Glasfurd of the Bengal Army. After attending Winchester College, Stephens won an exhibition (a type of scholarship) to King's College, Cambridge, in 1921, where he graduated with first-class honours in natural sciences and history. In 1929 D'Arcy Stephens married Isobel McGowan, daughter of Sir Harry McGowan, the chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries; Ian was best man at the wedding. D'Arcy died in November 1942 on HMS Ibis. Career Move to India After Cambridge, Stephens worked for the London Underground and as Ernest Debenham's private secretary. In 1930 he joined the Bureau of Public Information in Delhi, India, and from 1932 to 1937 worked as its director. After this he moved to The Statesman in Kolkata (then Calcutta), first as assistant editor, then in 1942 as editor, succeeding Arthur Moore. According to his obituary in The Times, for which he also wrote, he displayed \\"independent judgment and wide knowledge gained from travel\\", as well as a \\"flair for descriptive writing\\". Famine photographs Published by Stephens in The Statesman on 22 August 1943 When famine threatened Bengal in 1943, the British government downplayed the situation, talking of food shortages rather than famine; Leo Amery, the British Secretary of State for India, appeared to believe that propaganda might avert a crisis by discouraging hoarding. For months Stephens and The Statesman went along with this, writes Cormac √ì Gr√°da, \\"toe[ing] the official line, berating local traders and producers, and praising ministerial efforts\\". Referring to the situation as \\"famine\\" was prohibited under \\"Emergency Rules\\", anything \\"deemed damaging to the war effort\\" was restricted. From August 1943 Stephens began a \\"relentless battle for eight weeks\\" to show his urban readers in Kolkata (then Calcutta) that the famine was real. Photographs were not obviously covered by the Emergency Rules, so Stephens sent photographers out to take images of the victims. Their publication was widely regarded as \\"a singular act of journalistic courage and conscientiousness,\\" according to the historian Janam Mukherjee, \\"without which many more lives would have surely been lost\\". Some of the photographs Stephens regarded as \\"utterly unpublishable\\", but he ran several others on Sunday, 22 August 1943. \\"In some definite sense,\\" writes Mukherjee, \\"the event ever since known as the 'Bengal Famine of 1943' had been born.\\" The following Sunday, 29 August, Stephens published more photographs and an editorial, \\"All-India Disgrace\\". In Calcutta alone, \\"[s]cores of persons collapsing from under-nourishment are daily picked up from the streets,\\" he wrote. \\"[R]ecorded deaths from starvation cases in hospitals between August 16 and August 29 were 143; 155 dead bodies are known to have been removed from public thoroughfares by the authorities' new Corpse Disposal Squad during the ten days ending on August 24.\\" Things were significantly worse in the rural areas (the mofussil). According to the historian Zareer Masani, Stephens had a visiting card made with four images of the victims printed on one side. \\"He took the train to Delhi with three hundred of these cards and made sure that every senior government official got this token from him.\\" When Stephens visited Calcutta again in 1975, people old enough to recognize him thanked him in the street, Masani writes: \\"Are you Ian Stephens, the editor? Thank you for what you did for Bengal!\\" Return to England Stephens resigned from The Statesman in 1951 after disagreeing with the Indian government over its policy in Kashmir. He spent time in Kashmir and Pakistan, then returned to England and a six-year fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, which he used to write Horned Moon (1953) about his travels.

A portrait of her with her son, the Earl of Ossory, was painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller In 1715, because of his support for the Jacobite rising of 1715, her husband's titles were forfeited and he was obliged to go into exile. It was eventually ruled that the attainder enacted by the Parliament, applied only to his titles in the Peerages of England and Scotland, not to his Irish titles, which were later restored on behalf of his brother, Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran. The duchess is thought not to have had any contact with her husband during his long exile.

For his actions in the war he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 11 April 1940 before he went missing in action during the Second World War in 1944 and as presumed to have been killed in after he was captured.  Early life  Babachenko was born in 1911 to a Ukrainian peasant family in Stepanovka within the Russian Empire, currently located in present-day Ukraine. After graduating from secondary school in Sitniki he was employed as a deputy of a village council until joined the Komsomol and began working on a collective farm with his parents.  Military career  Babachenko enlisted in the Soviet military in 1933 but was demobilized in 1935 to study agriculture, for which he was briefly the director of a state farm before being drafted into the military again in 1938. Babachenko served in the Soviet-Finnish War, where he served as a Junior Lieutenant and chief of intelligence in his regiment, the 323rd Artillery Regiment. While on a reconnaissance mission in 1940 in Bezymyannaya, he discovered three trenches with Finnish soldiers ready to fire on Soviet troops. Babachenko and his fellow soldiers threw grenades into the trenches but ended up engaging in hand-to-hand combat, which resulted in Babachenko getting stabbed by a bayonet but survived. On different reconnaissance mission, in the city Vyborg of the Leningrad Oblast, Babachenko discovered another set of fortifications, complete with machine guns. His scouting group launched a sudden attack, causing the opponent‚Äôs soldiers to flee and the Soviets took control of the fortifications, enabling the occupation of Podoshva and Pirti. For his reconnaissance work in the Soviet-Finish War he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 11 April 1940. After the end of the war with the Finish he trained at the Lenin Military-Political Academy. After the start of the Second World War in 1941 he faced combat again. After graduating from officer training courses he held the rank of Major and commanded the 104th Army Anti- tank Artillery Regiment until he was captured by enemy combatants in 1943. While his exact date of death is unknown, it is known that he was detained in Stalag I-B East Prussia until he was transferred to Stalag XI-A in Nazi Germany on 22 May 1944.

Malayalam film producer Ousepachan Vaalakuzhy, impressed with Omar Lulu's Happy Wedding and Chunkzz decided to finance his third project, Oru Adaar Love. The primary cast was selected through audition. Ousepachan Vaalakuzhy said he likes to promote newcomers, as has he done with his previous films. After Priya Prakash Varrier's wink in the song \\"Manikya Malaraya Poovi\\" became a viral hit, the makers altered the script to give prominence to her, thus sidelining the role played by Noorin Shereef, who had initially been cast in the lead role. Music The film music and score were composed by Shaan Rahman. The song \\"Manikya Malaraya Poovi\\" sung by Vineeth Sreenivasan, a revised modern version of a Mappila song, was uploaded on 9 February 2018 on YouTube as part of the promotions. It became a viral video at number 1 position garnering over one million views and 50,000 likes in 20 hours. The original version of \\"Manikya Malaraya Poovi\\" was written by P. M. A. Jabbar with music composition by Thalassery K. Refeeque in 1978. Release Oru Adaar Love was released on 14 February 2019. It was dubbed in Tamil with the same title, in Kannada as Kirik Love Story and in Telugu as Lover's Day.  Reception   Box office  As of 9 March 2019, the film has grossed more than 12 crore in India. It was made on a budget of 5 crore.  Critical reception  S.R. Praveen of The Hindu stated \\"Oru Adaar Love on a Valentine‚Äôs day seems to be the handiwork of the culture police, for love hardly ever got such a shabby treatment on screen. If only a wink could save this experiment in mediocrity\\", referring to a scene from a song in the movie where the lead female actor winks, that when viral on the internet before the movie's release. The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Oru Adaar Love seems like a quickly put together movie trying to cash in on the rather unexpected publicity that came its way. There are unpredictable twists in the tale, however, that may keep viewers hooked till the end\\". India Today gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Oru Adaar Love's lacklustre story and underdeveloped character arcs struggle hard to entertain the audience throughout the film\\". The News Minute gave 1 out of 5 stars stating \\"The film appears to say that the wrongs that men do aren‚Äôt really all that wrong. The misogyny doesn‚Äôt even try to hide behind any ‚Äòlarger‚Äô story like in some movies\\". Times Now gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"The film does no justice to the title but you can watch it to reminisce about your high school days and your first crushes. But when it comes to high school romances, I would still prefer watching Trisha Krishnan-Vijay Sethupathi‚Äôs 96\\". The Week gave 1 out of 5 stars stating \\"One of the oft used cliches when reviewing a movie is 'old wine in new bottle'. In Omar Lulu's case, he has just a bottle and filled with some water that has the colour of wine\\". CNN-News18 gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Everything has been planned conveniently to suit a violent ending. What could have turned into an engaging tale of teenage realisation ends up nowhere. It‚Äôs a lost opportunity\\". The Indian Express gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Oru Adaar Love has no plot as such except for a predictable romantic triangle that plays out between Priya Prakash Varrier, Roshan Abdul Rahoof and Noorin Shereef. The point the film tries to make hasn‚Äôt been fleshed out fully to last a two-hour long narration. The entire movie feels like one big set up to achieve a moment that‚Äôs fashioned to make the audience sob\\". Sify gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Oru Adaar Love provides some unexpected surprises but you would require real patience to sit through until then. It‚Äôs a no brainer, often offensive school kid romance that uses every technique to entertain. If that is your idea of fun, you may find this one fine\\".

In 2008, it was elevated for the first time to species rank--a view that was further corroborated in 2014 when a review of systematics and morphological characters of Australian Mormopterus was published. The generic combination of this species was inferred by the elevation of the subgenus to genus Ozimops. The eponym for the species name \\"ridei\\" is likely William Ride, who was an accomplished Australian zoologist. Description It is a smaller member of its genus, with a body mass of . Its forearm is long. Fur color is highly variable among individuals, with some bats a light brownish-gray while others are darker brown. Biology and ecology It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as inside Eucalyptus tree hollows or in buildings. It is insectivorous, often foraging near habitat edges. Range and habitat It occurs along much of the eastern coast of Australia. It is generally found in areas with more than of annual rainfall. Conservation It is listed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this category because it has a very large extent of occurrence, a large estimated area of occupancy, it uses a wide variety of habitats, and its range includes protected land. However, the IUCN assessment does express uncertainty over its population trend; it is unknown if its population is stable or declining.

History Reverend Stephen Smith of Philadelphia was the founder of Asbury African Methodist Episcopal Church which he organized on October 26, 1845. The church was originally a frame building located on the east side of Market Street between Second and Third Streets. In 1846, William Murphy and his wife came to Asbury AME Church with the certificate from Bethel Church in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1863, during the ministry of Reverend Jeremiah Young, the church was rebuilt and the congregation chose to rename the church Asbury to honor Francis Asbury, the English missionary who founded the Independent Methodist Episcopal Church in America. On November 25, 1867, the Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church was incorporated by the court of Delaware County. In 1889, the church building on 2nd and Bevan Street was sold and services were held at James Hall on Fifth and Edgemont Avenue until a new structure was built in 1890. In 1995, the church property at 2nd and Bevan was sold. The United Methodist Church at 1712 Providence Avenue was purchased and became the new home of Asbury AME Church in 1996.

The MER-B Opportunity rover spent 30 months exploring Cape Tribulation from 2014 to 2017. The top of Cape Tribulation is about 134 meters (440 feet) higher than the plains that surround the crater. The MER-B Opportunity rover summited Cape Tribulation in January 2015, which was the highest Martian elevation achieved yet on its mission. Then in March 2016 it accomplished the distance of a classic marathon. Also in March 2016 it achieved the steepest slope traverse (32 degree) yet of its mission, surpassing the slope it took on at Burns Cliff in 2004. MER-B was trying to reach a target on Knudsen Ridge, on the south side of Marathon Valley, which meant attempting a steep grade which can cause wheel slippage. Another effect of this angle was that sand and dust that had collected on the rover flowed in streaks over the back of the rover, such was the incline. Examples of locations: *Cape Tribulation Summit *Marathon Valley **Knudsen ridge **Wharton Ridge *Spirit of Saint Lois Crater *Spirit Mount Endeavour crater is a 14-mile (22 km) wide crater on Mars, that was explored by the MER-B Rover Opportunity in the 2010s, after landing on the planet in 2004.

This was so steep that dust that had accumulated on its top panels began to flow downward. Spirit of Saint Louis Crater Along Cape Tribulation, at the west end of Marathon Valley is a shallow crater about 110 feet (34 meters) long and about 80 feet (24 meters) wide, named Spirit of Saint Louis after the record-break aircraft.

With the exception of Massachusett, which was adopted as the lingua franca of Christian Indian proselytes and survives in hundreds of manuscripts written by native speakers as well as several extensive missionary works and translations, most of the other SNEA languages are only known from fragmentary evidence, such as place names. Quinnipiac (Quiripey) is only attested in a rough translation of the Lord's Prayer and a bilingual catechism by the English missionary Abraham Pierson in 1658. Coweset is only attested in a handful of lexical items that bear clear dialectal variation after thorough linguistic review of Roger Williams' A Key into the Language of America and place names, but most of the languages are only known from local place names and passing mention of the Native peoples in local historical documents.Costa, D. J. (2007). pp. 82-85. Within what is usually regarded as Massachusett, there were certainly dialects as it was spoken by several different peoples across a broad region, and widely adopted as a second language over most of New England and Long Island.Goddard, I. (2000). 'The Use of Pidgins and Jargons on the East Coast of North America' in Gray, E. G. and Fiering, N. (eds.) The Language Encounter in the Americas, 1492-1800: A Collection of Essays. (pp. 61-80). The use of the dialect of the Massachusett‚Äîspecifically the speech of the Praying town of Natick, with some Nipmuc influences‚Äîin the Bible led to it assuming the role of a de facto standard and prestige variant, especially in regards to writing. The spoken language was also highly influenced by the speech of Natick since a large number of the Indian missionaries, teachers and clerks included many men from prestigious, chiefly families from or with kinship connections there or had spent several years there in training before going on to serve other Indian communities. The Indians adopted literacy with the orthography of Eliot's Bible, and even began to adjust their speech, leading to dialect leveling across the region.Connole, D. A. (2007). pp. 101-104. By 1722, only fifty-nine years after the publication Eliot's Bible translation, Experience Mayhew remarked on the leveling effects on Martha's Vineyard, where the local speech was quite distinct, '... most of the little differences betwixt them have been happily Lost, and our Indians Speak, but especially write much as the Natick do.Cotton, J. (1830). Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society. John Davis (ed.) Vol II(3). pp. 242-243. Cambridge, MA: E. W. Metcalf Company.Mandell, D. R. (1996). Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth- Century Eastern Massachusetts. (p. 59). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. Some vestiges of dialects continued even with leveling, and Martha's Vineyard islanders continued to use variant forms such as ohkuh instead of ohke (ahkee) Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 59.

Occasional variation in spelling seems to indicate some dialectal interference. Syncopation, relatively rare in Natick speech, was a spreading feature and seems to have been an obligatory feature of late-stage SNEA languages, possibly an influence from the Abenakian languages. Thus, kuts, 'cormorant,' and Íùèsqheonk, 'his blood,' but more generally these words are found as non- syncopated kuttis (kutuhs) Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 97. From PA *kentehsiwa. and wusqueheonk (wusqeehe√¥k) , respectively, that appeared in the Bible.Costa, D. J. 2007. pp. 96-99. Nevertheless, most of the surviving manuscripts and documents that do demonstrate dialectal variation are often of uncertain geographical and ethnic origin. Daniel Gookin, who had traveled with John Eliot on his missions, brought the Indians under the jurisdiction of the colonial government and was responsible for bringing the Indians under English laws and governance. He noted that the Pawtucket, Massachusett and Pokanoket (Wampanoag) all spoke the same language, and may have considered the separate peoples to have spoken distinct dialects. Ives Goddard proposed the dialects of Natick, North Shore (Pawtucket), Wampanoag, Nauset and Coweset, produced somewhat similarly below, and is mostly grouped according to the various peoples known in history that are believed to have spoken the language.Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical features of massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 227‚Äì244). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter Massachusett The Church of South Natick built over the original church in 1828. Services were conducted by Indian congregants in Massachusee unnontÍùèwaonk well into the mid-18th century.Eliot Church of Natick. (2016). 'Our History ‚Äì From 1651 to the Present.' Retrieved 27 Nov 2016. The dialect specific to the Massachusett people was likely a prestigious dialect. Elderly converts in Natick informed Eliot and Gookin that the Massachusett leaders were able to exert political influence and exact tribute over most of the other Massachusett-speaking peoples and all the tribes as far west as the Pioneer Valley, such as the Nipmuc, Nashaway and Pocomtuc, before weakened by epidemics that greatly reduced the population, warfare with enemy tribes and competition with English settlers.Bragdon, K. J. (2005). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. (pp. 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press. As a practical feature, the Massachusett were centrally located between other Massachusett speakers, thus it was understood over a broader region of the dialect continuum. The dialect was likely the basis of Massachusett Pidgin, adopted as a regional language of commerce and intertribal communication over most of New England and Long Island. The Natick variety was used by Eliot as the basis of the written language used in his translations of the Bible and other works, thus making it an unofficial standard language of writing, and also prestigious variety because of the pronounced role of Natick and its people in the mission to the Indians. The influence caused significant dialect leveling as speakers adjusted their speech, thus the Natick variety greatly influenced dialects enough to erase many of the differences. From place name and document evidence, Massachusett seems to prefer the locative suffix -et/-it/-ut over the older form form that generally appears elsewhere, and many place names were 'standardized' to Massachusett spellings and norms across the region. Although the latter form still appears in Massachusett written sources of Natick until a late period, in place names, it is not found in traditional Massachusett or Narragansett place names and had varying mixtures of usage elsewhere. The dialect of the Massachusett also seems to have resisted syncope, which is obligatory in many late-stage SNEA languages, which may have been prevented in Massachusett due to fossilization as a written language. Massachusett people historically ranged over much of the Greater Boston region, lining the shores of Boston Harbor and extending west towards the fall line, corresponding roughly to the 128 beltway, and much of the South Shore almost as far south as Plymouth. They were later confined to the Praying towns of Natick and Ponkapoag, in Natick and Canton, and Titicut and Mattakeesett, corresponding to Bridgewater and Pembroke, Massachusetts. As the Massachusett were mainly confined to the Praying towns and adjusted to the written language, it is uncertain if there was any internal diversity. Natick was originally settled by Massachusett people from Nonantum, later joined by the Nipmuc that lived west of Natick. Although the community remained a Massachusett-speaking one, it is quite possible that Nipmuc influenced it to some extent. Titicut and Mattakeesett were near Wampanoag areas, and many of the Praying Indians in those communities were close to and had kinship relations with Wampanoag just to the south. The language survived until the 1740s when the Indians were reduced to colonial wards under appointed guardians and large portions of the town were either sold or rented to English settlers. Only one speaker could be found in 1798, and the language likely went extinct in the dawning years of the nineteenth century.Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K. (1988). (185 ed., p. 20). Although no speakers remain today, the two state-recognized Massachusett tribes of Natick and of Ponkapoag continue to use the language in its colonial orthography for cultural, sacred and liturgical purposes.SachemsquawNaticksqw, C.

The written language survives in the records of Natick until 1721, when administrative control of the town passed into the hands of English settlers. In addition, it is essentially the language of all of Eliot's translations of the Bible and several other religious works by other English missionaries and some personal letters from Natick. Wampanoag (Pokanoket) Traditional W√¥pan√¢ak clothing on display at the Cape Cod Museum. The Wampanoag were able to preserve much of their native culture and identity, and as of 1993, have also reclaimed their language. (W√¥pan√¢√¥t8√¢√¥k) , 'Wampanoag language,' historically represented several divergent forms, mainly due to the insular regions. The Wampanoag inhabited most of southeastern Massachusetts, with more isolated, and likely divergent, communities found on Cape Cod, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. In addition, Wampanoag inhabited much of what is now south-eastern Rhode Island. The name of the people refers to the 'east' or 'dawn,' from Massachusett wompan- (w√¥pan-) . In terms of contemporary speakers of the Massachusett language, all of them are speakers of the revived Wampanoag dialect of the W√¥pan√¢ak Language Reclamation Project and come from the Aquinnah, Assonet, Herring Pond and Mashpee tribes. Historically, the Wampanoag were also known as the Pokanoket, which was actually the name of a confederacy that included most of the Wampanoag tribes. The isolation of the islanders from the mainland led to a large amount of internal diversity. John Cotton, Sr., who had grown up as missionary on Martha's Vineyard, told his son, who had become a missionary to the Wampanoag just south of Plymouth, on the mainland, the following to describe mutual intelligibility: 'Mat woh nummissohhamÍùèÕùun asuh matta newahƒ≠teo webe yeu noowahteauun yeug Indiansog mat wahtanooog uag Indiansog ut nishnoh kuttooonganit.' 'I can't tell or don't know, only this I know, that these Indians don't understand every word of them Indians.'Cotton, J. (1830). pp. 242-243. The island regions of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands all shared some common features that kept them distinct from the mainland, but were distinct from each other. Martha's Vineyard was the most divergent speech, difficult for off-islanders from the mainland or other islands. Despite dialect leveling that helped erase these features, the written documents continue to have a small set of divergent vocabulary that persists in native documents produced by Martha's Vineyard islanders. For example, nehpuk, 'my blood,' continues in use despite the standard form nusqeheonk (nusqeehe√¥k) . The continued use of variant forms in writing probably was a legacy of the separate network of missionaries and missionary schools. The Wampanoag on the mainland often accepted ministers and literate Indians from or who had trained in Natick, whereas the Martha's Vineyard Wampanoag were administered by the Mayhew family, with several generations of bilingual ministers working the mission and providing instruction and establishment of Indian schools which may have re-enforced local features. The Wampanoag on Cape Cod and the Islands were fortunate to have been isolated from the ravages of King Philip's War and for having the trust of their English neighbors, and these Wampanoag tribes emerged from the war relatively unscathed. The population of Wampanoag increased after the war as many Indians joined the larger settlements, where the English settlers were more tolerant, land was still ample, proximity to seaports where men could find work on whaling vessels and ability to find Indian spouses, and by the early eighteenth century, it is estimated that 70 per cent of the Indians in Massachusetts were Wampanoag or had assimilated into the Wampanoag community. As a result, the spoken language was able to cling on as the dominant language until the 1770s, but the last native speakers died in Martha's Vineyard sometime in the late nineteenth century. Rememberers that knew bits of the language were recorded by Frank Speck and Gladys Tantaquidgeon in the 1920s, but Gordon Day was able to record some vocabulary from a remember as late as the 1960s. The documents from the Wampanoag make up the majority of surviving written records, such as the marriage, baptism and death records of Indian churches; deeds and land sales; petitions to the court; personal letters; marginalia on the edges of books, letters and other records. In addition, the Wampanoag dialect was an influence on the second publication of the Massachusett-language Bible, edited with the help of John Cotton, Sr., and the five contributions of Experience Mayhew to Indian missionary literature, including the most widespread primer for teaching Indians to read and write in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Both John Cotton, Sr. and Experience Mayhew were fluent speakers of Martha's Vineyard speech. With the current success of the language thanks to the work of the WLRP, there is a growing L2 community of 15 (W√¥pan√¢√¥t8√¢√¥k) speakers and 500 and growing students from the participating Mashpee, Aquinnah, Herring Pond and Assonet tribes and new records in the revived orthography such as complete teaching materials for pre-school through high school, a dictionary, a grammar and numerous other didactic publications.Saskia De Melker, \\"'We Still Live Here' Traces Comeback of Wampanoag Indian Language\\", PBS Newshour, 11-10-2011, accessed 18 November 2011Rose, Christina (2014-02-25). Sleeping Language Waking Up Thanks to Wampanoag Reclamation Project. Indian Country Today Media Network. Retrieved 2014-02-26. There are just under 3,000 Wampanoag people split between the federally recognized tribes of Mashpee and Aquinnah (Gay Head) as well as the state-recognized Assonet, Pocasset, Herring Pond, Chappaquiddick and Seaconke tribes, but a total of 6,427 claimed Wampanoag ancestry in the 2010 U.S. census. Pawtucket Pawtucket Falls. This is close to the site of the former Praying Town of Wamesit, but the Pawtucket fled north to join the Pennacook and Abenaki after Metacomet's Rebellion. The Pawtucket were a collection of tribes living north of the Massachusett, corresponding to the regions of the North Shore, Cape Ann, the northern third of Central Massachusetts and the lower Merrimack Valley and its tributaries. It includes the Naumkeag, Agawam and Aberginian peoples listed in early colonial sources. Prior to English settlement, the Pawtucket were likely part of the Massachusett Confederacy, but as the Massachusett were weakened by disease, loss of land, attacks from enemy tribes and competition from English settlers, most of the tribes fell under the influence of the Pennacook, an Abenakian people that traditionally inhabited the Merrimack Valley of southern and central New Hampshire, extending into northern areas of Central Massachusetts. The name derives from pawtucket, a common place name in New England which seems to be a contraction of pentucket (punuhtukut) Hicks, N. (2007). p. 33.Bright, W. (2004). Native American Placenames of the United States. p. 119. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. and signifies 'at the waterfall,' specifically Pawtucket Falls, a major waterfall on the Merrimack in the city of Lowell, Massachusetts. The dialect of the Pawtucket is mainly known from a vocabulary of roughly three hundred words in William Wood's 1634 New-Englands Prospect as well as place names. The vocabulary is too small to provide clear information about the Pawtucket dialect, but it does demonstrate that the Pawtucket, at least along the coast, essentially spoke the same language as the Massachusett. What might appear as dialectal differences are often because many words seem to be suffixed with the obviative or diminutive endings, but some might vocabulary might have Abenakian influence, as the Pawtucket occupied the SNEA frontier with Abenakian languages, but even Gookin and Eliot considered the Pawtucket to have spoken essentially the same language as the Massachusett. The dialect was likely extinct by the early eighteenth century if not earlier. Most of the Pawtucket had fled north and joined the Pennacook due to usurpation of their lands, but some came under the influence of Eliot's mission to the Indians, settling with Pennacook and Nipmuc in the Praying town of Wamesit and the Nipmuc and Massachusett in the Praying town of Okommakamesitt (Marlborough, Massachusetts) where these Indians may have fallen under the influence of the Massachusett dialect of Natick as used in writing. After King Philip's War, those that returned to Wamesit and Okommakamesitt faced harassment, vandalized property, retaliatory attacks and continuous challenges to their land. Under threats and pressure, Wamesit was sold by 1685, with its people following the Merrimack north with other peoples to seek shelter with the Pennacook, who in turn, later merged into the Abenaki of northern New England and Canada.Chelmsford Historical Society. (2018). 'Indian History from the History of Chelmsford by Wilson Waters.' Retrieved 12 Feb 2018. Okommakamesitt was sold in 1686 by the General Court with a false deed produced by the English settlers on the edges of the Praying town. All but a handful of Indians retained their lands in Marlborough until they too were dispossessed in 1716, with most resettling in Natick, joining relatives up north or quietly assimilating into the surrounding community.Hudson, C. (1862). History of the Town of Marlborough, Middlesex County, Massachusetts from First Settlement in 1657 to 1861. (pp. 70-99). Boston, MA: T. Marvin and Son. The Pawtucket are extinct as a tribe today, but a handful of people in the Greater Lowell region and southern New Hampshire trace their ancestry back to the Pawtucket associated with Wamesit.Robert, F. and Strobel, C. (2011). Ethnicity in Lowell. Northeast Region Ethnography Program. Boston, MA: National Park Service. Nauset Illustration of Sachem Iyannough bringing the lost boy, John Billington, back to Plymouth. The Nauset dialect was supposed to have been spoken by the Nauset people, traditionally inhabiting all the lands of 'Mid Cape' and 'Outer' or 'Lower Cape' regions of the Cape Cod Peninsula, roughly coinciding with all the portions of the peninsula east of the Bass River, including the sharp bend north from Chatham to Provincetown, and associated islands such as Monomoy Island. The Nauset may have also had outposts or settled parts of Nantucket.Speck, F. G. (1928). Territorial Subdivisions and Boundaries of the Wampanoag, Massachusett and Nauset Indians. Frank Hodge (ed).

There is little known about the dialect of the Nauset, as it only exists in place names. It is uncertain if the Nauset were a separate entity. Despite a somewhat difference of culture, due to salty and sandy soils that forced a heavier reliance on exploitation of resources from the sea, the Nauset were likely a tribe of Wampanoag and therefore consideration of their speech as a separate dialect is probably because of their listing in historical, and many current, sources that list the Nauset as a separate people. However, the Nauset could have been a separate entity, given their isolation on the edge of the narrows of the Outer Cape and their resistance to joining the Pokanoket Confederacy, which governed all the Wampanoag tribes, at various points in history. The Nauset are extinct as a people today. The Nauset were able to survive the ravages of King Philip's War unscathed due to their isolation, trust of the local English settlers and neutrality. Most of the Nauset relocated to Mashpee where they joined the local Wampanoag when it was established as a Praying town of the Plymouth Colony, and thus, many Mashpee Wampanoag likely have significant Nauset ancestry in their Native bloodlines.Hodge, F. W. (1910). p. 41. The unique features of the speech of the Wampanoag remembers from Mashpee recorded by Speck may be due to Nauset features but could just as easily be considered dialectal variation, late-stage language usage and incorrect 'remembering' of the language as it was recorded from elders that did not speak the language. Coweset dialect (Narragansett?) Engraving of Roger Williams meeting with members of the Narragansett. In addition to many words of Narragansett and Massachusett origin, Williams recorded some terms of Coweset in his 1643 A Key into the Language of America. The Coweset people inhabited much of what is now central and northern Rhode Island, wedged between the Nipmuc to the north and north-west and the Narragansett (Nanhigganeuck), with the town of Woonsocket, Rhode Island purchased by Roger Williams from local Nipmuc and Coweset peoples. The Coweset were sometimes considered a tribe of Nipmuc, but they seem to have spoken an N-dialect, akin to Massachusett, and came under the political control of the Narragansett until they were able to shake off Narragansett domination in the late seventeenth century.Hodge, F. W. (1912a). p. 23. The name derives from Massachusett kÍùèwaset (*k8wasut) , 'small pine place.'Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 41, 307.Bright, W. (2004). pp. 124-125. Very little is known about the dialect of the Coweset. From place names, the language was an N-dialect, like Massachusett, but was wedged in a transitional area Massachusett to the north and north-east, L-dialect Nipmuc to the north- west and the Narragansett Y-dialect to the south. It is only attested in dialectal variation that appear in doublets and triplets in Roger Williams' A Key into the Language of America. By Williams' own accounts, most of his time in Rhode Island was spent with the Coweset, and the Narragansett were Y-dialect speakers, yet most of the vocabulary of the Key features N-dialect vocabulary. The majority of vocabulary in the Key is essentially Massachusett with the idiosyncratic system Williams used to write Algonquian words, followed by Y-dialect words. A small subset include N-dialect words with pronounced features of Y-dialects. For instance, the word to refer to the animal 'deer' is listed by Williams as attuck, cognate to Massachusett attuck (ahtuq') and n√≥onatch, which seems to be related to Mohegan-Pequot Y-dialect noyuhc .Fielding, S. (2006). A Modern Mohegan Dictionary. Uncasville, CT: Mohegan Tribe.Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 112. In another instance, the PSNEA verb *…ôrƒÅy…ôw, 'it is so,' appears in a cognate Massachusett form nni, related to Massachusett unnai (un√¢y) , Y-dialect e√Æu and transitional N-dialect nn√Æu , which preserves the final that was seldom used in Massachusett.Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 111. As Narragansett is a Y-dialect, as seen in the short word list recorded by Ezra Stiles in 1769 from an elderly Narragansett women near Aquidneck (Newport, Rhode Island) and twenty words extracted by Alfred Gatschet from a Narragansett-language 'rememberer' in P√¥casset (Providence, Rhode Island), it is clear that the language spoken near the end was unambiguously a Y-dialect.Mithun, M. (1999). The Languages of Native North America. p. 330. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. However, this may be because the Narragansett were greatly reduced by King Philip's War and survivors joined the Eastern Niantic, who also spoke a Y-dialect, so that most Narragansett after the war have significant Eastern Niantic ancestry and this may have re-enforced Y-dialect features. It is the position of Ives Goddard and David Costa that the N-dialect vocabulary identical to Massachusett is Massachusett, since Williams spent his formative years in the New World bouncing between the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies; the N-dialect with Y-dialect features represents a transitional dialect that Coweset would likely have been due to its location and Y-dialect vocabulary that represents Narragansett or possibly Eastern Niantic.Costa, D. J. (2007). pp. 111-112. The Coweset are extinct as a people today. It is likely that many Coweset joined the Narragansett in seeking refuge with the Eastern Niantic and have distant descendants in current members of the Narragansett. Many Coweset likely fled and joined the Stockbridge-Munsee, Schaghticoke in northwestern Connecticut, the Abenaki in Canada or the Brothertown tribe, which together with the Stockbridge-Munsee, were removed to Wisconsin.Swanton, J. R. 1952. pp. 28-29. Other dialects and dialect comparison The Aquidneck Indian Council, a Rhode Island-recognized educational and cultural institution for Native Americans, re-translated the Algonquian content of Roger Williams' Key into the Language of America, in an effort to better document and revive the Narragansett language, using comparisons with the Massachusett-language corpus as well as reconstructions based on evolutionary patterns of linguistic change from PA to SNEA. This, however, would be considered by other specialists, such as Goddard and Costa, as conflation of the mixed dialects found in the Key. However, even if only using Y-dialect material to reconstruct Narragansett would still produce a language similar still similar to other SNEA languages, which were most likely as related to each other as the dialects of the Nordic languages whose speakers can communicate, using their respective languages, and still understand and be understood by other parties, with difficulties increasing with distance and certain aberrant dialects. The Massachusett language also spread, with the majority of Eliot's Praying towns established in Nipmuc country as well as a few located near the confluence of Nipmuc, Pawtucket, Massachusett and Pennacook influence, such as Wamesit, but possibly also possibly Nashoba (Littleton, Massachusetts) as well as other missionary communities such as Washacum (Sterling, Massachusetts) and Nashaway (Lancaster, Massachusetts).Mandell, D. R. (1996). pp. 17, 27, 46. The Nipmuc also came to settle Natick, with James Printer said to be the most prolific translator as well as printer of Eliot's Indian Bible.Conole, D. A. (2007). pp. 100-110. The Indians that chose to stay away likely preserved their languages. For instance, a French missionary priest near Montreal, Quebec recorded a language sometime in the mid-eighteenth century that was most similar to Massachusett, complete with numerous loan words from English but was clearly an L-dialect, so may represent the original Nipmuc language removed from the standardizing effects of the prestigious Massachusett used by the literate Indians or a related but unknown language of New England's central interior.Gustuffson, H.

She served as mayor of Kopavogur from 1957 to 1962, actively influencing the development of the town. In the 1970 elections, she was elected as a Kopavogur councillor for the Union of Liberals and Leftists, serving until 1974. Biography Born in Reykjavik on 21 October 1911, Hulda D√≥ra Jakobsd√≥ttir was the daughter of the engineer Jakob Gu√∞j√≥n Bjarnason and his wife Gu√∞r√∫n Sesselja √Årmannsd√≥ttir. She was the eldest of five siblings. After completing high school in Reykjavik, she studied at the University of Iceland where she earned a master's degree (cand.phil.) in 1932. In 1938, she married Finnboga R√∫t Valdemarsson. Two years later they moved to Marbakka¬∑near K√≥pavogur where they raised five children. Both she and her husband became involved in the administrative affairs of K√≥pavogur which gained the status of a town in 1955. Hulda was elected mayor on 4 June 1957 and remained in office until 1962. She was the first woman in Iceland to become a mayor. Under her leadership, the town developed considerably with a school, church, social centre and swimming pool. She also served as a local representative in K√≥pavogur from 1970 to 1974.

This river successively crosses the townships of Thibaudeau, Bignell, McCorkill, Rinfret, Vimont, Dollier, Charron and Ducharme. The lower part of the Boisvert River valley runs through the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. The southern part of the Boisvert River valley is served by route 167 which connects Chibougamau to Saint-F√©licien, Quebec. Forest Road R1004 (heading northeast) that connects to route 167 serves the northwestern part of the Boisvert River valley and the eastern part of the valley from the Armitage River. The forest road R0210 (North-South direction) serves the eastern part of the valley of the Boisvert River and the valley of the Hogan River. Finally, the R1007 forest road serves the head lake area.

Life and work  Doswald spent his childhood and youth in Wettingen and his birthplace, Baden. From 1981 to 1989, he studied history, art history and political science at the University of Zurich, interrupted by relatively long stays in Spain and Latin America. In the mid-1980s, he began to work as a publicist, writing about themes and exhibitions of contemporary art, e.g. for Kunstforum International,Christoph Doswald: ‚ÄûKunst ist paradoxerweise oft die Speerspitze urbaner Transformationsprozesse‚Äú.

Under the pseudonym Dr. Kuno, Doswald wrote a weekly lifestyle column from 1991 to 2000, first for SonntagsZeitung, then in Schweizer Illustrierte. In 1998, together with Monica Glisenti, he conceived the cross-culture magazine \\"cashual\\" for the publisher Ringier. This monthly magazine combined artistic and journalistic strategies, e.g. hiring Nan Goldin as a photojournalist and Pipilotti Rist as a model, but was already discontinued after just six issues. From 2002 to 2008, Doswald headed the Society section of the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.N.N.: Christoph Doswald nimmt den Hut SonntagsZeitung, 6 May 2008. Together with Paolo Bianchi in 1985/86, Doswald managed a space for ephemeral art projects in their shared flat in Baden ‚Äì an artist-run space \\"avant la lettre\\". In this informal setting, they exhibited the works of befriended artists and organised performances. From 1988 to 1992, Doswald was a member of the board (and chairman on an interim basis) at Zurich's Shedhalle, where curator Harm Lux ran an ambitious exhibition programme, e.g. with projects by Jordi Colomer, Francesca Woodman, Christian Marclay, Sylvie Fleury, Christopher Williams, Pipilotti Rist, Thomas Hirschhorn and Daniele Buetti. In parallel, from the mid-1980s onwards, Doswald curated exhibitions, e.g. at Kunsthaus Graz, Villa Arson in Nice, Kunstmuseum Bern, Centre Pasquart Biel and the Academy of Arts in Berlin. From 2001 to 2007, he was a member of the \\"Comit√© technique\\", the purchasing committee at Fonds R√©gional d'Art Contemporain (FRAC PACA) in Marseille,:de:Regionalfonds f√ºr zeitgen√∂ssische Kunst where he realised various exhibitions, e.g. with Ugo Rondinone and Maria Marshall.Website Maria Marshall.

She was the wife of British scientist Charles Tomlinson, a member of the Royal Society.  Biography  Windsor was born on Innocent‚Äôs Day at Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1809. She was educated by her elder sister, Maria, who shaped her character and upbringing. She also trained in Sunday-School teaching and parochial work at St. Thomas's Church, Salisbury, under the guidance of Rev. Mr. Capel, the then Rector of Wareham, and Mrs. Capel, the then officiating minister of St. Thomas's. At the age of 22, Sarah worked as an educator for the two eldest daughters of a lady in North Wiltshire; she served under the lady for five years, to whom she owed her development in becoming a good wife and housekeeper. In 1835, Windsor's elder sister Maria married Rev. L. Tomlinson, who managed a large school in Salisbury with his brother Charles Tomlinson.Kurzer, F. ‚ÄúThe Life and Work of Charles Tomlinson FRS: a Career in Victorian Science and Technology.‚Äù The Life and Work of Charles Tomlinson FRS: a Career in Victorian Science and Technology, vol. 58, no. 2, 22 May 2004, rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/58/2/203?origin=publication_detail--. Sarah married Charles in 1839, and the couple moved to London, where they lived in a small house at 12 Bedford Place, Euston. Charles was involved in a wide range of literary and scientific engagements in London. For many years, the couple worked together on the Saturday Magazine, publishing weekly articles about nature, science, history and technology. Sarah also wrote several books for the Committee of General Literature and Education, under the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among her prominent worksThe Publishers' Circular and General Record of British and Foreign Literature. Vol. 24, Sampson Low, 1860. were a series titled First Steps in General Knowledge, Sketches of Rural Affairs and Lessons Derived from the Animal World. In 1842, the couple moved to a bigger house at 178 Hampstead Road when Charles was appointed at King‚Äôs College. The couple often received boarding students from the Department of Applied Sciences, which placed great responsibility on Sarah to manage the household and discipline of the students. The couple also hosted Saturday evening parties, which were attended by scientists, artists, and writers. In 1866, the Tomlinsons moved to a new home at 7 North Road, Highgate. Sarah became a superintendent to a parochial mission in London, where one of her duties involved reading books to mothers assembled at the weekly meetings. While she served there, she wrote Tales For Mission Rooms, By a Lady Superintendent, a collection of short stories about morality and values.

Location The project involves the construction of flyovers at the \\"Clock Tower\\", and at \\"Kitgum House\\", the widening of Nsambya Road and of Mukwano Road, including the improvements of interfacing roads and junctions. The project stretches over an estimated . Overview This road project is intended to decongest the city by separating through-traffic from the city-street-traffic. This project focuses on traffic entering the city, mainly from Entebbe along the old Kampala-Entebbe Road and from Mpigi, along the Kampala-Mpigi Expressway. Traffic from these routes, destined to Lugogo, Nakawa and points along the Kampala-Jinja Highway will find this new route faster and more user-friendly, reducing travel times and leading to less carbon emissions from exhaust fumes in stalled traffic on the city streets. Also, by removing the pass-through traffic, off the city streets, the congestion will be lessened. Background In an attempt to reduce gridlock within the city of Kampala, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) commissioned a study in 2010 which was updated in 2013 and 2014 to examine available options for alleviating chronic traffic jams in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area. The Government of Uganda accepted the recommendation of the study and through the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), engaged Nippon Koei in a joint venture with Eighth Japan Engineering Company (EJEC) and Infra Consulting Services Limited (ICS) to carry out the detailed design and tender assistance of the Kampala Flyover Project. The project (Jinja Road ‚Äì Mukwano Road ‚Äì Queen‚Äôs Way) is funded by the Ugandan government, with financing from JICA. Construction The first phase of this project is expected to begin in 2018, once a contractor has been selected. The work is budgeted at US$148 to US$200 million (depending on sources), borrowed from the Government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency. On 19 December 2018, construction of this project was flagged off by Yoweri Museveni, Uganda's president. The first phase is budgeted at USh300 billion (US$82 million).

Relations between South Korea and Latin America have been growing since the 1960s. In the past decade, South Korean companies such as LG Corporation and Samsung have established businesses in Latin America, which improved trade relations between the two regions. LG and Samsung also played a role in the spread of K-Pop to Latin America. K-Pop by LG was a yearly dancing competition sponsored by LG electronics in Colombia. K-Pop by LG took place from 2011 to 2013 during the months of October through December in Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, and Cali, three major cities in Colombia. Samsung was named the official sponsor for South Korean boy band Big Bang during their first worldwide concert tour in 2012, the Big Bang Alive Galaxy Tour. Big Bang performed in Lima, Peru, the only city in South America they visited as part of their Alive Galaxy tour, on November 14, 2012. In 2011, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government agencies organized the first K-Pop World Festival in Changwon, South Korea. This festival consists of K-Pop fans performing for global auditions and a finale in South Korea. In 2018, 71 countries participated in the global auditions, 17 of these in Latin America.  Television appearances  On August 31, 2011, the official Facebook page for El Gran Show, a Peruvian dance reality show, released a survey asking their viewers to suggest a genre of music for the contestants to perform to. Most voters agreed that the show should feature K-Pop dancing routines. However, the show producers ignored the public's request, which led to turmoil and backlash from the Peruvian K-Pop fan-base. On November 10, 2012, El Gran Show featured dance performances to popular K-Pop songs: ‚ÄúRing Ding Dong‚Äù by SHINee, ‚ÄúFantastic Baby\\" by Big Bang, ‚ÄúSorry, Sorry‚Äù by Super Junior, and ‚ÄúGangnam Style‚Äù by Psy. On November 1, 2012, U-Kiss appeared on Dos Sapos una Reina (Two toads one Queen), a Peruvian television show, to perform the title track for their 7th mini album \\"Stop Girl,\\" and to witness a choreography competition to their songs. They were introduced to the Peruvian audience as an Asian sensation with over one million followers on Facebook at the time. K-Pop continues to appear in other Latin American television shows and media. In 2014, K-Pop was featured in Bailando por un Sue√±o (Dancing for a Dream) in a segment of Showmatch in Argentina. The program was successful with the help of Alejandro Velazquez better known as DJ Mosquito and the creator of VEGA Radio. VEGA Radio is a Pop and K-Pop radio station in Argentina that reproduces music for 6 different stations and is available live, online, and on the app. Hundreds of K-Pop fans in Argentina showed their support to the appearance of K-Pop on national Argentinian television by organizing a flash mob. The flash mob took place on November 23, 2014 at the Planetario Galileo Galilei located in Buenos Aires, where the fans danced to their favorite K-Pop songs such as \\"Hurricane Venus\\" by BoA, \\"Mr. Mr.\\" by Girl's Generation and 2PM's \\"Go Crazy.\\"  Concerts  In recent years, an increasing number of K-pop groups have performed in Latin America. In 2013, the boy group Super Junior performed in four South American countries ‚Äï Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru -- as part of its Super Show 5 tour. Additionally, that same year on November 7, it had a show at Mexico City Arena, which attracted over 17,000 fans. Super Junior performed on April 27, 2018, at Mexico City Arena, a stage where various famous Latin American artists such as Ozuna, J Balvin, and Marco Antonio Sol√≠s also performed in 2018. NU'EST held concerts in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Peru in 2014. In 2017, BTS visited Brazil and Chile where it performed as part of the Live Trilogy Episode III, the Wings Tour. On March 11-12, 2017, BTS held concerts in Santiago, Chile, and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on March 19-20.  Impacts  On November 30, 2006, the first Korean Cultural Center in Latin America was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Two other cultural centers were founded in Mexico City (2012) and S√£o Paulo (2013). The Korean Cultural Center, Mexico City in Mexico officially opened to the public on March 13, 2012. This center is in Polanco, Mexico City, as a base for the spread of Hallyu in the region. Mexico City is known for its K-pop fan base of over 3 million. The 32 KCCs all around the globe are a project sponsored by the Korean Culture and Information Service, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in South Korea. The main purpose of these centers is to promote Korean culture and strengthen bilateral relations between South Korea and other nations. Concerts featuring traditional and popular Korean music, art shows, film festivals and Korean cooking lessons are among the many events sponsored and organized by the KCCs in Latin America. Over the past decade, a number of K-pop groups and idols have included Spanish phrases in their lyrics.

It was approved for medical use both in Japan and in the United States in 2018, and is taken as a single dose by mouth. It may reduce the duration of flu symptoms by about a day, but is prone to selection of resistant mutants that render it ineffectual. Baloxavir marboxil was developed as a prodrug strategy, with its metabolism releasing the active agent, baloxavir acid (BXA). BXA then functions as enzyme inhibitor, targeting the influenza virus' cap-dependent endonuclease activity, used in \\"cap snatching\\" by the virus' polymerase complex, a process essential to its life-cycle. BXM was developed for the market by Shionogi Co., a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and Switzerland- based Roche AG. The names under which BXM and BXA appear in Shionogi research reporting are S-033188 and S-033447, respectively. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Medical uses Baloxavir marboxil is an influenza medication, an antiviral, that is taken as a single dose tablet, by mouth, by individuals that are twelve years of age or older, that have presented symptoms of this infection for no more than 48 hours. The efficacy of baloxavir marboxil administered after 48 hours has not been tested. In October 2019, the FDA approved an updated indication for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people twelve years of age and older at risk of influenza complications. Resistance In 2.2% of baloxavir recipients in the Phase II trial and in about 10% of baloxavir recipients in the Phase III trial, the infecting influenza strain had acquired resistance to the drug, due to variants of the polymerase protein displaying substitutions of isoleucine-38, specifically, the I38T, I38M, or I38F mutations. There is continuing research into and clinical concern over the resistance appearing in patients, in response to treatment with this drug. Side effects Common side effects following the single dose administration of baloxavir were diarrhea, bronchitis, common cold, headache, and nausea. Adverse events were reported in 21% of people who received baloxavir, 25% of those receiving placebo, and 25% of oseltamivir.  Mechanism of action  Baloxavir marboxil is an influenza therapeutic agent, specifically, an enzyme inhibitor targeting the influenza virus' cap-dependent endonuclease activity, one of the activities of the virus polymerase complex. In particular, it inhibits a process known as cap snatching, by which the virus derives short, capped primers from host cell RNA transcripts, which it then uses for polymerase-catalyzed synthesis of its needed viral mRNAs. A polymerase subunit binds to the host pre-mRNAs at their 5‚Ä≤-caps, then the polymerase's endonuclease activity catalyzes its cleavage \\"after 10‚Äì13 nucleotides\\". As such, its mechanism is distinct from neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. Chemistry Baloxavir marboxil is a substituted pyridone derivative of a polycyclic family, whose chemical synthesis has been reported in a number of ways by the company discovering it, Shionogi and Co. of Japan (as well as others); the Shionogi reports have appeared several times in the Japanese patent literature between 2016 and 2019, providing insight into possible industrial synthetic routes that may be in use. Baloxavir marboxil (BXM) is a prodrug whose active agent, baloxavir acid (BXA) is released rapidly in vivo, as the hydrolysis of BXM is catalysed by arylacetamide deacetylases in cells of the blood, liver, and lumen of the small intestine. The compound numbers for BXM and BXA used in publications by Shionogi and others during discovery and development (prior to assignment of a United States Adopted Name (USAN)) were, respectively, S-033188 and S-033447. As reported in a review of the patent literature, the carbonic acid ester (carbonate) moiety of the prodrug‚Äîshown in the lower left-hand corner of the image above‚Äîwas prepared during discovery and development research from a late stage 2-hydroxy-4-pyridone precursor by treatment with chloromethyl methyl carbonate.  Approval  Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (JMHLW) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved baloxavir marboxil based on evidence of its benefits and side effects from two clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients with uncomplicated influenza (Trial 1, 1518T0821 and Trial 2, NCT02954354), involving 1119 patients. Both trials included clincal sites and patients in Japan, with Trial 2 adding clinical locations in the United States. As of September 2018, in the only report of a Phase III randomized, controlled trial, baloxavir reduced the duration of influenza symptoms of otherwise healthy outpatients by about one day compared with a placebo treatment group, and comparable with what was seen for an oseltamivir treatment group. On the first day after baloxavir was started in its treatment group of patients, viral loads decreased more than in patients in either the oseltamivir or placebo groups; however, after five days, the effect on viral load of the single dose of baloxavir was indistinguishable from the effect observed following the complete, 5-day regimen of oseltamivir in its treatment group. Baloxavir marboxil was approved for sale in Japan in February 2018. In October 2018, the FDA approved it for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in people twelve years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. The FDA application of baloxavir marboxil was granted priority review in the United States, and approval of Xofluza was granted to Shionogi & Co., Ltd. in October 2018. Specifically, the FDA approved the use of baloxavir marboxil for people at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. In October 2019, the FDA approved an updated indication for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people twelve years of age and older at risk of influenza complications. Baloxavir marboxil was approved for medical use in Australia in February 2020. Research While it is being studied in COVID-19, no published evidence supports its use as of 8 April 2020.

Location Dunmore Castle is located northwest of Dunmore, County Galway, on the north bank of the Sinking River. History The castle photographed c. 1910, with local people at lower left Tradition states that Dunmore (Irish d√∫n m√≥r, \\"great hillfort\\") was a lesser residence of the ancient Kings of Connacht. The first castle at Dunmore was built by De Birmingham family in the early 13th century as a bulwark against Gaelic Irish attacks. In 1249 Dunmore was attacked and burned by the √ì Conchubhair (O'Conors). In 1284 it was besieged by the S√≠ol Maelruain under Fiachra O'Flynn. In 1315 the castle was damaged by Rory O'Conor during the Bruce campaign in Ireland. Most of the present structure dates from the early 14th century, i.e. the reigns of Edward II and III as Lords of Ireland: it was a two-storey hall keep. Dunmore Castle was modified in the 16th century, with extra floors, roof gables, chimneys, windows and a ground floor entrance. The de Berminghams rebelled against Queen Elizabeth I and the castle was taken from them in 1569 by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of Ireland, although it was later returned. The castle was seized from the de Berminghams permanently in the Cromwellian era (1650s). It was occupied by the Ouseley family (including the famous preacher Gideon Ouseley) until the 19th century. A lime kiln was built on the site in the 19th century. The castle is at present under the protection of the Office of Public Works. Description The castle is a rectangular five-storey keep measuring at base with a large base-batter. There is evidence for a garderobe at the northwest. The windows include an oculus, mullions and arrowslits. Some of the curtain wall survives.

She was a strong proponent of early education and moral development in children, although she never had children of her own. Throughout her most productive years (1855‚Äì85) she wrote over 60 novels, most of which were published by the American Sunday School Union.Crabbe, Katharyn F. ‚ÄúGuernsey, Lucy Ellen.‚Äù Encyclopedia.com, www.encyclopedia.com/arts/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/guernsey-lucy- ellen. She was an active member of the Rochester community; she founded the first sewing school for lower-class children and was involved establishing the Home for Aged Women. She edited a popular religious publication, The Parish Visitor, taught an adult biblical class for Sunday School, and was the president of the Christ Church Missionary Society (1881‚Äì85).‚ÄúChrist Church, Rochester, Western New York: A Story-Chronological.‚Äù Christ Church, Rochester, Western New York: A Story-Chronological, by Jane M. Parker, Christ Church, 1905, p. 124.  Family  Lucy and her sister Clara were daughters of James T. and Electra Guernsey. Her father, James, was a Rochester-area businessman and philanthropist who helped build up his community of western New York in both a cultural and moral fashion. In addition to his business ventures, he was largely responsible for introducing horticulture into the area. James was also known as an anti-slavery activist long before the abolitionist movement gained traction in the North, but among the community he was best known as a friend of the Native Americans. Among the famous Seneca chiefs he befriended, he was most intimate with Red Jacket and Cornplanter.‚ÄúRochester Democrat and Chronicle.‚Äù Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, 21 June 1893. When Lucy and Clara were young, her father invited twenty or thirty Seneca braves to stay in their house.Peck, William F. History of Rochester and Monroe County, New York. The Pioneer Publishing Company, 1908. This had a profound impact on Clara‚Äôs development, as she later went on to write about the Seneca tribes, aid them during a food shortage, and become a daughter of a local tribe.‚ÄúRochester Democrat and Chronicle.‚Äù Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, 4 Nov. 1899. Although Lucy didn‚Äôt have as deep of a connection to the Seneca‚Äôs later in life, she was also a great friend like her father.  Work and involvement  From an early age, Guernsey showed high potential for literary success later in life. After being home schooled she attended Miss Araminta Doolittle‚Äôs academy where she was noted as a model of ‚Äúdecorum and studiousness.‚ÄùHawley, Natalie F. ‚ÄúLiterature in Rochester.‚Äù Rochester History, vol. 10, no. 1, Jan. 1948, pp. 11‚Äì12. In later years, Guernsey devoted herself to charity work and editorial work at St. Luke‚Äôs church. She was an active member of the Rochester Female Charitable Society and a lifelong member of St. Luke‚Äôs church. Towards the beginning of her career as an author, she wrote for magazines such as Atlantic Monthly and Harpers, in addition to her publications with the American Sunday School Union. Guernsey worked with another religious publishing firm formerly known as Thomas Nelson and Sons (currently Thomas Nelson). During the last 11 productive years of her life she was in charge of editing the Parish Visitor, a religious publication intended for distribution in prisons, homes, and hospitals.  Literary genre  A majority of Guernsey‚Äôs novels can be classified as works of domestic fictions. She often focused on problems associated with reaching responsible maturity and the implication of family life during these developmental times. In particular, Guernsey is most distinguished for her astute observations of people and animals as well as her natural dialogue. Often the American Sunday School Union publications were short pamphlets, yet Guernsey would write 200-page novels. Due to the sheer volume of her work, Guernsey was criticized for poorly constructed plots, but nevertheless, the content and morals of her stories were representative of the community‚Äôs preferred juvenile teachings.

Councillors were elected in single multi-member districts, consisting of the municipality's territory, using an open list proportional representation system. Voting was on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot. The mayors were elected in a two- round system.

Native to the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found on the continental slope at depths between . Description The shortbeard codling can grow to a maximum standard length of about and takes the form of a somewhat spindle-shaped cylinder. The snout is fairly blunt and the upper jaw is slightly longer than the lower jaw. There is a short barbel on the chin and a flattened spine on the operculum. There are two dorsal fins with no spines and a total of from 69 to 76 soft rays. The first dorsal fin has 6 rays, the second of which is the longest, and the second dorsal fin originates immediately behind the first fin. Each pectoral fin has 17 to 23 soft rays. The pelvic fins are widely separated and each has two elongated soft rays; these fins originate to the front of the pectoral fins. The anal fin has no spines and has 57 to 63 soft rays. The caudal fin is small and rounded. The general colour of this fish is tan, the dorsal and anal fins having dark edges. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the western Atlantic Ocean between about 57¬∞N and 4¬∞N, its range extending southwards from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the Bahamas, and the Gulf of Mexico, the depth range being from around down to about . Ecology L. barbatulum is one of the dominant fishes in the more open areas of the continental slope, away from deepwater coral reefs. Other fish found in these locations include the underworld windowskate (Fenestraja plutonia), the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa, and the shortnose greeneye Chlorophthalmus agassizi. It is a demersal predator, feeding on such invertebrates as bivalves, gastropod molluscs, polychaete worms and tanaids, crushing its prey with its beak-like jaws.Priede (2017), p. 110.

Gade died in 1900. After a few years a committee of private citizens began to work for the creation of a monument that would commemorate the composer. A site on Sankt Ann√¶ Plads close to the Garrison Church where Gade for many years had worked as organist, was selected. The committee commissioned the sculptor Vilhelm Bissen to design a memorial and the bronze sculpture was cast at Lauritz Rasmussen's bronze foundry. The monument was unveiled on Sankt Ann√¶ Plads on 24 June 1897. The monument was moved to its current location in √òstre Anl√¶g in May 1934.

Origins It was established under the authority of the Narkompros and funded through the Department of Fine Arts (IZO). In May 1920 Anatoly Lunacharsky appointed Wassily Kandinsky as its first director. David Shterenberg, who was at that time the director of IZO, stated \\"We organised the INKhUK as a cell for the determination of scientific hypotheses on matters of art\\". In its first year it attracted about 30 visual artists, Architects, musicians and art critics. Many of them were also taught at Vkhutemas and published in LEF. One of the consequences of state funding was the maintenance of stenographic records, originally kept by Varvara Stepanova and after 1921 by Nikolai Tarabukin. These were published in 1979 by Selim Khan-Magomedov. Kandinsky's Inaugural Programme In Grey (1919) by Kandinsky , exhibited at the 19th State Exhibition, Moscow, 1920 Kandinsky's presented the Inaugural Programme in June 1920 to conference with delegates from the Svomas (State Free Art Studios). Central to his presentation was the idea of a \\"science of art\\" whereby would research into the \\"fundamental elements\\" of art in general, as well as more specific \\"supplementary elements\\" which are less generalised, even within a specific medium. The organisation was to be composed of three sections: * research of the fundamental elements of painting, sculpture, architecture, music, dancing and poetry * research into the intrinsic, organic and synthetic ways in which the different arts are linked * research into monumental art, which Kandinsky predicted would become the art of the future. However nothing much came from the first two sections, and only the third section achieved anything. Supported by both Stepanova and Alexander Rodchenko, this section had 33 meetings between May and December 1920. In fact this section ended up dealing with a broad variety of issues from folk songs, children's art, faktura, lubki, African sculpture and dance as well as the sort of study of the fundamental elements originally allocated to the first section. Although Kandinsky adopted what superficially appeared to be scientific methods to determine the nature of these elements, for example by circulating surveys, the way these surveys were drawn seemed to indicate his approach was more predetermined by his aesthetic theories - such as the centrality of the artists \\"inner necessity\\" - than a more objective approach. Thus his colleagues started organising a way to resist the subjectivism of what was referred to as \\"Kandinsky's psychologism\\". The Working Group of Objective Analysis Criticism of Kandinsky was initiated by Nikolay Punin, who complained his art was accidental and individualistic. This encouraged Stepanova, Rodchenko, Liubov Popova and Varvara Bubnova to form the Working Group of Objective Analysis in November 1920.

Career  Anne Distel is professor of art history at Paris- Sorbonne University. She is the author of numerous books on nineteenth-century paintings. She is particularly interested in Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and was the curator of the monographic exhibition of Renoir which was presented at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1985. She organised a lecture, \\"Renoir and the Woman of Paris\\", at The Frick Collection art museum in 2012. She authored (1993), a lavishly illustrated pocket book for the collection \\"D√©couvertes Gallimard\\", which has been translated into six languages, including English; and Renoir, a 400-page book packaged in a box set, published in English in 2010. During an interview with √âditions Gallimard, Distel pointed out that collectors‚Äîfor example, Albert C. Barnes‚Äîplayed a very important role in Renoir's life, and were the cause of evolution of his style. Barnes built a foundation to house his eclectic private collection in 1922. The foundation had a goal of education consistent with Barnes' very democratic ideas about the spread of culture. Distel was nominated Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2008.

It begins directly after the German Bundesautobahn 96 at the German-Austrian border near H√∂rbranz, passes through the Pf√§ndertunnel past Bregenz into the Rhine Valley, through the Ambergtunnel past Feldkirch into the Walgau and ends at Bludenz, becoming the Arlberg Schnellstra√üe (S16). Until 2006, the official name of the A14 was only Rheintal Autobahn. In Vorarlberg, the name Rheintal Autobahn was only used for the part of the A14 in the Rhine Valley (i.e. the route H√∂rbranz-Feldkirch), while the part located in the Walgau (Feldkirch-Bludenz) was unofficially referred to as the Walgau Autobahn.  History   Prehistory and plans  Already in the mid-1930s, traffic planners recognized that the rapidly increasing motorized traffic would be too much for existing roads. A first study was commissioned before the Nazi era and had the title HaFraBa (motorway Hanseatic cities- Frankfurt-Basel). After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1939, another highway study was commissioned, which provided for a connection from Wangen im Allg√§u to Feldkirch. It would only connect to the cities of Lindau, Bregenz, Dornbirn and Feldkirch. An alpine road would lead via the Pf√§nder to Scheidegg to the Queralpenstra√üe. These plans, however, were thrown out with the beginning of the war in 1939. In occupied post-war Austria, motorization had reached its lowest level. Only in 1952 Baurat Netzer developed a study that envisaged the expansion of the Bundesstra√üe 1 with bypasses. An overload of the highways could only be divined in the local thoroughfares. The first large-scale traffic census in 1955 and a traffic forecast based on it showed that even in Vorarlberg, an extension of the Bundesstra√üe alone would not have the desired effect. A memorandum from 1956 mentions a motorway from Unterhochsteg to Feldkirch and from Lauterach to the Swiss border. The planning for these was started immediately, as there was a need, especially in the area of Bregenz.  Final planning and construction  Aerial view of the Dornbirn-Nord junction in 1977, where the highway ended at this time A14 Rheintalautobahn seen from Gebhardsberg Characteristic crossing of the Udelberg at G√∂tzis Tunneling machine during the construction of the second Pf√§ndertunnel tube On October 29, 1965, ground was broken for the construction of the first section of the Rheintal Autobahn from Dornbirn Nord to G√∂tzis Stra√üenh√§user.Vorarlberger Nachrichten vom 29. The rock material extracted from the Udelberg puncture was mainly used for this construction phase. The geological subsurface of this construction phase, in particular at Dornbirn- Nord, is unstable to this day and requires frequent adjustments and improvements.Vorarlberger Nachrichten vom 17. This motorway section was opened for traffic on 17 December 1971.Vorarlberger Nachrichten vom 17. Only in 1973, after several years of preparation and uncertainty, did the planning of the Pf√§ndertunnel begin as another important part of the new motorway. Already a year later, the directional tunnel was tendered, and breakthrough occurred on 4 December 1975. The full excavation of the tunnel began in the autumn of 1976. At the same time, access roads were built from the Austria-Germany border and to the Dornbirn-Nord junction. On December 10, 1980, the new tunnel was officially opened, but still without a connection to the city of Bregenz at this time. In the following years, the expansion of this highway to Feldkirch was sped up. The Ambergtunnel to Frastanz was opened on 16 July 1985, which opened the way to the Walgau. In the meantime, the motorway section in the Walgau had already been opened on June 5, 1981, which was now connected to the section in the Rhine Valley. With the Arlbergschnellstra√üe (S 16) there was thus a direct road connection from the German border near H√∂rbranz to the neighboring state of Tyrol, but only two lanes with oncoming traffic in the area of the two large tunnels.  Adaptation to traffic conditions  As a result of the massive increase in traffic in the 1980s and 1990s, plans for the second tube of the Amberg Tunnel began before the turn of the millennium. In December 2003, it was opened to traffic. Finally, in the summer of 2004, the original tube, which had been in existence since 1985, was completely refurbished and adapted for one-way operation. The plans for a second Pf√§ndertunnel tube could only begin with a change in the transport concept of Vorarlberg in 2001. Up to this time, it was planned to prevent the expansion in order to maintain the gatekeeper effect on the traffic. However, since this gatekeeping effect did not occur and the traffic load in the secondary road network was increasingly higher due to congestion avoidance traffic in Bregenz and the surrounding area, this concept was finally changed and the planning started. Construction of the second tube began in April 2006 and was completed in June 2012, after which the old tube was completely renovated. The full operation of both tubes in directional traffic began on 3 July 2013. The project for the construction of a junction \\"Rheintal Mitte\\" in Dornbirn is currently being planned. In the area of today's underpass of the L 45 Schmitternstra√üe under the Rheintal/Walgau Autobahn, a new motorway junction is to be built, which, in connection with the expansion of the L 45, should connect the operating areas in the south of Dornbirn to the highest- ranking road network. The start of construction is scheduled to begin in 2018 at the earliest.Land Vorarlberg, Abteilung Stra√üenbau: Autobahnanschlussstelle Rheintal Mitte / L 45. The Wolfurt-Lauterach half-interchange is to be expanded, with the conversion of the Wolfurt freight yard, to a full interchange, in order to counteract the steadily growing truck traffic of the municipalities of Lauterach and Wolfurt.

He located the galaxy's position with a total of two observations. As he also noted the mag 11-12 star just 2' northwest, his position is fairly accurate.

It stands above the village of Virneburg in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Virneburg, 2016 aerial photograph  History  The castle was probably built in the second half of the 12th century as a fief of the count palatine. The first record of the castle can be found in an 1192 document, in which the brothers Godfrey and Frederick of Virneburg gave their castle Vernenburgh together with the county and all its estate to the Archbishop of Trier, John I, as a fiefdom. This document is not preserved in the original, the 16th- century copy is either a faulty translation or a forgery due to the wording contained therein, which was not yet customary around 1200.Wilhelm Iwanski: Geschichte der Grafen von Virneburg: von ihren Anf√§ngen bis auf Robert IV. (1383). Supplement 2, Coblenz, 1912, pp. 81 ff. The lords of Virneburg, later elevated to the rank of count, are first mentioned in a document by the Archbishop of Trier, Poppo, in 1042 where a certain Bernhardus de Virneburch is recorded. At that time, feudal sovereignty had passed to the counts of Sayn, but John of Sayn relinquished it in 1358 to the counts palatine, with the exception of the castle, which was still mentioned in 1506 as a male fief to the counts of Sayn, even though the counts of Virneburg no longer recognised their feudal sovereignty. In 1339, Count Rupert of Virneburg gave part of the castle to the Elector of Trier, Baldwin to pay off a debt. It refers for the first time to the hoechste thurn (\\"highest tower\\"), probably the old bergfried built when the castle was constructed. In 1414, the counts of Virneburg had to hand over the rest of the castle to the Archbishop, Werner of Falkenstein, to whom the county had always been a thorn in the side. Only a few years later, however, the people of Virneburg succeeded in redeeming their castle from being an enfeoffment of Trier. On the death of Count Cunos of Virneburg in 1545, the Virneburg family died out. Its heirs were the counts of Mark-Arenberg and then the counts of Manderscheid-Blankenheim before being confiscated a little later by Trier as a terminated fiefdom. Following an objection by the counts of Manderscheid-Schleiden, however, it was returned to them in 1549 as a fiefdom. The property was acquired in 1600 by L√∂wenstein- Wertheim. An inventory of the castle made at that time lists twelve rooms. The bergfried had been replaced and was given a new chemin de ronde in 1623, but by 1663 the castle was described as being very dilapidated, especially \\"on the sides with the high walls and well\\". A restoration was postponed at that time and, in 1665, the walls in the front and upper courtyard of the castle had \\"completely fallen down and unrestored\\". In 1670, the dilapidated bergfried was demolished and rebuilt the following year. The dilapidated enceinte was repaired and the most necessary construction work was carried out in the castle. When the French invaded the Eifel, the castle was blown up in 1689, the tower was completely destroyed, its residential buildings went up in flames, and the enceinte was slighted. On the initiative of the Royal District Court of Adenau, the castle ruin was sold publicly on 19 January 1914 for 1,080 Marks to the Rhenish Society for the Preservation of Monuments and Landscape (Rheinischer Verein f√ºr Denkmalpflege und Landschaftsschutz). Ausschnitte aus ‚ÄûEntstehung und Entwicklung der Orte der Verbandsgemeinde Vordereifel‚Äú, Kapitel Virneburg von G√ºnter Pung  Description  The ruins of Virneburg ‚Äì part of the shield wall The remains of the castle are located on a slate dome surrounded by the Nitzbach stream on three sides. The kuppe climbs steeply to a height of 80 metres and its elliptical outline defines the layout of the castle. A path starting at the south-east corner of the castle hill ends after about five minutes climb on the terrain of the old south-east zwinger, which was reinforced at its south corner by a round tower. The walls of this zwinger have been destroyed except for a few remains, only the shape of terrain makes the course of the wall still discernible. Through a gate in the adjacent defensive wall of the inner bailey to the west, one reaches the heart of the castle, which used to be densely packed with buildings apart from a narrow courtyard. The original main entrance to the castle was in the west. Here, the inner bailey had a spacious semicircular outer bailey in front of it, which was accessible through a gatehouse and was reinforced by a round tower on the southern wall of the zwinger. Along the southern zwinger wall, the path led to the surviving gate of the main castle, which was dominated by a mighty bergfried, which has disappeared today. In front of the gate itself, the ogival arch bridge over the neck ditch is still visible, the half on the gate side used to be completed by a drawbridge which no longer exists. Just as with the Virneburgs' castle of L√∂wenburg above Monreal, in front of the Bergfried was a shield wall, which has largely survived and is about 3 metres thick and still 18 metres high. It has been built painstakingly of brick and on its crown was a chemin de ronde. The probably continued to the north of the present structure. On this wall, probably built as part of the original castle, the two-storey gatehouse and other buildings of the inner bailey were added. To the right of the castle gate at the corner of the wall is a round tower with a square interior, which is still 15 metres high. It is followed by the line of the residential building, from which a small square tower, 3 metres wide, projects. The palas itself is still two storeys high; it was not given its present appearance until the 16th century. Outside, on the more weathered masonry, is an older, filled-in basement with two square windows, its divisions can still be seen on the basalt consoles. The base of the eastern outer wall of the palas is still preserved. This continued to the north and formed the outer wall of other buildings.

Description Eagles is a CCG designed by Tom Dalgliesh. The game is similar in set-up and strategy to Columbia's Dixie CCG released the previous year, albeit with expanded rules, and set in the days of the Napoleonic Wars. The game recreates Napoleon's Waterloo campaign during the Hundred Days. The base set has 300 cards with a total of 900 variants, and the battle deck can consist of 60 or 120 cards representing the French, British, Dutch and Prussian regiments. The cards had no rarity; instead each card was printed in three versions: Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Every card was individually available or sold as a complete set via direct order from the company. Reception In the August 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 232), Rick Swan liked the game, saying, \\"It isn't fantasy, you say, but who cares? You might be surprised to learn the tactics aren't all that different from those in Magic: The Gathering.\\" He concluded, \\"If you're the adventurous type, you still ought to give this a look.\\" In the Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist & Price Guide, Second Edition (2003), John Jackson Miller considered the game to be \\"very playable\\".

Liszt believed that the work was rich and powerful. In 1853 Schumann revised the work and added a Scherzo as a second movement, which the performer could choose to play, or not play. In 1861 it was released into the hands of his student Johannes Brahms. Movements # Allegro brillante (F minor) #Scherzo. Molto commodo (D-flat major) # Quasi variazioni. Andantino de Clara Wieck (F minor) #Prestissimo possible (F minor, ends in F major) The work, in general, is a typical sonata with some surprises such as Clara Schumann's andantino. The final movement is reminiscent of his Kreisleriana, op. 16. This movement ends with a coda in F major concluding the work in a brilliant and powerful way.

He was the secretary general of Workers' Force from 1948 to 1963. Born in Baule, Bothereau worked on the family's vineyard while his father fought in World War I, then completed an apprenticeship as a car mechanic. He joined the Metalworkers' Federation, an affiliate of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). He undertook his compulsory military service in Orleans, then afterwards remained there, working as a car mechanic. As he was employed by the government, he joined the local union of state workers, soon becoming its deputy secretary, and also serving on the committee of the Orleans trades council. He began to do much work for the departmental CGT union, and in 1929, was elected as its secretary. CGT membership in the department grew under Bothereau, and his skills were recognised by CGT leader L√©on Jouhaux. in 1933, he was appointed to the CGT executive, where he worked closely with Jouhaux, his responsibilities including labour issues, relationships with the departmental unions, and publication of La Voix du Peuple. Bothereau was called up at the start of World War II, but remained supportive of the CGT line, denouncing the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, and trying to maintain activity in spite of increasing government restrictions. In 1940, Ren√© Belin led a minority of the CGT into collaboration with the Vichy government, and Bothereau met with Belin against Jouhaux's advice, but ultimately decided to side with the resistance. In 1941, he secretly relocated to northern France, jointly leading the underground northern section of the CGT with Louis Saillant and Albert Gazier, while running the workshop at a training centre in Paris. The CGT was established legally following the liberation of France, and Bothereau returned to its executive, resigning in 1947 and working with Jouhaux to form Workers' Force (FO), established in April 1948. Jouhaux opted to become president of FO, leaving the post of general secretary open to Bothereau. The federation remained fairly small under his leadership, priding itself on its independence from political parties, and its affiliation to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Bothereau retired in 1963, serving on the general council of the Bank of France, and from 1964 to 1967 was a Conseiller d'√âtat. He then retired to Beaugency, where he was elected to the local council as an independent, becoming deputy mayor.

The car was driven by Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen and made its competitive d√©but at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix. Design and development The focus of the VF-18's design was to produce a more stable chassis than its predecessor, the VF-17, with the aim of building a car capable of producing more consistent performances between rounds. To do this, Dallara worked to reduce the weight of the chassis as much as possible, allowing Haas more freedom in using ballast to influence the car's weight distribution. The car was subject to scrutiny following its performances in pre-season testing and free practice sessions at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix. Questions were raised over similarities between the VF-18 and the Ferrari SF70H, the car entered by Haas' partner Ferrari in as the sporting and technical regulations ban the use of \\"customer cars\\", or cars developed by one constructor and sold on to another team. Team principal Gunther Steiner dismissed the claims, responding to critics by arguing that the team had only purchased parts from Ferrari that the FIA had approved for sale.

The UPN candidate in the area, Mr. Zubair Ogereva got 19, 311 votes.Paul, Alade. \\"GNPP Gains from Atta-Saraki Feud in Kwara\\", The National Concord, 23 August 1983. Some political analysts in the area attributed Pius Jimoh's victory to intra-party crisis known as Atta- Saraki feud within the NPN in the Kwara South Senatorial District. However, Pius Jimoh claimed that his victory was not based on any party platform or party crisis but purely because his people reposed confidence in him. While Pius Jimoh was in the senate, he advocated for the creation of Kogi State so as to save the people he represented from their bondage in Kwara State because they have got nothing to gain from remaining there. He was also a proponent of poll-tax abolition throughout the country saying the piece-meal abolition of the tax by some state governments was not yielding results because people from where it was abolished were forced to pay same in other states while travelling.\\"I will Perform better Inspite of my Background - Senator Jimoh\\", The New Nigerian, 2 October 1983. Pius Jimoh's tenure was cut short by the December 31st, 1983 coup that brought General Muhammadu Buhari to power. Senator Pius went back into his petroleum business, a company he established after his resignation from Julius Berger PLC. He was the Chairman and Managing Director of Kings Oil Marketing Limited before his passing away on 29 March 2014 in an automobile crash along Ageva-Magongo Road. Legacy Pius Jimoh has served his community ‚Äì Adavi, Ebiraland and the nation in general in various capacities. He served as the President of Adavi-Eba Development Association for a record of eleven years during which he facilitated various developmental projects in the community including the establishment of Adavi- Eba Community Model College, Adavi-Eba Community Health Centre and extension of water supply throughout the community. Senator Pius was a benefactor to many indigent families and individuals with special emphasis on youth development. He was a detribalized peacemaker who abhorred violence, clannishness and ethno-religious bigotry. Until his passing on Saturday 29 March 2014, he was a member of prestigious and respected Ebira People Association Supreme Council of Elders at the age of 64.\\"Ebiraland and the Supreme Council of Elders\\", The Graphic, 27 January 2014.

On January 27, 2009, it crashed on final approach to its destination. Both crew members survived with minor injuries but the aircraft was written off. Aircraft history Flight 8284 was operated using an ATR-42-320 (registration number: N902FX), manufactured in 1990 by ATR. Before being delivered to Empire Airlines in 2003, and later leased to FedEx in the same year, the aircraft served for three previous airlines: Bar Harbor Airlines, Continental Express and ExpressJet Airlines. Flight details The captain was 52-year-old Rodney Holberton with a total of 13,935 flight hours, with 12,742 hours as pilot-in-command (PIC). He had 2,052 hours on the ATR 42, 1,896 as PIC. The first officer was 26-year-old Heather Cornell with 2,109 hours, according to the records of Empire Airlines. She had 130 hours operating the ATR 42 as second-in-command. Accident Flight reconstruction simulated by NTSB. The aircraft approached Lubbock International Airport at around 4:30 A.M. Central Standard Time in freezing mist. During the approach there was a flight control problem which prevented deployment of the flaps. The first officer continued the approach while the captain attempted to fix the flaps issue. Neither crew member monitored the airspeed and the aircraft began descending at over per minute, leading to a \\"Pull Up\\" warning. The crew pulled up 17 seconds after the initial alarm. The aircraft then entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed. The aircraft landed short of the runway threshold, and skidded down and off runway 17R. A small fire began shortly after. Airport officials said that weather conditions did not contribute to the crash. Investigation Overview of the accident site. Wreckage of N902FX. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the cause of the accident. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder showed that the crew continued the landing after the flaps failed to deploy rather than conducting a go-around. The crew also failed to apply maximum engine thrust immediately after the stall, waiting 17 seconds after an TAWS warning had sounded before applying thrust. In postaccident interviews, the captain said that he had sleep fatigue before the flight due to \\"high-workload situations\\" which affected his performance. After the investigation was completed the NTSB released their final report in 2011. It concluded with investigators stating that \\"The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.\\" Aftermath N902FX was badly damaged in the accident and was written off. The crew members were sent to hospital for minor injuries, and were later released. Both returned to flying with FedEx Express a month later. The NTSB issued nine safety recommendations as a result of the crash, including recommendations to prevent in-flight icing. The crash led to the EASA reviewing airplane stick shakers to protect from stalls and adopting a rule regarding the simulation of icing conditions in flight simulators.

The album was Gaughan's first after spending several years largely avoiding playing music while regaining his health following a mental breakdown in 1979. Containing an array of traditional and contemporary folk songs performed on guitar with open tunings, Handful of Earth was by far Gaughan's most political to that point, and was inspired by the political turmoil in Scotland following the Conservative Party victory at the 1979 general election. Gaughan recorded the album with engineer Robin Morton at the latter's Temple Studios. During recording, Morton extended the album's recording sessions to allow them to complete what they both felt was becoming Gaughan's best work. When the album was completed, Gaughan felt he had released the best album he possibly could, causing him to change direction following its release rather than use the template he had on Handful of Earth. The album was critically acclaimed, and was named \\"Folk Album of the Year\\" by Melody Maker and, later, Folk Roots readers and critics both named it the greatest album of the 1980s, while also ranking 907th in the 1998 edition of All Time Top 1000 Albums. The album has proven influential on artists such as Billy Bragg. In 2007, Gaughan played Handful of Earth live for the first time at Glasgow City Halls. Background and recording Scottish folk singer/guitarist Dick Gaughan released his acclaimed debut album No More Forever in 1972, and throughout the 1970s, he developed a career primarily steeped within Celtic folk music. Within the blossoming Scottish folk scene, Gaughan soon became a veteran. After Gaughan left the band Five Hand Reel towards the end of 1978, he started having on-off bouts of depression and mental illness which came to a nadir in 1979 when he had a total breakdown. Gaughan felt the 'inevitable' result of his touring life, such as unhealthy living and heavy alcohol consumption, had caught up with him, and as such he spent the following two years doing very little but focus on becoming healthier again, aside from the occasional short European tour and contributing to the collaborative folk compilation Folk Friends 2 (1980), which contains seven solo or collaborative Gaughan songs. Brian McNeill (pictured 2006), who plays fiddle on two songs. Prior to his breakdown, the 1979 general election was won by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party with a majority in England but a minority in Wales and Scotland. This followed the Scottish Devolution referendum by two months and, according to Gaughan, \\"people in Scotland, particularly on the Left, were reeling under the economic consequences of the Thatcher strategy for solving inflation by crashing the economy and creating mass unemployment. What seemed to be required was to openly stand up and be counted.\\" While all of Gaughan's solo albums in the 1970s included songs which reflected his political views, they had been \\"more as chronicler than as protagonist,\\" and after improving his health, Gaughan decided his next album should better reflect his socialist views and the political turmoil in Scotland: \\"It was quite clearly time to stop reporting and start participating.\\" Handful of Earth became one in a series of solo albums by Gaughan which re-interpret Scottish and Irish traditional music for guitar.World Music: The Rough Guide (Volume 2: Latin and North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific), Rough Guides/Penguin (London, 2000; ). In the album's liner notes, he credits a conspicuous influence from many Northern Irish folk singers. The album was recorded in late 1980 at Temple Studios near Edinburgh and was produced by Dick Gaughan with Robin Morton, the latter of whom also engineered the recording. Guest musicians appear on several songs, namely Phil Cunningham, who contributes whistle to one track and keyboard to another, Brian McNeill, who adds fiddle to two tracks, and Stewart Isbister, who adds bass to one track. During the album's recording, both Gaughan and Morton realised the album was developing into a \\"special\\" one; Morton recalled: \\"It was one of those situations where money really wasn't enough, and as time went on it became obvious that Dick needed more time, so I gave him more time just so we could turn out a great album.\\" Composition Dick Gaughan (pictured 2006) moved into a stronger political direction on Handful of Earth. Handful of Earth blends traditional and contemporary folk songs. Most of the traditional tracks are Scottish folk songs, including old Highland ballads, while the contemporary folk songs are either covers or originals by Gaughan. The album is fiercely political, featuring songs that deal with struggle, workers' rights and the political deception of the elite. Many of the songs concern specific political issues within Scotland, and the album was said by The Herald to resonate within Gaughan's \\"political sensibilities, his abhorrence of bigotry, injustice and inequality,\\" a point reinforced by musician Alasdair Roberts who said: \\"Every song has some sort of point to it, some kind of reason for existing.\\" \\"Erin- Go-Brath\\" and \\"Both Sides of the Tweed\\", both well-known ballads, are transformed by Gaughan into passionate Scottish anthems. Gaughan's guitar playing on the album is particularly intricate. Writer Stewart Lee, when speaking about the album, said Gaughan is \\"one of those people who's so good at folk guitar that it almost becomes avant-garde. He's within a hair's breadth of someone like Thurston Moore or Jim O'Rourke suddenly declaring him the answer.\\" He felt that the guitar playing, which he compared to John Fahey, presents an unusual contrast to the sentimental songs. The songs on the album boast open tunings, most often DADGAD, also known as the Celtic tuning, which Gaughan most often capped to the 5th fret, although sometimes to the 2nd, while other tunings on the album include CGCGCD, DADDAE and DGDDAE. \\"Erin-Go- Brath\\" is a traditional song in a folk rock-style arrangement reminiscent of Five Hand Reel. It deals with the late 19th and early 20th century anti-Irish and anti-Highlander racism in Lowland Scotland. \\"Now Westlin' Winds\\" is another traditional track, which Gaughan learned from ex-miner Georgie Hamilton, and contrasts the picturesque, pastoral imagery of nature with the \\"slaughtering guns\\" of man. Gaughan learned the traditional \\"Craigie Hill\\" after hearing it on Paddy Tunney's album The Irish Edge (1966). \\"The World Turned Upside Down\\" was written by Leon Rosselson and would go on to be covered by Billy Bragg. The song concerns the Diggers' revolt, and is the first of two songs on the album, the other being \\"Worker's Song\\", to concern workers' rights and restore politics to the \\"front line\\" of folk music. The traditional song \\"The Snows They Melt the Soonest\\", which concerns rejection from a woman, is performed in an intimate style. Gaughan writes that the song highlights that \\"there is much more to the lives of ordinary working people than the struggle to survive.\\" The first part of \\"Lough Erne/First Kiss at Parting\\" is a traditional track that Gaughan learned from Cathal McConnell and is typical of Irish emigrant songs with its cheerful optimism for better life in a new land, while the second part was written by Gaughan and inspired by a poem, also named First Kiss at Parting. Meanwhile, the first part of \\"Scojun Waltz/Randers Hopsa\\" was written by Gaughan one morning in Andy Irvine's kitchen while the two worked on Parallel Lines, and was considered by Gaughan to \\"prove that Cajun music originated in Leith,\\" given that he felt the track possessed both a Cajun and Scottish sound, while the second part is a traditional track in the Danish dance style 'hopsa'. It contains a DADGAD- tuned melody guitar and a DGDDAE-tuned harmony guitar. \\"Song for Ireland\\" was written by the Englishman Phil Colclough, a friend of Gaughan's, and has since become a standard with Irish bar bands. \\"Workers' Song\\" was written by Ed Pickford with a self-explanatory message, and was referred to by Jamie Davidson of CounterPunch as \\"the best British folk recording ever put to tape,\\" while Gaughan's reworking of the traditional song \\"Both Sides of the Tweed\\", which was written to attack the Acts of Union 1707, sees Gaughan assume the character of someone who acknowledges the human spirit will overcome difficulty and struggle. The reconciliatory track was said by one writer to have scotched notions of Gaughan's nationalism. Release and reception Handful of Earth was released in March 1981 by Topic Records. It failed to chart in either the UK or US, but was released to critical acclaim. Clive Pownceby of The Living Tradition wrote that the release of the album was \\"a shaft of light through some pretty turgid folk times and [marked] Gaughan's first full emergence as a premier league player.\\" In a contemporary review, English Dance & Song magazine wrote that what distinguishes Gaughan as a performer is his \\"consistent choice of good, not to mention committed, material.\\" Callahan's Irish Quarterly felt the album was likely the most fully realised expression of Gaughan's artistry. Fret magazine wrote: \\"The instrumentals and songs in this collection fully live up to Gaughan's handsome reputation, and they grow richer with every listening.\\" Melody Maker named it their \\"Folk Album of the Year\\" 1981. Handful of Earth eventually fell out of print, leading Green Linnet Records to re-release it on CD in 1991. Among retrospective reviews, Chip Renner of AllMusic named Handful of Earth an \\"Album Pick\\", writing that the album \\"is Gaughan's best blend of traditional and contemporary songs,\\" and called \\"Song for Ireland\\" a \\"classic.\\" In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, writer Colin Larkin wrote that the album established Gaughan as one of contemporary folk's major artists, and wrote that \\"[t]his exceptional set is rightly regarded as a landmark in British traditional music.\\" He also awarded the album a perfect score, as did MusicHound. In the book World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, Handful of Earth is described as \\"perhaps the single best solo folk album of the decade, a record of stunning intensity with enough contemporary relevance and historical belief to grip all generations of music fans. Newsnet Scotland called the album a \\"masterpiece.\\" Writer Martin C. Strong was favourable towards in Handful on Earth in The Great Rock Discography, noting that it explicitly espoused Gaughan's staunch socialist political views. Andy Irwin of Mojo wrote that Handful of Earth saw Gaughan take \\"the traditional song form to fresh heights of intensity and stirring power,\\" and wrote that it \\"remains his masterwork, turning well-known ballads like 'Erin-Go-Bragh' and 'Both Sides of the Tweed' into passionate Scottish anthems and restoring politics to the front line of British folk music with 'Workers Song' and Leon Rosselson's emotive story of the diggers' revolt 'The World Turned Upside Down'.\\" The positive critical reception reflects what Billboard noted as the album's passionate reputation among Celtic music fans around the world. Legacy Handful of Earth became a milestone within traditional music, and established Dick Gaughan as a major force within contemporary folk and as one of the most committed folk singers within Britain, cementing his reputation for Scottish pride and outspoken topicality. Folk singer Billy Bragg, who ranks Handful of Earth as one of his favourite albums ever, said he was blown away when first listening to the album, writing that \\"Gaughan's commitment to the songs is wonderful. In many ways it goes beyond folk music but everything you ever believed folk music could and should be is there.\\" He felt the release of the \\"incredible record\\" was timely just before the UK miners' strike. Comedian and writer Stewart Lee named Handful of Earth as one of his 13 favourite albums ever, calling a \\"great album of Scottish nationalist songs and really old Highland ballads, with this fantastic intricate guitar playing. Just the atmosphere and the mood of it is really great.\\" Alasdair Roberts also considers the album to be one his favourites, while June Tabor said that \\"Dick gets inside a song like no one else and proved himself a great singer.\\" Gaughan considered Handful of Earth to be his best ever work, and felt he had to change direction following its release because he felt the album's template could not be improved upon, saying: Glasgow City Halls, where Gaughan played Handful of Earth live in 2007. For two and a half decades following the album's release, Gaughan rarely revisited its songs and never played the album in concert, which he said was because \\"just about every song demands a precise retuning of his guitar.\\" Nonetheless, in January 2007, Gaughan played the album live for the first time at City Halls, Glasgow, as part of the Celtic Connections festival, and was joined by fiddler Brian McNeill from the original album. During the performance, Gaughan declared \\"Now Westlin Winds\\" to be his favourite song ever. The Herald praised the performance, praising his \\"idiosyncratic, intense style\\" and noting the absence of \\"glib ditties or half-hearted performances.\\" In 1989, Handful of Earth was voted as \\"album of the decade\\" by Folk Roots in both its critics' and readers' polls. In 1998, the album ranked at number 907 in the updated version of the book All Time Top 1000 Albums, a list of the greatest albums of all time that was the result of over 200,000 votes cast by informed music lovers and ranked in order.All Time Top 1000 Albums, 2nd Edition, Virgin Books, 1998, ed.

The film features Nizhalgal Ravi, Gautami, Aamani, Raghuvaran and Suresh in lead roles, with J. Livingston, Thakkali Srinivasan, Chinni Jayanth and Baby Sowmya playing supporting roles. The film had musical score by the duo Premi \\\\- Seeni and was released on 14 July 1995. Plot A serial killer targeting prostitutes goes on a murdering rampage in Chennai. The bodies of three prostitutes were discovered by the police, but there were no signs of sexual assault. The police inspector Vikram (Nizhalgal Ravi) takes in charge of the case. Dhanasekhar and Ashok are two sub-inspectors who are put onto the case to assist Vikram. A fourth victim, a prostitute, is then found murdered in a hotel room. Luckily, Vikram's girlfriend Uma (Aamani), a journalist, took a picture of the presumed serial killer along with the fourth victim and show it to Vikram. Vikram continues his investigation and discovers that the presumed serial killer, Niranjan (J. Livingston), is wanted by the Mumbai police. Niranjan went to jail several times for forgery. According to the information collected by the police informants, Niranjan will be at a nightclub for a special event. Vikram with his assistants finally catch Niranjan, but during the fight, Dhanasekhar has been wounded severely. At the court, Niranjan confesses that he had killed only one prostitute. That night, the prostitute discovered weapons in his suitcase and fearing that she will call the police, he killed her. Niranjan denies killing the other prostitutes, but the public prosecutor Priya (Gautami) and Vikram prove otherwise. The court has sentenced Niranjan with a death penalty. Days passed, and the murders of prostitutes continued in Chennai. Vikram and Priya realize that they have made a big mistake. Priya tells to Vikram that a similar case happened a few years ago in Madurai. A serial killer murdered seven prostitutes, but the case is still unsolved. Priya's husband Ramesh (Raghuvaran) and brother Suresh (Suresh), who were police officers, investigated on these murders. One night, Ramesh told Priya that he found a shred of conclusive evidence. He and Suresh immediately took the police jeep to catch the serial killer. Later that night, they died in a car accident. Vikram starts looking into the Madurai's rape case and finds out that someone changed the post-mortem report of Ramesh and Suresh. Ramesh and Suresh did not die in the car accident, but they were killed by the serial killer. The police officer Ashok then reveals to Uma that he is the serial killer. In the past, Ashok's mother (K. S. Jayalakshmi) was a prostitute, and Ashok could not bear the fact that his mother slept with other men for money, so he killed her at the age of eight. Ashok then became a police officer and continued his murdering rampage. He closed the cases in which he was involved before anyone even notices. After confessing everything, Ashok strangles Uma and she faints. Vikram later arrests him for murdering Uma, and Ashok's lawyer Srinivasan (Thakkali Srinivasan) defends him. Uma, who was supposed to be dead, survived. She arrives at the court and reveals that Ashok tried to kill her that night. The court judge postpones the judgment for the next hearing. If Uma testifies against Ashok and tells everything at the court, Ashok will be sentenced to life imprisonment. Srinivasan then advises Ashok to escape from police custody. Ashok manages to escape from the police. The court orders the police department to catch the serial killer Ashok dead or alive. Afterward, Vikram and the police department surround him, and Ashok is gunned down by Priya.

A non-profit organisation under the same name (Eesti Metsa Abiks) has been registered by activists from the movement in the Estonian Business Register in June 2017. Since January 2018, EFA belongs to the social chamber of the FSC-s representative organization in Estonia.  Origins of movement and background  March on December 16, 2016 The movement considers its beginning to have been a demonstration on December 16, 2016 during which a march started in front of the Ministry of the Environment and ended in front of the Riigikogu (the Estonian parliament). Estimates of the number of participants in the demonstration range from 100 to 1000. Its purpose was to oppose the planned amendment to the Forest Act, according to which the rotation age of spruce wood was to be lowered and other cutting restrictions alleviated. One of the purposes was also to generally oppose the direction in which Estonian forestry policy was heading, deviating from the path of sustainability and able to viewed as promotion of industrial interests, according to critics. The incentive of organising the demonstration, however, is said to have been the Estonian Ministry of the Environment's withdrawal from an agreement according to which the lower rotation age of spruce stands was to be compensated by fulfilling the protection needs of fresh boreal forests and fresh boreo- nemoral forests, as well as the small-scale coverage, especially in the national media, of an open letter sent to the Riigikogu, to ministers and to the President of Estonia on December 1 by 101 cultural figures criticising the forest policy and urging them to reject the amendment to the Forest Act.  Programme of the movement  The public programme of the EFA consists of political, social, ecological and economic parts. * The part of the programme concerning political aspects foresees the Estonian Ministry of the Environment returning to its proclaimed aim, which is \\"to instil a responsible attitude towards nature and to preserve a clean and naturally diverse living environment for the people of Estonia\\". To attain this objective, it is desirable to improve the proportion of personnel with an environmental education background in the management of the Ministry and its subdivisions. Staying on the path of the sustainable model that forms the legal basis of Estonia's forestry policy is also desired. According to this model, the economic sphere must function within a socially acceptable framework and society shall not exert excessive pressure on the environment, otherwise there is a risk that future generations may not be able to enjoy current environmental benefits. In practice, this means more comprehensive and balanced inclusion policies with real impact. Additionally, it is recommended to disclose the forestry development plan in advance and to carry out a complete inventory of Estonian forests to bring an end to widespread confusion concerning the prescribed cut, the volume of growing stock and similar issues. * The part of the programme regarding social aspects voices the intent to involve local governments in the state's planning of cutting to the extent that decision-making powers be vested in local governments in terms of the use of specific forests to achieve balanced, versatile forestry use that is as acceptable to all parties as possible. Information about the diverse nature of forests, as well as social and ecological dimensions, is to be disseminated among private forest owners, and broader opportunities for compromises are to be sought. * The part of the programme regarding the environment specifies the need for additional supervision of dangers posing a risk to biodiversity to introduce protective measures more quickly. Ornithologists have suggested the idea of a spring-summer logging ban to protect wildlife during their nesting period, and this is also supported by the programme. Elsewhere, the EFA has expressed its explicit support for a four-month logging ban proposed in 2000 by five scientific and nature protection organisations. This part of the programme also insists on protected areas fulfilling management objectives regarding wildlife protection and that woodlands be planned as an integrated whole. * The part of the programme regarding the economy stipulates that forest management principles provided by the law shall be implemented in practice, i.e. \\"efficient forest management, understood as economical production and the short-term as well as long-term use of all forest-related benefits\\". As a separate point, taking the development opportunities of nature tourism into account is highlighted. The last point of the part concerning the economy provides that natural resources shall be valorised to reap the benefits, again illustrating the principle of the EFA according to which sustainable use brings greater benefits.  Members  Members who have made media appearances as coordinators of the EFA include Linda-Mari V√§li, Madis Messimas (water programme), Indrek Vainu (special solutions), Veljo V√§rk (bogs programme) and Martin Luiga. Sven Anton is the organisation's in-house lawyer. As of May 2017, close to 1000 members had formally joined the organisation. However, by November 2017, its Facebook group had nearly 6000 members. The EFA's website states that anyone who agrees with the organisation's objectives and their ways of attaining them can consider themselves a member.  Activities   Proposed Keret√º protection area  On February 20, the EFA accused the Ministry of Defence of pressuring the Ministry of the Environment to delay establishing Keret√º protection area so as to ensure that its An information meeting of the EFA at the entrance of Nursipalu military training area on the day of a visit of the National Defence Committee of the Riigikogu. protection regime would not derail the expansion of the military training area or the creation of a mortar shooting range. According to the EFA, such a course of events is unacceptable and careless in regard to the area's natural heritage, whereas the Ministry of the Environment felt that the environmental impact assessment of the training area could even improve the development of the nature conservation area and that the Estonian Environmental Board had the right to limit all activity that could harm local natural heritage. The EFA thereupon made a new declaration in which it demanded that the natural conservation area be created on the basis of the initial borders set in the expert analysis in 2013; that the deforestation of surrounding forests be avoided; and that instead of in Nursipalu, the mortar training area be established in Sirgala as its natural environment had already suffered heavy damage due to the mining of oil shale. On March 23, Nursipalu training area was visited by the National Defence Committee of the Riigikogu, who were met by a group of EFA activists at the entrance of the training area to remind them of the area's natural heritage and of the opposition of the municipality and its citizens to changes in the natural environment. On November 6, the EFA communicated to the public that in cooperation with the local civil group Inims√µbralik Nursipalu (People-Friendly Nursipalu) it had taken legal action against the salvage permits for Nursipalu because the environmental impact assessment of the infrastructure of the shooting range had not been completed, and therefore the planning that should have formed the permit's basis had not been carried out. The EFA estimated that attempts had been made to carry out the deforestation in a hurry and in secret. Three days earlier, the Estonian Chamber of Environmental Associations also addressed the deforestation issue in a critical tone.  Campaign against pulp mill  Anti-pulp mill information sticker of the EFA The EFA has also been strongly critical of the pulp mill planned for construction close to Tartu. Anti-pulp mill campaigning was launched on April 3, 2017 when the EFA sent a public declaration to four ministers and to the Environment Committee of the Riigikogu requesting that special plans of the state not be drawn up, and in the event that they nevertheless were drawn up, that the EFA be involved in pre-selecting the location of the planned mill. The organisation also wanted the planning intentions of the pulp mill to be preceded by a broad survey by independent experts to determine whether the construction of the mill would be possible without excessively burdening Estonia's forest resources. Four days later, a declaration was delivered to the mayor of Tartu and to the Tartu county governor indicating that prior to determining the location of the pulp mill next to the Emaj√µgi River, local residents‚Äô opinions should be canvassed, noting that the company which instigated the plan had not shown any interest in residents‚Äô views. A few days after this, on April 12, Est-For Invest O√ú held an information meeting at the Estonian University of Life Sciences at which Linda-Mari V√§li, the coordinator of the EFA, wore a themed T-shirt and reminded Aadu Polli that according to an OECD report, Estonia suffers from dangerously high rates of forest exploitation and that besides the pulp mill there is a risk of emergence of other enterprises with a demand for raw timber. Polli replied that the pulp mill would only use wood that was otherwise destined for export. On May 1, the organisation arranged a hike from the Tartu district of Supilinn to Vorbuse to examine the natural environment in the potential construction area of the pulp mill. Around a dozen activists took part in the event, during which a rare kingfisher was spotted and a conversation was had with local residents, who told TV3 reporters that they did not want the pulp mill to be built. Two weeks later, a larger demonstration was organised on Town Hall Square in Tartu. Among the participants were Urmas Klaas, the Mayor of Tartu; actress Merle J√§√§ger; poets Kristiina Ehin, poets Contra and Aapo Ilves; and Mika Ker√§nen, an author of children's books. Themed poetry was recited, songs were sung and critical speeches were given. In September 2017, the EFA brought an action in which they requested that the administrative Acts associated with the construction of the pulp mill be declared null and void, stating that the volume of raw materials and water consumption and the pollution risk itself sufficed to consider, at the social level, the option of not constructing the mill.  Forests on Lake Harku's western shore  On July 28, the EFA contested a clearcutting licence for Lake Harku‚Äôs western shore because according to the rural municipality‚Äôs comprehensive plan, said shore was defined as greenfield land to be managed using a method other than clearcutting. On August 15, a discussion took place at the Environmental Board between the Board, Harku municipality, the local community and the EFA, the representative of the landowner being the sole party to submit their opinion in writing. The views of citizens, the municipality and the EFA were the same and the Environmental Board declared the licence null and void. For potential future improvement cutting and shelterwood cutting permitted in the municipality's comprehensive plan, it was advised to include experts to ensure that the quality of the greenfield land as a biodiversity conserver, windbreak and rainwater filter is maintained.  EFA audit of NEPCon regarding State Forest Management Centre FSC certificate  On October 16, 2017 the EFA submitted for a NEPCon audit of the State Forest Management Centre the cases of forest management malpractice that it had collated during the year and that indicated direct violations of the FSC Forest Management Certificate and acute conflicts between local residents‚Äô interests and the forest cutting carried out in their region, as well as to various shortcomings in ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems. The EFA also drew attention to wrongful acts committed by the state forest managers: destroying yews protected by nature protection law; cuttings carried out in the conservation zone of Karula National Park; inadequate engagement of local inhabitants when planning cutting in Viimsi and Taevaskoda; errors in compliance with several sustainable forestry requirements or the Forest Act concerning a number of specific logging cases; and letters from nature tourism entrepreneurs and beekeepers in which interest groups spoke up against the current forestry practices of the State Forest Management Centre. The audit was illustrated with photos, media articles and extracts of correspondence between the State Forest Management Centre and citizens.  Sustainable Forestry Conference  Coordinator Linda-Mari V√§li making a presentation. On October 25th2017 the Sustainable Forestry Conference was held in the Riigikogu's conference hall in cooperation between the EFA, the University of Tartu and the Environment Committee of the Riigikogu. Presentations were made by Anneli Palo and Asko L√µhmus, scientists from the University of Tartu; Tarmo T√º√ºr, the Chairman of the Estonian Fund for Nature; EFA coordinator Linda-Mari V√§li; Marika Mann, the founder, owner and CEO of the nature tourism enterprise Estonian Nature Tours; and Hasso Krull, a cultural theoretician. Anneli Palo's presentation covered the historical development of Estonian forests, drawing attention to the fact that the proportion of real virgin forest constitutes just 2% of total forest area in the country. The Chairman of the Estonian Fund for Nature pointed out as well the small extent of old forests, cast doubt on the protection of sites deemed eligible for conservation, and presented a proposal to amend the Nature Conservation Act being prepared by the Estonian Fund for Nature so as to provide a minimum system of protection that could not be negatively affected by amending (with regulations) the legal definitions of cutting. Linda-Mari V√§li, the coordinator of the General Programme of the EFA, presented its initial version of the next forestry development plan, calling it a \\"compensatory development plan\\" that would counterbalance the social and ecological damage done by the current, intensive development plan. During the second part of the conference, Marika Mann showcased the unused potential of nature tourism in Estonia and the country's unique position as a birdwatching destination, emphasising (with the rest of the world as an example) the need for state support in developing nature tourism. Hasso Krull presented the concept of natural capital of the British economist Dieter Helm. This concept attributes the highest value to renewable natural resources: clean air and water and natural biotic communities. Examples Krull highlighted included comparison of the price of locally produced drinking water to that of imported drinking water, the price of conserving bogs to restoring them and the price of clear-cut forest to the price of standing timber. In the last presentation of the day, Asko L√µhmus revealed the results of a study where a working group of conservation biologists placed official forest statistics under scrutiny, using a thousand random sites for research. The results confirmed the scientists‚Äô long-held suspicions that the forest statistics presented by the government are inaccurate and give a more positive depiction of the situation than exists in reality. The research is planned to continue and its raw data to be published.  Other  On July 26, 2017 the EFA communicated their objections to the exclusion from protection of three parks in Tallinn; the city district government of Pirita endorsed the EFA's position regarding Windeck Park.  Recognition  On January 25, 2018 the EFA was presented with the Keskkonnategu (‚Äòenvironmental deed‚Äô) people's choice award by the Ministry of the Environment. Linda-Mari V√§li, coordinator, has received praise for her work in the EFA from the Estonian Fund for Nature: she was awarded the 2016 Young Environmentalist of the Year special mention. V√§li also placed 20th among Ekspress Meedia‚Äôs top 20 most influential people (Eesti M√µjukad 2017) regarding rural development.  Criticism  On March 24 2017, in an article entitled Tunne oma vaenlast (\\"Know Your Enemy\\"), journalist Mari Kartau accused the EFA of incompetence, radicalism and discourtesy. However, the audit later presented to NEPCon by the EFA in respect of the State Forest Management Centre's infringements was called \\"comprehensive\\" by Kartau. Upon the selection of Linda-Mari V√§li, the coordinator of the EFA, as one of Ekspress Meedia's top 20 most influential people regarding rural development, Kartau noted that V√§li had acquired basic knowledge in forestry and that her opinion should therefore be taken into account. On October 11, when the dismissal of the complaint concerning the procurement documents of the pulp mill was appealed in the district court, Minister of the Environment Siim Kiisler issued a press release stating that the EFA in its activities was \\"inciting conflict and enmity\\", \\"destructive\\" and \\"irresponsible\\" and that its appeal was \\"absurd\\". Linda-Mari V√§li, the coordinator of the EFA, responded that the Minister's declaration saddened her and that the Minister had misunderstood the EFA's aspirations. She also felt that his declaration contained misleading allegations. The EFA's lawyer added that court cases were the only way of generating discussion in the given situation because decisions to date had been made \\"behind closed doors\\".

It is a family business that has been in the D'Arrigo brothers' families since its founding in 1923. It is composed of 3 D'Arrigo Brothers entities, respectively headquartered in Boston, New York City, and Spreckels, California  History  Brothers Andrea and Stefano D‚ÄôArrigo emigrated from Sicily to the United States in 1904 and 1911, respectively. They both obtained engineering degrees and served during World War I before starting their produce business. In 1923 the two brothers established their first business in Boston, bringing fresh produce from around the country to the Boston market. While on a trip to California in 1925, Stefano D‚ÄôArrigo noted the abundance of land perfect for growing produce near what is now San Jose, California With a packet of broccoli seeds from Sicily, the brothers established a growing operation on the West Coast. That operation is now headquartered in Spreckels, California 50 miles south of San Jose in the Salinas Valley, sometimes called the Salad Bowl of the World. The brothers developed a refrigeration system to keep produce fresh during cross-country train trips, and became the first company to ship fresh fruits and vegetables from California to the East Coast of the United States, year-round. This was unprecedented at the time, and initiated the modern fresh produce industry. The company trademarked \\"Andy Boy\\" in 1927 as the first-ever brand of fresh vegetables in the United States. After many years in Boston, the D‚ÄôArrigo brothers opened their New York operation in 1948 with Andrea's oldest son, Stephen, in charge. Like all of the other major agribusinesses of the Salinas Valley, D'Arrigo Brothers have had their share of difficulties with labor shortages and strikes.  Operations  The Boston and New York operations serve as distribution centers for fresh produce. The California operation serves as both a growing operation with over 30,000 acres under cultivation, and a distribution center, with approximately 3,000 employees. In August 2006 D'Arrigo Brothers opened a new headquarters facility that would house cooling, shipping, business and administrative operations all under one roof. In 2011 D'Arrigo Brothers introduced four new, improved varieties of cactus pears‚Äî orange, red, purple and green ‚Äî that are firmer, sweeter and juicier than the traditional variety. The climate of the Santa Clara Valley and Salinas Valley, where they grow their cactus pear, is ideally suited for these unusual fruits. In December 2015, 'Andy Boy' D'Arrigo, the namesake of their premier brand, retired. In 2016, D'Arrigo Brothers partnered with Driscoll's berry growers to use the newly expanding D'Arrigo cooler facility for Driscoll's berries. In 2017 D‚ÄôArrigo Brothers initiated a 2.2 megawatt solar power system that allows them to lower utility bills by about $1 million annually. This has expanded in 2018 by an additional 1.1 megawatts, and in mid-2018 should increase to a total of 5.5 megawatts.  D'Arrigo Clinic  In July 2012 the Natividad Medical Center launched D‚ÄôArrigo Family Specialty Services to benefit a patient population that includes many farmworkers, based on a donation from the D'Arrigo Brothers.

It can happen during childbirth, sexual assault, and accidental occurrences. In adults, the vagina is largely protected from trauma due to the protective function of the mons pubis and labia majora. This protection is lacking in girls who lack a protective fat layer to protect the vagina. Vaginal trauma can occur when something is inserted into the vagina, for example, a sharp object causing penetrating trauma. Vaginal trauma can occur as a result of a painful sexual experience or sexual abuse. Vaginal trauma can occur in children as a result of a straddle injury. Most of these, though distressing, are not serious injuries. In some instances, a severe injury occurs and requires immediate medical attention. Especially if the bleeding won't stop. Vaginal trauma also occurs during an episiotomy and vaginal childbirth. Avoiding vaginal injuries during childbirth will help to prevent depression, hospital readmissions, and perineal pain. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include: abdominal pain, bleeding, bruising, faintness, vaginal discharge, embedded object in the vagina, genital pain, swelling, vomiting, painful urination, inability to urinate, presence of a wound, report of sexual abuse, and blood in the urine. A hematoma can form after vaginal trauma. Imaging can identify the presence of the accumulated blood. Cause  Pregnancy related  During childbirth, vaginal or cervical injuries can occur and will likely require surgery to correct them. The vagina is sometimes injured during the course of labor and perineal tears extend from the vagina to various points of the perineum.  Non pregnancy related  Non-obstetric causes include: sexual assault, STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library[subscription required] consensual sex,Genital Findings of Women After Consensual and Nonconsensual Intercourse - Journal of Forensic Nursing fracture of the pelvis, foreign object inserted into the vagina, jet ski and water-skiing accidents or blunt force trauma, such as being kicked or kneed in the groin during an athletic competition. Risk factors Risk factors include: first episode of consensual intercourse, breastfeeding, menopause, and medication side effects. Prevention A safe environment can be created for young children in addition to keeping small objects out of reach.  Treatment  Treatment begins with a thorough assessment. The presence of someone to provide support during the examination is very beneficial. Such support is especially prioritized in cases of vaginal trauma due to sexual assault. A support person provides emotional support and can help minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Those treating victims employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.

She is currently an associate professor of psychology and women's and gender studies at the University of Michigan, where she leads the Stigmatized Sexualities research lab.  Early life  Terri Conley was raised in the small town of Greenfield, Indiana, by her closeted lesbian mother. She was surrounded by conservative ideologies in Greenfield, but, because of her mother, learned a lot about gender differences, monogamy, and intergroup relationships. Conley has stated that these personal experiences have helped her discover her passions and find a career that she can enjoy. Conley describes her childhood home as one surrounded by textbooks, where she read her first social psychology textbook after being drawn in with the cartoons displayed on the front. Conley decided that she wanted to be a researcher at the age of 13, and despite thinking her mind would change, she did not waver from those childhood aspirations.  Education  Conley completed a BA in psychology and women's studies (honors degree, with distinction in psychology) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1993, where she wrote two honors theses and worked in three different research labs. She then went on to earn her MA in social psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1995. After receiving her MA, Conley got her Ph.D. in social psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1999, where she also minored in health psychology and measurement and psychometrics.  Career  Directly after receiving her Ph.D., Conley began her career working as a Social Science Research Council postdoctoral fellow from 2000 to 2002. She then went on to become an assistant professor of psychology at California State University‚ÄìNorthridge in 2003 and 2004. From 2004 to 2008, Conley worked as an assistant professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Missouri at both the St. Louis and Kansas City campuses. In 2008, Conley became an assistant professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Michigan. In 2013, continuing at the University of Michigan, Conley became an associate professor of psychology and women's and gender studies. She works in a joint program in women's studies and psychology, with a concentration in personality and social contexts. Her three major lines of research include gender differences in sexuality, minority group members' perceptions of members in other groups, and the comparison between traditional monogamy and consensual non-monogamy. Conley is the head of the Stigmatized Sexualities research lab at the University of Michigan, which has published many journal articles surrounding the topics of gender and sexuality.  Research  Conley's most notable contributions to the fields of social psychology and women's studies include demonstrating social factors that contribute to gender differences in sexuality (particularly, casual sex) and demonstrating that consensually non-monogamous relationships have similar (and sometimes superior) outcomes relative to monogamous relationships. One of Conley's studies involves the replication of the 1989 Clark and Hatfield study of casual sex offer acceptance. Conley has since conducted many more studies confirming her suspicions about the original Clark and Hatfield study. She has formulated an alternative explanation for why women are less likely to accept casual sex offers from a stranger. Conley found that women were passing on sexual advances out of fear of being judged as promiscuous and doubt that a one-night stand with a new partner would be pleasurable. She also discovered that regardless of gender, whoever was being approached with a casual sex offer was more \\"choosy\\", arguing against the assumption that women are the more selective gender. When discussing her research, Conley says: \\"I like to look beyond conducting research that confirms existing stereotypes\\". Although she enjoys this type of research, she also discusses the difficulties, remarking that \\"if you‚Äôre debunking stereotypes you have to do twice as much\\", and that \\"when you‚Äôre studying sexuality it‚Äôs really hard to be taken seriously\\".  Motivations  When discussing her motivations for studying gender and sexuality, she mentioned how \\"it occurred to me that every single paper I wrote has someone it's trying to take down or someone I'm mad at. I have sort of an adversarial approach to science, which I actually think is very healthy for science\\". Conley also describes the importance of the research she conducts, specifically in terms of consensual non-monogamy, mentioning that \\"anywhere in the US, an employer can say they're firing you because you're in a consensually non-monogamous relationship, and there's nothing you can do\\", citing that visibility and challenging stigmas will help move society in the right direction. Conley's main objective in researching sexuality is to eliminate stigmas surrounding the subject by conducting research that questions societal norms.  Gender differences in sexuality  Conley and colleagues have demonstrated that two of the main reasons women are less likely to accept heterosexual casual sex offers than men are: a) women are stigmatized to a greater extent than men are for participating in casual sex, and b) women anticipate that they will receive less sexual pleasure in the encounter than men do. In Conley's study replicating Clark and Hatfield's 1989 study mentioned above, she found evidence that negates the gender differences asserted in the original study. Conley found that proposers of casual sex who were men (toward women) were \\"uniformly seen as less desirable than female sexual proposers\\", proving that the gender differences found in Clark and Hatfield's study have more to do with the gender of the proposer than of the study participant. She also found that the only consistent predictor of acceptance of casual sex for both men and women is perceived sexual capabilities, showing that the lower acceptance of casual sex offers by women found in Clark and Hatfield's study had more to do with their perception of the proposer's ability to be good in bed, and less to do with the study participant's gender. In another study, Conley and her associates Ziegler and Moors found more proof that the gender differences asserted by researchers and social norms have less to do with inherent gender differences, and more to do with backlash effects and sexual double standards imposed on women by society. Conley et al. found that the stigma associated with women having casual sex can often decrease the likelihood that they accept casual sex offers. Although casual sex can often be stigmatized for men and women, Conley et al. found that women were \\"more strongly influenced by fear and stigma\\". Much of Conley's research supports pleasure theory, which Conley describes as the idea that \\"the pursuit of pleasure is the central force that motivates sexual behavior\\" for both men and women. This theory comes from the large pleasure gap in sexual encounters between men and women, where men can expect to have a pleasurable time in most sexual encounters, where women will not always experience pleasure. As previously discussed above, Conley found that the differences found in the 1989 Clark and Hatfield study had more to do with ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs perception that their heterosexual casual sex partners will be unlikely to give them pleasure‚Äù, than gender differences in casual sex interest. She also conducted research on bisexual women that showed this to be true - these bisexual women were far more likely to accept a casual sex offer from a woman than a man, due to their perceived ability to pleasure the participant. Relatedly, Conley has investigated the role that orgasm plays in reactions to casual sex. Piemonte, Conley & Gusakova (2019), found that, despite stereotypes of women being less satisfied and more distressed by their casual sex experiences than men, gender differences in response to casual sex encounters evaporate when controlling for whether the participant had an orgasm during the casual sex encounter.  Monogamy and its alternatives  In her research on monogamy and its alternatives, Conley demonstrated that, despite widespread acceptance of the notion that monogamous relationships are superior to other non-monogamous arrangements, scant evidence exists in support of this supposition. Conley calls this phenomenon of seeing monogamy as preferable and inherently better than consensual non-monogamy a 'halo effect\\". When asked to describe it, Conley defines consensual non-monogamy as \\"a relational arrangement in which partners agree that it is acceptable to have more than one sexual and/or romantic relationship at the same time\\". In conducting research on consensually non-monogamous relationships, Conley found that people in consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships are more likely to use condoms and use them more correctly than monogamous people who are secretly cheating on their partner. Conley's research demonstrates that monogamy may not be as protective against sexually transmitted infections as would be expected, given that people in CNM relationships are much more likely to practice safer sex. Likewise, people in certain types of CNM relationships report higher levels of relational adjustment than those in monogamous relationships. Sexual satisfaction of those in some types of CNM relationships is also higher than that of individuals in monogamous relationships. Discussing the act of researching non-monogamy, Conley describes how she is perceived as a worse scientist because she conducts research that does not confirm stereotypes, and that researchers that do support popular stereotypes are perceived as less biased and better scientists. She also describes how she is perceived as having a connection to the consensually non-monogamous community because of her research, or that she \\"just want[s] everyone to be polyamorous\\", due to the fact that she conducted research that had positive findings about non-monogamy.

The company was incorporated as Viking Petroleum UK Ltd in October 2003. In December 2003, it acquired a 40% holding in the Ryedale gasfields in North Yorkshire from Edinburgh Oil and Gas plc. In October 2013, Viking acquired Tullow Oil's 60% share in onshore oil interests relating to the North Yorkshire gas fields and operation of the gas-fired Knapton Power Station in October 2013 (Knapton is supplied by gas wells in the Kirby Misperton area). Viking changed its name to Third Energy Onshore in October 2013. Third Energy Onshore was 97% owned by Barclays' private equity division, Barclays Natural Resource Investments; its ultimate parent company, Third Energy Holdings, is based in the Cayman Islands. Sister company Third Energy Offshore was acquired from Third Energy Holdings by Hague and London Oil plc in September 2018, with the deal formally approved in December 2018. In October 2018, owner Barclays was reported to be considering selling Third Energy Onshore rather than invest a further ¬£5m to make the Kirby Misperton fracking site fully functional in the next 12 months. In March 2019, financial adviser Lazard was reported to be talking to rival energy companies about investing in or acquiring Third Energy Onshore's business. In July 2019, Third Energy Onshore and two sister companies were sold to York Energy, a subsidiary of US-owned Alpha Energy. Kirby Misperton fracking In November 2014, Third Energy Onshore announced its intention to apply for permission to frack near Kirby Misperton. In July 2015 Third Energy Onshore applied to North Yorkshire County Council for planning permission to frack a well drilled in 2013 and to produce gas from it. Permission was granted in May 2016; Friends of the Earth and a local pressure group, Frack Free Ryedale, applied for judicial review of the decision, but this application was rejected in December 2016. In October 2017, Third Energy Onshore announced its intention to begin fracking within weeks. In November 2017, opponents to the fracking operation called upon the company to confirm its financial standing before commencing work; the company was over a month late in filing its accounts (which were eventually filed on 1 February 2018). In January 2018, Business Secretary Greg Clark said permission for Third Energy Onshore to frack would not be granted until financial checks had been completed by the Infrastructure and Projects Authority, amid concerns about its resilience and ability to fund clean-up costs. The 2016 accounts of Third Energy UK Gas Ltd showed it made a ¬£3.4m loss (down from a ¬£3.85m loss in 2015), but owed ¬£44.7m to its ultimate parent company, Third Energy Holdings, based in the Cayman Islands. Third Energy Onshore began removing equipment from the site in early February 2018, as questions about the company's finances and management continued, including about the September 2017 appointments of former Carillion interim CEO Keith Cochrane as non- executive chairman, and of Jitesh Gadhia, a Conservative party peer and donor and a non-executive director at HM Treasury body UK Financial Investments (which advises government on dealing with financially distressed businesses) as a non-executive director. Cochrane and Gadhia resigned as directors in September 2018. In April 2019, the Kirby Misperton site remained dormant over a year after Third Energy Onshire vacated it; the company had earlier said it would drill at the site before the end of 2019. The July 2019 completion of Third Energy Onshore's sale raised fears that fracking might be restarted at Kirby Misperton.

It has a single thin leaf and up to fifteen dark pinkish-purple flowers which lean downwards. It is listed as \\"endangered\\" in New South Wales because of its limited distribution and disturbance of its habitat. Description Genoplesium simulans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long with the free part long. Between four and fifteen dark pinkish-purple flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The flowers lean downwards and are about wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped, about long and wide with red stripes and hairy edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, dark pinkish-purple and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped to egg- shaped, about long, wide with dark red stripes and hairy edges. The labellum is narrow egg-shaped, pinkish-purple, about long and wide with tangled, pinkish-mauve hairs up to long on its edges. There is a pale green to cream- coloured callus with purplish markings in the centre of the labellum and covering less than half of its surface. Flowering occurs from December to March. Taxonomy and naming The pink midge orchid was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis superba. The specific epithet (superbum) is a Latin word meaning \\"excellent, superior or splendid\\", referring to the relatively large, colourful flowers of this orchid. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium simulans grows with low shrubs in and near the Morton National Park. Conservation This midge orchid is only known from two locations near Nerriga and another north of Wallerawang. The species is threatened by its small population size, habitat disturbance caused by vehicle damage and weed infestation, especially of ox-eye daisy. It has been classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.

In 1867 Hunt's Yachting Magazine described him as \\"a nobleman who has justly earned amongst us the name of a thoroughly practical and enthusiastic yachtsman\\".Hunt's Yachting Magazine, Volume 16 (1867), p. 228 In 1874, the magazine Vanity Fair published a cartoon of Batthyany by \\"Ape\\" entitled \\"Yachting\\", reporting that from his youth he had been trained as an Englishman and that in pursuing his passion he had almost always owned the best vessel of the class he wished to race in. In 1870 Philip, 4th Prince Batthy√°ny- Strattmann, a second cousin of Batthyany's father, died without a son, and Gustav Batthy√°ny succeeded him as Prince and also inherited some family land in Hungary and Austria, including the lordship of G√ºssing, but the two cousins had hardly known each other, and the 4th Prince did not leave Gustav Batthy√°ny his unsettled property.Geschichte des Marktes und der Herrschaft Trautmannsdorf an der Leitha (1974), p. 171 Nevertheless, when he died in 1883, the 5th Prince left substantial settled estates in Austria, Hungary, and Croatia, in which his son Edmund succeeded him. On behalf of himself and his father's creditors, Edmund Batthyany then began a legal action against the trustees and executrix of his father's will for control of his father's property in England, including the proceeds from the sale of valuable horses, which took some years to come to a final judgement. Marriages The family castle at K√∂rmend, where Batthyany and his first wife both died On 14 February 1857, at St James's Church, Piccadilly, Batthyany married Henrietta Mary Elisabeth, a daughter of Gustavus Gumpel, a Jewish merchant originally from Hamburg who had emigrated to Manchester in 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon and the reversal of his emancipation of the Jews.Rainer Liedtke, Jewish Welfare in Hamburg and Manchester, c. 1850‚Äì1914 (1998), pp. 28‚Äì29 They had no children.Geschichte des Marktes und der Herrschaft Trautmannsdorf an der Leitha (Verein f√ºr Landeskunde von Nieder√∂sterreich und Wien, volume 20, 1974), p. 176: \\"Seine erste Gemahlin hie√ü Henriette Gumpel und war die Tochter eines Kaufmannes und Bankiers.

It is a publicly-traded company with shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and previously TSX Venture Exchange. Beginning in 1996 the company acquired exploration rights to the former Peters and Aurora mines with the objective of utilizing modern exploration technology to re-evaluate the potential gold reserves. Following positive exploratory results, the company received financing from the International Finance Corporation and other investors and conducted economic and technical feasibility studies. The Aurora gold mine began commercial production in 2015 and has produced approximately 125,000 to 160,000 ounces of gold per year from the mine since then. These lower than expected results and a revised technical study that significantly lowered the recoverable reserves estimates, led to the removal the CEO and directors involved in making the investment decision and a class action lawsuit alleging misrepresentations in public disclosures.  Operations  Guyana Goldfields owns and operates the Aurora Gold Mine in the Cuyuni-Mazaruni region, along the Cuyuni River, of Guyana. Guyana Goldfields oversaw its development in 2014-15. While they produced 35,901 ounces of gold in 2015, commercial production began in January 2016. The mine produced 151,600 ounces in 2016 as the company again transitioned to a company focused on mine operation. During 2017, 160,500 ounces were produced, 150,450 ounces were produced in 2018 and 124,200 in 2019. It is an open pit mine that uses a semi-autogenous mill and carbon in pulp processing. The company's March 2020 updated life of mine plan estimated 2.2 million ounces of proven and probable reserves where the gold is dispersed at an average 2.7 grams per tonnes of ore. It estimated a 14-year mine life assuming the transition to underground mining can be achieved. The company is also investigating the feasibility of developing its Aranka/Sulphur Rose deposit, located 23km from the Aurora mine, as well as exploring at other properties in Guyana.  History  Guyana Goldfields Inc. (Champs D'Or De Guyana Inc.) was founded in December 1994 by J. Patrick Sheridan Jr. for the purposes of exploring mineral properties located in Guyana. In 1996-97 the company acquired exploration rights to the Peters Mine and Aurora Mine properties which had last produced gold in the early-1900s. The company had also acquired exploration rights to the Coronation Gulf project near Coppermine River in Nunavut, Canada, which had last been explored in 1967-69 but moved that property in 2000 to a subsidiary company called Coppercorp, and later to Coronation Minerals (later renamed Guyana Precious Metals and then GPM Metals Inc.) which would be separately listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. The company's stocks moved from the TSX Venture Exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2003. In 2009 the company would acquire Sheridan Jr.'s other company Aranka Gold Inc. and its properties around the Aremu River area in Guyana to conduct similar exploration work as being done in the Peters and Aurora properties. The company funded new exploration and, in 2004, reported result that indicated the discovery of a significant deposit in the Aurora Mine area. The company's stock price rose from $0.70 per share in May to $3.50 in November, as Goldcorp bought into the company acquiring 8.7% of its shares. The share price peaked in late-2006 at $11.90 as the company had raised funds for proceeding with scoping and feasibility studies. Over several years, as the studies outlined the feasibility of mining and they were issued a license to mine, the company was considered for acquisition by larger companies experienced in developing and operating gold mines, such as Agnico-Eagle Mines, however, the deals did not take place and Guyana Goldfields transitioned from a mineral exploration focus to a mine development company and sold some of its non-core assets to focus on its Aurora and Aranka deposits.. In 2012, they released an updated mine plan for Aurora that had them producing 3.29 million ounces of gold over a 17 year mine life. They raised sufficient funds to pay for the mine through private placements, stock offerings, and borrowings, much of it from International Finance Corporation and Export Development Canada. They began construction of the Aurora gold mine in 2014 after the board of directors approved the $238 million expenditure. In August 2015, Guyana announced its first gold production at its Aurora mine and began commercial Commercial production started in January 2016. However, also in 2015, a revised study lowered the mine's reserves to 2.86 million ounces of gold and a mine life of 16 years, and also the government of Venezuela made a territorial claim for the land underlying Guyana Goldfield's Aurora mine, and threatened the company with legal action. Guyana Goldfields was listed on the S&P;/TSX Composite Component from June 2016 to Dec 2018. During that time, the Aurora mine under-performed and the 2018 third-quarter results were released, Sheridan Jr. was removed from the company causing its share price to fall to $1.62. A new technical study revealed that the 2012 studies had over-estimated the amount of recoverable gold reserves and a proxy fight, led by Sheridan Jr., resulted in the CEO Scott Caldwell and the remaining directors who were present in 2012 also being removed from the company. While Alan Pangbourne took over as CEO in January, the company faced a class action lawsuit in 2020 alleging misrepresentations were made by the company in its public disclosures.

Four were found in the first two days of the Exoplanet Explorers project on Zooniverse in early April 2017, while up to two more were revealed in further analysis. The system is almost 600 light years away in the constellation Aquarius, within K2 Campaign 12. Planetary system K2-138 is notable for its large number of planets, all found through the efforts of citizen scientists. They are designated K2-138b, c, d, e, f, and g in order from their host star. The first five were validated by Christiansen et al., while K2-138g was noted as being a likely candidate. However, since there were only two transits of it, K2-138g could not be validated. There is a possibility that the two transits for this candidate are from two individual long-period planets. All six planets are within the Super-Earth and Mini-Neptune categories, with radii between about 1.6 to 3.3 . The outer five, including the unconfirmed K2-138g, are likely small gaseous worlds with no solid surface. However, the smaller K2-138b could be rocky. The masses of the planets remain unknown, as the data for K2-138 does not have a high enough signal-to-noise ratio for transit-timing variation (TTV) analysis. However, the Spitzer space telescope could be able to accurately detect TTVs and lead to the masses of the planets being calculated. Planets b through f are predicted to caused TTVs on the order of 2.5 to 7.1 minutes, for predicted masses between 4 and 7 . The five validated planets of K2-138 are very close to the parent star and form an unbroken chain of near-3:2 resonances. Their orbital periods range from 2.35 to 12.76 days, with the unconfirmed sixth planet orbiting much further out with a period of about 41 days. K2-138b, c, d, e, and f are locked in several chains of three-body resonances, a feat shared by only a handful of systems, including TRAPPIST-1 and Kepler-80. Like the former, K2-138 could show the end result of slow, inward disk migration. Spitzer observations of K2-138g were announced on the AAS Meeting #233. The iPoster shows an updated radius of K2-138g of 3.7 , making it the largest planet in the system. This result is preliminary. A team of astronomers collected 215 spectra over 79 nights with the instrument HARPS mounted on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope. With a Bayesian analysis of the K2 photometry and HARPS radial-velocities (RVs) the team were able to constrain the mass of planet b to e. The bulk densities of the planets range from earth- like density for planet b to Neptune-like density for planet e. The masses and densities constrain the composition of the planets. They have likely rocky cores and a substantial atmospheric layer, composed of volatiles. For planet f and g this team was able to constrain the upper limit of the mass to 8.7 and 25.5 earth masses. K2-138 was selected as a target by ESA in the first Announcement of Opportunity (AO-1) Program of the CHEOPS mission, which was launched in December 2019. For 87.6 orbits the spacecraft will record the transits to measure TTVs of the planets. K2-138 could become a benchmark system to compare RV and TTV masses. The system is also a good candidate to search for co-orbital bodies, which are predicted to exist and to be stable in resonant chain systems like K2-138. <div align=\\"center>K2-138 exoplanetary system (artist concept) See also * Amateur exoplanet discoveries * K2-288Bb, another planet found by citizen scientists from Exoplanet Explorers * Kepler-86 * Kepler-90 * PH1b * TRAPPIST-1 References Category:Aquarius (constellation) Category:K-type main-sequence stars Category:2MASS objects Category: Planetary systems with six confirmed planets ","title":"K2-138"},{"id":"56551601","text":"Sigvaldi Kaldal√≥ns (Stef√°nsson) (13 January 1881 ‚Äì 28 July 1946) was an Icelandic composer and doctor.

Post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments are also called post-fire mitigation treatments and emergency stabilization treatments. Vegetation fires usually partially or totally consume the canopy, above-ground organic residue (litter), fine roots, and soil organic compounds, reducing soil protection, enhancing soil water repellency, and compromising soil stability. The combined effect of fire and the occurrence of heavy rainfall in the post-fire season can lead to catastrophic hydrologic and erosion events with severe impacts on population and valued resources downhill such as housing, infrastructures, water supply systems, and critical habitats. For example, high intensity rainfall after the Thomas Fire in California (USA) led to catastrophic floods and debris flows in 2018 with 20 people dead, 300 houses destroyed, and critical infrastructures severely affected. Stabilization treatments are part of the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) programme implemented by the US Forest Service and Department of Interior (USA) and similar programmes such as the Rapid Response Assessment Team (RRAT) in Australia conducted in many other fire-prone regions.  Classification of post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments  The design of the hillslope stabilization treatments are aimed at: * Counteracting the effect of fire on the soil protection provided by the vegetation and surface cover: treatments such as seeding and mulching are aimed at reducing runoff and erosion by providing protection to the soil surface. They mimick above ground organic layers that protect the soil against the raindrop impact and absorb rain water, decreasing runoff volume and velocity. * Counteracting the effect of fire on specific soil properties involved in the runoff and erosion processes: treatments that seek for offsetting fire effects on soils such as enhanced soil water repellency (surfactants) or decreased soil aggregation (flocculants). These products can be applied alone or combined with other stabilization treatments to increase their effectiveness. * Reducing slope length: treatments such as the erosion barriers are intended to reduce the amount of sediments that reach values-at-risk downhill by reducing the slope length and, thus, runoff velocity and erosion potential. They also create mini-dams that hold the runoff, promote infiltration, and sediments settling.  Types, selection, and implementation of post-fire treatments  The selection of hillslope stabilization treatments should consider three key elements: (i) the effectiveness of the treatment, (iii) the cost of production and transport, and (i) the values-at-risk to be protected The most cost- effective treatment might not be adequate to protect critical values-at-risk whereas the treatment with the highest effectiveness and cost could not be suitable to treat large areas if the cost of repairing or replacing values-at- risk is low. Since the highest risk of catastrophic events happens during the first year after the fire, the implementation of any emergency treatment must be conducted quickly after the fire. * Seeding: Seeds of native or non-native grasses (usually non-reproducing annuals to avoid negative interactions with native flora and alteration of local biodiversity) are manually or aerially applied over the burned area to promote a rapid vegetation establishment that provides ground cover and increase soil stability with their shallow root system. Seeding have been the post-fire hillslope mitigation treatment most frequently used in the world and mainly in the USA (in the 1970s and 1980s 75% of the burned areas treated in the USA were seeded ). However, negative side- effects such us the potential introduction of non-native species, negative interactions with the recover of native vegetation, and its low efficiency during the first year after the fire before their germination contributed to the reduction of its use (in the 2000s only 30% of the burned areas treated in the USA were seeded ). * Erosion barriers: Contour-felled logs or straw wattles became popular in the USA during the 1990s coinciding with the decrease of seeded areas. Felled-logs or straw wattles are placed on the hillslope contour and aim to reduce runoff velocity and create areas where the runoff water can infiltrate, and the sediment settle. Recent studies however, have showed the low effectiveness of this technique for high intensity rainfall, when the holding capacity is easily exceeded, or their holding capacity is reduced by sediments from previous erosion events. Additionally, a poor design and installation (gaps between the log and the soil surface or not on contour with a slope to one end) can led to increased erosion due to the concentration of the runoff in lowest end of the barrier. Despite these recent insights, log barriers are still extensively applied in Mediterranean countries such as Spain. * Mulching: Covering the soil surface with a material that provides protection against raindrop impact, retains water, and reduce runoff velocity. The material most commonly used is agricultural straw, whose application reached in the 2000s 18% of the burned areas treated in the USA. This extensive use is due to its high effectiveness but also the development of its aerial application that reduced the application costs and made it viable in inaccessible areas. An alternative to straw mulching is the wood- based mulch using wood chips, wood shreds, and wood strand but also pine needles and forest residues. Although marginally used before the 2010s, wood- based mulching is becoming popular since it prevents side-effects of agricultural straw such us the introduction of non-native species and invasive weeds, its longer longevity, and stability to wind. Additionally, wood-based mulches can be produced locally from burned or green trees, reducing transport costs. * Chemical treatments: Tackifiers, fertilizers, and flocculants are used as stand-alone emergency treatments or in combination with other treatment to provide increased soil stability to reduce runoff and erosion. Anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), a synthetic petroleum by-product, is a flocculant that is applied as pellets or in solution to the soil surface in fire-affected areas. PAM binds soil particles, increase soil stability and infiltration, and reduce soil erosion. However, studies on their effectiveness in fire-affected areas are inconclusive or show no significant effect on runoff and erosion * Combined treatments: Seeding has been frequently combined with fertilizers to increase the viability of the seedlings. Seeds have been coated with surfactant to reduce fire-induced soil water repellency and increase water availability. Organic fibres (wood shreds, paper, cotton and flax) have been mixed with seeds, fertilizers and tackifiers to produce hydromulches. Although combined treatments can have higher effectiveness, the associated increase in production or transport costs can make their application less cost-effective and only viable to provide additional protection to critical values-at-risk.

Founded in 2003 by Bo and Trish Sharon, the chain focuses primarily on organic food. From 2016 to 2019, the company was partially owned by the Kroger supermarket chain. At its peak in 2019, the company had 39 stores in ten states. The withdrawal of financial support from Kroger at the end of 2019 led to a massive company downsizing to just six surviving stores in four states and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing in 2020. History Bo Sharon and his wife Trish Sharon founded Lucky's Market in Boulder, Colorado in 2003. The two had taken over a grocery store then known as the North Boulder Market, and renovated it. The couple chose to make a store focusing primarily on organic food. After operating their first store for 10 years, they then opened a second store in Longmont, Colorado in August 2013. The company is one of the few businesses that encourage its patrons to drink while they shop by selling craft beer by the pint and providing cup holders built into the shopping carts. Rapid expansion outside of Colorado The first expansion beyond Colorado was in Columbus, Ohio in October 2013, the third store in the chain. Supermarket News described the store's format as \\"value-priced natural and organic foods served in a hip and playful atmosphere targeting foodies\\". Many stores allow customers to sample craft beers while shopping. Lucky's opened its first store in the state of Missouri, the fourth in the chain, in January 2014 in Columbia, the home of the University of Missouri. A second Missouri store, the seventh in the chain, was opened in the St. Louis suburb of Ellisville in July 2014. A third Missouri store opened in Springfield in November 2017. Lucky's opened its first store in the state of Montana in March 2014 in Billings, the fifth in the chain. A second Montana store was opened four years later in Missoula in May 2018. Both stores were eventually closed in February 2020. Lucky's opened its first and only store in the state of Kentucky, its sixth in the nation, in May 2014 in Louisville by holding a \\"bacon cutting\\" ceremony. The company opened its first store in the state of Michigan in February 2015 in the university town of Ann Arbor. A second Michigan store was opened in Traverse City in January 2017. The company opened its first store in the state of Wyoming in March 2015 in Jackson. Lucky's opened is first and only store in the state of Indiana was opened in May 2015 in Bloomington. The company's first and only store in the state of Iowa was opened in June 2015 in Iowa City only to close in March 2019 after a very brief existence of less than four years. The company opened its first and only store in the state of Georgia was opened in July 2015 in Savannah. Investment by Kroger Lucky's expanded into Florida in 2016, and had eight stores in the state by late 2017. Their expansion coincided with expansions in the state from competing chains such as Sprouts Farmers Market and Earth Fare. The Kroger Co. made a large investment in Lucky's Market in April 2016. This investment has allowed the chain to accelerate the rate of store opening and the chain planned to open 50 stores in Florida by 2020. At the time of the announcement, Lucky's Market had 17 stores in 13 states that were located in the Midwest and Southeast United States. A second Ohio store was opened in Cleveland in May 2018. In January 2019, Lucky's opened their fifth and possibly last store in Colorado in Fort Collins. In August 2019, Lucky's started to distribute Kroger's Simple Truth private label organic products. In December 2019, Kroger announced that it was divesting its business of the chain. In its third-quarter earnings report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Kroger reported that \\"it was taking a $238 million impairment charge on the investment, including a $107 million net loss attributable to its minority interest in the Lucky's chain\\". It was later revealed in papers filed with the bankruptcy court that Kroger had owned 55% of the chain. Mass store closings and later bankruptcy filing On January 21, 2020, Lucky's Market announced that it was closing 20 of its 21 locations in Florida, leaving only the store in West Melbourne. Liquidation sales began the next day, January 22, and had continued up to February 12. No announcement was made concerning the fate of the 14 stores in Florida that were under construction at the time of the announcement. A store that was planned for opening in Spring 2021 in Denver, Colorado was cancelled the same day. Additional sources indicate that there are plans to close as many as 32 stores in 10 states, leaving the chain with only 7 stores remaining, an 82% reduction. At the time of the closing announcement, Lucky's had stores in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio and Wyoming. The store closings across the U.S. includes the company's complete withdrawal from the states of Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, and Wyoming. Further closings of the remaining stores at a later date has not entirely ruled out at the time of the announcement. The stores that were kept open were located in North Boulder and Fort Collins in Colorado; Traverse City in Michigan; West Melbourne in Florida; Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio; and Columbia in Missouri. Six days later, it was announced on January 27 that Lucky's Market had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was to sell the leases on five stores to Publix and six stores to Aldi, all of which are located in Florida. From information obtain from Lucky's bankruptcy filing, the company reported assets between $100 million and $500 million with liabilities between $500 million and $1 billion, and has between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors. Documents filed as part of the bankruptcy also reveal that the seven remaining stores are to be sold to an undisclosed party, later announced to be a new company led by founders Bo and Trish Sharon. A few days later on February 4, it was announced that the West Melbourne store that had been set to remain open was instead to close, leaving the company with only 6 stores and withdrawn completely from Florida. At this time it was also announced that along with the stores sold to Publix and Aldi, 5 stores had been sold to Winn- Dixie as well as one each to Hitchcock's Market and Seabra's Foods, all of which are located in Florida. The company's financial performance in the year just prior to its bankruptcy filing was dismal. For the company's fiscal year ending in January 2020, Lucky's Market reported an approximately $100 million net loss along with a 10.6% drop in sales at stores that were open for at least year.

It came second in the second National Lightplane Contest held soon after its first flight, with outstanding take-off and climb characteristics. Its designer and builder continued to use it until 1939. Design and development The Orkan (Whirlwind) II was the second aircraft designed by Tadeusz Grzmilas and followed the Orkan I, a glider. Grzmilas was serving in the Polish air force at Pozna≈Ñ and obtained permission to build it in the military workshops there during the 1927-8 winter, with the Second National Lightplane Contest, scheduled for late October 1928 in Warsaw, in mind. He took it on its first flight on either 9 September 1928 or 5 October 1928. It had a two part, thick, constant thickness, rectangular plan, two spar wing either with plywood covering ahead of the forward spar and canvas covered behind or entirely fabric covered. Ailerons extended to the wing tips. Each half-wing was braced to the lower fuselage longerons by a pair of parallel, steel tube struts to the spars and supported at the central joint low over the fuselage on inverted V-struts. The Orkan II was powered by a Anzani six- cylinder radial engine which Grzmilas had won as a prize for his success at the Second Polish Glider Contest of 1925, flying the Orkan I. It was mounted uncowled via a rounded, light alloy covered nose to the rectangular section, wooden framed and ply covered fuselage. An open cockpit under the wing trailing edge w\\\\s provided with a rounded cut-out for a better upward field of view. The horizontal tail, like the wing, was rectangular in plan and fabric covered. It was mounted on top of the fuselage and strut-braced on each side to the lower longeron; the elevators had a cut-out to allow movement of the rudder, which was fabric covered and rectangular in profile apart from its lower edge, angled for ground clearance. The fabric covered fin had a strongly cropped triangular profile. The Orkan II's fixed, conventional landing gear had mainwheels joined by a single axle on steel tube V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons at the bottom of the wing struts, together with a tall tailskid. Soon after its first flight, the Orkan II took part in the Second National Lightplane Contest. Flown by Grzmilas it gained second place overall, with first places for the shortest take-off () and for the greatest altitude reached in 30 minutes {). After the contest Grzmilas flew the Orkan from time to time during his service career, during which he was based at Dƒôblin, Krak√≥w and Lublin. In September 1939 he stored it in the L.W.S. factory at Lublin where it was later destroyed.

The facility was operated by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers () who represent 77% of the global maple syrup supply, and have been compared to a cartel. Adjusted for inflation (2018), this heist is considered the most valuable in Canadian history.  Origins  Syrup production in a Quebec sugar house (2005) In 1966, a group of maple syrup producers in Quebec participated in a joint plan to collectively market maple syrup. This effort inspired the formation of a larger agreement all across Quebec which became known as the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The FPAQ maintains a strategic reserve of maple syrup, officially known as the International Strategic Reserve (ISR) across multiple warehouses in rural Quebec towns.  Theft  Over the course of several months between 2011 and 2012, the contents of 9,571 barrels, valued at C$18.7M, was stolen in a suspected insider job from a FPAQ facility in Saint- Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec. The syrup was stored in unmarked white metal barrels inspected only once a year. Thieves used trucks to transport barrels to a remote sugar shack, where they siphoned off the maple syrup, refilled the barrels with water, then returned them to the facility. As the operation progressed, the thieves started siphoning syrup directly off barrels in the reserve without refilling them. The stolen syrup was trucked to the south (Vermont) and east (New Brunswick), where it was trafficked in many small batches to reduce suspicion. It was typically sold to legitimate syrup distributors who were unaware of its origin.  Discovery and investigation  In fall 2012, the FPAQ took their annual inventory of syrup barrels. Inspector Michel Gauvreau started climbing up the barrels and nearly fell, expecting 600-pound barrels but finding them to be empty. Police later recovered hundreds of barrels of the syrup from an exporter based in Kedgwick, New Brunswick. Between 18 and 20 December 2012, police arrested seventeen men related to the theft.  Perpetrators  * Richard Valli√®res (b. 1978), accused ringleader, sentenced in April 2017 to eight years in prison plus C$9.4 million fine, with an extension to fourteen years if fine is not paid. * Raymond Valli√®res (b. 1954), father of Richard, convicted of possession. * √âtienne St-Pierre (b. 1943), a New Brunswick based syrup reseller. * Avik Caron (b. 1974), the insider whose spouse owned the FPAQ warehouse, sentenced to five years in prison plus a C$1.2 million fine. * S√©bastien Jutras, a trucker involved in the transport of stolen syrup, served eight months in prison.  In popular culture  The theft was featured in the Netflix documentary series Dirty Money in season 1, episode 5, \\"The Maple Syrup Heist\\". Canadian folk band Trent Severn wrote a song, \\"Stealin' Syrup\\", based on the heist for their 2016 album release, Trillium. The theft is also alluded to in the television show Elementary, season 5, episode 13: \\"Over a Barrel\\". In the episode, the barrels are shown being brought by barge to a warehouse in New York, causing the disappearance of a particular gang; however, the gang is merely hiding in plain sight, selling smuggled maple syrup rather than smuggled cocaine. The event is the subject of episode 14 of the Things I Learned Last Night podcast. Jaron Myers and Tim Stone overview the event and discuss the FPAQ reserves. The event is the subject of episode 96 of the Do Go On podcast. Comedians Jess Perkins, Matt Stewart and Dave Warneke discuss the event. The event is also mentioned in the show White Collar, Season 5, Episode 8: \\"Digging Deeper\\". Neal mentions it to Peter Burke as they are investigating a stolen Dinosaur fossil. Neal even uses the correct value of the syrup stolen.

Baldwin joined Henry Harbison Sinclair in starting San Antonio Light and Power Company. A.W. Decker was hired to be the chief engineer of the project. Decker had been train in the use of AC power. George Westinghouse's company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation built the high-voltage transformers need to increase the power plants voltage to 10,000 volts for the long distance power lines that fed the city of Pomona 14 miles a way. The system was so successful that a 29 mile line was add to fed power to San Bernardino, California. The San Antonio Light and Power Company's Pomona Water Powerplant is oldest AC power plant in California feeding electricity to the Pomona and the San Gabriel Valley, built in 1892. The Pomona Water Power Plant was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.514) on Nov. 25, 1953. The Pomona Water Power Plant was built by the San Antonio Light and Power Company. The Pomona Water Power Plant is located near Mount Baldy Village, California in Los Angeles County on Camp Baldy Road, San Antonio Canyon.

In the Foreword, Gann hinted that this book is more than just a novel because it \\"contains a valuable secret, clothed in veiled language. Some will find it the first time they read it, others will see it in the second reading, but the greatest number will find the hidden secret when they read it the third time.\\" Some traders believe Gann has encoded some techniques of financial astrology into this book, and some even claim that they have devoted a lifetime to study this text.  Plot  The story is roughly divided into two parts: before and after 1927, the year in which it was written. The story began in the late evening of 9 June 1906, when the protagonist Robert Gordon was born. The early part of the book is mostly about the early life of Robert, including how he found and lost his true love, Marie Stanton, who was born on 6 October 1908. The loss of Marie Stanton inspired Robert to become the greatest inventor in history. After 1927, the book describes an imaginary war from April 1930 to July 1932, in which Robert single-handedly help the United States to win with his amazing inventions.  The imaginary war and its hidden meaning   The imaginary war vs. the Great Depression  Some writers, including W.D.‚Äôs grandson John L. Gann, think that the imaginary war in the book was a prediction of the Second World War. However, the war in the book was from 1930 to 1932, whereas the Second World War started about ten years later. Therefore, unless Gann was making a very serious mistake, he could not be referring to it. Since there was no war against the US in 1930 in actual history, some believe that it was Gann‚Äôs prediction for the Great Depression in the form of a metaphor. Below is a table comparing the timeline of the imaginary war and the Great Depression: {  +Timeline of the Tunnel Thru the Air vs. The Dow 1930-1932 !Date !Event !The Dow - Fall 1929 Spain and Japan were threatening the United States. The famous 1929 crash. - Apr 1930 Japan declared war with the United States, and attacked the East Coast. A major top below 300 after the 1929 crash. - 1 Aug 1930 El Paso was bombed.

Getting back above 50. }  Transits to the 1776 US independence chart  Bonnie Hill found that all the turning points of the imaginary war in the book were related to transits to the US chart, mostly by Mars. Hill also noted that Gann was using the Gemini-rising chart of the US Independence, which was also used by other famous astrologers. (* Note: the transits with Pluto are crossed out below, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.) {  !Date !Page # !Action !Astrological Reasons - Apr 1930 277 Japan attacked the United States G Mars 90 N Mars (Apr 11) G Mars 180 N Neptune G Uranus 90 N Sun - 1 Aug 1930 285 El Paso was bombed G Mars 30 N Sun - 24 Jun 1931 311 Cairo, IL destroyed G Mars 30 N Mean North Node ~~G Pluto 60 N Neptune*~~ - 2 Aug 1931 315 St. Louis attacked G Mars 15 N Saturn ~~G Pluto 30 N Mars*~~ -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2 Oct 1931 320 Chicago attacked G Mars 105 N Mercury - 321 CBOT destroyed  ~~G Pluto 30 N ASC*~~ - 15 Oct 1931 338 US defied enemy G Sun 120 N Mars G Neptune 90 N ASC - 24 Nov 1931 347 US fought back G Mars 60 N Moon - 7 Dec 1931 349 Enemy attacked Detroit  ~~G Mars 30 N Pluto*~~ G Saturn 150 N Mars - 6 Jun 1932 358 Enemy attacked Boston G Mars 90 N Moon - 8 Jun 1932 362 Battle of NYC G Mars 30 N Mars G Uranus 150 N Neptune - 4 Jul 1932 383 Enemy attacked Washington DC G Mars 0 N ASC G Mars 0 N Uranus - 30 Aug 1932 407 World Peace Conference in NYC G Venus 30 N Mars }  Encoding techniques   Title  Petter Ivar Amundsen believes that the title of the book is an anagram. He replaced the ‚Äú1940‚Äù in the title with the following letters: * The number ‚Äú0‚Äù is replaced by the letter ‚ÄúO‚Äù. * The remaining numbers 1, 4, 9 are worked in the following ways: ** 1 x 9 x 4 = 36, 3 x 6 = 18, and the 18th letter is ‚ÄúR‚Äù ** 1 & 9 are ‚Äú19‚Äù, and the 19th letter is ‚ÄúS‚Äù ** 9 + 4 = 13, and the 13th letter is ‚ÄúM‚Äù He rearranged the letters, and the title became ‚ÄúFrom the Lunar Return, Looking back to His Mother‚Äù. Amundsen noted that Marie disappeared on 5 June 1927, when the Moon was in Leo, and she reappeared on 30 August 1932, when the Moon was in Leo again. He also noted that the date of the Foreword was 9 May 1927, which was 1940 days before the end of the novel, 30 August 1932.  Book cover  The original 1927 book cover depicts some planes flying around a tunnel in the sky. Paul Nipperess notices that the number and location of planes displays some Fibonacci relationships.  Fake quotes  There are a number of quotes in the book which are unclear if they are really said or written by the person. For example, on page 191, Gann ‚Äúquoted‚Äù Pythagoras in the following passage: ‚Äú‚ÄòThere are in woman‚Äôs eyes two sorts of tears, the one of grief; the other of deceit.‚Äô I think that is because there are two kinds of men, one who appreciates love and honor and gives sympathy; the other kind who is selfish, expects something for nothing and must meet with deceit.‚Äù Brian Sklenka thinks that Gann was trying to draw the readers‚Äô attention to the Pyathagoras, and the numbers ‚Äútwo‚Äù and ‚Äúone‚Äù, indirectly hinting that the octave theory discovered by the Greek philosopher. Similarly, on page 192, Gann included the following ‚Äúquote‚Äù from Southey, ‚ÄúThere are three things a wise man will not trust, the wind, the sunshine of an April day and a woman‚Äôs plighted faith.‚Äù Again, it is an association of the British poet and the number ‚Äúthree‚Äù, which is an indirect reference to his famous story Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Some esoteric writers like S. J. Pasagic believes that the story is a hidden reference to the Law of Three (see the teachings of George Gurdjieff).  Page numbers  Many believe that Gann used the pages numbers in the 1927 original edition to encode some of his secrets. Here are some examples that the page number is related to the information on that page: {  !Page Number !Content of the Page !Remarks - 12 This is a part of Chapter 2 in which Robert's mother expressed that ‚ÄúBobbie had advanced ideas fully a hundred years ahead of his time and that he should be educated and allowed to follow his own ideas‚Äù. The page number (12) to the power of the chapter number (2) is 144. Gann has a tool called the Square of 144 which he considered to be one of the most important. The reference to 144 appears again on page 144. - 22 The phrase ‚Äúheart jump right up in his throat‚Äù appeared three times in book, on page 22, 116 and 241. 116/22 is roughly equal to 5.2, or two times of 2.618, the square of the golden ratio 1.618. Similarly, 116/241 is about 48 percent, or subtract it from one makes 52 percent. - 26 Robert met his love rival, Edward Mason. Edward was actually the first name of Gann's astrologer, Edward Johndro, and the Masons work with esoteric mathematics. In addition, 26 refers to the square of the golden ratio 1.618, or 2.618. - 56 It is the only page in the book on which the word \\"eclipse\\" appears. 56 years are about three Saros cycles and considered one complete cycle of eclipses. - 69 Robert explicitly stated that he believes in ‚Äúthe signs and the stars‚Äù and hinted that are astrological references in the Holy Bible. 69 is the astrological symbol of Cancer. This is where Robert's natal Venus was, and it would be later transited when he confessed his feelings to Marie. - 75 It is the start of the seventh chapter, Future Cycles. It is the only place in which Gann openly discussed his method. There are 418 pages in the book, and 418 - 75 = 343, and 343 is the cube of 7 (the chapter number). By the way, 343 is about half of the geocentric Mars cycle. - 120 Marie Stanton disappeared at 3 am on 5 June 1927. The number ‚Äú3‚Äù is hidden in this passage in the following ways: * First of all, a Grand Trine appeared on the sky, where the planets are 120 degrees apart, and 120 is 1/3 of 360. * Also, 5+6+1+9+2+7 = 30 which is reduced to 3 in numerology. * By then, Robert was about 21 years old, and 2+1=3. * Not to mention that the time was 3 am. - 144 The author cites a poem. The poem part of the page contains exactly 144 words, matching the page number. The reference to 144 has appeared before on page 12. - 224 Robert made his first plane. One heliocentric cycle of Venus is 224 days, and it is believed to be related to the symbolism of the plane. - 272-273 A birthday party for Robert was being held on 9 June 1929. The party was mentioned again on page 360 when the date was 7 June 1932. The date difference was 1,094 days, or around 40 periods of the lunar cycle of 27.32 days (as hinted by the page number). Some analysts believe that the lunar cycle is correlated with the stock market. - 288 The US won their first battle since the start of the imaginary war on 3 August 1930. There are 418 pages in the book, and 418 - 288 = 130. The Sun was at 130¬∞ in longitude (or 10¬∞ Leo) on that day. - 289 Walter compared this victory to the Battle of Alamo, which was the independence battle of Texas. The term ‚ÄúLone Star State‚Äù appeared the second and last time in the book, since page 1. On both 6 March 1836 (End of Battle of Alamo) and 3 August 1930, Jupiter was in the first decan of Cancer, with an aspect to Saturn. In addition, between the two appearances of ‚ÄúLone Star State‚Äù, the difference is 288 pages. 288 is twice of 144, and 144 months are the approximate orbit of Jupiter. - 418 The last page of the book. The diagonal of the Giza Pyramid has a length of 418 Royal Cubits. }  The disappearance of Marie Stanton  One of the main story line in the novel is that Marie suddenly left Robert in 1927, and she reappeared at the end of the book in 1932. It turns out that all dates related to this incident are related to the positions of Venus, Mars and the Moon: # Texarkana, June 5, 1927, 3 am. The moment of parting Marie and Robert. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer, the Moon at the time of the onset of the event in 28 degrees of Cancer. # Paris, late February 1929. The illusion of meeting Robert and Marie. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer on a heliocentric chart. Moon Return on the geo-map. # New York, August 30, 1932, 11 am. Meeting Robert and Marie. Lunar return. The connection of Mars and Venus is very close to Cancer.  Weather forecasting along the Mississippi River  In 1994, retired engineer Bonnie Lee Hill did a public seminar in which she revealed some astrological methods concealed in the Tunnel Thru the Air. Some of the trading rules used by Gann are related to the weather in the area around the Mississippi River, and they are listed below: {  !Rule (as coined by Hill) !Planets !Time Window !Aspect Formed !Details !Implication in Cotton Prices - Wet Cotton Farmer Uranus and Neptune  rowspan=\\"3\\" Before mid-April of each calendar year  rowspan=\\"3\\" Multiples of the 8th (45¬∞) or 12th (30¬∞) harmonic If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River will flood in that year. The supply would decrease and the price would go up. - Poor Cotton Farmer Jupiter and Neptune If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the rainfall along the Mississippi will be ideal to grow crops. The supply would increase and the price would fall. - Dry Cotton Farmer Saturn and Neptune If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River area will experience horrible drought. The supply would decrease and the price would go up. } The last rule (\\"Dry Cotton Farmer\\") was actually not mentioned at all in the book. It was deduced by Hill after she discovered the first two rules. Here are some actual examples from Hill's lecture:  Wet Cotton Farmer (Uranus-Neptune)  * In 1735, geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune. Over ninety percent of New Orleans was under water. The entire region was drastically affected by the flooding in the Delta. * In 1762, geocentric Uranus 135¬∞ with Neptune. This was a major flood. For instance,the flood level in the city of Cincinnati was up 80 feet. The top of a church steeple was the only thing sticking out of the water in the little town of Cincinnati. * In 1821 (geocentric Uranus conjunct Neptune), we had another major flood. They called it the ‚Äúworst flood of the century‚Äù. The reporters said that they had no words to describe the damage from this flood. They couldn't even estimate the cost of the damage. People decided give major sections of land back to the Mississippi River. They would not farm the land, and they would not build towns on the land. The people realized that the Mississippi River would always ‚Äúwin‚Äù. * The next flood in the table occurred in 1881 (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune). Please notice that we had a major flood in 1881, and another major flood in 1882. Due to retrogradation, we had the same aspect (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune) on Feb 26, 1881 and April 8, 1882. There are cases in which we had major floods three years in a row because the same aspect occurred in the spring of all three years. The floods in 1881-1882 were very famous. Mark Twain was alive during that time. He actually went down the Mississippi River on a steam boat, and said the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide at that time. The channel of the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide. * The next flood in the table occurred in 1907 (geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune). This is the flood mentioned by Gann in The Tunnel Thu the Air. Please notice that we had a flood in 1907, and in 1908. Why? The same aspect occurred in the spring of both years. * The next big flood occurred in 1927 (geocentric Uranus 150 Neptune). This is the one that Gann predicts in The Tunnel Thru the Air. They had a late spring and a major flood. There was over $284 million in damage. It was estimated that 240 billion gallons of water came down the Mississippi River that spring. They had 1.8 million acres of land under water. A lot of people feel that this was one of the major causes of the Great Depression; the flood destroyed the economy through the Mississippi basin. This totally destroyed the cotton crops. * The next major flood occurred in 1935 (geocentric Uranus 135 Neptune). The same aspect occurred in the spring of 1936, and a second flood occurred. The flood in 1936 caused $270 million in damage. * In 1943, geocentric Uranus trine Neptune. A major flood occurred which caused $172 million in damage. In 1973, we saw geocentric Uranus semi-square Neptune. A major flood caused $420 million of damage. October cotton hit a high price of 99 cents at this time. In 1979, a major flood occurred. Geocentric Uranus was semi-sextile Neptune on March 31, 1979. * In 1993, geocentric Uranus was conjunct Neptune on February 2. What happened in 1993? The same thing that occurred in 1821, approximately 173 years earlier. Once again, the Mississippi River looks like an inland lake. Many, many acres are under water and they are currently discussing buying the land from the farmers, giving it back to the river, and saying we won't grow crops there again and we won't build buildings there again. The ticket for this flood at the time of the seminar was $12 billion.  Poor Cotton Farmer (Jupiter-Neptune)  * In 1844, cotton had an extreme low of 5 cents a pound. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 27, 1844. Since this is rain during the growing season, you will find this class of aspects can happen a little later in the season. It's not required that they be more like January or February. They can be more like March‚ÄìApril. * On March 2, 1851, geocentric Jupiter was 135 degrees from Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 8.25 cents in January 1852. * On April 7, 1857, geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 9.25 cents in January 1858.In 1871, cotton hit the lowest low it had ever hit since 1860 (13.50 cents). * On April 8, 1871, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune. In 1873, cotton hit another major low of 13.80. Geocentric Jupiter was trine Neptune on March 3, 1873. * Cotton hit another major low (6.20 cents) in 1896. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-square Neptune on February 26, 1896. * Geocentric Jupiter was square Neptune on March 14, 1904. This was a major low in cotton prices. On July 19, cotton sold for 6.85. The cotton farmers were so disgusted that they burned the cotton in the fields. They did not even go to the effort of harvesting it. Hundreds of cotton farmers abandoned their farms and left. It was not worth cotton farming again. No one would ever want cotton ever again. They gave up. * Very low cotton prices occurred in 1920. Geocentric Jupiter was conjunct Neptune on March 8, 1920. * On April 17, 1926, geocentric Jupiter was opposite Neptune. In March 1927, cotton hit a low of 11.80. The government reports showed a record crop. * Cotton hit a major low of 25.20 cents in December 1970. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 29, 1970.Cotton hit a major low of 26.59 in December 1972. * On March 10, 1972, geocentric Jupiter was again semi-sextile Neptune.Cotton hit a major low of 29.99 in July‚ÄìAugust 1986. * On March 16, 1986, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune.  Dry Cotton Farmer (Saturn-Neptune)  * In 1761, we had a major drought in the country. Geo Saturn was 135 degrees from Neptune on April 13, 1761. The next year, geo Saturn was again 135 degrees from Neptune on February 6, 1792. We had another major drought in 1762. * On April 13, 1816, geocentric Saturn was sextile Neptune. There was a major drought and crop failure in 1816. * On January 14, 1860, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The year 1860 is famous for the Kansas drought. Hundreds of people moved to Kansas tostart over. They planned to start farming, and make a fortune. Many of these farmers gave up and left Kansas after the drought of 1860. They said you just can't make it in Kansas. * On March 11, 1863, geocentric Saturn was opposite Neptune. There was a major drought. Cotton hit the highest price it had ever seen 91 cents. That is 91 cents in 1863 dollars. Why was cotton so high? First, there was a major drought. Second, the Civil War was disrupting the economy. * On February 1, 1869, geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. In 1869, cotton hit a high of 35 cents before a huge decline in price. * On January 31, 1903, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The drought was so severe that cotton farmers planted their crops in a different manner. There was a little bug that grew in certain crops, and the farmers planted those crops next to the cotton. This little bug was called the boll weevil, and it decided that cotton tasted much better than the other crops. Suddenly, the cotton farmers had a major boll weevil infestation. The drought helped to cause a long-term problem with boll weevils. * A drought occurred in 1910, and on January 24 geocentric Saturn was square Neptune. * A drought occurred in 1930, and on December 29, 1929 geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. * Geocentric Saturn was 135 degrees Neptune on February 21, 1931. A drought occurred in 1931. * The drought in 1933 was the famous Oklahoma Dust Bowl. On February 13, 1933, geo Saturn was inconjunct Neptune.  The Major Motors campaign  From page 197 to 199, the book described how Robert traded the shares of a company called ‚ÄúMajor Motors‚Äù. It is in fact an alias for General Motors, just as there is another company in the story called ‚ÄúMajor Electric‚Äù, which refers to General Electric. Quoting from page 197: ‚ÄúOn Sunday, June 19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely. On this day he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured that Major Motors would decline until about June 30th and then start an advance which would last until about September 16th, 1927, when the Company would be 19 years old and at that time the stock would reach final high and would then go down to February to April, 1929. He figured that the stock should advance to around 270 by September 16th and made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if it went down around June 30th, and then start buying the stock.‚Äù  Detailed trades and their astrological aspects  Bonnie Hill detailed the exact trades and their related astrological aspects as below, including both lunar aspects and transits to the GM incorporation chart on 17 Sep 1908: (* Note: the transits with Pluto below are crossed out, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.) {  !Date !Action !Astrological Aspects !Lunar Aspects - 30 Jun 1927 Buy GM @ 192.50 Major Bottom G Sun 150 N ASC G Sun 30 N Venus G Sun 90 N Saturn G Venus 30 N MC G Mars 30 N Mars G Moon max North One day after total solar eclipse - 15 Jul 1927 Buy GM @ 204 Start pyramid G Sun 135 N ASC G Mars 30 N MC G Jupiter 0 Uranus G Moon max South Full Moon - 21 Jul 1927 Buy GM @ 214 G Mars 135 N Uranus G Moon 0 North Quarter Moon - 26 Jul 1927 Buy GM @ 224 G Mercury 135 N ASC G Mars 0 N Jupiter G Moon max North - 5 Aug 1927 GM up to 230 Raised stop to 225 G Mars 90 N ASC G Saturn SD Quarter Moon - 8 Aug 1927 Stop loss was hit G Venus 75 N ASC G Venus 0 South  - 12 Aug 1927 Buy GM @ 218 G Venus 0 N MC G Jupiter 0 G Uranus G Mercury Leo Full Moon - 20 Aug 1927 Buy GM @ 228 G Venus SR Quarter Moon - 24 Aug 1927 Buy GM @ 238 G Mercury 105 N ASC G Sun 0 N Jupiter G Sun Virgo G Moon max South - 26 Aug 1927 Buy GM @ 248 G Venus 0 N MC New Moon - 7 Sep 1927 GM is at 253  ~~G Pluto 0 N Neptune *~~ G Mercury 0 Venus G Moon max South - 14 Sep 1927 Buy GM @ 258 G NN 90 N Sun G Mars 0 South G Mars 180 G Uranus G Mercury Libra G Moon 0 North - 16 Sep 1927 Sell GM @ 272 Birthday of GM G Sun 0 N Sun G Mercury 0 South G Uranus 0 South  } Regarding this plethora of astrological aspects, Hill only had the following to comment: * A major bottom occurs when geocentric Sun is square natal Saturn. * Gann sells when geocentric Sun is conjunct the natal Sun, and two planets are at zero South declination. Other than that, she did not go further to separate the wheat from the chaff, and delineate how other traders could apply this cluster of seemingly unrelated aspects to their trading.  Relationship to eclipses  Gann strongly hinted at the astrological influence when he stated that Major Motors‚Äô share price would rise during this period because of ‚Äúa new and great discovery of a time factor‚Äù which would make the price to stop declining ‚Äúabout June 30th‚Äù. Daniel Ferrera noted that there was a total solar eclipse on 29th June, 1927, and Saturn was going retrograde. By the middle of September that year, Saturn had turned direct and returned to its spot during the eclipse. Also, this total eclipse fell with the Sun Square to natal Saturn. This is a seemingly very negative aspect, but Ferrera explains that the Natal Saturn was retrograde, and when a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed that good aspects such as trines and sextiles become negative and bad aspects such as squares & oppositions become positive. Ferrera also pointed out that, prior to the first trade on 30 Jun 1927, the total lunar eclipse on 15 Jun created some negative transits, because the Moon was in exact opposition to natal Pluto, and the Sun Square to the natal Sun. This is why Gann expected the price to decline into 30 Jun 1927 (except that, of course, Gann could not have been aware of Pluto, as it was discovered in 1930).  Relationship to the Gann angles and the Hexagon chart  As James Smithson noted, Robert forecasted that Major Motor's share price would rise between June 30 and September 16, 1927 due to positive astrological influences. This is a period of 78 days, during which he forecast that the price would rise from 192¬Ω to 270, which rounds up to 78 points. After a rise of 78 points in 78 days (i.e. 1√ó1 Gann angle) time and price would be squared and the uptrend would end. Similarly, Daniel Ferrera noted that the bottom price of $192¬Ω is in opposition to Jupiter & Uranus on the Gann Hexagon Chart, whereas the final price of $270 conjoins Jupiter and Uranus on the same chart, a complete 180¬∞ movement.  The cotton campaign  From page 195 to 197, the book goes into details how Robert traded cotton in 1927. Quoting from page 195 of the book: ‚ÄúAfter Robert had sold out his October cotton at 17.30 and his December cotton at 17.50 on June 10th, he decided to watch the market very closely for a few days because he thought it would go lower. His forecast indicated last buying level around June 25th. He figured that after this time the market would go higher until September 5th to 6th, when he figured it would be final high.‚Äù  Relationship to the Wet Cotton Farmer rule  As indicated in the previous section, Bonnie Hill noted that Uranus was inconjunct with Neptune in that Spring, which would predict that a flood was coming and the cotton price would go up.  Relationship to the Gann angles  Peter Palaskas found that the support line is related to the 1√ó1 angle whereas the resistance is related to the 4√ó1 angle.  Relationship to eclipses  Peter Palaskas found that the entry dates are related to the two solar eclipses on 3 Jan and 29 Jun 1927.  Declination of major planets  In addition to the ecliptic longitude, cycles are also found by declination of the planets. On page 79, Gann wrote, ‚ÄúHistory shows that in 916 agriculture in the British Isles was at its lowest ebb and that there was great scarcity of wheat and corn. Very few people were engaged in tilling the soil on account of wars. The same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in 1916 and 1917, when this country was called on to furnish food to starving Europe and send men and money to save their armies from defeat.‚Äù Bonnie Hill explained that the common factor in 916 and 1916 is that geocentric Saturn was at maximum North declination in March. Since Saturn's sidereal year is 29.457 years, it is very uncommon for it to be at maximum North declination in March. Like the weather rules above, the astrological ‚Äúsign‚Äù occurs in the spring. Also, on page 202, Gann discussed the great bull market from 1924 through 1927, ‚ÄúHe went back into the stock market and in the great Coolidge Bull Campaign from 1924 to 1927 was again a dominant factor in General Motors and other stocks and was reputed to have made fifty millions, or more.‚Äù Checking the geocentric ephemeris, and Hill found that in March‚ÄìApril 1924, geocentric Jupiter was at max South declination, and geocentric Uranus in South declination during all of 1924. On July 8, 1927 geocentric Jupiter was at 0 North declination, and on May 1, 1927, geocentric Uranus was at 0 North declination. The declination of both planets was ‚Äúincreasing‚Äù during the 1924-1927 bull market.

(November 24, 1801 ‚Äì November 23, 1869) was a Presbyterian minister and the fifth president of Lafayette College. Early life Born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania in 1801, McLean spent most of his childhood in Ross County, Ohio. At 21, McLean became affiliated with the Presbyterian church in Athens, Ohio where he became interested in the seminary. In 1824, he graduated from the University of Ohio and for the next two years worked as a teacher in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. After this, McLean attended the Princeton Theological Seminary for a period of two years, and was ordained by the Presbytery of Miami on June 29, 1831. Career McLean's first pastoral role was as a Stated Supply (or acting pastor) for a church in Lebanon, Ohio, though he was soon thereafter moved to the Old Tennent Church in Manalapan, New Jersey in 1832. He preached at the Old Tennent Church for four years before resigning in 1836. The year prior to his leaving, in 1835, McLean, along with members of the church board, agreed to form a new congregation in nearby Freehold, New Jersey citing closer proximity to their own homes. On June 10 of that year the church began construction, and by 1837, at the cost of $4,000, the church was completed. Many of the elders of the Old Tennent Church moved to the new church, then named The Village Church at Freehold, and on November 1, 1838, McLean was officially installed as the church's first pastor. He stayed with the church in Freehold for a period of twelve years before Lafayette College requested him to become their next president in 1850. Lafayette College McLean's entrance to Lafayette College came during a troubled financial time in the college's history. Previous presidents had left college with no endowment, and with debtors threatening to close to school. In 1848, the trustees of the college came within three votes of closing the school, and after the short presidency of Charles William Nassau provided no change in the endowment the college requested the Synod of Philadelphia of the Presbyterian Church for financial support. Aid from the Synod was agreed upon, but only if the college transferred over their control - which they agreed to do. After the Synod took control of Lafayette College, they chose McLean to take over at the next president as he was known to have a talent for raising money (having done so previously with the Freehold church). Inaugurated in 1850, McLean's first order of business was to maintain long-term solvency for the college by offering tuition subscriptions at the price of $100 which could be traded in for a full college education on the stipulation the entire endowment goal was reached. By January, 1854, he succeeded in raising an endowment of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), which was immediately allocated to pay off the college's long list of debts and current expenses. After fixing the college's economic crisis, McLean furthered the school's academic reputation greatly by hiring Francis March as an instructor. March, a graduate of Amherst College, had learned under the guidance of Noah Webster who was celebrated as the \\"Father of American Scholarship and Education\\". March's appointment to the school by McLean was seen as one of the pivotal moments in the history of higher education, as it was the first time a professor advocated the teaching of English in a college setting. Within a few years, starting with Lafayette, all American colleges began teaching English. Within a year of hiring March, the school's subscription program had almost entirely paid off the college's debts. However, despite paying off their debts, the school was still operating at a loss of income, and McLean chose to resign at the end of the 1857 school year. The role of president was split among the trustees to the school, thus saving money that would otherwise be spent on a president's salary. Further ministry Following his presidency at Lafayette, McLean returned to the ministry and spent four years in London where he preached frequently. He returned to the United States in 1862 where he served for the next year as a pastor in Plainfield, New Jersey. After 1863 he moved to Red Bank, New Jersey where he continued to preach until his death in 1869. Personal life McLean married Evelina B. Linn on February 1, 1830, daughter of U.S. Congressman James Linn and granddaughter of New Jersey Governor William Livingston. In addition to his other obligations, McLean was served as a Director at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1848 to 1860. Also in 1848, while a pastor of The Village Church at Freehold, McLean was awarded with the honorary title Doctor of Divinity from Lafayette College. McLean died on November 23, 1869 in Red Bank, New Jersey due to ulceration of the stomach. He was buried in the cemetery at Old Tennent Church.

Early life and education Springstead was born on 22 August 1906 in Hamilton, Ontario. Career In July 1925, Springstead participated in a track and field qualification held at Varsity Stadium for the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. Her performance earned her a spot on the first women's track and field team of Canada to compete in an international event. The following month, Springstead was third in the high jump event alongside a fourth place finish in the hurdles event at a 1925 track and field meet in London, England. After the meet, Springstead was presented a trophy by Lord Decies for her courage. The same year, Springstead won gold at the 1925 Canadian Track and Field Championships in the high jump event. Outside of her athletic career, Springstead worked for Calvin Presbyterian Church as a teacher and was a secretary for Tuckett Tobacco Company.

It consists of three cemeteries: Woodlawn Cemetery, the Jewish Cemetery, and Woodlawn Cemetery North. Henry Flagler created the cemetery on 17 acres of pineapple fields in 1904. \\"By 1904, there was 'no more attractive cemetery in Florida' than Woodlawn, most likely inspired in name and design by New York‚Äôs Woodlawn Cemetery that had also utilized a spacious Landscape Lawn.\\" \\"As was his custom, Flagler spared no expense and the cemetery soon became a tourist attraction. The St. Augustine Tatler of January 1905 reported that socialites would spend the afternoon there admiring its rock roads and \\"rows of oleanders, Australian pines, and crotons.\\" In 1914 the Woodlawn Cemetery Association deeded the cemetery to the City of West Palm Beach. The Cemetery holds 10,085 burials, from January 1905 through December 1994. It originally had an iron gateway, with the words \\"That Which Is So Universal As Death Must Be A Blessing‚Äù in bronze letters. With the widening of Dixie Highway in 1925 an acre was lost and the iron gate had to be removed. A year later it was replaced with the present cement archway, with the same words inscribed. Confederate monument Southern cemeteries of the period were segregated, and Woodlawn Cemetery only accepted white, Christian burials. Just inside the entrance gate there was from 1941 to 2017 a prominent stone monument with the following text, underneath a Confederate flag: Forever now, among the immortal dead, whose dust belongs to glory's dreamland, sleeps the fair Confederacy. Right principles can never die. No cause for which the brave have bled in virtue's name, for which the true have kept the faith, for which the dead have died in holy martyrdom, is ever lost! In memory of our Confederate soldiers, erected by United Daughters of the Confederacy A.D. 1941 Amid the wave of Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials after the Dylann Roof shooting of 2015, the monument was defaced in August, 2017, with the words \\"Antifa Nazis & KKK\\", with arrows pointing at the Confederate flag. This was not the first instance of vandalism to it. (Indeed, vandalism throughout the Cemetery has been such a problem that it was fenced in, leaving only the main entrance.) It was removed in 2017. Jewish Cemetery In 1922, a group of Jewish merchants of West Palm Beach formed the Jewish Community Center, an unincorporated association, which bought seven blocks of previously unplatted land on the western edge of Woodlawn Cemetery. The Jewish Cemetery was platted in June 1923 and by 1952, all the lots had been sold. Expansion of main cemetery Because Woodlawn was nearly full by 1927, the Australian pines were removed to make room for 422 additional lots. In later years more burial spaces were made available by the closing of most of the east-west roads dividing the blocks. Woodlawn North Cemetery Woodlawn Cemetery increased in size in 1975 with the city's acquisition of slightly more than two acres adjoining the north border. This addition is known as Woodlawn North Cemetery. Famous burials * Charles Edward Merrill, co-founder of Merrill Lynch * E. M. Brelsford, Palm Beach's first postmaster and first store owner.

She won her job as a presenter with this public broadcaster through the television programme Sterretje Gezocht. In 2015 and 2016 Kemper was nominated for the Zilveren Televizier-Ster Vrouw. In 2019 it has been announced Kemper will transfer to RTL. Biography Kemper grew up in Volendam and lives in Amsterdam. She studied sports management and had a part-time job with her uncle and aunt behind the counter of a fish shop in Almere. She is an athlete at AV Edam. That was also Kemper's reason for following her studies in sports and marketing management. BNN =Sterretje Gezocht= When Geraldine saw the call for the BNN programme Sterretje Gezocht, she immediately registered. Her dream was therefore to become a VJ at TMF or a presenter at BNN. A total of about eight thousand women registered. In the end Kemper managed to become the new star of BNN after eight weeks. She defeated Fleur in the final with 60% of the jury points and 60% of the votes of the audience. That meant that she got a role in the soap opera Onderweg naar Morgen and became a presenter of Try Before You Die. In addition, Valerio Zeno announced during the final that the winner would immediately start the day after the finale as the presenter of Spuiten en Slikken Zomertour; Geraldine replaced Zarayda Groenhart for one episode. =Try Before you Die= In 2009 she made her appearance in season 5 of Try Before You Die, in the company of Steyn de Leeuwe, Valerio Zeno, Filemon Wesselink, Nicolette Kluijver, Dennis Storm, Zarayda Groenhart and Sander Lantinga. In the challenge she tackled challenges like: \\"participating in the tough guy challenge\\", \\"French kissing with an elderly man\\", \\"taking pictures in Volendam clothing\\" and \\"making the biggest crop circle\\". In 2011 she presented Try Before You Die 2. =Spuiten en Slikken= Geraldine Kemper during shooting for Spuiten en Slikken (April 2014). At the last moment Kemper was allowed to make one episode of Spuiten en Slikken Zomertour as reporter. By the departure of Filemon Wesselink from Spuiten en Slikken, Nicolette Kluijver and Zarayda Groenhart were given Filemon's place and a place was released. Kemper, who therefore already replaced one episode for Groenhart, belonged from season 9 to the regular squad of Spuiten en Slikken. In Spuiten en Slikken she does the experiments, called Gerries Eerste Keer. From 2014 she also takes on the general presentation, together with Tim Hofman. =3 op Reis= Since 2012 she also presents 3 op Reis. She attracted the Caribbean and a road trip through Europe.

The ion is made by removing a proton from 5-azido-1H-tetrazole. The molecular structure contains a five membered ring with four nitrogen atoms, and a side azido chain connected to the carbon atom. Several salts exist, but they are unstable and spontaneously explode. Rubidium azidotetrazolate was so unstable that it explodes while crystallizing. The potassium and caesium salt also spontaneously explode when dry. Azidotetrazolates are under investigation for use as bullet propellant, rocket propellants and high explosives. The nitrogen base compounds have the advantage of being \\"green explosives\\", meaning that their waste products are safe. Amongst the tetrazolates, they have the highest nitrogen fraction. Properties Different stimuli can set off explosions. Possibilities include impact, friction, sparks or heat. Guanidinium azidotetrazolate could be melted to an ionic liquid at 100¬∞C, but would decompose smoothly at 159¬∞. Sodium azidotetrazolate explodes when the temperature reaches 155¬∞C. The CNNNN ring in azidotetrazolate is planar and aromatic. The NNN side chain is attached to the carbon atom, and bent at the first nitrogen so that it is roughly parallel to the ring. The base acids, 5-azido-1H-tetrazole and 5-azido-2H-tetrazole both can exist. The 1H version has a hydrogen atom bonded to a nitrogen atom next to the carbon. It is the stable form in solids and solutions in polar liquids. This is explained by a favourable hydrogen bond, and a greater dipole moment. The 2H version with hydrogen attached in the second nitrogen from the carbon is purportedly more stable in gas phase.

Yet, although the Lydian Lion was minted by Alyattes for use as a \\"nobleman's tax- token\\", \\"it took some time before ancient coins were used for everyday commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread.\\"\\"Hoards, Small Change, and the Origin of Coinage,\\" Journal of the Hellenistic Studies 84 (1964), p. 89 The Greeks of Cyme changed the Lydian \\"tax-token\\" into a means of transaction for the common man and woman. Stamped coins avoided weighing silver for small transactions because the symbol on the hemiobol was enough to verify its value. > Two late Greek sources record that King Midas of Phrygia married a Greek > princess. Aristotle calls her Hermodike and says she \\"cut/struck the > earliest coinage of Kyme.\\" Pollux names her Demodike, the daughter of King > Agamemnon of Kyme, and he notes that she was but one among several others > who were alleged to have been the first to strike coins.

Given the technological and chronological link to minting, Hermodike II may have been married to Alyattes of Lydia, who had more than one wife,Herodotus, The Histories, (Penguin Books, Suffolk, England, 1983), I., p. 79 and who amassed great wealth, like Midas, by sourcing the electrum for his coins from Midas‚Äô fabled river Pactolus. Ionia, Uncertain city (possibly Kyme, Aeolis) 600‚Äì550 BC, Hemiobol. Horse head, rough incuse Hermodike II is attributed to the global spread of coinage. The coins from Cyme, when first circulated around 600‚Äì550 BC, utilised the symbol of the horse. The symbol of the Trojan Horse tied the dynasty of Agamemnon with the glory of the original Agamemnon through the Greek victory over Troy.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two white flowers which sometimes have faint reddish lines. Description Caladenia intuta is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single narrow lance-shaped leaf, long and wide with purple blotches near its base. The leaf and the flowering stem are densely covered with hairs. One or two white flowers, sometimes with faint reddish lines and wide are borne on a wiry flowering stem tall. The sepals have thin blackish tips. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and the lateral sepals are long, wide and spread stiffly apart from each other. The petals are long, wide and also spread stiffly apart from each other. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and has many short, white or purplish teeth on the edges. The tip of the labellum curls downward and there are four rows of white or purplish calli shaped like hockey sticks along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia intuta was first formally described in 2005 by David Jones, who gave it the name Arachnorchis intuta and published the description in The Orchadian from a specimen collected near Hardwicke Bay. It had previously been known as Caladenia sp. \\"Brentwood'. In 2008, Robert Bates changed the name to Caladenia intuta.

Korean girl groups have aided in the global spread and promotion of Korean culture through their demonstrated prominence and popularity. Generally, they are known for their interesting concepts, catchy lyrics, point-choreography and fresh visuals. First Generation groups from the late 90s and early 2000s such as S.E.S., Fin.K.L, and Baby Vox are cited as building these foundations as the first successful all-female girl groups in Korea and through their participation in the first Hallyu Wave. In 2003 and onward, Second Generation groups such as Girls' Generation, Kara, T-ara Wonder Girls, 2NE1, 4Minute, f(x) (group), Sistar, Miss A, Girl's Day and Apink revived the popularity and consumption of girls domestically in Korea as well as globally through the second phase of Hallyu. Groups that began the generation transitional shift in the early 2012s, such as AOA and EXID helped propel that for the Third Generation with groups that debuted in 2012 onward such as Blackpink, Twice, Red Velvet, GFriend, Mamamoo, Momoland, and I.O.I that have risen to distinction in recent years and helped contribute to the widespread attention and appreciation of K-pop.  Profiles   Generation 1 (1994‚Äì2002)  First generation of K-pop began with the birth of the idol industry after the debut of H.O.T. in 1996 and follows the early years of K-pop with fresh, feminine girl groups debuting, and includes idol groups debuting from 1994 to 2002. {  +Best-selling groups !Group name !Duration !(Former) Members !Sub-unit groups !Debut single !Breakthrough single !Notable singles !Best-selling Korean album !Notable awards -

Gordon John Watson (1916-1992) was a squash player from Australia. He held the Australian Professional Championship and Australian Open Championship titles from 1939 undefeated until 1949. His impressive record in championship competition and his peerless coaching record have resulted in Watson being widely considered the doyen of the sport in Australia, as both player and coach, for 48 years from 1931 to 1979.https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/IjMSu9pFQuejLsCb3N6Q Early playing career After leaving his home town of Portsea on the Mornington Peninsula at the age of fourteen, Watson commenced his squash career at the age of sixteen. He gained employment as a masseur and gymnasium instructor at the Pearce, Bjelke Peterson Physical Culture Institute, where the first commercial squash courts in Melbourne were built in 1926. Watson went on to become the club's squash professional in 1931. Due to his employment at the club, Watson was classed as a professional and only eligible to compete in the Australian Professional Squash Championships. This competition was first held in 1931; the same year as the inaugural Australian Men's Amateur Championship. Watson started competing in earnest after his first overseas trip, to England and Germany, in 1936. Championship career Jim Watson (no relation) was the Australian Professional Champion from 1931 to 1938 and Watson was runner-up to Jim three times during this period: 1935; 1936, and 1938. In 1939 Watson finally defeated Jim Watson and went on to remain champion until 1949. The Broadhurst Cup competition began in 1939 and was contested by both the Australian Amateur and Professional Champions, becoming by default the first iteration of the Australian Open Championship. In its inaugural year Watson, already the Australian Professional Champion, defeated Merv Weston (Australian Amateur Champion), 9/7, 9/5, 9/0, becoming the first Australian Open Champion. Watson would also retain this title through to 1949 and remarkably, during this decade of Watson's domination at the top level of competition, he surrendered only a single game. The Australian Open Championship was finally liberated from Watson's domination in 1949 by the visit to Australia of British Open Champion, Egyptian Mahmoud el Karim (1916-1999). Karim, undefeated for fifteen years, met Watson in the final where Watson led 8‚Äì3 in the fifth game before a phenomenal comeback by Karim to take the game 10‚Äì8 with the final results being: 4‚Äì9, 9‚Äì0, 4‚Äì9, 9‚Äì2, 10‚Äì8.https://www.squashvic.com.au/w/blog/a-walk-through-the-history-of-the- victorian-squash-championships Watson's close loss to Karim and the lack of year-round competition in Australia, inspired him to travel to contest the British Open (the effective world championship of the sport at the time) in England in 1950; the first Australian male squash player to tour overseas. As a seeded player in his first international competition, Watson put out Englishman E S Hawes in the first round: 9‚Äì1, 6‚Äì9, 9‚Äì0, 9‚Äì4. In the quarter finals he defeated another Englishman, W E J Watson: 9‚Äì1, 9‚Äì7, 7‚Äì9, 10‚Äì9. Watson met Abdul Bari, a leading Indian player, in the semi final and was defeated: 9‚Äì2, 9‚Äì2, 10‚Äì8. 1950 closed with the world rankings as Karim No. 1; Bari No. 2; and Gordon Watson No. 3. English squash professional and writer Jack Giles wrote in Squash Player International in 1974, \\"The first [Australian] player to really make an impact on the international scene was G.J. Watson. A very popular and respected figure, Watson was a player of undoubted world class. He was afflicted by that bane of so many potentially great players - lack of real all-year round competition. He could get that competition in those days only by coming to the U.K, then only for a month at a time. An expensive and not very satisfactory arrangement.\\" Coaching career Watson retired from competition in 1950 and built a successful coaching career. He established Watson's Squash Academy by arrangement with the owner Betty Meagher (a close friend and champion pupil of Watson's) in Flinders Lane, Melbourne for six years and then established the Gordon Watson Squash Centre in Hawthorn Road, Caulfield in 1962. As a coach, Watson quickly demonstrated his total understanding of the sport and amassed similarly unprecedented success as that which he had enjoyed as a competitor. Before his retirement from the sport in 1979, he coached no fewer than 21 Australian title holders and countless winners of state championships. These included many early champions of the women's game: Betty Meagher; Val Watts; and Joan Watson (his sister-in-law). Between them these women took 7 Australian Amateur and 9 Victorian Amateur championships between 1946 and 1955. Watson also coached national male champions Frank Harris, Merv Weston and Ian Carson who retained 7 Australian Amateur titles between them. Military service The outbreak of World War II interrupted the development of Watson's professional sporting career. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940 and was assigned to the 9th Division (Australia). He served a total of 1983 days attached to the 2/4 Australian General Hospitalhttps://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C4749 in Tobruk and the 2/7 Field Ambulancehttps://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U57442 in New Guinea. He completed his service with an honourable discharge at the rank of Captain on 1 November 1945.

Throughout its history, the city of Jodhpur was supplied with water from over 50 stepwells. However, the introduction of low cost pumps and pipes rendered stepwells obsolete, and none were built after the 19th century.Jutta Jain-Neubauer (1981). The Stepwells of Gujarat: In Art-historical Perspective. Abhinav Publications. pp. 19‚Äì24. . The Brikha Bawari was designed in the style of older stepwells. The stepwell was designed at the behest of the Essgee Group, a Jodhpur-based real estate firm, which envisioned a modern stepwell as a source of water for a new housing development it was constructing. The firm contracted Anu Mridul to design the modern stepwell. Construction on the building was finished in 2009, after which the stepwell began to be used as a water reservoir. Mridul was awarded the All India Stone Architecture Award in 2009 for his design. The stepwell is built of red sandstone, and is capable of holding 17.5 million liters of rainwater.

It is the 28th overall episode of the series and is written by Tricia McAlpin & David Phillips and directed by Michael McDonald. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 9, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake has a romantic encounter with a woman named Sophia but he then finds out that she's an attorney representing a criminal Jake arrested. Meanwhile, Amy runs for union rep as Scully is not a good representative for the union while Boyle and Gina fight for a reservation date they organized before they broke up. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.99 million household viewers and gained a 1.9/5 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Eva Longoria's performance in the episode as well as Boyle's and Gina's subplot. Plot Eager to join the dating pool, Jake (Andy Samberg) hits it off with a woman named Sophia (Eva Longoria) who later reveals herself to be the attorney defending a perp Jake arrested. Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) urges Amy (Melissa Fumero) to run for union rep to replace an incompetent Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller), and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) and Gina (Chelsea Peretti) fight over a non-refundable hotel room reservation they made before ending their affair. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Jake and Sophia\\" was seen by an estimated 3.99 million household viewers and gained a 1.9/5 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 17% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.41 million viewers with a 1.7/4 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.9 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, The OT, and NBC Sunday Night Football. Critical reviews \\"Jake and Sophia\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"All of this being said, 'Jake And Sophia' isn't uproariously hilarious or as quotable as the earlier episodes of this season. However, it still brings something to the table. In fact, the line readings are some of the best of the season, and that actually elevates the episode's quality. It's still a fun and funny episode of television. But in a lot of ways, the humor in 'Jake And Sophia' is subtler than that of the previous episodes.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Amy Santiago is Brooklyn Nine-Nines unsung hero. Captain Holt's been the season's obvious perfectly enunciating standout. Gina has lines, and Chelsea Peretti's line readings, that rocket her into the weird comedy stratosphere. Andy Samberg's Jake has enthusiasm and star power, while Terry and Rosa are simply powerful (self-conscious and unselfconscious varieties respectively). And Boyle‚Äôs Brooklyn‚Äòs bumbling Tom Bombadil‚Äîharmless and charming, but somehow essential.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Eva Longoria hasn't been much of a screen presence since Desperate Housewives ascended to that omniscient voice-over palace in the sky back in 2012, and it was nice to see her pop up in tonight's Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the first of what will apparently be a three-episode arc for district attorney Sophia Perez. (In case you were wondering where Longoria's been, the short answer is producing EVERYTHING.) It's a shame the show couldn't have found a slightly less-hackneyed plotline than 'accidentally slept with the enemy' to introduce her, especially after Arrested Developments Julia Louis-Dreyfus arc pretty much rode that trope into the ground, but Longoria is an appealing presence here, even if her character isn't very fleshed-out.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"'Jake and Sophia' was a great example of what Schur and Goor talked about before season 1: that point a good sitcom reaches where the characters have become so specific that you can place them into any story and it‚Äôs inherently funny because they're the ones in that story.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode an 8.0 and wrote, \\"Whether Brooklyn Nine-Nine will circle back around to his feelings for his coworker remains to be seen, but that's probably a 'yes' (and you can put decent odds on Sophia's career as a defense attorney remaining a sticking point for as long as Longoria sticks around). For now, 'Jake and Sophia' has shifted the pecking order in ways that hopefully prove meaningful in the long run; in other words, it's just another solid installment from one of the most remarkably progressive sitcoms on the market.

Early life Gaines was born in Wilkes County, Georgia, one of fourteen children of his enslaved parents, Louisa and William Gaines. He was named for John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, the religion of his father. His mother was a Baptist. He grew up on a plantation as a slave. He learned the alphabet when he was eleven and then learned to write using a copy book. Sick as a child, he taught himself to read while in bed. He took to religion at a young age, reading the bible and experiencing conversion when he was nine years of age. By the time he was fifteen or sixteen years of age, he became interested in becoming a preacher. In 1855, he was moved to Stewart County, Georgia and the following year to Muskogee County, Georgia.

Cazzetta and Maurice \\"Mom\\" Boucher were members of a small motorcycle gang, the \\"SS\\", which was under consideration for an invite to join the Hells Angels. When the Lennoxville massacre took place the two friends made different choices. Elements of the Hells Angels' Montreal chapter had become convinced that five senior members of their club had been embezzling club profits, so they tricked them into a meeting, and killed them. According to true crime author RJ Parker this killing triggered distrust within other elements of Canada's underworld empire. According to Parker, Cazzetta was closely related to senior member of the Quebec Mafia, and thus adopted the position that underworld members should not kill other members of their own gang. So, where Boucher did join the Hells Angels, Cazzetta formed his own motorcycle club, The Rock Machine, taking over turf formerly controlled by the weakened Montreal chapter of the Hells Angels. According to Parker, Boucher could not strike against his former friend, out of concern the powerful Quebec Mafia would intervene. He wrote that Boucher worked to rebuild his chapter's ties with other chapters and other underworld groups. He wrote that Cazzetta too forged alliances, principally with the Bandidos, another powerful motorcycle club, and that he forged ties with cocaine cartels, and became one of Montreal's principal importers of cocaine. Cazzetta's cocaine smuggling and distribution triggered extra police scrutiny, and 1994, he was arrested with 11 tons of cocaine. Cazzetta's detention triggered Boucher to attack the remainder of The Rock Machine. The struggle lasted six years, and many innocent bystanders were hurt or killed. Cazzetta was in prison during the war. By the time Cazzetta had served his sentence Boucher himself was serving a life sentence, the war was over, and The Rock Machine had been absorbed into the Bandidos. Cazzetta chose to join the Hells Angels, in 2005. He would rise to lead the Hells Angels in Quebec.

Officially known as Central State Prison, the facility is notorious for its grim conditions, torture by guards, and its use in holding political opponents of former President Yahya Jammeh. Opened in 1920 by British colonial authorities, the prison contains a 'remand wing' where juvenile offenders and those awaiting trial are held, and a 'security wing' which houses high security prisoners, including those on death row, political prisoners, and other convicted inmates. Torture and other mistreatment is rampant inside the prison's security wing with some inmates reporting beatings, not being allowed to leave their cells for months at a time, lack of adequate medical treatment leading to the spread of disease, mosquitoes, and forbidden contact with family.https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/1158776/432_1181636583_22316-gambia- english.pdf According to a former prisoner, most prisoners are only allowed four, thirty minute, visits a year while those on death row are not allowed any, and deaths are rife, usually the result of preventable disease. In 2009, two British missionaries were jailed in Mile 2 Prison on charges of sedition after writing a letter critical of the government. On 23 August 2012, nine inmates were ordered to be executed by lethal injection on the orders of Yahya Jammeh, including one inmate whose death sentence had recently been commuted to life. These were the first executions to be carried out in Gambia since 1981.

Firearms conviction Prior to leaving the United Kingdom Davis is reported to have worked as a drug dealer, a career that led to drug possession and firearms convictions. 2014 conviction of his wife, in the United Kingdom His wife, Amal el-Wahabi, was convicted, in 2014, of funding terrorism, when she tried to use a friend to smuggle 20,000 euros to Davis. During her trial el-Wahabi said one factor that triggered Davis to leave London was his desire to stop using drugs, and to avoid the friends likely to challenge his resolve. A photo on el-Wahabi's cell-phone, that Davis had sent her, via the WhatsApp application, was used by the prosecution to argue that el-Wahabi should have realized Davis was involved in militancy. The image shows Davis posing with a group of over a dozen young men, many of whom were brandishing rifles. Citing text messages the pair exchanged on their cell phones the prosecution argued that el-Wahabi arrange the funds transfer to retain Davis's loyalty, because he had threatened to take a second wife. Alleged to have guarded some of Daesh's foreign captives Daesh captured some European and North American captives, and it was widely reported that they were tortured, subjected to mock executions, and some of them were ultimately beheaded. Four United Kingdom guards, dubbed The Beatles, were alleged to have played a central role in their abuse. The most vocal, who appeared in several videos, issuing threats, was dubbed \\"Jihadi John\\". Davis, whose identity had not yet been established, was dubbed \\"Jihadi Paul\\". Turkish capture and conviction Davis was captured by Turkish security officials, in Istanbul, on November 12, 2015. A Turkish court convicted him of being a member of a terrorist group, in 2017, and gave him a seven year sentence. According to an article in the New Delhi Times Turkish Prosecutors had originally planned to charge him with \\"preparing terrorist acts\\". At his trial he admitted being acquainted with Emwazi Mohammed, aka Jihadi John, from when they attended the same mosque, in London. But he denied encountering him in Iraq or Syria. He denied playing a role in the abuse of the captives. He claimed he had grown disenchanted with Daesh, and had crossed the border to Turkey, to acquire false identity papers, to start a new life, since he knew he was a wanted man. He claimed a notorious photo of him, posing with armed fighters, dated to 2013, and he had taken it as a joke, a common lark at the time. Call for trial in the United Kingdom In February 2018 several citizens of the United Kingdom, who had been captives who endured abuse by the surviving members of \\"The Beatles\\", called for them to face prosecution in the United Kingdom.

Between twelve and thirty two light reddish flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The flowers lean downwards and are about wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, about long, wide and greenish with reddish-purple bands and hairy edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, light reddish green and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow egg- shaped, about long, wide with hairy edges and a similar colour to the dorsal sepal. The labellum is narrow egg-shaped, dark purple, about long and wide with coarse, spreading hairs up to long on its edges. There is a dark purple callus in the centre of the labellum and covering about three-quarters of its surface. Flowering occurs from February to April. Taxonomy and naming The Kangarooby midge orchid was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis systena. The specific epithet (systenum) derived from the Ancient Greek word systenos meaning \\"tapering to a point\\", referring to the shape of the labellum of this orchid. (Kangarooby is a locality near Forbes.)

After attending the Jesuit Convocation in Neuhaus (Bohemia), he studied at the German College of Apollinaris in Rome and received his doctorate in theology. On 22 October 1699, he was ordained a priest, already a canon in Gran (Hungary) by 1700, and was consecrated titular Bishop of Scutari. From 1705, he was a Royal Hungarian Councillor and, from 14 October 1709, Bishop of Waitzen, where he founded the Piarists. On 1 July 1716, he became the prince-bishop of Vienna. Together with Emperor Charles VI he petitioned Pope Clement XI to elevate Vienna to an archdiocese. The Prince- Bishop of Passau, Raymund Ferdinand von Rabatta, tried to prevent this, but on 6 March 1721, the Congregation in Rome agreed, and on 1 June 1722, the decision of the Consistory of Cardinals followed. On 14 February 1723, was that of Pope Innocent XIII in signing the Papal Bull Suprema dispositione, finally elevating Vienna. Kollonitsch then held the title of prince- archbishop, to whom the diocese of Wiener-Neustadt has been subordinated as suffragan. In 1729, the Viennese diocesan area was extended, when the area Under the Wienerwald (the parishes between Vienna and Wiener-Neustadt) was separated from the diocese of Passau. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Benedict XIII on 26 November 1727, and at the same time appointed cardinal-priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro, in 1740 Kollonitsch changed to the titular church and became cardinal priest of San Crisogono. As early as 1747, he had been awarded the title Protector Germaniae by Emperor Francis I. He was a zealous bishop who demanded of his priests participation in annual retreats and the wearing of clerical clothing. In 1719, he also introduced retreats for lay people. He increased the funds available for the creation of priests in St. Barbara and St. Stephan. In 1727, he acquired a palace in Wien- Landstra√üe, which he had converted into a poorhouse; this was enlarged in 1784 and adapted to the Invalidenhaus. In 1730, he conducted a general visitation of his diocese. Ex-libris armorial of Cardinal Kollonitsch He also won the lawsuit with the cathedral chapter of St. Stephen, when the Pope gave him jurisdiction over the canons. In return, he raised in 1728 the cathedral provost, Joseph Heinrich Braitenb√ºcher, to Vicar-General and Auxiliary Bishop. Being the last of his family, he adopted in 1728 the son of the half-sister of his father Ladislaus Zay von Cs√∂m√∂r. He appointed him heir to his dominions with the condition that he and all his descendants, with the complete omission of their former name and coat of arms, should be addressed only as Counts and Countesses von Kollonitsch.

Since childhood, she has produced work in a variety of different art forms. In 1974, she became one of Chicago‚Äôs pioneering video and new media artists and, later to include, independent video producer, exhibition curator and teacher. Sykes is a Chicago based experimental video artist who explores themes of spirituality, ritual and indigeneity from a feminist perspective. Sykes is known for her pioneering experimentation with computer graphics in her video work, utilizing the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Chicago, at a time when this technology was just emerging. Her early works broke new grounds in Chicago‚Äôs emerging New Media Art scene, and continue to inspire women to explore experimental realms. With a passion for community, she fostered significant collaborations with many institutions that include but are not limited to University of Illinois, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College, Center for New Television, and (art)n laboratory. These collaborations became exemplary for the showcasing of new media work. The wave of video, new media and computer art that she pioneered alongside many other seminal early Chicago New Media artists persists as a major influence for artists and educators today Her work has been exhibited internationally, at institutions such as Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (Copenhagen), Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Museum of the Art Institute (Chicago) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York). Sykes‚Äôs tapes have been broadcast in Sweden, Italy, Puerto Rico and extensively throughout in the USA, including ‚ÄúThe Independents,‚Äù PBS national broadcast, 1985, and national cablecast,1984. Media Burn has a selection of her tapes online and over 200 of her raw footage, master edits, dubs and compilation tapes in their archives. Select grants include a National Endowment for the Arts and American Film Institute Regional Fellowship, Evanston Arts Council Cultural Arts Fund and several Illinois Arts Council Grants. In 2019, the Evanston Arts Center Exhibition chose to showcase Sykes‚Äôs first solo watercolor exhibition, ‚ÄúEthereal Abstractions,‚Äù premiering in 2020. The paintings are lyrical, colorful abstractions reminiscent of organic shapes, ethereal forms and underwater landscapes - evocative impressions of spiritual and elemental worlds. They evoke the spontaneity and themes that have evolved from her previous body of time-based and digital artwork. She paints under the name of Barbara L. Sykes.  Early influences  In the early 1970‚Äôs, Sykes worked as a commercial silkscreener and then as an offset lithographer. Bored with her career, she decided to start a new career in the electronic arts. From 1974 to 1979 Sykes studied at the University of Illinois at Chicago, during which experimental video art was developing in Chicago. The Electronic Visualization Laboratory was started by two UIC faculty, Tom Defanti (Computer Science) and Dan Sandin (Fine Art), and was influential in developing computer graphics with the goal of creating video art. The research lab known for developing the Sandin Image Processor, a video synthesizer similar to synthesizers used to create music. The Image Processor allows for abstract analogue visuals to be created using analogue computer graphics, a new technology at the time. The lab was known for its Electronic Visualization Events (EVE), where live performances combined music and video processing in real time. As a student of this new technology, Barbara Sykes quickly developed unprecedented skills using the Image Processor and produced a large body of groundbreaking work, that includes Sykes historically significant performances with Tom Defanti of The Poem during EVE I, 1975, and Circle 9 Sunrise during EVE II ,1976, at a time when such real-time performances were the first of their kind. For EVE III, 1978, Sykes produced Electronic Masks and Sykes and Defanti co-produced By the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak and Duals together. Real-time computer performances continue to be vitalized at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Before earning an undergraduate degree, Sykes enrolled in the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, SAIC, emerging video program in 1979, and obtained her MFA in 1981. While a student at the UIC, Sykes worked at their Media Production Center and as a freelance videographer and editor, producing dance, instructional and documentary videos. Concurrently, she was a UIC teaching assistant for graduate and undergraduate classes, providing instruction on the Image Processor, field production and editing. In graduate school at SAIC, she worked at the Video Data Bank co-coordinating Recent Work, a traveling video art exhibition, and documented visiting artists, including Ellen Fisher‚Äôs performance, Call Her Amedia. She was also a broadcast post-production editor and cameraperson for a weekly Greek variety program that aired on PBS in Chicago in order to fund her tuition.  Career  Much of Sykes' work from the 1970s such as The Poem (1975), Circle 9 Sunrise (1976), Movement Within (1976), Reflections (1976), Off the Air (1977), Environmental Symmetry (1978) and By The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak (1978) utilized the Sandin Image Processor to create tapes as montages of meditative, poetic abstractions and her multimedia installations and interactive performance environments. While the nature of the Image Processor allows for limited analogue control, with much of the process left up to chance and experimentation, Sykes‚Äôs mastery of the Image Processor distinguished her work from other artists in the field. Notable, her pioneering figurative tapes, Electronic Masks (1978) and Emanations (1979), illustrate the innovative work created solely using the IP‚Äôs oscillators and editing. In 1977, Gene Siskel, film critic and host of Nightwatch, interviewed Sykes about her work and performance of Circle 9 Sunrise during this live television program on WTTW, PBS, Chicago. Her later works evolved into lyrical video poems, mystical stories and experimental ethnographic documentaries that demonstrate more personal and expressive narratives and themes. They showcased her strength as a storyteller grounded with an aesthetic sophistication of great emotional depth that depicted the underlying sacred nature of the people and events portrayed. Shiva Darsan (1994) and Song of the River (1997) are among these works. Sykes created videos that \\"reflect her interests in female mythological figures, rituals, dance, art, and music of other cultures as well as depicting dream states and fantasized visions.\\" While this later work is different in process, there are clear relationships to her earlier work, as is evident in Electronic Masks (1976), which demonstrates a blend of image processing with themes of spirituality. Song of the River, shot in Borneo, was created during Sykes's 14-month sabbatical in research and video production throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. While there, she visited various indigenous tribes and was interested in learning about their spiritual relationships, and how these relationships are evident in everyday life. In a statement about the film, Sykes describes that \\"from birth to death, special rights and ceremonies mark the important events of one‚Äôs existence, assuring a symbiosis of body and soul with the divine. This deep relationship between the people and their gods are reaffirmed through daily activity. At times, the person symbolically becomes god, strengthening their own sense of sacredness and self-respect.\\" These themes are continued in Shiva Darsan, shot in Nepal, another video in her series \\"In Celebration of Life... In Celebration of Death...\\" Shiva Darsan discusses the Hindu god Shiva through a personal account of Sykes's visit to the Shivaratri Festival at the Pashupatinath Temple. \\"In Celebration of Life... In Celebration of Death...\\" which was funded by a Chicago Artists Abroad Artist Residency and Columbia College, won several awards throughout 1994 and 1995 including the CINE Golden Eagle Award, First place at the Hollywood Spiritual Film and Entertainment Festival, First place Documentary Award at La Crosse Video Festival, Certificate of Merit in the Religious and Ethics Category at Intercom/Chicago International Film Festival and First place Documentary Award at La Crosse Video Festival, among others. The series was also shown at a variety of video festivals, such as the Banff Mountain Film Festival, the Canadian International Film and Video Festival, the Parnu International Visual Anthropology Film Festival in Estonia, the XI International Women's Film Festival in Madrid, Spain, the 12th International Hamburg Short Film Festival in Germany, the Festival International de la creation Video et Cinematographique in Manosque, France, the Festival of Illinois Film and Video Artists in Chicago, and the Three Rivers Arts Festival. Her last experimental ethnographic documentary, Amma, A Documentary of a Living Saint, is an extraordinarily powerful portrayal of a world-renown woman spiritual leader and global social activist. Besides creating artwork, Barbara Sykes has had a notable presence in the Chicago new media scene. In the late 1970s she became involved with The Center for New Television (formerly The Chicago Editing Center) where she would host video workshops and screen her work. In 1981, Sykes curated Video: Chicago Style, which was exhibited at Global Village in New York City, and was additionally screened on Manhattan Cable. This exhibition eventually grew into Video and Computer Art: Chicago Style, which she presented along with Sykes's Retrospective, her one- woman exhibition, throughout Japan, Australia, Spain and was the first woman video artist to present in China, 1988-1989. Sykes was a tenured experimental television professor at Columbia College Chicago from 1982-2005. While at Columbia College, she also served as initiator and director of the visiting lecturer series for the Department of Television, organizing lectures by industry professionals and artists such as Gene Youngblood, author of Expanded Cinema, Barbara London, curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Rafael Franca, which occurred in conjunction with ‚ÄúBrazilian Video Art‚Äù, the first ever exhibition of Brazilian experimental video work in Chicago. In 1996 and 1997, Sykes was a featured artist in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago‚Äôs retrospective exhibition ‚ÄúArt in Chicago, 1945-1995‚Äù and included in the companion book produced for this show. In 2016 Sykes took part in Celebrating Women in New Media Arts, a panel symposium held at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The symposium highlighted women who have paved the way in the male dominated field of new media. Joan Truckenbrod and Claudia Hart were among some of the participants who shared their experiences making technological artwork as women, and some of the challenges they faced. The symposium preceded and helped to promote the 2018 release of the book New Media Futures: The Rise of Women in the Digital Arts published by the University of Illinois Press. This book captures the contributions of twenty- two trailblazing mid-western women creators that were integral to the development of the digital arts and at the forefront of social change, technical innovation and artistic inquiry. New Media Futures featured artists and contributors are Barbara Sykes, Ellen Sandor, Donna Cox, Janine Fron, Carolina Cruz-Niera, Margaret Dolinsky, Tiffany Holmes, Dana Plepys, Maxine Brown, Brenda Laurel, Copper Giloth, Jane Veeder, Colleen Bushell, Nan Goggin, Mary Rasmussen, Martyl Langsdorf, Abina Manning, Annette Barbier, Sally Rosenthal, Lucy Petrovic, Joan Truckenbrod and Claudia Hart. Sykes and the other women in New Media Futures have participated in its book tours and presentations, https://www.artn.com/herstory. In 2018, Sykes' work By The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak was included in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition.

The Mitchell-Anderson building on the Payne Seminary campus History  Early history  Payne Seminary traces its origins to 1844 when the Ohio Conference of the AME Church was authorized to build a seminary and manual training school. As a result Union Seminary opened in 1847, which led to the establishment of Wilberforce University in 1862 and Payne Seminary in 1891. The seminary‚Äôs path towards becoming a free- standing institution began in June 1890, when the board of trustees of Wilberforce University, on the motion of Bishop Abraham Grant, appointed Bishop Benjamin Arnett to chair a committee to ‚Äúconsider the propriety and feasibility of establishing a Theological Seminary at Wilberforce, to be part of, but not to be controlled by, a peculiar arrangement, so that it would be made more efficient than now.‚Äù The board's plan for a seminary was presented to the AME Church Council of Bishops and approved unanimously on February 28, 1891.Payne Theological Seminary. Catalogue of Payne Theological Seminary, of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Wilberforce, Ohio, 1901-1902. Wilberforce, Ohio: Payne Theological Seminary, 1901. Once the board of trustees' organizational plans were endorsed by Wilberforce's Financial Board, it was recommended the homestead of Rev. John G. and Fannie A. Mitchell be purchased for $8,500 as the seminary's future site. This plan was presented to Wilberforce's Board of Trustees and adopted with some modifications. Daniel Payne was selected as the Seminary's first dean.Wilberforce University. Payne Theological Seminary of Wilberforce University : An Account of Its Origin, Organization and Object.

On June 19, 1894, \\"Payne Theological Seminary of Wilberforce University\\" was incorporated by Alexander Wayman, Benjamin Arnett, James Handy, Benjamin Lee (Bishops of the AME Church), John Mitchell, James Shorter, and William Scarborough. The first Bachelor of Divinity graduates were: E.T. Demby, Charles Henry Johnson, and William Polk, Jr.; C.H. Colemen was awarded an English Theological certificate. Reverend John G. Mitchell served as the seminary‚Äôs second dean from 1893 to November 1900. Bishop Benjamin T. Tanner, the founder of the Christian Recorder newspaper, was dean from 1900 to 1902, but he was only on campus during commencement due to his duties as Bishop.

Wright, Jr. ‚Äî who taught Hebrew and New Testament Greek at Payne ‚Äî reflects on the Seminary‚Äôs impact in his autobiography: \\"As I look back, it seems marvelous that Payne Seminary could have done so well with such poor equipment and poorly prepared students. The school has furnished several bishops of the Church, college presidents and deans, teachers and many pastors of large responsibility.\\"Wright, Richard R. 87 Years Behind the Black Curtain : An Autobiography. Philadelphia: Rare Book, 1965.  1902 - 1968  As a part of its ‚Äúpeculiar arrangement‚Äù with Wilberforce University, Payne Seminary‚Äôs dean assumed institutional leadership. During his tenure from 1902 to 1937, Dean Reverend George F. Woodson increased curriculum diversity. Dean Charles S. Spivey, Sr., serving from 1937 to 1944, emphasized the need for an educated clergy. Dougal Ormonde B. Walker became the interim-dean in 1944, and despite his short tenure, began Payne's development towards becoming an accredited institution. Dean John H. Lewis held the office from 1944 to 1951, during which he continued the accreditation process Walker initiated. Lewis emphasized the need to renovate the campus' buildings and grounds by appealing for construction of a new administrative building. During the 1951 to 1956 tenure of Dean Rembert E. Stokes, enrollment increased, the administration building was completed, and the stain glass windows of The Chapel of the Living Savior were installed. Sokes commissioned experts to produce stained glass windows for the Chapel, which featured Biblical heroes (Jesus, Moses, Amos, St. Paul, and Martin Luther) and AME Church heroes (Wesley, Wilberforce, Allen, and Payne). The nine glass windows are acclaimed for their conceptual and artistic design. Stokes left Payne Seminary to become president of Wilberforce University in 1956. Payne‚Äôs chapel currently serves as the congregational home for Holy Trinity AME Church. Dean Charles S. Spivey, Jr. served from 1957 to 1967, when he raised funds to furnish the academic building and the Chapel of the Living Savior. Alvia A. Shaw served as interim- Dean in 1968.

Taxonomy L. thermotolerans is the type species of the genus Lachancea. The species has previously been known as Kluyveromyces thermotolerans and Zygosaccharomyces thermotolerans, which is the name by which it was first described in 1932. Habitat and ecology L. thermotolerans is widely distributed and occurs in diverse environments, both natural and man-made. It has been isolated from locations around the world. The species is commonly associated with fruit and with insects such as fruit flies that feed on fruit. In some cases, it has been identified as one of several species found in naturally fermented foods. Uses L. thermotolerans is unusual among yeasts in its ability to produce lactic acid through fermentation. This property has prompted study of L. thermotolerans in the production of wine and beer, both of which are traditionally produced using Saccharomyces yeasts. In winemaking, L. thermotolerans and other yeast species have been studied for the effects of their metabolites on the flavor profile of wines. Systems including L. thermotolerans in co-fermentation with wine yeast or in place of lactic acid bacteria have been described as an alternative to traditional malolactic fermentation. L. thermotolerans has been sold commercially on its own and in a yeast blend. In beer brewing, L. thermotolerans has been considered as a method for producing sour beer.. It has been observed that this kind of yeast ferments at low temperatures (17 ¬∞C) as well as at high temperatures (27 ¬∞C) and with SO2 doses of 25 mg/L and 75 mg/L with an ethanol yield between 7-11% vol.

This difference resembles a tax due to the mathematics which impose a lower compound return when returns vary over time, compared to a simple sum of returns. This diminishment of returns is in increasing proportion to volatility, such that volatility itself appears to be the basis of a progressive tax. Conversely, fixed-return investments (which have no return volatility) appear to be \\"volatility tax free\\". Overview As Spitznagel wrote: Quantitatively, the volatility tax is the difference between the arithmetic and geometric average (or ‚Äúensemble average‚Äù and ‚Äútime average‚Äù) returns of an asset or portfolio. It thus represents the degree of ‚Äúnon-ergodicity‚Äù of the geometric average. Standard quantitative finance assumes that a portfolio‚Äôs net asset value changes follow a geometric Brownian motion (and thus are log-normally distributed) with arithmetic average return (or ‚Äúdrift‚Äù) \\\\mu, standard deviation (or ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù) \\\\sigma, and geometric average return :\\\\mu-\\\\sigma^2/2 So the geometric average return is the difference between the arithmetic average return and a function of volatility. This function of volatility :\\\\sigma^2/2 represents the volatility tax. (Though this formula is under the assumption of log-normality, the volatility tax provides an accurate approximation for most return distributions. The precise formula is a function of the central moments of the return distribution.) The mathematics behind the volatility tax is such that a very large portfolio loss has a disproportionate impact on the volatility tax that it pays and, as Spitznagel wrote, this is why the most effective risk mitigation focuses on large losses: According to Spitznagel, the goal of risk mitigation strategies is to solve this ‚Äúvexing non- ergodicity, volatility tax problem‚Äù and thus raise a portfolio‚Äôs geometric average return, or CAGR, by lowering its volatility tax (and ‚Äúnarrow the gap between our ensemble and time averages‚Äù). This is ‚Äúthe very name of the game in successful investing. It is the key to the kingdom, and explains in a nutshell Warren Buffett‚Äôs cardinal rule, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt lose money.‚Äô‚ÄùThe Volatility Tax, Universa Investments, February 2018 Moreover, ‚Äúthe good news is the entire hedge fund industry basically exists to help with this‚Äîto help save on volatility taxes paid by portfolios.
