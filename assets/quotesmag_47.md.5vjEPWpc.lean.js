The colouring of this species is very distinctive and the specific name soralia comes from the resemblance of its markings to the vegetative structures on some crustose lichens. ==Description== The Copan brook frog is a small frog, the males growing to about and the females to . The snout is very blunt and the prominent eyes have red irises. The male has a single vocal sac under the throat, with a pair of vocal slits. The dorsal surface is brown with a well-marked pattern of green, olive, and black, pale-edged spots or blotches. The ventral surface is yellow and the outer surface of the fore limb has a patterning of white streaks. ==Distribution== This tree frog is endemic to mountainous parts of northwest Honduras and northeast Guatemala. Its habitat is moist tropical forest and cloud forest at altitudes of up to above sea level. ==Biology== D. soralia is nocturnal and is usually found in or near streams, in low vegetation and on waterside rocks. Breeding takes place between May and July. The tadpoles are a pale yellowish-green colour with iridescent green spots and red eyes. They inhabit shallow pools. ==Status== Duellmanohyla soralia is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers of frogs are dwindling, and in the Cusuco National Park, where the habitat is fully protected, at least part of the cause of the decline is believed to be the disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Elsewhere this frog is also threatened by loss of habitat caused by forest clearance for agricultural purposes and by water pollution. ==References== soralia Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Frogs of North America Category:Critically endangered fauna of North America Category:Amphibians described in 1985 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Copan brook frog"},{"id":"12372425","text":"Schmidt's mountain brook frog (Duellmanohyla schmidtorum) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

Inventing the Child is an account of childhood at the start of a new millennium. Zornado analyzes several of the dominant notions of childhood which lead to this moment, such as those of Calvin, Freud, and Rousseau, and finally the \\"consumer childhood\\" era of Dr. Spock and television. He argues that the stories we tell our children, from fairy tales to Disney videos, perpetuate the materialism and conformity of our dominant culture. The book has been praised by writers such as Daniel Quinn, who calls it \\"among the two or three most eye-opening, illuminating, and important books I've ever read.\\" The first two volumes of Zornado's 2050 trilogy have been published by Iron Diesel Press. 2050 is set two thousand years after the fall of civilization, when a wanderer named Vilb sets out on a personal journey, only to discover that he may be little more than a pawn of ‚Äúthe gods,‚Äù a remnant of ancient human beings who have been waiting for this very moment to fulfill their destiny, not his. It is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Antarctica, which though habitable remains extremely dry; the lack of water and food has set this new \\"Little Earth\\" on a course for crisis, and Vilb holds - though he hardly knows it - both its cause and its resolution.

He is a first generation college student. He has a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and a Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics. He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980 and served there for 33 years. ==Career== Most of Morell's early work in the Agency was devoted to energy and to East Asian projects. During his mid-career, Morell managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief, and he served as the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was President George W. Bush's daily intelligence briefer during 2001, including on September 11th. Morell spent the entire day with the President. When asked by Bush who was responsible for the attacks that day, Morell said \\"‚Ä¶ I have no doubt that the trail will lead to the doorstep of Bin Laden and al-Qa‚Äôida.\\" Morell also served as Director for Intelligence, the Agency's top analyst, from 2008 to 2010. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director, the Agency's top administrator, from 2006 to 2008. Morell, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton and other members of Obama's national security team in May 2011 In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes. Morell was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the Agency's second highest honor, for his role in the bin Laden operation. Obama, knowing that Morell was with Bush on 9/11, sent Morell to Dallas to brief Bush on the raid two weeks after bin Laden was killed. From July 1, 2011 to September 6, 2011, Morell served his first stint as acting director of the CIA, replacing Leon Panetta when he was confirmed as Secretary of Defense. On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal. President Obama considered Morell as the permanent replacement to Petraeus but chose John Brennan instead; Brennan was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013. Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013 and left the Agency in early September 2013. == Post retirement == In November 2013, Morell joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor. In 2018, Beacon named Morell as the head of its geo- political risk practice. In this role, Morell advises firms on global developments and what they mean for the companies. In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that the damage done by Snowden was profound and that he should come home to face a jury of his peers. Morell has noted that he, Morell, would be willing to live by the verdict of a jury as to whether Snowden was a patriot or a traitor. In January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor on intelligence and national security. In 2018, CBS began producing Morell's weekly podcast on national security, titled Intelligence Matters. In each episode, Morell speaks with current and former members of the intelligence community as well as policymakers about their careers and about national security issues. Each episode is distributed as a podcast and an hour-long program on CBS News Radio. Morell also contributes to the media in other ways, as a contributing columnist to the Washington Post and as an expert voice on Axios.https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/michael- morell/ In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism‚ÄîFrom al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. A New York Times bestseller, the book traces his three-decade-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the Agency's counterterrorism missions both before and after the September 11th attacks. The book deals with the public controversies related to the country's post-9/11 counterterrorism activities.Miller, Greg (May 3, 2015). \\"Former CIA official cites agency‚Äôs failure to see al-Qaeda‚Äôs rebound\\".

CBS News. May 11, 2015. Morell noted that Powell had said repeatedly that no one from the Agency had ever apologized for sending him to speak to the United Nations with incorrect intelligence and that Morell thought it time that someone did so. In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties and that he had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was \\"not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.\\" Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement (Morell rejoined CBS News after the election). In a subsequent Q&A; article with the NY Times, Morell responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, \\"was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton\\", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out \\"entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought.\\" In September 2017, Morell resigned from his senior fellowship at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government as a result of Chelsea Manning's appointment as a senior fellow there. Morell noted that he was fine with Harvard inviting Manning to speak on campus but that he was not okay with her being given the honor of a senior fellowship at one of America's most prestigious institutions. After Morell and others complained, Harvard rescinded its offer to Manning. In 2017, Morell was appointed to serve on National Defense Strategy Commission, a congressionally created body designed to give Congress an independent view of America's defense needs. The group's final report was sobering, painting a picture of US defense capabilities eroding relative to those of China and Russia. In early 2019, Morell, along with the also former Acting and Deputy Director of the CIA John McLaughlin, brought together a group of former CIA, NSA, and FBI officers to produce a briefing book on a dozen or so key national security issues facing the nation. Morell and McLaughlin provided the book to all candidates running for President, whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent, to include President Trump's reelection campaign. The two told the press that the aim of the book was to provide a basis of fact and analysis as campaigns developed their foreign policy positions and as they debated the issues. The book did not advocate particular policies. In April 2019, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reported that Morell, who had been consulting for a U.S. firm that did work with Saudi Arabia, stepped down from that role following the killing of Saudi national, U.S. resident, and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Ignatius wrote that Morell withdrew \\"over concern about the direction that Saudi Arabia was heading.\\" In 2019, the International Spy Museum unveiled a new interactive exhibit hosted by Morell. In the exhibit, Morell leads participants through a red-teaming exercise of the intelligence that pointed to Usama bin Ladin hiding at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The exhibit is one the museum's most popular.https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/museums/the-new-spy- museum-is-bigger-bolder-and-more-beautiful-here-are-the-10-things-you- shouldnt-miss/2019/05/08/1bfada0e-6853-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html  Views  Morell has written dozens of Op-Eds and given hundreds of media interviews since leaving government. His writings and interviews suggest the world is a dangerous place and that to keep the country safe, the United States must take a leadership role in the world, it must have strong allies with whom it works together on tough issues, and it must have a strong military, intelligence service, and diplomatic service in order to deter adversaries. Second, for the United States to be strong abroad, it must be strong at home. Morell says that \\"the most important determinant of a country's national security is the health of its economy and society\\" and that the thing that most keeps him up at night is the failure of our politicians to come together, to compromise, and to make decisions that move our economy and our society forward. On May 19, 2015, during his book tour, Morell stated on MSNBC that what Vice President Dick Cheney said publicly about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003 was inconsistent with the views of the intelligence community.\\"Fmr. CIA Deputy Director grilled on Iraq War\\". MSNBC. May 19, 2016.\\"'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Tuesday, May 19th, 2015\\". NBC News. May 19, 2015. MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: \\" ... here on last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument.\\"\\"'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Wednesday, May 20th, 2015\\". NBC News. May 20, 2016. In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia, and Iran for the extremely high civilian death toll in Syria. He called on the opposition in Syria to deter Russia and Iran by making them \\"pay a price\\" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country. He also called on the United States to conduct limited, precision bombings of Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table. Regarding President Assad, Morell argued \\"I want to go after those things, such as his personal helicopter and aircraft, that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad.\\" In October 2016, Morell told Rose that the United States should confront Iran's behavior in the Middle East, and he voiced support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against Yemen's Houthis, pointing out that the Iranians were supporting the Houthis as a proxy force against the Saudis. Morell said \\"Ships leave Iran on a regular basis carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen.\\" Morell also said that Iran wants \\"to be the hegemonic power in the region\\" and Arab states of the Persian Gulf are \\"pushing back against that\\". In December 2016, Morell suggested that the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was \\"the political equivalent of 9/11\\". He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently with harsh sanctions, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence. In March 2017, Morell said: \\"On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There's no little campfire, there's no little candle, there's no spark. And there's a lot of people looking for it.\\"\\"Key Democratic Officials Now Warning Base Not to Expect Evidence of Trump/Russia Collusion\\". The Intercept. March 16, 2017. In April 2019, Morell, along with Stanford professor Amy Zegart, wrote a piece in Foreign Affairs titled \\"Spies, Lies, and Algorithms: Why the Intelligence Community Must Adapt or Fail\\". In the article, Morell and Zegart argue that the intelligence community is falling further behind in the technology race, a development that poses a significant risk to the country. The authors say that this lag has already caused a significant intelligence breakdown, the failure of the community to see in a timely manner Russia's weaponization of social media during the 2016 presidential election.  Advisory groups  Since retiring from CIA in 2013, Morell has served on a number of boards or advisory groups related to national security. He currently serves on the board of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C. think tank on international affairs. He serves on the advisory boards of the Alliance to Secure Democracy at the German-Marshall Fund, the American Media Abroad group, and the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. Morell also serves on the board of CyberDome. He served on the Advisory Board of the Committee to Investigate Russia, a group organized by Hollywood director Rob Reiner and The Atlantic senior editor David Frum.  Teaching  Also, since retiring from the Agency, Morell has spent time teaching and mentoring at a variety of colleges and universities. He is currently a distinguished visiting professor at the Michael V. Hayden Center at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, where he teaches classes on intelligence and moderates on-the-record conversations on intelligence, including a March 2019 event on Congress and the Intelligence Community, titled The Hill Has Eyes: Congressional Oversight of Intelligence. Morell spent the fall quarter of 2016 teaching a seminar as a resident fellow at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. Morell has also spent time at Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, West Point, and his alma mater, the University of Akron.https://ctc.usma.edu/mr-michael-morell-joins-ctc-as-senior-fellow/ ==Personal life== Morell is married to Mary Beth Morell (n√©e Manion), and they have three children. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Profile at the CIA *Twitter Page on Twitter *Who is Michael Morell? - - Category:1958 births Category:Deputy Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency Category:Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency Category:Georgetown University alumni Category:Living people Category:Obama administration personnel Category:People from Akron, Ohio Category:People from Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio Category:People from Youngstown, Ohio Category:University of Akron alumni ","title":"Michael Morell"},{"id":"12372482","text":"Exerodonta abdivita is a species of frogs in the family Hylidae.

More colloquially, the phrase is also used to label actions seen as the unnecessary or unjustified destruction of the environment for personal or corporate gain. == Definition == There are academic and semantic difficulties in defining \\"terrorism\\" and specifically \\"environmental terrorism\\", but discussions of environmental terrorism are growing with a focus on identifying possible risks to natural resources or environmental features. Some, including in the military argue that attacks on natural resources can now cause more deaths, property damage, political chaos, and other adverse effects than in previous years. Chalecki distinguishes between environmental terrorism and eco- terrorism. She notes that environmental terrorism can be defined \\"as the unlawful use of force against in situ environmental resources so as to deprive populations of their benefit(s) and/or destroy other property\\". In contrast, eco-terrorism is the destruction of property in the interest of saving the environment from human encroachment and destruction.San Francisco Chronicle, July 1, 2001, page A10 More concisely, environmental terrorism involves targeting natural resources. Eco-terrorism involves targeting the built environment such as roads, buildings and trucks, in defense of natural resources. Other analysts may fail to distinguish between these different threats. ==See also== *Environmental vandalism *Environmental impact of war *List of environmental issues *1989 California medfly attack ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Baechler, G. 1999. ‚ÄúEnvironmental Degradation and Violent Conflict: Hypotheses, Research Agendas, and Theory-building.‚Äù In Ecology, politics, and violent conflict, edited by Mohamed Suliman, 76-112.

The title is often translated as The True Teaching, Practice, and Realization of the Pure Land Way in English. The work was written after Shinran's exile, and is believed to have been composed in the year 1224. It represents a synthesis of various Buddhist sutras in Mahayana literature, including the Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life, the Nirvana Sutra, the Avatamsaka Sutra and the Mahapraj√±aparamita Sutra. In this way, Shinran expounds Jodo Shinshu thought. The work is divided into six chapters, not including the Preface: * Chapter 1 - Teaching * Chapter 2 - Practice * Chapter 3 - Shinjin, plus additional preface * Chapter 4 - Realizing * Chapter 5 - The True Buddha and Land * Chapter 6 - The Transformed Buddha and Land In addition to frequent quotations from Buddhist sutras, Shinran often quotes the Jodo Shinshu dharma masters, who comprise the teaching lineage, which extends from Shakyamuni Buddha to Shinran's teacher Honen. At the beginning of each chapter Shinran begins with the phrase (in English) \\"Compiled by Gutoku Shinran, Disciple of Shakyamuni\\". The name Gutoku or \\"foolish, stubble-headed one\\" was the name Shinran gave himself after he was exiled from Kyoto. == Chapter 1 == This is the shortest of the six chapters, and mostly quotes from the Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life to explain that encountering a Buddha is extremely rare and auspicious for all beings, and that Shakyamuni Buddha's appearance in the world was expressly to propound the Pure Land teachings. == Chapter 2 == This chapter delves in more detail the basis for Pure Land Buddhist thought namely: * That the Buddha Amitabha made a series of vows to save all beings * That the most important vow is the 18th or Primal Vow to lead beings to the Pure Land if they recite his name * That the Buddha Amitabha sought to excel among Buddhas by providing a way out of suffering that all could practice. Later the chapter quotes at length passages from the writings of Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Shan-tao and H≈çnen as well as other Jodo Shinshu Patriarchs in chronological order. Shinran appears to be providing a progression of ideas among Buddhist writers that shows the evolution of Pure Land Buddhism. Among the topics discussed and cited are the recitation of the Amitabha's name, or nembutsu, the Path of the Bodhisattva, and the nature of the Pure Land itself. Toward the end, Shinran turns toward the topic of tariki or Other Power and again quotes from various sutras and commentaries to draw his ideas upon. At the end of Chapter 2, Shinran writes his famous hymn, the Shoshinge or \\"Hymn of true Entrusting\\", which is a cornerstone of Jodo Shinshu liturgy. == Chapter 3 == The preface to this chapter begins with Shinran discussing his belief in shinjin, or total entrusting to Amitabha Buddha, and how other schools focused on self-power are floundering in their efforts. In Chapter 3 itself, Shinran discusses shinjin in much detail, and why it is central to Jodo Shinshu practice. For Shinran, the total entrusting to Amitabha represented the most assured way for the common man to be reborn into the Pure Land, because rebirth would occur entirely through the compassion and wisdom of Amitabha. Again, Shinran quotes at length from both Tan-luan and Shan-tao who expounded the subject in detail in explaining the ideas of reciting Amitabha's and entrusting one's self to the practice of it. Shinran then discuss the nature of shinjin, and describes it as the \\"mind aspiring for great enlightenment\\" in a transcendent, crosswise manner, as opposed to the direct manner found in self-oriented practices. Here Shinran reiterates the point that if one abandons \\"sundry practices\\" and entrusts themselves to Amitabha for one thought-moment, they will attain a state of shinjin and their birth in the Pure Land will be assured. Shinran then lists the benefits of practicing the nembutsu, or recitation of Amitabha's name. These include a great sense of joy, the praise of the myriad Buddhas, the protection of the myriad Buddhas, and a state of being \\"truly settled\\". The last section of Chapter 3 focuses on what defines people who cannot be saved by other Buddhist practices, who are seen as the main focus of Amitabha's Primal Vow. == Chapter 4 == In the comparatively short Chapter 4, Shinran begins by writings about nature of Amitabha as the Dharmakaya itself, and that those who attain shinjin are assured of Nirvana. Noteworthy is the quote at the beginning of the chapter: :...Because they [who attained shinjin] dwell among the truly settled, they necessarily attain Nirvana...Supreme Nirvana is uncreated dharma-body [dharmakaya]. Uncreated dharma-body is true reality. True reality is dharma-nature. Dharma-nature is suchness. Suchness is oneness. Amida Tathagata comes forth from suchness and manifests various bodies... After the introduction, Shinran writes about the idea, first posited by H≈çnen, about Amitabha's intent to lead all beings to the Pure Land through smarana, so that they can become Bodhisattvas. These Bodhisattvas, will then return to the world to lead other beings along the Buddhist path. Again, Shinran expands on these ideas by citing the writings of past patriarchs of Pure Land thought. == Chapter 5 == Chapter 5 is devoted to the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha, and birth there. Shinran writes that the Pure Land represents truth and reality, and upon birth in the Pure Land, one's delusions are immediately gone. As the Buddha Amitabha embodies the truth (symbolized by infinite light) his Pure Land and birth there represents awakening from delusions and defilements. This complements Chapter 4's assertion that shinjin is the same as Nirvana. == Chapter 6 == Chapter 6 is the longest chapter of the Kyogyoshinsho, and brings other Buddhist sects and practices into the context of Pure Land Buddhism as varying forms of skillful means. Other Buddhist writers in medieval Japan similarly tried to categorize Buddhist sects into a form of hierarchy, and here Shinran attempts to do the same. Shinran believes that in the era of Mappo, most of the original practices and teachings have died out or lost their efficacy, and so the only viable path left is the Pure Land path. The end of Chapter 6, the Postscript, includes a brief autobiography, particularly during and after Shinran's exile from Kyoto in the year 1207. He writes about how he came to H≈çnen's teachings in the year 1201 and feels he has remained his disciple ever since. He explains that his motivation is to share his joy in finding the Pure Land and hopes that others will take refuge in Amitabha as well. Shinran concludes the Kyogyoshinsho with a passage from the Flower Garland Sutra: :On seeing a bodhisattva :Perform various practices, :Some give rise to a good mind and others to a mind of evil, :But the bodhisattva embraces them all. == References == * The Collected Works of Shinran Volumes I and II, Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-Ha, Kyoto, Japan, Shin Buddhism Translation Series, 1997. * Shinran Shonin, Hisao Inagaki (trans): Ky≈çgy≈çshinsh≈ç: On Teaching, Practice, Faith, and Enlightenment, Berkeley: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, 2003. == External links == * The Kyogyoshinsho provided by \\"Collected Works of Shinran\\" * Kyogyoshinsho translation by Hisao Inagaki * Listening to Kyo Gyo Shin Sho Category:Japanese Buddhist texts Category:J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Category:Works by Shinran Category:Books about Buddhism in the Kamakura period ","title":"Ky≈çgy≈çshinsh≈ç"},{"id":"12372526","text":"Exerodonta xera is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, shrub- dominated wetlands, and swamps. ==Description== The bird-voiced tree frog is a small species growing to about long. It is usually a dappled, pale grey or brown on its dorsal surface, but its color changes with the temperature and its level of activity, and may be more or less pale green. It often has a dark brown cross-shaped mark on its back and further dark areas on its limbs. Its belly is grey with flashes of yellow on the underside of its hind legs. The male has a dark throat. This frog is very similar to the larger gray tree frog (Dryophytes versicolor), but that species has an orange flash on its hind legs. Both have a whitish square region just underneath the eyes. The bird- voiced tree frog is easily distinguishable during the spring and summer when it gives its characteristic call. ==Distribution and habitat== The bird-voiced tree frog is found over much of the southeastern United States, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida,Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina,Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Its favored habitat is wooded swamps near streams and rivers where the dominant species include cypress, birch, tupelo, and buttonbush. ==Behavior== Adult male calling The bird-voiced tree frog normally lives in trees, seldom descending to the ground except to breed. It is nocturnal and emerges at dusk to forage for insects and other small invertebrates. Breeding takes place in late spring and early summer, usually after heavy rains. The male calls from bushes and low vegetation close to the edge of temporary pools or ponds. The sound is a rapid, repetitive \\"wit-wit-wit-wit\\". The female lays a number of batches of six to fifteen eggs in shallow water. The tadpole stage lasts for about a month and the newly metamorphosed juvenile frogs are often seen in bushes or dispersing to other localities in wet weather. ==Status== The bird-voiced tree frog is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It seems to have large populations in the areas in which it occurs and there seems to be no noticeable decline in numbers. Clearing or draining the swamps in which it lives would be deleterious, but is not happening to any great extent. ==References== Category:Dryophytes Category:Amphibians described in 1928 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Bird-voiced tree frog"},{"id":"12372550","text":"Bocourt's tree frog (Dryophytes bocourti), or Bocourt's treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae endemic to Guatemala and found on the mountains of the southern Alta Verapaz Department and Baja Verapaz Department.

Pine woods tree frogs lay eggs in ephemeral water bodies. Eggs generally hatch within 24 hours, and tadpoles metamorphose into baby froglets after 50‚Äì75 days at 11‚Äì15 mm in length. Tadpoles are remarkably variable; similar to the squirrel tree frog (Dryophytes squirellus), the presence or absence of dragonfly larvae (a predator) induces a dramatic, red-colored tail. Like many amphibian species' tadpoles, those of the pinewoods tree frog are susceptible to parasitic infection by trematode flatworms. However, tadpoles swim in a manner that does not necessarily reduce the intensity of infection, but reduces the likelihood of these parasites infecting in the head and body region; instead, their swimming behavior shunts parasites to the tail area, where infection by parasites causes fewer harmful effects.  Adult  The pine woods tree frog is a very small species, growing to a length of . The color varies, sometimes being mottled brownish- gray, deep reddish-brown, gray, or grayish-green, usually with dark markings on its back. It is very similar in appearance to the squirrel tree frog but it can be distinguished from that species by the series of yellow, orange, or white dots that can be seen on the back of the thigh when the hind leg is extended. The toes have large toe pads but little webbing. Their distinctive call can be heard between April and October; it is a series of staccato sounds, giving it the nickname of \\"Morse code frog\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The pine woods tree frog is found in the southeastern United States on the plains of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, its range extending from Virginia to Florida and Louisiana. It climbs high in trees, but also sometimes descends to ground level and favors pine woods, savannahs, mixed pine and turkey oak woodlands, and cypress swamps. During droughts or cold weather, it hides in or under rotten logs or in moist crevices in trees. ==Biology== The pine woods tree frog mainly eats insects. Breeding takes place at any time between March and October. The male calls, especially at dusk, from locations close to water, such as trees, bushes, and inside clumps of vegetation. The female lays about 100 eggs on or just below the surface of the water, which may be a ditch or temporary pool. The tadpoles are fully developed and ready to undergo metamorphosis at about two months old. ==Status== The pine woods tree frog is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Common name Helena's treefrog has been proposed for it. ==Taxonomy== Osteocephalus helenae was described in 1919 by Alexander Grant Ruthven as Hyla helenae based on three recently metamorphosed specimens. The relationships of this species were unclear and it was considered incertae sedis within Hyla, until and colleagues concluded in 2013 that Ruthven's Hyla helenae is the same species as Osteocephalus germani described by Ron and colleagues in 2012 and that the correct name for this taxon is Osteocephalus helenae. ==Description== Based on the type series of Osteocephalus germani, adult males measure about and adult females about in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is truncate but may sometimes be rounded in females. The tympanum is visible but partly concealed dorsally. The fingers and the toes bear large discs and are webbed, the toes more heavily so. Dorsal skin bears tubercles in males but is smooth in females. Coloration is variable, ranging dorsally from brown with dark brown marks to light gray with dark brown marks; the ventrum is light cream and may have dark brown flecks. There is a cream-colored suborbital mark. Males have a paired vocal sac. Variation in dorsal and ventral coloration of preserved specimens ==Habitat== The region of the type locality of Osteocephalus helenae is lowland tropical rainforest. In Peru, this species (as Osteocephalus germani) has been collected from primary and secondary lowland forests and from premontane forest at elevations up to . All specimens were encountered by temporary pools, perching over broad leaves or on tree branches above the ground. ==Conservation status== The assessment of Osteocephalus helenae for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2004 predates the current delimitation of this species. ==References== helenae Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1919 Category:Taxa named by Alexander Grant Ruthven Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Osteocephalus helenae"},{"id":"12372588","text":"The mimic tree frog (\\"Hyla\\" imitator) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae that is endemic to the central Amazon of Brazil.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, and urban areas. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The Italian tree frog is very similar in colouring to the European tree frog of which it was previously believed to be a subspecies.Duellman, William E. Grzimek's Animal Encyclopedia. 2nd Ed., Vol. 2. Gale, 2003, p. 235. It grows to a length of and females are usually larger than males. The skin on the dorsal surface is smooth and bright green. The ventral surface is whitish and clearly demarcated from the dorsal surface by a beige line. A black stripe extends from the eye to the armpit. The female has a white throat while the male has a golden brown one with an inflatable vocal sac. The hind legs are longer than the forelegs and the digits of the hands and feet end in adhesive discs. ==Distribution and habitat== Italian tree frog The Italian tree frog is native to Italy and Sicily. Is very rare in southern Switzerland and a small area of western Slovenia close to the Italian border. It is found in lowland woods, forests, mountain valleys and wet habitats such as reed beds, at altitudes of up to . ==Biology== The Italian tree frog is able to climb bushes and trees and move around the countryside via hedgerows, ditches and canals. It feeds on small invertebrates such as flies, mosquitoes and midges. In the breeding season, dominant males establish territories near a pond, paddy field, or other area of water and advertise themselves by calling. Each call consists of a repeated series of six to ten pulses which start quietly and increase in intensity and which varies in frequency and pulse rate between different males. Females appear to take notice of various attributes of the calls when choosing a male. Other male frogs, known as \\"satellites\\" and often rather smaller than the calling males, may lurk nearby and try to intercept females attracted by the territorial males' calls, a form of parasitism. ==Status== The IUCN has rated the Italian tree frog as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in its Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it is quite common in Italy and its population size seems stable. Though it is likely to be threatened by habitat loss and possibly by water pollution, it faces no other particular threats. ==References== Category:Hyla Category:Amphibians described in 1882 Category:Amphibians of Europe Category:Fauna of Switzerland Category:Fauna of Slovenia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Italian tree frog"},{"id":"12372600","text":"Bolovan may refer to the following rivers in Romania: * Bolovan, a tributary of the Ilva in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Bolovan, a tributary of the Budac in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County * Bolovan, a tributary of the GeamƒÉna in Olt and V√¢lcea Counties == See also == * BolovƒÉni»ô (disambiguation) * Bolovani, a village in D√¢mbovi»õa County, Romania ","title":"Bolovan (disambiguation)"},{"id":"12372606","text":"Hyla molitor is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. ==Sources== * Category:Hyla Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1857 ","title":"Hyla molitor"},{"id":"12372607","text":"Milebush is a hamlet about one mile (1.6 km) north of Marden in the Maidstone district of Kent, England.

It is part of the Fair Youth sequence, and sometimes included as the last sonnet in the Rival Poet group. ==Synopsis== The poet admits that he no longer possesses the love of the youth, whose worth is too great for the poet, who could only possess him while the youth did not recognise his own worth. His time with the youth was like a dream of greatness from which he has now woken. Shakespeare says, in essence, that the Fair Youth is so much better than he is that Shakespeare can't possibly deserve him. Being unworthy, Shakespeare wants to release the Youth from the relationship so that \\"he can have the better life that he deserves\\".(Nelles, William. \\"Sexing Shakespeare's Sonnets: Reading beyond Sonnet 20.\\" English Literary Renaissance, 2009.) In the closing couplet, Shakespeare says that while the relationship lasted, he felt like a king, but now he realizes it was simply a dream. The structure of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand if you want to get rid of me. In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and \\"I'm left here to remember our time together\\" when I felt like nobility. ==Structure== Sonnet 87 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 2nd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And like enough thou know'st thy estimate, (87.2) However, (along with Sonnet 20) Sonnet 87 is extraordinary in Shakespeare's insistent use of final extrametrical syllables or feminine endings, which occur in all but lines 2 and 4; for example, in the first line: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, (87.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. There is critical debate over their effect. Helen Vendler proposes that the feminine endings, similar to their intermittent use in Sonnet 126, parallel \\"the poet's unwillingness to let the young man go\\".(Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge and London: Belknap-Harvard University Press, 1997. 381. OCLC # 36806589) She notes that 12 of the 14 lines end with feminine rhymes. The movement between feminine and masculine endings, with the feminine endings receiving emphasis, enacts a longing on the part of the speaker for the young man to stay. Atkins adopts the view that the monotony of the feminine endings creates a somber tone of loss. Lines 2 and 4 are the only lines without feminine endings and they \\"ending as they do in pyrrhic feet, give the same elegiac effect\\".(Atkins, Carl D. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2007. 226. ) Beyond the frequent feminine endings, the meter is quite regular, but there are several significant cases in which, rather than the rhythm of the words determining the meter, the meter determines the rhythm of the words. This occurs especially in stretches of monosyllabic function words (like prepositions, conjunctions, and especially pronouns). The words at the beginning of line 5 could be emphasized in almost any combination and still deliver some sense; but when emphasized in accord with a regular meter, the reading \\"For how do I hold thee\\" underscores the antithetical rhetoric Shakespeare is known for. A similar effect can be heard in line 9's \\"thy own worth\\", and likely in line 13's \\"Thus have I had thee\\", emphasizing both the speaker's possession and its being past. == Legal and financial imagery == Critics commonly agree that Shakespeare uses legal imagery as a metaphor for the relationship between the speaker and the young man. Helen Vendler and Stephen Booth are of the same opinion that the legal terms of the sonnet frame the relationship between the speaker and the young man as a contract now void because of the beloved's realization of his greater worth. The relationship between the speaker and the young man is expressed in the language of legal and financial transaction: \\"possessing\\", \\"estimate\\", \\"charter\\", \\"bonds\\", \\"determinate\\", \\"riches\\", and \\"patent\\" ‚Äîalso \\"dear\\" and \\"worth\\" in the financial sense.(Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge and London: Belknap-Harvard University Press, 1997. 383. OCLC # 36806589) Booth, in addition to the above, understands hold and granting in a legal and financial sense as well.(Booth, Stephen, ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1977. 290. ). Michael Andrews acknowledges the metaphorical use of legal and financial imagery like Vendler and Booth. However he proposes further that the legal and financial imagery, along with a \\"coolly ironic\\" tone, disguises the speaker's true feelings which only fully appear in the couplet: \\"Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,/ In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\\" The couplet reveals that the speaker understands that the young man never fully gave himself.(Andrews, Michael Cameron. \\"Sincerity and Subterfuge in Three Shakespearean Sonnet Groups.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 33, No. 3. Folger Shakespeare Library (1982): 321. Web. 10 October 2009. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869735) In this interpretation the legal and financial imagery of the three quatrains are more self-protective than sincere. Murray Krieger offers a different view of the contract theory seen within Sonnet 87. In his analysis, he focuses his attention on the use of the word \\"dear\\" within the first line. He notes that the reader's initial deduction of the word \\"dear\\" implies the idea of affection. But this initial impression of the word on the reader is immediately confronted by the word \\"estimate\\", which essentially uncovers the reality of the speaker's lowly position to the young man. Kreiger furthermore notes that the legal and financial terms strongly imply the poet's bitterness towards his position: \\"at having love's world of troth reduced to the niggardly world of truth, the world of faith to the world of fact\\".(Kreiger, Murray. \\"Sonnet 87.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets and Poems. Ed. Harold Bloom. Broomall, PA : Chelsea House Publishers, 1999. 39. ) == Couplet == Though Vendler and Booth understand the legal imagery in a similar fashion, they differ in their understanding of the couplet. Vendler proposes that the couplet has a defective key word. Vendler identifies \\"gift\\" as the key word of the sonnet as \\"gift\\" and its variants \\"gives\\" and \\"gav'st\\" appear in all three quatrains in lines 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11. However, this key word is defective because it is absent in the couplet. Its absence in the couplet reflects the desertion of the \\"gift\\", the young man.(Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge and London: Belknap-Harvard University Press, 1997. 383. OCLC # 36806589) Booth understands the couplet to have sexual overtones. In the phrase, \\"I had thee as a dream\\" Booth suggests that \\"had\\" means \\"possessed sexually\\" or \\"embraced\\". Sexual dreams were a common Renaissance topic and Booth suggests that Shakespeare is playing on this usage. He cites Spenser's The Faerie Queene 1.1.47-49, Jonson's The Dream, Herrick's The Vine, Othello 3.3.416-432, and Gascoigne's Supposes, 1.2.133 as contemporary works that contain sexual dreams.(Booth, Stephen, ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1977. 291. ) Booth also proposes that \\"matter\\" in the closing line has a sexual meaning in addition to meaning \\"real substance\\". Here he cites examples of matter being used in its sexual sense in Hamlet 3.2.111: \\"country matter\\" and Julius Caesar 1.1.23: \\"women matters\\". Richard Strier additionally notes the complexity of the word \\"flatter\\" not only within Sonnet 87 but within other Shakespeare sonnets as well. While the word has been used \\"in contexts of purely negative self-deception\\" as well as \\"in the context of providing genuine beauty,\\" it is utilized within this poem as an \\"evocation of joy that is brief and delusive, but potent while it lasts\\".(Strier, Richard. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Michael Schoenfeldt. Malden: Blackwell, 2007. 84. ) The phrase \\"as a dream doth flatter\\" correlates strongly with the Petrarchan view that earthly joys are briefly. == Sexuality == Opening with the exclamation of \\"Farewell!\\" sonnet 87 reads very much like a break-up poem, which would suggest a romantic theme to it, and because of the sonnet's addressee, the suggestion turns into a homosexual romance. At the very least, Shakespeare thinks that he owes it to the youth to break up with him, due to what Pequigney calls \\"the narcissistic wound\\". Shakespeare's undermining of himself is proof of an apparent \\"wound to the ego\\".(Pequigney, Joseph. Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1996.) Sonnet 87 is filled with over the top, romantic language towards the young man, with lines such as \\"Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter\\". Yet when watered down, Pequigney argues that this simply states that Shakespeare is only acknowledging that he enjoyed knowing the young man. The use of romantic language masks the idea that this is purely a platonic love between the two males. In the sonnets addressed towards the young man, such as sonnet 87, there is a lack of explicit sexual imagery which is prominent in the sonnets addressed towards the dark lady. This, as Pequigney claims, is further proof \\"that nothing sexually amiss is to be found in the lyrics of that Shakespeare composed for the youth.\\" (Pequigney, Joseph. Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1996.) A. L. Rowse, another Shakespearean critic, also rejects the existence of homoerotic suggestion in sonnet 87, arguing that the language of the time is simply so far from how we communicate today. The language between two friends \\"might be considered sexually implicit\\" (Rowse, A. L. Sex and society in Shakespeare's age Simon Foreman the astrologer. New York: Scribner, 1974) in today's world, but hundreds of years earlier was simply friendly. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 87"},{"id":"12372651","text":"Sutton High School can refer to: *Sutton High School, London, girls' school in Sutton, London, United Kingdom *Sutton High School, Plymouth in Sutton, Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom *Sutton High School (Nebraska) in Sutton, Nebraska, United States *Sutton High School (Massachusetts) in Sutton, Massachusetts, United States *Sutton District High School in Sutton, Ontario, Canada Also: *Sutton High Sports College, former name of The Sutton Academy, in St Helens, Merseyside, United Kingdom ","title":"Sutton High School"},{"id":"12372653","text":"Scarthyla vigilans (Maracaibo Basin treefrog) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

It is found in Costa Rica, Panama, and adjacent northwestern Colombia. It is classed as Critically Endangered and threatened by the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. == Habitat == Agalychnis lemur lives in tropical mid-elevation pre-montane rainforest between 440 and 1600 metres ASL. Costa Rica is currently host to three sites in which this species resides. They are Fila Asuncion (an abandoned farm 15 km southwest of Lim√≥n); a forested area near Parque National Barbilla; and Guayac√°n in Lim√≥n Province. Of these three locations Fila Asuncion is the only one known to have a large breeding population. == Biology ==  Morpological characteristics  During the day the Lemur Leaf Frog is a vibrant green but changes to brown at night. This characteristic enhances its ability to camouflage in the day and hunt at night. The Lemur Leaf Frog is a slender species. It has no inter- digital webbing on the front or hind feet. In the past its lack of webbing suggested it belonged in the genus Phyllomedusa. However, recent analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences has shown the species was found to genetically closer to species of the genus Agalychnis to which it now belongs This species also displays sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than males. Adult females range approximately from 40-45mm in length by 15-20mm in length across the abdomen in resting position, while males range from approximately 30-35mm in length by 10-15mm in length across the abdomen. Females on average weigh roughly 4 grams, with males weighing in at half that weight.  Activities  The lemur leaf frog is mainly nocturnal, resting on the undersides of leaves during the day.  Diet  Details of the specific diet of Agalychnis lemur have not been reported but is primarily a wide variety of insects.  Reproduction   Breeding  Agalychnis lemur participate in \\"prolonged breeding\\" that takes place continuously during the rainy seasons, primarily observed during spring or summer. These species engage in the ritual calling. The male lemur frog intones a series of clicks to call to the female.  Eggs  Agalychnis lemur produces up to 20 eggs at a time. They are usually deposited under resting leaves overhanging a water supply. These eggs are blueish green or grey encased in the typical jelly mass. Agalychnis lemur lays eggs terrestrially, on vegetation or roots overhanging water. When the eggs hatch the tadpoles drop into the small pools of water below. Depending on the temperature, food, and water supply tadpoles will usually drop into the water at around 7 days and the metamorphosis, 90‚Äì150 days.  Hatching  The tadpoles can prematurely hatch when there is danger that could be eaten by predators. Vibration from predators or rain cause the tadpoles to hatch prematurely, in order to escape attack or hatch when they can be washed into water below.  Tadpoles  Preserved tadpoles are bluish-gray with an opaque body while the dorsal and ventral fins are transparent. However, in life their overall color is greenish gray with a white abdomen. Tadpoles on earlier stages are smaller, slender, and less pigmented, and some even show an evident dark stripe between the eyes and nostrils.Brand√£o, RA, √Ålvares, GFR, Crema, A, Zerbini, GC. (23 March 2009). Natural History of Phyllomedusa centralis (Anura: Hylidae: Phyllomedusinae): Tadpole and Calls. South American Journal of Herpetology 4 (1): 61-8. == Population == Although Agalychnis lemur was once considered a common species in Costa Rica it has declined. With more than an 80% decrease in population in a period of 10 years it is now closely being monitored in Panama where it is still abundant in the lower elevations of central and eastern parts of the country. However, there have been no further reports on the populations of these lemur frogs endemic to Columbia. Due to their marked drop in population these species of lemurs has been listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 2004. Related causes that may be linked to the disappearance of these frogs are chytridiomycosis (a disease affecting only amphibians contacting with zoospores of the Chytrid fungus) and general loss of habitat from deforestation. == Resistance to Chytridiomycosis == Chytrid fungus has been plaguing amphibians globally resulting in a number of amphibian extinctions. Researchers are currently using non-invasive imaging technology to better understand how a specific species of tree frogs in Central America are proving resilience to this fungus. Scientist are attributing tree frog's ability to withstand the deadly fungus to their unusual skin which allows the frogs to bask in the hot sunlight boosting their temperatures adequately enough to kill off the fungus. While typically a frog's long exposure to sunlight would dry out its skin, this species of tree frogs in Costa Rica thrive under the high temperature conditions. Scientists believe these tree frogs are able to thrive under these harsh conditions, which normally negatively affect frogs because of their skins ability to reflect the sunlight, regulating their core temperature, yet maintaining enough heat to kill off the chytrid fungus. The antimicrobial skin peptides in the skin of Agalychnis lemur have shown to be a strong preventative measure for chytrid fungus, in particular Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. In 2004 a sample of peptides from nine different adult amphibians in Omar Torrijos National Park, Panama were taken to test for susceptibility to Chytridiomycosis. Of the 9 species test the A. lemur ranked third in immunologic resistance with a mean of 15% in inhibition of pathogen growth and peptide renewal. The strongest (Xenopus Laevis) had a mean of 65% more than four times that of the A. lemur. Although A. Lemur shows some resiliance to chytridiomycosis it is not completely immune. In a different study following that, it was predicted that this species could survive chytridiomycosis because they contained dermaseptin-L1 and phylloseptin-L1 peptides which contained resistance to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. While there has been survivors, the appearance of chytridiomycosis still caused population decline despite their antimicrobial skin peptides. This shows that in-vitro studies may not represent what actually happens in living organisms. By taking skin secretions of Agalychnis lemur, scientists tested to conclude that the skin peptides contained phylloseptin-L1 and dermaseptinL1 with cytolytic activities in order to combat bacteria and fungus. For these reasons, at Omar Torrijos National Park, it was predicated that the species would be able to survive the appearance of chytridiomycosis. While there have been survivors, a large population decrease was caused from Chytridiomycosis despite the anti-fungi properties of their skin peptides. This shows that the results that are taken in a study may be different than what happens in real life. Reference required == Conservation == In Costa Rica, lemur leaf frogs are currently only found in two remaining locations. Genetic testing of the mitochondrial DNA of the Costa Rican lemur leaf frog populations show that those frogs are distinct from the Panamanian frogs. This highlighted the need for the separate conservation of the Costa Rican populations. The first in situ conservation effort for the lemur leaf frog was started in 2003. The in-situ aspect of the project was carried out by the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center, consisting of introducing tadpoles to artificial ponds every year, gradually increasing the wild population of the frogs inside of the reserve. The project has been so successful that the frogs are spreading out from the center. It was first successfully breeding ex-situ for the Costa Rican frogs was at Manchester Museum's Vivarium https://frogblogmanchester.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/prk.pdf where an official conservation project for the Costa Rican population was established (Project Lemur FrogProject Lemur Frog: https://lemurfrog.org) was established in 1999. Work at Manchester Museum with the species has involved supporting them in Costa Rica, highlighting the species' plight to the public <, DNA research work to genetically fingerprint the species which allowed for the creation of an official studbook for this species. Manchester University has also developed a global environmental education programme based on the species that extends to the countries of origin. The Atlanta Botanical Garden and El Valle, Panama have also bred the Panamanian form of the species in captivity and been highly successful. == Problems and successes associated with conservation efforts == Given that the population of Agalychnis lemur is on the decline in Central America, there are now clear efforts in place to help conserve the species. The conservation effort at the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center (EVACC) in El Valle de Ant√≥n, Panama provides in-country ex-situ support for amphibians that have the greatest potential risk of extinction from chytridiomycosis. A. lemur falls into this category and is being supported at El Valle. During 2006-2007, the water ‚Äì through means of filtration from tap sources ‚Äì in which they were living turned out to be soft and acidic. Ultraviolet B spectrum lighting was provided on all tanks for two hours daily via modified halogen bulbs. From 2006-2008, their diet consisted of wild caught invertebrates, including: katydids, termites, fruit flies, and isopods. In the necropsy, of A. lemur that had died after 90 days, the Captive-Bred Juveniles (CBJ), (ones that included animals resulting from captive breeding) were compared with wild‚Äêcaught Long-Term Residents (LTR). The results showed that the cause of death for the A. lemur at EVACC was through poor nutritional condition and osteodystrophy, with a very small number contracting lungworm infection and squamous metaplasia.Pessier, AP, et al. (2014). Causes of Mortality in Anuran Amphibians From An Ex Situ Survival Assurance Colony in Panama. Zoo Biology 33 (6): 516-26. A stumbling block to the conservation of Agalychnis lemur at El Valle in Panama has been its tendency to develop a vitamin A defiency when given insect-based diets in captivity. Lesions develop shortly after the vitamin A deficiency comes into effect. The tongue of Agalychnis lemur is prominently affected by squamous metaplasia. Other associated problems occur elsewhere, such as in the oral and nasal cavities, the esophagus, stomach, reproductive tract and bladder. Further research is required to evaluate these problems. At Manchester Museum and Bristol Zoo in the UK, and Nordens Ark in Sweden, they have successfully established a genetically diverse and healthy 'safety net' population of Costa Rican Lemur Leaf Frogs. A studbook has now been established and healthy animals are being bred and maintained within the programme as a back up to the wild populations in Costa Rica. This success, together with the In-situ conservation work being carried out has hopefully secured Costa Rican populations of the species for the future. ==References== *Morelle, Rebecca. \\"Sun-loving Frogs Aid Fungus Fight.\\" BBC News.

It is primarily located along a one-mile stretch of the Hunton Road, a minor road approximately 2 miles NNW of Marden, with the heart of the village centred upon a square created by Hunton Road and Dairy Lane. The main part of the village lies just below a ridge line, to the south of the River Beult floodplain. The precise age of the village is uncertain. However, Chainhurst Manor, which sits on top of the ridge and is located directly opposite the northern end of Dairy Lane, is at least 400 years old and documentary evidence shows that Chainhurst has appeared on maps at least since the 18th century. Local Industry Historically, local industry was primarily agricultural with many of the former residents working for one or other of the major farms located in the immediate area. Traditional farming activities included fruit and arable farming, with extensive hop gardens, as evidenced by the oasts of The Roundels and Reed Court Farm, on Hunton Road and those at Whitehurst and adjacent to Platt House, which are both found on Dairy Lane. There is also a compound of \\"Hoppers Huts\\", located south of the bridge over the Beult, which provided accommodation for seasonal workers who came to the area to help with the annual harvest. In recent generations, these activities have been displaced. With the steadily increasing mechanisation of farming since the second world war, labourers who worked for the local farms were no longer required and forced to move out of their tied accommodation into local council accommodation. During this period, an influx of new villagers who either work in Maidstone, seven miles to the north, or in London; accessible via the train service from Marden, have arrived changing the complexion and make up of the village. In consequence, it is fair to describe the village now as a dormitory location. Amenities As is common with many small rural villages and hamlets, Chainhurst has suffered from a loss of amenities; losing its principal focal points, the Pig & Whistle (formerly The Royal Oak) public house and the Bull Inn (close to Stonewall Farm) over a decade ago. In consequence, non-drivers within the community are dependent upon the local bus service (to Maidstone and Marden) and a fortnightly visit by the Kent Mobile Library. At one time, Chainhurst had its own school (now \\"The Old School House\\") located on the corner of Hunton Road and Dairy Lane. Primary schooling was taken over by the school in the village of Marden itself, with secondary schooling being provided by any one of a number of schools in Maidstone or Tonbridge. Sporting Venue In recent years, the land surrounding Chainhurst, and Reed Court Farm in particular, has been the venue for Cyclo-Cross and it is now an annual fixture on the London League calendar. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Villages in Kent ","title":"Chainhurst"},{"id":"12372743","text":"The La Loma tree frog (Hyloscirtus colymba) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae found in Costa Rica, Panama, and expected but not confirmed in Colombia.

Adult males have a creamy colored mental gland on the chin, a pale bluish-green throat and a single gular sac, and no nuptial pads. It can be distinguished morphologically from Hyloscirtus palmeri, which lacks the eye stripe, and from Isthmohyla angustilineata, which has a stripe continuing to the groin area and no finger webbing.Savage, J. (2002) Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica, University of Chicago Press ==Larvae== Tadpoles are large and bronze colored, with large, irregular gold flecks, and can grow up to 37 mm long, and metamorphs are 17‚Äì19 mm. Larvae are well-equipped for grazing, with an inferior oral disc consisting of a beak and 6-7/7-10 denticle rows. They tend to live in fast-flowing streams in rock piles, and are nocturnal. ==Breeding== Males make high-pitched cricket-like chirps from beneath rocks and plants near swift-flowing streams, and stop calling at the slightest disturbance, making them very difficult to catch. Field observations from Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project operations in Cerro Brewster found the males were unusually prominent when sick with chytridiomycosis.http://www.amphibianrescue.org (2010)Press release: Panama amphibian rescue challenged by rapid spread of chytrid fungus ==Conservation== Where extant, these frogs are probably more abundant than people realize, because of their highly secretive behavior. However, H. colymba adults have completely disappeared from stream sites in western Panama due to chytridiomycosis. Tadpoles are also susceptible, exhibiting loss of keratinized mouthparts when infected. Because they have now disappeared from much of their western chytridiomycosis-infected range, these frogs were ranked as high priority for ex situ conservation in an amphibian ark assessment.Amphibian Ark (2008) Species Prioritization, Panama.

The factory began construction in 1940 and was completed within a year, producing its first weapons by January 1941. The site employed around 2,000 people during the war in the manufacture of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons; one of the main weapons built at the factory was the Bofors 40 mm gun. Laura Knight's wartime painting Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring was created at the site, with factory worker Ruby Loftus being the subject. ==History== The Newport Royal Ordnance Factory began construction in April 1940 on the empty site of a former allotment site near Corporation Road, Newport. The site was designated Royal Ordnance Factory No. 11 officially but became commonly known as ROF Newport. On 7 November that year, the factory was opened by Sir Charles Northrup McLaren, the Director General of Ordnance Factories. Upon its opening, 120 women applied for roles at the factory with 75 eventually being hired. The workers were also provided with new homes that had been specifically built for the factory workers. The workers underwent a year of basic training. Less than a year after construction began, production of the first gun at the factory was completed in January 1941. Under the Lend-Lease initiative created by the United States to supply Allied nations with support during wartime, machines used to build weapons were delivered to ROF Newport to begin production. One of the main weapons built at the factory was the Bofors 40 mm gun. Staff at the site worked ten hour shifts, alternating fortnightly between day and nights shifts, with a one-hour break for meals. The factory grounds also had its own vegetable patch, while pigs and hens were also kept to provide the workers with fresh meat and eggs. The workers also set up several sports clubs amongst themselves. Between 1941 and 1945, the factory employed around 2,000 men and women. After the war, the site was decommissioned and taken over by Standard Telephones and Cables. The building was later demolished. ==In popular culture== The wartime painting Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring by Laura Knight was created at ROF Newport. The work features a munitions worker named Ruby Loftus working on a Bofors breech, used in the creation of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. When the site was redeveloped in the 21st century, part of the new housing estate was named after Loftus. The factory was also used to make the 1942 Paul Rotha film Nightshift that was screened around Britain. In 2015, an animated film based on the workers of the site was made and showcased at several international film festivals. Entitled, Newport Gun Girls, it was financed by money donated by the National Lottery. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Newport, Wales Newport Category:History of Newport, Wales Newport Category:1941 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1945 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"ROF Newport"},{"id":"12372751","text":"Gustavo Arellano is an American writer.

It is endemic to Ecuador and only known from the vicinity of its type locality in the Tapichalaca Biological Reserve, Zamora-Chinchipe Province. It is named after the type locality, which is a reserve owned by the Fundaci√≥n de Conservaci√≥n Jocotoco. Hyloscirtus tapichalaca belongs to the Hyloscirtus larinopygion group, although its placement with the group is uncertain; it may be the sister taxon of all other species in the group. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body and the limbs are robust. The snout is nearly truncate in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct, and the supratympanic fold is thick, obscuring its posterodorsal edge. The fingers and the toes are broad, bear large discs, and have webbing. The dorsum is gray to pale brown, and the flanks are gray to gray brown. The digital discs, lateral and lower margins of vent, knees, elbows, and outer margin of forearms are white. The iris is yellow-gold. Males have a single subgular vocal sac. ==Reproduction== The male advertisement call consists of a single, unpulsed note of variable duration (0.14‚Äì0.19 seconds). The calls are emitted at irregular time intervals (0.7‚Äì1.2 seconds apart), most of them clustered in bouts. Scars in the males suggest male-male combats. A 62-mm female contained 428 ovarian eggs some in diameter. The tadpoles probably develop in streams. ==Behavior== Hyloscirtus tapichalaca exude a sticky, white fluid when captured. One specimen assumed a posture where the white markings in the posterior surfaces of the elbows, heels, and vent were exposed. This is likely an anti-predator behavior. ==Habitat and conservation== The type locality is a small cascading stream in montane cloud forest. There are records from elevations of above sea level. Males have been observed calling from branches by stream margins. Threats to this species are unknown. The type locality is a protected area. Habitat degradation likely occurs outside the reserve. ==References== Category:Hyloscirtus Category:Endemic fauna of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians described in 2003 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyloscirtus tapichalaca"},{"id":"12372817","text":"The El Pepino tree frog (Hyloscirtus torrenticola) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae found in Colombia and Ecuador.

She served in the Pacific Ocean and was awarded six battle stars, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Presidential Unit Citation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve in 1946. In August 1962, the former Sentry was transferred to South Vietnam as RVNS Ky Hoa (HQ-09) in the Republic of Vietnam Navy. Her fate after 1962 is unreported in secondary sources. == U.S. Navy career == Sentry was laid down on 16 May 1943 by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington; launched on 15 August 1943 sponsored by Miss Nanette L. Pratt, and commissioned on 30 May 1944, Lt. Thomas R. Fonick in command. After shakedown, Sentry sailed from San Francisco, California, on 28 August 1944 and joined the U.S. 7th Fleet at Manus on 6 October for the Leyte invasion. She arrived off the Leyte beaches on 17 October and carried out a three-day pre-invasion sweep. She continued sweeping during and after the initial landings on 20 October until joining the transports on 24 October to provide antiaircraft support. Sentry remained in Leyte Gulf for the next six weeks then participated in most of the subsequent landings in the Philippines. With her division, Mine Division 34 she carried out pre-invasion sweeps at Ormoc Bay on 6 December 1944, Mindoro Island on 14 December Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945, and Zambales and Subic Bay on 29‚Äì31 January. For all but the Ormoc landings, she remained on the scene after the initial troop landings, helping extend the mineswept areas and providing antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection to the transports. Many mines were encountered, and kamikaze resistance was intense, and the ships saw much antiaircraft action. On 13 February, Sentry and her division began pre- invasion sweeps in Manila Bay in preparation for the landings at Mariveles and Corregidor. While sweeping off Corregidor on the 14th, the minesweepers came within 5,000 yards of the island and were repeatedly straddled by Japanese fire before supporting ships silenced the enemy's guns. Sentry continued sweeping in Manila Bay through 19 February, and her division earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the operation. During the next two and one-half months, Sentry carried out various local sweeps in support of mop-up operations in the Philippines, the most notable being a pre-assault sweep for the landings at Legaspi, Luzon on 1 April, and an 8-day sweep in the Sulu Sea off Palawan beginning on 22 April. On 9 May, the ship arrived at Morotai to prepare for operations in the Netherlands East Indies. Between 7 and 18 June, Sentry supported the landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo; and, between 22 June and 15 July, she helped clear the way for the assault at Balikpapan. During both operations, the minesweepers came under fire from shore batteries; and one ship, , was sunk by a mine on 8 June. Sentry's task unit received a Presidential Unit Citation for its service off Borneo between 15 June and 1 July 1945. After overhaul at Subic Bay, Sentry departed the Philippines on 8 September and arrived at Sasebo Japan, on 20 October, having accepted the surrender of the Japanese army garrison of Shan Zaki in the Ryukyus while en route. In the following weeks, she swept Japanese minefields in the Ryukyus, the Tsushima Strait, and the Van Diemen Strait. She sailed from Sasebo on 9 December for the United States. Arriving at Orange, Texas, on 2 April 1946, she was decommissioned there on 19 June 1946 and placed in reserve. In addition to her six battle stars for World War II service, Sentry was also awarded a Navy Unit Commendation and a Presidential Unit Citation. While she remained in reserve, Sentrys classification was changed to MSF-299, effective 7 February 1955. Sentry was struck from the Navy list on 1 February 1962 and transferred to South Vietnam on 31 August 1962. == Republic of Vietnam Navy career == The former Sentry was transferred to South Vietnam's navy, the Republic of Vietnam Navy, on 31 August 1962 as RVNS Ky Hoa (HQ-09).

It is found in most parts of the Amazon Basin, except in the southeast and the Guianas. Colombian, Venezuelan, and Surinamese records need confirmation. ==Taxonomy== This species was originally described by Franz Hermann Troschel as Hyla calcarata in 1848. After Edward Drinker Cope transferred it to the genus Hypsiboas as Hypsiboas calcaratus in 1867, it was variously recognized with either name until Faivovich and colleagues validated Hypsiboas in 2005. However, in 2017 showed that Hypsiboas was a junior synonym of Boana, the latter then being the valid name. Many sources, however, still use the old name. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The fingers have only basal webbing while the toes are webbed. Males have pre-pollical spines. The dorsal coloration varies from light brown to reddish brown or brown. There is a dark brown middorsal line, and some specimens have brown diffuse transversal bands. The limbs bear pale brown transversal bars dorsally. Scattered minute white and black dots, or large dark brown blotches, might be present on the dorsum. The flanks are white, light blue or blue and have dark brown vertical bars. The venter is creamy white and the belly is yellowish white. ==Habitat and conservation== This species occurs in tropical rainforest at elevations up to above sea level, but mostly below . It is an arboreal frog. During the rainy season, adults can be seen perched on stems and small branches above slow-moving streams. The eggs are deposited in water where the larvae will then develop. Habitat loss associated with forest conversion, logging, clear cutting, and fire is a threat to this species. However, it is abundant in parts of its range, is present in protected areas, and is not threatened overall. 250px ==References== calcarata Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Taxa named by Franz Hermann Troschel Category:Amphibians described in 1848 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Troschel's tree frog"},{"id":"12372899","text":"Logo of the National Electronic Distributors Association The National Electronic Distributors Association (NEDA) was a trade association in the United States of manufacturers and distributors.National Electronic Distributors Association  The Voice of Authorized Distribution The association cooperates in standardization of names for components, such as batteries.NEDA Roundtables NEDA is often cited by American manufacturers, along with ANSI, for names of components.

The HBM was developed in the 1950s by social psychologists at the U.S. Public Health Service and remains one of the best known and most widely used theories in health behavior research. The HBM suggests that people's beliefs about health problems, perceived benefits of action and barriers to action, and self-efficacy explain engagement (or lack of engagement) in health-promoting behavior. A stimulus, or cue to action, must also be present in order to trigger the health- promoting behavior. The health belief model ==History== One of the first theories of health behavior, the HBM was developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Irwin M. Rosenstock, Godfrey M. Hochbaum, S. Stephen Kegeles, and Howard Leventhal at the U.S. Public Health Service. At that time, researchers and health practitioners were worried because few people were getting screened for tuberculosis(TB), even if mobile X-ray cars went to neighborhoods. The HBM has been applied to predict a wide variety of health- related behaviors such as being screened for the early detection of asymptomatic diseases and receiving immunizations. More recently, the model has been applied to understand patients' responses to symptoms of disease, compliance with medical regimens, lifestyle behaviors (e.g., sexual risk behaviors), and behaviors related to chronic illnesses, which may require long-term behavior maintenance in addition to initial behavior change. Amendments to the model were made as late as 1988 to incorporate emerging evidence within the field of psychology about the role of self-efficacy in decision-making and behavior. ==Theoretical constructs== The HBM theoretical constructs originate from theories in Cognitive Psychology. In early twentieth century, cognitive theorists believed that reinforcements operated by affecting expectations rather than by affecting behavior straightly.Lewin, K. (1951). The nature of field theory. In M. H. Marx (Ed.), Psychological theory: Contemporary readings. New York: Macmillan. Mental processes are severe constitutes of cognitive theories that are seen as expectancy-value models, because they propose that behavior is a function of the degree to which people value a result and their evaluation of the expectation, that a certain action will lead that result.Lewin, K., Dembo, T., Festinger, L., & Sears, P. S. (1944). Level of aspiration. In J. Hunt (Ed.), Personality and the behavior disorders (pp. 333‚Äì378). Somerset, NJ: Ronald Press. In terms of the health- related behaviors, the value is avoiding sickness. The expectation is that a certain health action could prevent the condition for which people consider they might be at risk. The following constructs of the HBM are proposed to vary between individuals and predict engagement in health-related behaviors. Perceived susceptibility Perceived susceptibility refers to subjective assessment of risk of developing a health problem. The HBM predicts that individuals who perceive that they are susceptible to a particular health problem will engage in behaviors to reduce their risk of developing the health problem. Individuals with low perceived susceptibility may deny that they are at risk for contracting a particular illness. Others may acknowledge the possibility that they could develop the illness, but believe it is unlikely. Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing an illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy, or risky, behaviors. Individuals who perceive a high risk that they will be personally affected by a particular health problem are more likely to engage in behaviors to decrease their risk of developing the condition. The combination of perceived severity and perceived susceptibility is referred to as perceived threat. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility to a given health condition depend on knowledge about the condition. The HBM predicts that higher perceived threat leads to a higher likelihood of engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Perceived severity Perceived severity refers to the subjective assessment of the severity of a health problem and its potential consequences. The HBM proposes that individuals who perceive a given health problem as serious are more likely to engage in behaviors to prevent the health problem from occurring (or reduce its severity). Perceived seriousness encompasses beliefs about the disease itself (e.g., whether it is life-threatening or may cause disability or pain) as well as broader impacts of the disease on functioning in work and social roles. For instance, an individual may perceive that influenza is not medically serious, but if he or she perceives that there would be serious financial consequences as a result of being absent from work for several days, then he or she may perceive influenza to be a particularly serious condition. Perceived benefits Health-related behaviors are also influenced by the perceived benefits of taking action. Perceived benefits refer to an individual's assessment of the value or efficacy of engaging in a health- promoting behavior to decrease risk of disease. If an individual believes that a particular action will reduce susceptibility to a health problem or decrease its seriousness, then he or she is likely to engage in that behavior regardless of objective facts regarding the effectiveness of the action. For example, individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen prevents skin cancer are more likely to wear sunscreen than individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen will not prevent the occurrence of skin cancer. Perceived barriers Health-related behaviors are also a function of perceived barriers to taking action. Perceived barriers refer to an individual's assessment of the obstacles to behavior change. Even if an individual perceives a health condition as threatening and believes that a particular action will effectively reduce the threat, barriers may prevent engagement in the health- promoting behavior. In other words, the perceived benefits must outweigh the perceived barriers in order for behavior change to occur. Perceived barriers to taking action include the perceived inconvenience, expense, danger (e.g., side effects of a medical procedure) and discomfort (e.g., pain, emotional upset) involved in engaging in the behavior. For instance, lack of access to affordable health care and the perception that a flu vaccine shot will cause significant pain may act as barriers to receiving the flu vaccine. In a study about the breast and cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women, perceived barriers, like fear of cancer, embarrassment, fatalistic views of cancer and language, was proved to impede screening.Austin, Latoya T et al. ‚ÄúBreast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Hispanic Women: a Literature Review Using the Health Belief Model.‚Äù Women‚Äôs Health Issues 12.3 (2002): 122‚Äì128. Web. Modifying variables Individual characteristics, including demographic, psychosocial, and structural variables, can affect perceptions (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers) of health- related behaviors. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, among others. Psychosocial variables include personality, social class, and peer and reference group pressure, among others. Structural variables include knowledge about a given disease and prior contact with the disease, among other factors. The HBM suggests that modifying variables affect health-related behaviors indirectly by affecting perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers. Cues to action The HBM posits that a cue, or trigger, is necessary for prompting engagement in health- promoting behaviors. Cues to action can be internal or external. Physiological cues (e.g., pain, symptoms) are an example of internal cues to action. External cues include events or information from close others, the media, or health care providers promoting engagement in health-related behaviors. Examples of cues to action include a reminder postcard from a dentist, the illness of a friend or family member, and product health warning labels. The intensity of cues needed to prompt action varies between individuals by perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers. For example, individuals who believe they are at high risk for a serious illness and who have an established relationship with a primary care doctor may be easily persuaded to get screened for the illness after seeing a public service announcement, whereas individuals who believe they are at low risk for the same illness and also do not have reliable access to health care may require more intense external cues in order to get screened. Self-efficacy Self- efficacy was added to the four components of the HBM (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers) in 1988. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's perception of his or her competence to successfully perform a behavior. Self-efficacy was added to the HBM in an attempt to better explain individual differences in health behaviors. The model was originally developed in order to explain engagement in one-time health-related behaviors such as being screened for cancer or receiving an immunization. Eventually, the HBM was applied to more substantial, long-term behavior change such as diet modification, exercise, and smoking. Developers of the model recognized that confidence in one's ability to effect change in outcomes (i.e., self- efficacy) was a key component of health behavior change. For example, Schmiege et al. found that when dealing with calcium consumption and weight-bearing exercises, self-efficacy was a more powerful predictors than beliefs about future negative health outcomes.Schmiege, S.J., Aiken, L.S., Sander, J.L. and Gerend, M.A. (2007) Osteoporosis prevention among young women: psychological models of calcium consumption and weight bearing exercise, Health Psychology, 26, 577‚Äì87. Rosenstock et al. argued that self-efficacy could be added to the other HBM constructs without elaboration of the model's theoretical structure. However, this was considered short-sighted because related studies indicated that key HBM constructs have indirect effects on behavior as a result of their effect on perceived control and intention, which might be regarded as more proximal factors of action.Abraham, Charles, and Sheeran, Paschal. ‚ÄúThe Health Belief Model.‚Äù Cambridge Handbook of Psychology, Health and Medicine. Cambridge University Press, 2001. 97‚Äì102. Web. ==Empirical support== The HBM has gained substantial empirical support since its development in the 1950s. It remains one of the most widely used and well-tested models for explaining and predicting health-related behavior. A 1984 review of 18 prospective and 28 retrospective studies suggests that the evidence for each component of the HBMl is strong. The review reports that empirical support for the HBM is particularly notable given the diverse populations, health conditions, and health-related behaviors examined and the various study designs and assessment strategies used to evaluate the model. A more recent meta-analysis found strong support for perceived benefits and perceived barriers predicting health-related behaviors, but weak evidence for the predictive power of perceived seriousness and perceived susceptibility. The authors of the meta- analysis suggest that examination of potential moderated and mediated relationships between components of the model is warranted. Several studies have provided empirical support from the chronic illness perspective. Becker et al. used the model to predict and explain a mother‚Äôs adherence to a diet prescribed for their obese children.Becker, Marshall et al. ‚ÄúThe Health Belief Model and Prediction of Dietary Compliance: A Field Experiment.‚Äù Journal of Health and Social Behavior 18.4 (1977): 348‚Äì366. Web. Cerkoney et al. interviewed insulin-treated diabetic individuals after diabetic classes at a community hospital. It empirically tested the HBM's association with the compliance levels of persons chronically ill with diabetes mellitus.Cerkoney, K A, Hart, L K, and Cerkoney, K A. ‚ÄúThe Relationship Between the Health Belief Model and Compliance of Persons with Diabetes Mellitus.‚Äù Diabetes care 3.5 (1980): 594‚Äì598. Web. ==Applications== The HBM has been used to develop effective interventions to change health-related behaviors by targeting various aspects of the model's key constructs. Interventions based on the HBM may aim to increase perceived susceptibility to and perceived seriousness of a health condition by providing education about prevalence and incidence of disease, individualized estimates of risk, and information about the consequences of disease (e.g., medical, financial, and social consequences). Interventions may also aim to alter the cost-benefit analysis of engaging in a health-promoting behavior (i.e., increasing perceived benefits and decreasing perceived barriers) by providing information about the efficacy of various behaviors to reduce risk of disease, identifying common perceived barriers, providing incentives to engage in health-promoting behaviors, and engaging social support or other resources to encourage health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, interventions based on the HBM may provide cues to action to remind and encourage individuals to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Interventions may also aim to boost self-efficacy by providing training in specific health-promoting behaviors, particularly for complex lifestyle changes (e.g., changing diet or physical activity, adhering to a complicated medication regimen). Interventions can be aimed at the individual level (i.e., working one-on-one with individuals to increase engagement in health-related behaviors) or the societal level (e.g., through legislation, changes to the physical environment). ==Limitations== The HBM attempts to predict health- related behaviors by accounting for individual differences in beliefs and attitudes. However, it does not account for other factors that influence health behaviors. For instance, habitual health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, seatbelt buckling) may become relatively independent of conscious health-related decision making processes. Additionally, individuals engage in some health-related behaviors for reasons unrelated to health (e.g., exercising for aesthetic reasons). Environmental factors outside an individual's control may prevent engagement in desired behaviors. For example, an individual living in a dangerous neighborhood may be unable to go for a jog outdoors due to safety concerns. Furthermore, the HBM does not consider the impact of emotions on health-related behavior. Evidence suggests that fear may be a key factor in predicting health-related behavior. Alternative factors may predict health behavior, such as outcome expectancy (i.e., whether the person feels they will be healthier as a result of their behavior) and self-efficacy (i.e., the person‚Äôs belief in their ability to carry out preventive behavior). The theoretical constructs that constitute the HBM are broadly defined. Furthermore, the HBM does not specify how constructs of the model interact with one another. Therefore, different operationalizations of the theoretical constructs may not be strictly comparable across studies. Research assessing the contribution of cues to action in predicting health-related behaviors is limited. Cues to action are often difficult to assess, limiting research in this area. For instance, individuals may not accurately report cues that prompted behavior change. Cues such as a public service announcement on television or on a billboard may be fleeting and individuals may not be aware of their significance in prompting them to engage in a health-related behavior. Interpersonal influences are also particularly difficult to measure as cues. Scholars extend the HBM by adding four more variables (self-identity, perceived importance, consideration of future consequences and concern for appearance as possible determinants of healthy behavior). They prove that consideration of future consequences, self-identity, concern for appearance, perceived importance, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility are significant determinants of healthy eating behavior that can be manipulated by healthy eating intervention design.Orji, Rita, Vassileva, Julita, and Mandryk, Regan. ‚ÄúTowards an Effective Health Interventions Design: An Extension of the Health Belief Model.‚Äù Online journal of public health informatics 4.3 (2012): n. pag.

Among land-living vertebrates, it had only been confirmed earlier in certain parrots (as opposed to fish and invertebrates where relatively widespread). A few months later, fluorescence was discovered in the closely related Hypsiboas atlanticus, and in 2019 it was discovered in the distantly related pumpkin toadlet (Brachycephalus ephippium) and red pumpkin toadlet (B. pitanga). In 2020, it was confirmed that fluorescence is relatively widespread among frogs and other amphibians. When exposed to ultra-violet light, the skin of the polka-dot tree frog emits a bright green fluorescent glow. The discovery was made accidentally when the researchers checked the skin secretions of the frog under UV light. They expected only a faint red fluorescence, because the frog skin contains biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment responsible for its dull mottled browny-green colour. The surprising green fluorescence is attributed to hyloin compounds, mainly hyloin-L1, hyloin-L2 and hyloin-G1. These fluorescent molecules, in the dihydroisoquinolinone family and derived from the isoquinoline (a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring), in an alkaloid protecting mucous membrane, have been identified in the lymph tissue, skin and glandular secretions of the frog. Because it is linked to secretions from skin glands, they can also leave fluorescent markings on surfaces where they have been. The fluorescence intensity represents about 18‚àí29% of the luminosity under twilight conditions and is suspected to play a possible role in the communication, camouflage and mating of the frog. ==References== punctata Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1799 Category:Fluorescence Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Polka-dot tree frog"},{"id":"12373132","text":"The Chaco tree frog (Boana raniceps) is a frog species in the family Hylidae found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, and Venezuela.

Its name is a testimony to Mr. W. F. H. Rosenberg who collected the type series, and in English, to the aggressiveness of males of the species. ==Description== Males of B. rosenbergi measure on average in snout‚Äìvent length and females . It has partly webbed fingers and entirely webbed toes, and large disks in both fingers and toes. Its skin is granulated with small warts, and yellowish, greyish, or reddish in colour, with brown or blackish marbling or spots. ==Reproduction== Gladiator frogs are so named because of the aggressive nature of males. Female gladiator frogs only mate with males that provide a nest. Males can acquire a nest either by building one, using a suitable water-filled depression, or conquering another male's nest; the aggressive behaviour of males relates to the third strategy. The way of acquiring a nest depends on local conditions (availability of suitable sites for nest construction or suitable natural depressions) and may differ between populations. Thus, in some populations, males do not fight, possibly reflecting high abundance of suitable nests, and reduced risk of hostile take- overs. ==Habitat and conservation== B. rosenbergi inhabits primary and secondary forest, as well as in heavily altered areas such as small strips of trees in pastureland. It is considered an adaptable species that is not facing any significant threats. ==References== rosenbergi Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1898 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Rosenberg's tree frog"},{"id":"12373159","text":"The Valle tree frog (Boana rubracyla) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae found in Colombia and possibly Ecuador.

Published on 28 April 1949, it marked the birth of the modern Commonwealth. Drafted by the Indian statesman V. K. Krishna MenonBrecher cites the negotiations that led to the creation of the modern Commonwealth, Page 20 in Brecher‚Äôs India and World Politics: Krishna Menon‚Äôs View of the World, Oxford University Press, London 1968., the declaration had two main provisions: It allowed the Commonwealth to admit and retain members that were not Dominions, so including both republics and indigenous monarchies, and it changed the name of the organisation from the British Commonwealth to the Commonwealth of Nations, reflecting the first change.The Modern Commonwealth The Declaration recognised King George VI as Head of the Commonwealth. Following his death, the Commonwealth leaders recognised Queen Elizabeth II in that capacity. The former term included the device of terminology that would reflect both the developing political independence and the right of countries in the Commonwealth to be republics and the commonality of allegiance that was the cornerstone of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931. This proved to be a major stumbling block, until a compromise position was proposed by the Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, who planned a position of Head of the Commonwealth, separate but held by the same person as the monarch. The declaration stated vis-√†-vis India: This formula has since been deemed to be a sufficient precedent for all other countries. The issue had been discussed at the 1948 Prime Ministers Conference, the agenda of which was dominated by the imminent decisions of two states‚ÄîIndia and Ireland‚Äîto declare themselves republics. At the meeting, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru proposed a Ten Point Memorandum on the settlement between India and the Commonwealth. The Cabinet Committee on Commonwealth Relations recognised that Nehru's proposals could not constitute a basis for continued Commonwealth membership, and that a further conference would be required. On 16 May 1949, during the Constituent Assembly Debates for the framing of a republican constitution, Nehru declared in the house that: At the next conference, in April 1949, Nehru, seeking above all to avoid two-tiered membership, conceded a more agreeable three-point programme, based upon common Commonwealth citizenship, a declaration of India's continued membership, and recognition of the monarch in a separate capacity than that as monarch. This met general agreement, particularly with the new South African Prime Minister Daniel Fran√ßois Malan, and, over the next two days, the draft was crafted into a final agreement. To avoid criticisms about dropping the word British from the name of the Commonwealth, Nehru conceded a reference to the \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\" in the opening paragraph of the document as an historically-appropriate reference. King George VI was reticently in favour of the separation of the positions of king and Head of the Commonwealth, having met and liked Nehru, but was concerned with the practicalities. News of the agreement was hailed by all those on the opposition benches in the British House of Commons, including Winston Churchill and Clement Davies. By contrast, Jan Smuts, who had been defeated by Malan in the South African general election the previous year and was considered second only to Churchill as a Commonwealth statesman, was bitterly opposed. In the South African context, with which Smuts was mainly concerned, Republicanism was mainly identified with Afrikaner Conservatism and with tighter racial segregation Muller (1975), p. 508. The London conference - concerned mainly with India and to some degree with Ireland, which recently declared itself a Republic - did not pay much attention for the implications for South Africa. India became a republic in 1950 and remained in the Commonwealth. However, Ireland, which was in the same situation, having passed the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, declared itself a republic on 18 April 1949,The Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (Commencement) Order, 1949 ten days before the declaration, and therefore left the Commonwealth. ==See also== * Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria ==Footnotes== Category:History of the Commonwealth of Nations Category:India and the Commonwealth of Nations Category:1949 in law Category:1949 in India Category:1949 in London Category:1949 in the United Kingdom Category:1949 in international relations Category:1949 documents ","title":"London Declaration"},{"id":"12373176","text":"Boana semilineata is a species of frog in the family Hylidae that is endemic to Brazil.

Between 1991 and 1995, Griffin Music would become one of the largest independent record labels in the United States, releasing back catalog of many European classic rock artists such as Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, Mot√∂rhead, Denny Laine, Roy Harper, Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, Rick Wakeman, Fish, Mike Oldfield, Jethro Tull, Pete Best, The Quarry Men, Budgie, XTC, Nazareth, Hawkwind, Tangerine Dream, Steve Hillage, Status Quo, Strawbs, UFO, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band and dozens of others.Godwin Turns Fandom Into Business ‚Äì Billboard 1996Partial Catalog at Rate Your MusicPartial Catalog at Discogs.com In 1993, Griffin Music secured the license to manufacture and distribute a portion of the BBC in Concert series in North America. Later, Godwin and partner Neale Parker would form Griffin Video which would include many of the same bands' various concert videos. The biggest release by Griffin Music came in March 1995 when the label released the first in what was to have been a multi-album deal, David Bowie Santa Monica '72. The album shipped 25,000 units but was withdrawn after only four days. Despite Griffin paying a large advance for the Bowie catalog, the license was challenged and a lengthy litigation ensued. The remaining albums by David Bowie and John Mellencamp were never released. Griffin Music was bought in 1997 by Tango Music after filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On January 2nd 2020, Griffin Music was registered as Griffin Music Group in Canada under new ownership and management (Ryan Harvey-MacIntyre) and operates once again as a Canadian Independent Record label. ==References== Category:Canadian independent record labels Category:Defunct record labels of Canada Category:Record labels established in 1989 Category:Record labels disestablished in 1997 Category:1997 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"Griffin Music"},{"id":"12373230","text":"Isthmohyla insolita is a species of frogs in the family Hylidae.

R. Lancaster‚Äîand after whom the species is named. The species is very variable; however, high-altitude populations that were first ascribed to this species were in 1996 recognized as a new, distinct species, Isthmohyla calypsa. ==Description== Males grow to about and females to about in snout‚Äìvent length. The eyes are large and the snout is very short and blunt. The dorsum is mottled in shades of brown, green, and grey. The ventrum is greyish white and may have dark mottling, depending on locality. The thighs are either yellow with black barring or white with black spots, again depending on locality. The tadpoles are relatively large and have oval body with a long, muscular tail and short tail fins. Their color is brown, with some darker or green markings. ==Habitat and conservation== Isthmohyla lancasteri live in humid lowland and montane forests at elevations of above sea level. They also inhabit modified habitats where few trees remain (e.g., pastureland). The eggs are laid in pools within streams. This species is common in Costa Rica; its abundance in Panama is unknown.

The species was thought to already have become extinct, but in 2007, it was re-discovered in the Monteverde Cloud Forest of Costa Rica when a single male was found. In 2008, a gravid female and few males were spotted. The common name American Cinchona Plantation treefrog has been suggested for it. ==Description== Males grow to and females to in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is moderately short and acutely rounded. The tympanum is barely discernible. The fingers have large discs and are up to one-third webbed. The toes have discs that are slightly smaller than those on the fingers and are two-thirds webbed. The dorsal color varies from grey to light brown. Most specimens have a thin, dark line running through the eye. Other dark markings are variably present. The flanks are usually yellowish, but may in some individuals appear greenish or bluish.

They show sexual dimorphism, with females (mean snout-vent length ) being larger than males (). ==Reproduction== Reproduction takes place in temporary and permanent pools inside rainforest. It is an explosive breeder with a mean brood size of over 6000 eggs. Breeding is associated with intense vocalization by males. In addition to vocalization, male‚Äìmale interactions may involve grabbing and pushing and even direct physical combat. This kind of behaviour is more common in species where males are larger than females (see sexual selection in frogs). ==Trophic interactions== The diet consists mostly of arthropods (in particular grasshoppers and crickets), but also vertebrate remains (other frogs including Physalaemus crombiei and Scinax argyreornatus as well as unidentified bird feathers) can be found in their stomach contents. These frogs themselves may be preyed by colubrid snake Chironius bicarinatus. ==Habitat and conservation== Itapotihyla langsdorffii is an arboreal frog occurring on shrubs and trees inside rainforest.

It is endemic to Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitats are tropical moist montane forests, grasslands and streams. It was first described by the British biologist and herpetologist Arthur Loveridge in 1945 and is named in honour of the American ornithologist and explorer Rollo Beck who led the Whitney South Seas Expedition in the 1920s, collecting bird and other specimens from thousands of islands in the South Pacific. ==Description== Beck's tree frog is a fairly large tree frog with a snout-to-vent length of between . The head is about as wide as it is long, with small, widely separated nostrils and tympani (eardrums) somewhat smaller than the eyes. Both fingers and toes are long with the toes being webbed while the fingers have disced tips and are unwebbed, the third finger being the longest. The skin is rather coarse, especially on the head and eyelids, but in other parts of the body it is finer. The upper parts of head and body are brown or dark green, and the underparts are streaked with dark colour. ==Distribution and habitat== Beck's tree frog is endemic to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea. It was at first only known from the two highest mountains in the country, Mount Wilhelm in the Bismarck Range and Mount Giluwe in the Southern Highlands. Specimens have been found at altitudes of over . In 2007, a previously unknown population was discovered at an altitude of in the Kaijende Highlands in Enga Province. The typical habitat of this frog is mountain grassland including boggy areas with pools. It breeds in rapid mountain streams, the large eggs being stuck onto the underside of stones.

He was one of Britain's wealthiest people. ==Early life== Born to a British Brigadier General and a Canadian mother, Tim Landon attended Eastbourne College in Sussex. As a graduate of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, Landon was posted to the 10th Hussars. ==Time in Oman== With his regiment, he travelled overland from Europe to Arabia and arrived in Oman in the mid-1960s. He was sent there as part of a British military operation to help Sultan Said bin Taimur defeat the Soviet-backed Dhofar Rebellion. He was stationed in the south as an intelligence officer, but was transferred to Muscat. There he became an integral part of the British-aided coup to remove the old Sultan, whose style of rule ‚Äì which was all but preventing the country's modernisation ‚Äì was feeding the flames of the Dhofar insurgency that was poised to spread the length of Oman and threaten the Straits of Hormuz, and subsequently much of the West's oil supply. Landon, who was close to the Sultan's son Qaboos from his Sandhurst days, was allowed to visit his friend, although the Sultan had placed his son under house arrest. Convincing the son to oust his father from the throne was no easy task. The coup occurred on 23 July 1970, when Landon was twenty-seven. Said bin Taimur was confronted at his palace and told to sign over power to his son. The only confirmed casualty in this otherwise bloodless coup was the old Sultan's foot when he inadvertently shot himself. The deposed ruler was flown to London on an RAF transport aircraft. He ended up living in a suite at the Dorchester hotel until his death in 1972. When asked once what was his greatest regret, the old man replied: \\"Not having had Landon shot.\\" Daily Telegraph obituary 12 July 2007 Over the next fifteen years, the young officer helped his friends develop the Sultanate from a non- industrial, agrarian economy into a modern 20th-century state. Omani oil revenues enabled much of the country's advances and Landon became a leading advocate of \\"Omanisation\\" of the economy and government. ==Later projects== By 1979, Landon's position as an adviser had become a figurehead role. He returned to England, taking up a diplomatic post at the Omani embassy in London and establishing a home at Faccombe, a village near Andover in Hampshire. The title the \\"White Sultan\\" was regarded with bemusement by Landon, who maintained that Sultan Qaboos was very much in charge of Oman's destiny, and he was simply a servant and friend there to give advice. He continued to shuttle between London and Muscat until he died, his Boeing often seen arriving at or leaving Farnborough, the nearest airport to his home. ==Financial interests, philanthropy, and controversy== Landon invested the money he had made during his time in Oman, diversifying his wealth into mineral exploration and farming in Africa, property and real estate investments in Europe and America, and a wide range of financial portfolios in global markets. His fortune was estimated at US$750 million or higher. Landon was known to be a patron of the arts and society as well as an avid conservationist, generously assisting with fundraising for foundations and charities. Landon also played an important role as intermediary in several questionable deals like when giant telecom company Ericsson sold telecommunications equipment to Oman in the late 1990s. The connection was revealed by a joint investigation into Landon's business by the Swedish Public Television \\"Uppdrag granskning\\" and Swedish Public Radio's \\"Dagens Eko\\" in January 2007. Landon was also behind another questionable deal when in 1999 Swedish jetfighter Saab and UK defence giant BAE Systems offered millions of dollars in bribes to Czech politicians to buy the Gripen jet-fighter. The real beneficiary of the money paid out was the Austrian Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, a longtime agent for BAE and a relative of Landon through Landon's wife Katalina Esterhazy de Galantha.

The reasons behind its drastic decline are unclear, but the disease chytridiomycosis is suspected to have played a major role. No recorded sighting had been made since 1980, and the species was believed to be extinct. However, in late 2009 New South Wales Fisheries field scientist Luke Pearce located a surviving population of the frogs. Scientists acted quickly to establish a small \\"insurance\\" colony. Soon after, the wild colony was eradicated due to two consecutive floods and an outbreak of chytrid fungus.

He was born near Bertrand in southwest Michigan Territory and died on January 28, 1899 in Hartford, Michigan. Dubbed the \\"Red Man's Longfellow\\" by literary fans, Pokagon was often called the \\"Hereditary and Last Chief\\" of the tribe by the press. He was a son of his tribe's patriarch, Leopold Pokagon. ==Biography== Simon Pokagon was born to Potawatomi chief Leopold Pokagon and his wife. He claimed attendance at the University of Notre Dame and Oberlin College, but that has been challenged, as they have no record of his matriculation.Peyer, Bernd (2007). American Indian Nonfiction, p. 240. University of Oklahoma Press. . It is likely that he received education from the Sisters of St. Mary's Academy near Notre Dame and at the Twinsburg (Ohio) Institute. Some scholars have challenged his claims of fluency in four of the \\"classic\\" European languages.James Clifton, 1994. ==Career== Pokagon wrote several books and multiple shorter works. He is identified as one of the recognized Native American authors of the nineteenth century. Some have argued that his writings may have been substantially edited by the wife of his personal attorney, although that remains speculation and a matter of controversy among scholars. Pokagon was a featured speaker at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. While his popularity with some fellow tribal members waned, he was always welcomed among the Gold Coast \\"High Society\\" of Chicago and the Chautauqua literary groups of the East Coast. He was an early activist trying to force the United States to pay monies owed pursuant to treaties and to provide fair treatment of Indian peoples. Pokagon met with President Abraham Lincoln twice to petition for payment from the government for land taken in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. He also met with President Ulysses S. Grant to accept an expression of gratitude for the efforts of Potawatomi volunteers in the Civil War. In the 1890s, Pokagon began pressing land claims to the Chicago lakefront. A complicated individual with what often seemed to be contradictory motivations, he sold \\"interests\\" in that Chicago land claim to real estate speculators, angering some in the Pokagon community. In much of his writings, Pokagon wrote about the past and traditional ways of life; he lamented the passing of a \\"vanishing\\" race of Indians. But the Pokagon Potawatomi were not vanishing. They had organized a Business Committee, a traditional, democratically elected tribal council that governed by consensus and advocated for the rights of tribal members. Meanwhile, most tribal members worked as laborers at local factories and farms and retained close ties to the Catholic Church. According to the historian Susan Sleeper-Smith, unlike the neighboring Miami in Indiana, who \\"hid in plain sight\\", the Pokagon Potawatomi tightly held onto their traditions and sense of community. In a publication originally titled Red Man's Rebuke and subsequently Red Man's Greeting, Pokagon wrote: > On behalf of my people, the American Indians, I hereby declare to you, the > pale-faced race that has usurped our lands and homes, that we have no spirit > to celebrate with you the great Columbian Fair now being held in this > Chicago city, the wonder of the world. No; sooner would we hold the high joy > day over the graves of our departed than to celebrate our own funeral, the > discovery of America. And while...your hearts in admiration rejoice over the > beauty and grandeur of this young republic and you say, 'behold the wonders > wrought by our children in this foreign land,' do not forget that this > success has been at the sacrifice of our homes and a once happy race. Pokagon wrote prolifically, his books including The Red Man's Rebuke (1893), The Red Man's Greeting (1893), and O-gi-maw-kwe Mit-i-gwa-ki, Queen of the Woods (1899) which was written about his wife, Lodinaw. His role as an American Indian intellectual, tribal leader, author, speaker, temperance advocate, and environmentalist have been studied since his death, yet some sources on his life are erroneous, such as the Bureau of American Ethnology's Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico. Pokagon's writings reflected his pride in being Indian as well as the struggle to \\"hide in plain view\\" that many Indians faced. Queen of the Woods presented a positive image of what it means to be Indian, and exposed some of the challenges that are unique to native populations. His work also demonstrates natives' efforts to indigenize forms of communication in the dominant culture. His use of the literary medium made it possible for his voice as an Indian to be heard and understood within white society. Pokagon was not the last chief of the Potawatomi. The Pokagon have had chiefs since his death, and leadership in Potawatomi communities is not hereditary. For a while, he was the head of the Business Committee of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, until his political fortunes soured and he was replaced. He became an ambiguous icon of an early Indian who obtained \\"celebrity\\" status. == Appearance at the World's Columbian Exposition == On October 9, 1893, Pokagon was a featured speaker at the World's Columbian Exposition. He gave the mayor of Chicago a copy of a deed to Chicago wrapped in birchbark . He was also the umpire for a lacrosse game featuring Iroquois and Potawatomi athletes. He dressed in a suit but wore a feathered cap as a mark of his Potawatomi identity. He gave a speech to a crowd of nearly 75,000, addressing the devastation of alcohol on Indians and stated that his people needed to abandon their tribal allegiance and pursue U.S. citizenship: > What can be done for the best good of . . . our race? Our children must > learn that they owe allegiance to no clan or power on earth except these > United States . . . [they] must be educated and learn the . . . trades of > white men . . . [then] they will be able to compete with the dominant race. Another part of his speech, published in the Chicago Tribune, reflected his hope for the progress of his tribe: > I shall cherish as long as I live the cheering words that have been spoken > to me here by the ladies, friends of my race; it has strengthened and > encouraged me; I have greater faith in the success of the remaining few of > my people than ever before. I now realize the hand of the Great Spirit is > open in our behalf; already he has thrown his great search light upon the > vault of heaven, and Christian men and women are reading there in characters > of fire well understood; ‚ÄòThe red man is your brother, and God is the father > of all.' The conclusion of the day was Pokagon's appearance on the \\"History of Chicago\\" float alongside a replica of a statue of Black Partridge. ==Legacy and honors== *A monument to both Simon and his father Leopold Pokagon was proposed for Chicago's Jackson Park but never built.

The colour of the upper surface is somewhat variable, being mainly golden brown with darker brown patches but sometimes additionally having green patches. There is a narrow brown stripe running from the nostrils through the eye and back towards the groin, broadening towards the posterior and then becoming intermittent. Below the eye is a green band running as far as the shoulder and there is a thin white line along the edge of the upper lip. The skin on the underside has fine granulations. Davies' tree frog is very similar in appearance to the closely related New England tree frog but is larger, is less green and has a slightly bumpy rather than a smooth skin. ==Distribution and habitat== Davies' tree frog is endemic to the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales, Australia. It has been found in a number of separate locations from north of the Hunter River to the Hastings River drainage, a distance of about . It is only known from altitudes greater than and is found near streams and rivers with well-vegetated banks. In deep gullies the surrounding area is wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest while in the tableland the streamside vegetation is mostly tea tree (Leptospermum sp.), ferns, and grass tussocks in areas of dry, open woodland or heathland. ==Conservation status== Davies' tree frog has a very restricted range and an area of occurrence of less than . It is an uncommon frog and its habitat is threatened by forest clearance for agricultural purposes, and some of the streams in which the frog breeds have been stocked with exotic fish such as trout, carp and mosquitofish which may feed on the tadpoles.

The Giants were members of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League from 1984-1994 and were an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. ==History== Following the 1983 season, Bob and Margaret Bavais purchased the struggling Walla Walla based Blue Mountain Bears. Antiquated facilities compounded by dwindling attendance in Walla Walla prompted the new owners to move the franchise. The Bavasis, who had secured affiliation with the San Francisco Giants, ultimately selected Everett as the relocation destination. In their inaugural campaign, Everett went 36-38. The Giants, in their sophomore season, finished the year at 40-34 to claim the Washington division title. The Giants defeated the Eugene Emeralds to claim the Northwest League Championship. Rounding out the honors of 1985, owner Bob Bavasi was awarded the league's executive of the year. Two years later the Giants won their second division title. Facing the Spokane in the championship series, Everett would fall to the Indians. The Giants sought to build upon their success in 1987. With a record of the 42-34, Everett tied Spokane atop the division standings. Under league tie-breaker rule the Indians were declared division winners. Entering the new decade, the Giants struggled on the field. With the exception of 1993 when the club went 42-34 in a second place division finish, the Giants failed to post a winning record. The club would continue their affiliation with San Francisco through the 1994 season. At the culmination of the season Everett signed a player development contract with the Seattle Mariners. The Mariners, who had been affiliated with Bellingham, essentially swapped with San Francisco as the Giants signed on with Bellingham. Upon affiliating with Seattle the franchise selected a new team name; the Everett AquaSox. ==Season-by-season record== {  style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:95%\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Season !scope=\\"col\\"PDC !scope=\\"col\\"Division !scope=\\"col\\"Finish !scope=\\"col\\"Wins !scope=\\"col\\"Losses !scope=\\"col\\"Win% !scope=\\"col\\"Post-season !scope=\\"col\\"Manager !scope=\\"col\\"Attendance - align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"11\\" FD5A1E; color: white; border:2px solid#000000\\"Everett Giants - 1984 SFG North 3rd 36 38 .486  Rocky Bridges 41,442 - 1985 SFG bgcolor=\\"#D0E7FF\\"Washington 1st 40 34 .541 bgcolor=\\"#EEDC82\\"Defeated Eugene in championship game Joe Strain 53,869 - 1986 SFG Washington 2nd 40 34 .541  Joe Strain 51,131 - 1987 SFG bgcolor=\\"#D0E7FF\\"South 1st 49 26 .653 Lost to Spokane in championship series 2-1 Joe Strain 58,823 - 1988 SFG North 1st T 42 34 .553  Joe Strain 63,887 - 1989 SFG North 4th 31 44 .413  Joe Strain 70,714 - 1990 SFG South 3rd 35 41 .461  Deron McCue 74,577 - 1991 SFG North 3rd 37 39 .487  Rob Ellis 89,906 - 1992 SFG North 3rd 35 41 .461  Norm Sherry 85,936 - 1993 SFG North 2nd 42 34 .553  Norm Sherry 87,874 - 1994 SFG North 2nd 37 39 .487  Mike Hart 94,421 - } { bgcolor=\\"#D0E7FF\\"Division winner bgcolor=\\"#EEDC82\\"League champions } ==ReferencesExternal links== *Stats Crew Everett Giants Category:Defunct Northwest League teams Category:San Francisco Giants minor league affiliates ","title":"Everett Giants"},{"id":"12373507","text":"The Nodugl tree frog (Litoria micromembrana) is a species of frog in the family Pelodryadidae.

Cary was a key figure in the British rock music radio revolution of the 1960s. He was born in Chester, U.K., on 5 October 1946 and died on 29 February 2008, in Tenerife, Spain, after suffering from two strokes. Cary was one of the DJs who broadcast from the offshore pirate radio ship Radio Caroline in 1967 and 1968.Pirate Radio Hall of Fame At its peak the station had 23 million listeners. In the 1970s Cary was a DJ on RNI Pirate Radio Hall of Fame before a stint at Radio Luxembourg. Chris worked on Radio Caroline when it came back on air in 1972 after being in the port of Amsterdam for 5 years (from 1968) and later went to Radio Luxembourg 208 in 1975 and stayed there until around 1978. He operated pioneering computer retailer Compshop in North London in the late 1970s, and was involved with the design of the Compukit UK101 and sold the MicroAce, an unlicensed \\"clone\\" of the Sinlair ZX80.Microace repair, detailing byte-swap. In 1980 Cary went to Ireland with Robbie Robinson to set up Sunshine Radio. In 1981 he returned to Ireland again to set up Ireland's Radio Nova, which was the most successful commercial Top 40 radio station in Ireland to date in terms of professionalism and listenership. Many of the programming philosophies on Nova were based around Los Angeles station KIIS-FM. Chris met his future second wife Sybil Fennell on Radio Nova, as she was a newsreader on that station. He also set up a sister station to Nova called Kiss FM. He broadcast from time to time himself on Nova. 1986 Nova closed down and Chris moved back to the UK. He now had a company dealing in satellite equipment and for a while ran a satellite-distributed version of Radio Nova in Britain which employed a number of former pirate DJs including Paul Burnett, Mark Wesley and Tony Blackburn. Chris did present some programmes on the successor to Radio Nova called Energy 103. In the late 1980s', Chris set up a satellite station called Radio Nova International. In 1978 Cary went to Ireland with Robbie Robinson and DJ Roger Swann to set up Sunshine Radio with the stated objective of broadcasting to holidaymakers in Majorca. The cars they travelled in (a Lincoln Continental and a Mercedes) contained much of the broadcasting equipment that they intended to fit to an ancient wooden keeled sloop. Unfortunately the Mercedes broke down on the M1 but the Lincoln Continental made it to Larne where the \\"radio ship\\" was being prepared. DJ Roger Swann left after 10 days or so and ended up working on the voice of Peace and the pirate radio ship didn't make further than Dublin... The final fate of the radio ship is unknown but rumor has it that some broadcasts to the Irish republic were made from the ship..

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, temperate shrubland, rivers, and pastureland. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The male New England tree frog reaches a snout-to-vent length of while the females reach . The upper parts are green or greenish-brown often flecked with black. A white line runs along the upper lip and a straw-coloured line runs from the snout, through the eyes and tympani to the groin. The lower parts of the sides and the back of the thighs are bright orange-red. There are enlarged pads on the digits enabling the frog to climb. This frog is very similar in appearance to the Blue Mountains tree frog but as their ranges do not overlap, there is little chance of confusion. The skin is smooth whereas in the closely related and similar-looking Davies' tree frog the skin usually has small raised bumps. ==Distribution== The New England tree frog is native to the New England Tableland in eastern Australia where it occurs at altitudes between . Its range extends northwards from the Werrikimbe National Park in New South Wales to southern Queensland and in the Nowendoc area it is the most common species of frog present in streams. It is an adaptable species and occurs in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests, in mountain woodland and cleared pasture. It is likely to be present in any stream with well-vegetated verges. ==Behaviour== Male frogs start calling at night in August or September and the breeding season continues until December, the call being described as a series of ‚Äúorak..orak..orak‚Äù sounds continuing for about ten seconds. The males advertise their presence from logs or low vegetation beside streams, especially favouring Callicoma and Lomandra. The eggs are laid in shady parts of the stream and attached to submerged vegetation. The tadpoles grow to a length of about and are unique among Australian treefrog tadpoles in not having horny beaks, instead having a ring of tentacle-like papillae surrounding the mouth. It is not known on what the tadpoles feed but the adult frogs are presumed to eat small invertebrates. Their habits outside the breeding season are little known. ==Status== The New England tree frog has a very restricted range and fragmented population, with an area of occurrence of less than . It is an uncommon frog and its habitat is threatened by clearance of vegetation along riverbanks and by pollution, and some of the streams in which the frog breeds have been stocked with exotic fish such as trout. For these reasons, the IUCN has assessed this frog as being a \\"vulnerable species\\". ==References== Category:Ranoidea (genus) Category:Amphibians of New South Wales Category:Amphibians described in 1983 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"New England tree frog"},{"id":"12373640","text":"The Treasury Island tree frog (Litoria thesaurensis) is a species of frog in the family Pelodryadidae.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, and pastureland. == Description== Ranoidea wilcoxii shows extreme sexual dimorphism, meaning the males and females have different appearances. Females can reach a length of up to 70 mm and males 45 mm. Individuals are a smooth brown in colour with speckling and blotching in the groin. A thick black stripe extends from the nostril to the base of the forearm, encompassing the eye and tympanum The lower underside and groin can be from a light yellow to olive green, tending more often towards a beige brown. The thighs will reflect this colouration, though more brightly. Females fit this description year round, but males turn a bright yellow to yellow-orange during mating season. As with most members of the genus Litoria, they have climbing discs on their fingers and toes. The stony creek frog's snout is very useful in the wild. It enables it to stay low under water so it can stay away from predators. The snout acts as a ventilation system. When swimming underwater, the snout will stick slightly above the water so it can breathe. Male L. wilcoxii ==Reproduction== Males call with a very soft purring from debris such as rocks, vegetation or the ground immediately next to the water body. Once the female has located the male, the pair will enter amplexus. Eggs will be laid in a single submerged cluster attached to a sediment. ==Threats== It is threatened by habitat loss, destruction of its native environment, in particular spawning locations, is leading to a decline in the number of this species. As with a great variety of Australian frog species, chytridiomycosis poses great threats to the future of this species, with some locales experiencing 28% infection rate. ==Taxonomy== This species is almost identical physiologically to Lesueur's frog (Ranoidea lesueuri), and is identical physiologically to R. jungguy. It can be distinguished from Lesueur's frog by the presence of blue spots on the thigh, which are missing in R. wilcoxii. Geographical distribution and genetic testing are the only methods of differentiating R. wilcoxii from R. jungguy. ==References== Category:Ranoidea (genus) Category:Amphibians of Queensland Category:Amphibians of New South Wales Category:Amphibians described in 1864 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"Ranoidea wilcoxii"},{"id":"12373692","text":"The Wissel Lakes tree frog (Litoria wisselensis) is a species of frog in the family Pelodryadidae, endemic to West Papua, Indonesia.

The flanks are dark with white speckling. ==Habitat and conservation== Nyctimystes persimilis occurs along small (about 2‚Äì5 m wide) streams at elevations of above sea level in both primary forest and villages largely devoid of trees. Breeding probably occurs in streams where the tadpoles develop. On Mount Simpson, it is a common species in suitable habitat. There are no known major threats to this species; it appears to tolerate the degree of habitat degradation that is typically present in its range. ==References== persimilis Category:Amphibians of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of New Guinea Category:Amphibians described in 1958 Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

His grandson, Cui Shi, later served as chancellor during the reigns of the emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong. == Background == Cui Renshi was born in the 580s, during the reign of Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. He was from Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Dingzhou, Hebei). Early in the reign of Emperor Gaozu (r. 618‚Äì626), the founder of the Tang dynasty, Cui Renshi passed an imperial examination and was made the military advisor to the prefect of Guan Prefecture (ÁÆ°Â∑û, part of modern Zhengzhou, Henan). In 622, the chancellor Chen Shuda recommended Cui Renshi to be capable of editing imperial histories, and he was promoted to the post of military advisor to the commander of one of the imperial armies, but also given the responsibility of assisting in editing the histories of the Liang dynasty and Northern Wei. == During Emperor Taizong's reign == Early in the reign of Emperor Gaozu's son, Emperor Taizong, Cui Renshi was made an assistant to the imperial censorate. In 627, there was an alleged treasonous plot that occurred in Qing Prefecture (ÈùíÂ∑û, roughly modern Qingzhou, Shandong), and Cui was sent to investigate. When he got to Qing Prefecture, there had been many people already arrested by the local authorities on suspicion that they were involved in the plot. Cui removed their restraints, gave them food, and allowed them to bathe. He eventually sentenced only the ten-odd leaders to death, while releasing all of the rest. After he returned to the capital Chang'an, Emperor Taizong sent an imperial messenger to Qing Prefecture to carry out the executions, and the assistant chief judge at the supreme court, Sun Fuqie (), who was friendly with him, warned him that if he released too many people, he might be accused by those sentenced to death of unfairness. Cui responded, \\"I have heard that an official in charge of criminal law should be kind and forgiving, and therefore, even if he were going to execute people or cut off their feet, he needed to do so with respect. How can I worry about my personal safety and not care about those wrongly accused? If I suffer, but I get 10 innocent people released, that would be my wish.\\" Sun Fuqie, in shame, withdrew from his presence. Meanwhile, when the imperial messenger reached Qing Prefecture to verify Cui's actions, the prisoners sentenced to death had no objections, stating to the imperial messenger that Cui judged correctly and that they deserved to die. At a later point, when Cui served as assistant minister of census, there was a time when he was reporting a number of expenditures‚Äîmore than 1,000 items‚Äîto Emperor Taizong, and he recited them without having his books with him. Emperor Taizong found this odd and unbelievable, and he had the assistant head of the examination bureau of government, Du Zhenglun, fetch the books, and then had Cui re-recite his expenditures. As it turned out, Cui's oral report was correct without flaw, and Emperor Taizong was impressed. Around the same time, the imperial scholar Wang Xuandu () had written commentaries for the Confucian classics Classic of History and Classic of Odes, in which he disapproved of commentaries from the Han dynasty scholars Kong Rong and Zheng Xuan. Wang then asked for imperial approval to replace Kong's and Zheng's commentaries with his own, as the official commentaries. Emperor Taizong convened a group of scholars to debate before him, and as Wang was a capable debater, the scholars all could not refute him. As a result, the official Xu Jingzong requested that Wang's commentaries be declared official, and Li Xiaogong requested that it be made coextensive with Kong's and Zheng's commentaries. Cui, however, disapproved of Wang's commentaries, finding them to rely on unreliable interpretations, and so he wrote a submission rejecting Xu's and Li Xiaogong's suggestions. Emperor Taizong, agreeing with Cui, rejected Wang's commentaries. In 642, Cui was made an imperial attendant. At that time, the ministry of justice had submitted a proposal to increase the penalty for brothers of treasonous individuals, from removal from official posts to death. Emperor Taizong had his key officials discuss this matter, and Gao Shilian, Hou Junji, and Li Shiji were in favor of the increased penalties, while Tang Jian (), Li Daozong, and Du Chuke () were opposed. Most of the other officials favored the increased penalties, pointing out that during past dynasties, including Han, Cao Wei, and Jin dynasty, the penalty for treason was slaughter of three clans (father's clan, mother's clan, and wife's clan). Cui opposed, pointing out that in even more ancient times‚Äîtimes held ideal by Confucian doctrine‚Äîpeople were not punished for their families' misbehaviors, and the penalty for treason already included the death of sons‚Äîthat if treasonous individuals did not care about their own children, they would not care about their brothers. Emperor Taizong agreed and rejected the proposal to increase the penalty. In 643, in the aftermaths of major conflict between Emperor Taizong's sons Li Chengqian (the Crown Prince) and Li Tai (the Prince of Wei), who was Emperor Taizong's favorite son, causing Li Chengqian to plot to overthrow his father in fear that his father would replace him with Li Tai, Cui submitted a secret petition urging for Li Tai to be made crown prince. Emperor Taizong, after some deliberation, deposed both Li Chengqian and Li Tai, holding Li Tai's machinations responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall, and as Cui had wanted Li Tai made crown prince, he drew Emperor Taizong's ire and was demoted to the post of assistant minister of palace supplies. Later, his post was changed to deputy minister of census. During the preparations for Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo in 644, Wei Ting () the minister of imperial shrines was made in charge of shipping troop supplies over the Bohai Sea, and Cui assisted him; Cui also had the additional responsibilities of shipping troop supplies in the Henan region. Cui, believing that the supplies from distant prefectures would not arrive in time, took the initiative of requisitioning the food collected as taxes in the region he was in charge and shipping those as food supplies for the troops. However, in spring 645, during the campaign, Wei was accused of not getting supplies to the troops quickly enough and demoted to commoner status. Cui was accused of not paying sufficient attention to the problems of laborers fleeing conscripted labor and was removed from his post. After the end of the Goguryeo campaign, when Emperor Taizong returned from the front to Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding), he returned Cui to imperial service, making him an assistant to the head of the legislative bureau of government. He was soon also made acting minister of justice. Later, when Emperor Taizong was to visit his summer palace Cuiwei Palace (), Cui submitted a poem to advise him against doing so in a veiled manner, not wanting Emperor Taizong to be away from Chang'an, and while Emperor Taizong did not accept his veiled advice, he appreciated it. In 648, Cui was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the assistant head of the legislative bureau, not typically considered a post for a chancellor, but Emperor Taizong gave him the additional designation Canzhi Jiwu (), making him a de facto chancellor. Emperor Taizong was often listening to his advice, and this brought jealousy from fellow chancellor Chu Suiliang. It happened at this time that there was a person who came to the palace door to air his grievances, and Cui did not report this grievance to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong saw this as hiding relevant events from the emperor and exiled him to Gong Prefecture. Later, after a general pardon, he was allowed to return from exile. == During Emperor Gaozong's reign == After Emperor Taizong's death in 649, his son, Emperor Gaozong, made Cui the prefect of Jian Prefecture (Á∞°Â∑û, roughly modern Ziyang, Sichuan). Cui died soon thereafter. ==NotesReferences== * Old Book of Tang, vol. 74. * New Book of Tang, vol. 99. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 196, 197, 198.

As currently delimited, the genus is monotypic and contains Phytotriades auratus, commonly known as the golden tree frog, bromeliad-dwelling treefrog, El Tucuche golden tree frog, or Trinidad heart-tongued frog. ==Taxonomy== Phytotriades was separated from the genus Phyllodytes based primarily on genetic evidence; this also solved the unusual, disjunct distribution of the genus (the remaining Phyllodytes are endemic to eastern Brazil). Nevertheless, the contents of the genus remain to be elucidated. Earlier on, also Phyllodytes wuchereri was included in the \\"Phyllodytes auratus group\\", but the position of this species has not been addressed. At the moment, it is not clear which Phyllodytes species might eventually end up in this genus. AmphibiaWeb continues to include Phytotriades auratus in Phyllodytes. ==Distribution== Phytotriades auratus is known from the summits of El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche, the two highest peaks in Trinidad, as well as from Cerro Humo on the Paria Peninsula, Venezuela, on the adjacent mainland. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that the species might also occur (or have occurred) on the Isla Margarita. ==Description== Males grow to and females to in snout‚Äìvent length. They have serrated teeth and sharp \\"fangs\\", larger in males than in females, on their mandibles. The dorsum is chocolate brown in colour and has two iridescent, golden yellow stripes. Males are territorial and can use their fangs in combat. Males are not known to call (this feature separates Phytotriades from Phyllodytes). Fecundity is probably low, with maximally 5‚Äì6 tadpoles found in a single bromeliad tank. The tadpoles hatch at a length of and grow to . ==Habitat and conservation== On Trinidad, the species occurs in montane rainforest and elfin woodland at around above sea level. On Cerro Humo, the species was found in the elfin forest near the summit of the mountain (). Phytotriades auratus is closely associated with the giant bromeliad Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora; also the tadpoles develop in these bromeliads. Trinidadian populations are threatened by the collection of bromeliads and collecting of specimens. The Northern Range Game Sanctuary (also known as the El Tucuche Reserve) provides some protection to one of the populations. On Cerro Humo, a part of the habitat falls within the Pen√≠nsula de Paria National Park, although enforcement remains limited. Clearance for slash-and-burn plots threatens the potential habitat of the species on the slopes of the mountain. The species appears to be specialized for life in high humidity relatively cool tropical montane forests on isolated mountain crests and peaks. With the threat of global climate change, and specifically warming, temperatures are expected to rise even in mountainous regions. This seems likely to result in the uphill retreat of cool-adapted tropical montane forests and the shrinking of the already small range of this frog. ==References== Category:Hylinae Category:Amphibians of the Caribbean Category:Amphibians of South America Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Phytotriades"},{"id":"12374016","text":"The Alhandra heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes brevirostris) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae endemic to Brazil. ==Habitat== Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.

It is endemic to Brazil. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist shrublands, rivers, and freshwater marshes. P. ayeaye is found in the transition zone between cerrado (tropical woodland-savanna) and Atlantic semi- deciduous forest, laying its eggs on leaves above streams or pools so the tadpoles, when hatched, fall into the water below. This species is under threat from habitat loss resulting from mining activity and fires, and is also affected by pollution from mining and pesticides. Its restricted range is likely to make it particularly vulnerable to these threats. == Description == P. ayeaye is a medium-sized frog that can grow between 28.7 mm to 40 mm long and weigh from 1.89 g to 7.5 g. The dorsal side is a bright green color, and the sides of its body and appendages have a distinctive network of black lines with circular reddish to orange spots. The ventral side is a black to gray color. Tadpoles have long, oval bodies with flattened sides. The end of the tail arcs upwards. Their heads, with large eyes, and bodies are longer than their tails.Their dorsal surface is dark, while their ventral surface is a light gray color. == Habitat == The reticulated leaf frog is native to South America and lives in the Espinhaco, Mantiqueira, and Canastra mountain ranges located in Brazil. The topography includes mountains with rivers running between them. Streams run through the semideciduous forests, which provide water, shade, and protection. == Call == Male frogs produce multiple calls that for specific information or one call that conveys different information. The advertisement call is used to get the attention of females and warn other males who are nearby. The release call is also used when males try to mate with other males or when they are fighting. One study found that at a breeding site, most males use short notes when beginning their calls. As more males join in, they use more complex calls, making short and long notes. == Reproduction == The breeding season is from October to January. Males sit on vegetation beside a stream and call to females. Most P. ayeaye breed on nights with sufficient rainfall to increase the likelihood that fertilization will occur. The tadpoles hatch during November to December. They mature from October to May, and fully mature by June. Female P. ayeaye prefer to deposit their eggs on plants in the families Melastomataceae and Solanaceae. The leaves of those plants have trichomes on them which keep the eggs from drying out and adhering to the leaf. == Threats == P. ayeaye is currently under threat due to habitat loss. Human-related threats include mining for materials in Brazil, fires that ravage the landscape, and pollution from industries and military operations. The pollutants in the water causes a decline in the population. Ecotourism and urbanization also affect the breeding areas of this species. Non-human threats include climate change and erosion, which causes streams to be filled with sediment. == Conservation status == The International Union for Conservation of Nature still classifies the reticulated leaf frog as critically endangered. However, the last assessment of the species was done on January 7, 2009 and the website was updated in 2016. Since then, P. ayeaye was found in other locations in Brazil and is no longer declared critically endangered by the Brazilian List of Endangered Species in 2014. == Conservation efforts == While currently no specific conservation measures target this colourful amphibian, its occurrence in protected areas, such as the Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra in the state of Minas Gerais and Parque Estadual das Furnas do Bom Jesus in the state of S√£o Paulo, may provide it with some level of protection. ==Sources== Category:Phyllomedusa Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1966 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pithecopus ayeaye"},{"id":"12374052","text":"Callimedusa baltea is a species of frog in the family Phyllomedusidae.

The tadpoles develop in temporary ponds. It is not a common species although it was recorded by surveys in both 2013 and 2014 at rate of about one individual per person hour. Outside the two sites where this species is known to occur, it is threatened by habitat loss. It is present in the El Sira Communal Reserve. ==References== baltea Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Taxa named by William Edward Duellman Category:Amphibians described in 1979 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Callimedusa baltea"},{"id":"12374056","text":"Phyllomedusa boliviana is a species of frog in the family Phyllomedusidae.

Nine months later, she gave birth to a pretty baby girl, who the couple named \\"Janghwa\\" (\\"Rose Flower\\"). Two years later, they had another pretty girl and named her \\"Hongryeon\\" (\\"Red Lotus\\"). Unfortunately, the mother died when Hongryeon was 5 years old; and soon thereafter, the father remarried to continue his line. The new stepmother was both ugly and cruel. She hated her stepdaughters, but hid those feelings, only to reveal them once she had three sons in a row, which gave her a good deal of power, and she abused the girls in every possible way. But Janghwa and Hongryeon never told their father about any of it.  Conflict  When Janghwa came of age and got engaged, Father told his second wife to help Janghwa plan a wedding ceremony. Stepmother became angry, not wanting to spend a penny of \\"her family's money\\" or \\"her sons' future fortune\\" on Janghwa. So she came up with a dirty plan: One night when Janghwa was sleeping, Stepmother had her eldest son put a dead skinned rat in Janghwa's bed. Early the next morning, she brought Father to Janghwa's room, telling him she'd had a bad dream about her elder stepdaughter. When she pulled back the covers on Janghwa's bed, something that looked like a very bloody miscarriage shocked everybody in the room. Stepmother accused Janghwa of unchaste behavior, having an out-of-wedlock child. Father believed this. Janghwa did not know what to do so she ran out of the house to a small pond in the nearby woods. Stepmother ordered her eldest son to follow Janghwa and push her into the pond. As Janghwa drowned, suddenly came a huge tiger who attacked Stepmother's eldest son, taking one leg and one arm from him. Stepmother got what she wanted--Janghwa's death--but at the cost of her own son's health. She turned her anger upon Hongryeon, hating and abusing this remaining stepdaughter more than ever. Unable to bear this treatment on top of the loss of her beloved sister, Hongryeon soon followed Janghwa; her body was found in the same pond in which Janghwa had drowned. After that, whenever a new mayor came to the village, he was found dead a day after his arrival. As this kept happening, mysterious rumors spread through the village, but no one knew for sure what had happened to the men or for what reason.  Resolution  A brave young man came to the village as a new mayor. He was aware of the deaths of predecessors, but he was not afraid for his own life. When night came, he was sitting in his room when his candle was suddenly blown out and gruesome noises filled the air. The door opened to reveal no one, at first, but then the new mayor saw two young female ghosts. He asked them who they were and why they had killed the previous mayors. Weeping, the elder sister explained that all they wanted was to let people know the truth: the elder girl had not been an unchaste girl who committed suicide in shame. She had been framed by her stepmother and murdered by her eldest half-brother. The mayor asked the ghost of Janghwa for any evidence of this. Janghwa told him to examine the miscarried fetus that Stepmother had shown to the villagers.  Conclusion  The next morning, the new mayor did what the sisters' ghosts had asked him to do. He summoned Father, Stepmother, and the eldest son and examined the fetus that Stepmother insisted had come from Janghwa's body. When he split it with a knife, it was revealed to be a rat. Stepmother and her eldest son were sentenced to death. Father, however, was set free because the mayor thought Father had known nothing of Stepmother's evil plan and in fact was just another victim. Years later, Father married again. On the night of his third wedding, he saw his two daughters in a dream. They said that since things were as they should be, they wanted to come back to him. Nine months later, Father's third wife delivered twin girls. Father named these twins \\"Janghwa\\" and \\"Hongryeon\\" and loved them very much. The new family lived happily ever after. == Films == The story has been adapted to film a number of times, and formed the basis of the 2003 Kim Jee-woon film A Tale of Two Sisters and the 2009 American remake, The Uninvited. * Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1924) directed by Park Jun-hyun * Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1936) directed by Hong Gae-myeong * Janghwa Heungryeon jeon (1956) directed by Jeong Chang-hwa * Dae Jang-hwa Hong-ryeon jeon (1962) directed by Jeong Chang-hwa * Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1972) directed by Lee Yu-seob * A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) directed by Kim Jee-woon * The Uninvited (2009) directed by The Guard Brothers == See also == * Korean mythology * Kongjwi and Patjwi * Heungbu and Nolbu ==References== * Full text and analogy of Janghwa Hongreyon jeon * Brief information about Janghwa Hongreyon jeon at ÎëêÏÇ∞Î∞±Í≥ºÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ EnCyber * Analogy on Janghwa Hongreyon jeon at Seowon University website Category:Korean folklore Category:Korean fairy tales Category:Joseon Dynasty works Category:Female characters in fairy tales ","title":"Janghwa Hongryeon jeon"},{"id":"12374082","text":"Phyllomedusa iheringii is a species of frog in the family Phyllomedusidae, found in Brazil and Uruguay.

It is found in northern South America in the Upper Amazon Basin of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, Amazonian Brazil, and the Guianas from southeastern Venezuela to French Guiana. It might represent more than one species. Callimedusa tomopterna is an arboreal species that occurs in pristine tropical rainforests, usually on trees around temporary to semi-temporary pools during the wet season, but specimens have been also collected in open areas and floodable forests on shrubs and aquatic edges. It occurs at elevations up to above sea level. It is an uncommon species in most parts of its range. It can locally suffer from habitat loss. Behavior and Reproduction Callimedusa tomopterna are nocturnal and sleep throughout the day. During the nighttime, the males are able to communicate to the females through vocal calls. During the nighttime is when they also search for food. The reproductive aspects reported for the species of this family are marked by the uniqueness of egg deposition, placed on green leaves hanging under standing water, where the tadpoles will complete their development. The lack of availability of sites for reproduction can lead to sites being shared by anuran species, which can sometimes lead to interspecific mating. This is especially seen when males are actively looking for females through satellite behavior or have limited capacity to differentiate between sexes. This is an often-common behavior in many neotropical frogs such as the Callimedusa tomopterna. Studies have shown interspecific amplexus between individuals from two different species: specifically, Callimedusa tomopterna (Tiger-striped Leaf Frog) and Dendropsophus minutus (Lesser Treefrog). Threats: Clutch Predation In the Central Amazonia, treefrogs of the genus Phyllomedusa lay their eggs in gelatinous masses on leaves and branches over water. 59% of C. tomopterna clutches are often attacked by predators such as phorid flies (being the majorly responsible for clutch loss), and other unidentified predators. The reason for these clutch predations is mostly due to Anuran eggs being a high-protein energy source for many predators such as insects. They are especially notorious for larvae. Threats: Adult Predation Adult Callimedusa tomopternas are also highly predated on. Studies have shown that the predation of adult Phyllomedusa tree frogs by the snake species, Leptodeira annulate (cat-eyed snake) reinforces the claim that the toxins that Callimedusa tomopternas are able to secrete for defense are not sufficient enough to protect them from the cat-eyed snakes. ==References== tomopterna Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1868 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Callimedusa tomopterna"},{"id":"12374122","text":"Phyllomedusa trinitatis is a species of frog in the family Phyllomedusidae.

It occurs in Guatemala and Mexico and is found on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre between southeastern Chiapas (Mexico) and southwestern Guatemala. ==Description== Plectrohyla avia is the largest member of the genus Plectrohyla, with males reaching about and females about snout‚Äìvent length. It was described by in 1952 based on a single specimen. This specimen‚Äîthe holotype‚Äîis an adult male that measured SVL. The tympanum is small but very distinct. There is a heavy supratympanic fold that merges with the fold-like canthus (or in less technical terms, \\"lateral skin folds\\"). The fingers have vestigial webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The prepollex (\\"spikethumb\\") is simple and horny. Vocal slits are absent. The teeth of the upper maxilla are long and protruding. ==Reproduction== Based on an observation from Chiapas, breeding takes place underwater and involves axillar amplexus. Male advertisement call is a brief and rapid trill. Males were observed calling underwater and from within small holes and crevices in the splash-zone of waterfalls. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Plectrohyla avia are cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. It typically occurs in vegetation along mountain streams. Reproduction has been observed just at the start of the rainy season in a small pool. The well- developed lateral skin folds might facilitate dermal respiration. It is an uncommon to rare species that is threatened by habitat loss (deforestation and transformation of forest to agricultural areas) as well as chytridiomycosis. It might be, however, more common and widespread than currently thought, but with only a short period of activity at the beginning of the rainy season. ==ReferencesExternal links== * avia Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians described in 1952 Category:Taxa named by Laurence Cooper Stuart Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Plectrohyla avia"},{"id":"12374155","text":"Sarcohyla bistincta is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

It was originally released in November 1985 by EMI Records, and later reissued and remastered by One Way Records in 2000, with additional B-sides and extended mixes. The album was produced by (Chic's) Nile Rodgers. Not as successful as her previous album, Do You peaked at No.40 in the US, but was certified gold and featured the top 30 hit \\"Do It for Love\\". == Overview == Having reached a peak of success with her previous album A Private Heaven, Easton's record company secured the services of top producer Nile Rodgers to work with her on the follow-up album. Rodgers himself was also riding a career high at the time as a producer having recently worked with Madonna on her top-selling album Like a Virgin. Of the songs chosen, Rodgers composed two (\\"Magic of Love\\" and \\"Money Back Guarantee\\"), while hit singer/songwriters Adele Bertei and Junior Giscombe contributed \\"Do It for Love\\" and \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" respectively. The latter was later featured in an episode of the Miami Vice television series in 1988. A cover of the Martha and the Vandellas 1967 hit \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was also included. The sound of the album was a departure from her pop sound and had a more dance/club feel. While a popular album with her fans, Easton wasn't happy with the results, later commenting; \\"looking back, it was a huge mistake. I think as artists we just didn't gel and it's the album I'm most disappointed by\\". Released in November 1985, the album was preceded by the single \\"Do It for Love\\", which made the US top 30, peaking at No.29 in December. The album entered the Billboard 200 on November 23 and a month later peaked at No.40 during a 19 week run. By the end of the year, it was certified Gold by the RIAA. Later singles released were: \\"Jimmy Mack\\" and \\"Magic of Love\\", the former peaking at No.65 in February 1986. In her native UK however, the album was unsuccessful. Easton puts this down to the British view that she had abandoned her country for success in America. Neither the singles nor the album registered on the chart, with her only chart showing in 1985 being for earlier single \\"Sugar Walls\\" at No.95. Do You did however chart at No.32 in Japan, and No. 66 in Canada. The album received a favorable retrospective review by Allmusic, stating that \\"Easton consistently delivers driven, top-of- the-line performances, resulting in her sounding much more comfortable with dance material than on previous efforts\\". It lists the best songs as being the non-singles \\"Don't Break My Heart\\", \\"When the Lightning Strikes Again\\" and \\"Money Back Guarantee\\". On February 23, 2013, Edsel Records (UK) reissued and remastered Easton's A Private Heaven and Do You on CD with bonus tracks, with the latter including an extended version of \\"Jimmy Mack\\" that had never been included on any of her reissues. Due to her next album, No Sound But a Heart, failing to achieve a release in the United States, Do You would be Easton's last widely available album in the U.S. until 1988's The Lover in Me. ==Track listing== Side One # \\"Do It For Love\\" (Adele Bertei, Mary Kesler) ‚Äì 5:03 # \\"Don't Break My Heart\\" (Danny Ironstone, Tony Maiden, Mary Unobsky) ‚Äì 3:47 # \\"Magic Of Love\\" (Nile Rodgers) ‚Äì 5:05 # \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" (Gordon Gaynor, Mel Gaynor, Junior Giscombe) ‚Äì 5:29 # \\"Jimmy Mack\\" (Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland, Brian Holland) ‚Äì 4:12 Side Two # \\"Can't Wait Till Tomorrow\\" (John Keller, Geoff Leib, Rick Neigher) ‚Äì 4:47 # \\"Young Lions\\" (Dana Merino) ‚Äì 4:54 # \\"Kisses\\" (Larry Nacht) ‚Äì 4:03 # \\"Money Back Guarantee\\" (Martin Celay, Nile Rodgers) ‚Äì 4:34 # \\"When The Lightning Strikes Again\\" (Dan Hartman, Charlie Midnight) ‚Äì 5:10 The CD re-issue featured the following bonus tracks: # \\"Do It For Love\\" (Extended Mix) (Bertei, Kesler) ‚Äì 7:01 # \\"Can't Wait 'Till Tomorrow\\" (Extended Mix) (Keller, Leib, Neigher) ‚Äì 5:20 # \\"Money Back Guarantee\\" (Edited Version) (Celay, Rodgers) ‚Äì 4:03 # \\"Do It For Love\\" (Instrumental) (Bertei, Kesler) ‚Äì 4:50 The Edsel CD re-issue featured the following bonus tracks: # \\"Do It For Love\\" [Extended Mix] # \\"Can‚Äôt Wait Till Tomorrow\\" [Extended Mix] # \\"Do It For Love\\" [Instrumental] # \\"Jimmy Mack\\" [Extended Version] ==Personnel== * Sheena Easton ‚Äì lead and backing vocals * Nile Rodgers ‚Äì bass, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals * Martin Celay ‚Äì guitar * James Farber ‚Äì keyboards * Rob Preuss ‚Äì keyboards * Peter Scherer ‚Äì keyboards * Kevin Jones ‚Äì Synclavier programming * Jimmy Bralower ‚Äì drums * Steve Elson ‚Äì baritone saxophone * Stan Harrison ‚Äì alto saxophone * Lenny Pickett ‚Äì tenor saxophone * Mac Gollehon ‚Äì trumpet * Matt \\"Briz\\" Brislawn ‚Äì backing vocals * Michelle Cobbs ‚Äì backing vocals * Diane Garista ‚Äì backing vocals * Terri Gonzalez ‚Äì backing vocals * Brenda King ‚Äì backing vocals * Curtis King ‚Äì backing vocals * Frank Simms ‚Äì backing vocals * George Simms ‚Äì backing vocals * David Spinner ‚Äì backing vocals * Fonzi Thornton ‚Äì backing vocals ==Production== * Producer ‚Äì Nile Rodgers * Production Management ‚Äì Kevin Jones and Budd Tinick * Recorded and Mixed by James Farber at Skyline Studios (New York, NY). * Second Engineers ‚Äì Scott Ansell and Knut Bohn * Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk (New York, NY). * Design ‚Äì Tommy Steele at Steele Works. * Artwork ‚Äì Henry Marquez * Photography ‚Äì Philip Dixon * Background Photography ‚Äì Alan Dockery and Paul Maxon * Personal Management ‚Äì Harriet Wasserman ==Certifications== {  !align=\\"left\\"Country !align=\\"center\\"Certification !align=\\"center\\"Sales - align=\\"left\\"United States align=\\"center\\"Gold align=\\"center\\"500,000 - } == Notes == Category:1985 albums Category:Sheena Easton albums Category:Albums produced by Nile Rodgers Category:EMI Records albums ","title":"Do You (album)"},{"id":"12374205","text":"\\"Oye\\" (Listen! or Hey!) is a 1998 song by American singer and songwriter Gloria Estefan. It was released as the second single by Epic Records from her eighth studio album, gloria!. The song was written by Estefan, her husband Emilio Estefan, Jr., Randall Barlow and Angie Chirino and produced by Estefan, Jr. and Tony Moran. The song bears the most resemblance to a club song on the entire album and probably the one that became the most popular with this release. Unfortunately, in the US the single was planned for commercial release on July 14, 1998 on various formats (CD Single, CD-Maxi Single, Cassette Single, 7\\" & 12\\" Vinyl), but at the last minute the release was cancelled. The single was released worldwide in many other countries and took the highest position on many charts, including number-one in Spain and on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The song earned the Billboard Latin Music Award for \\"Best Latin Club-Dance Track of the Year\\". The video was directed by Argentinian director Gustavo Garz√≥n. ==Critical reception== Gloria Estefan performing in a nightclub in the music video of \\"Oye\\". J.D.

Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \\"the second single from La Glo's slammin' dance opus, \\"gloria!\\", sidesteps the disco demeanor of the previous \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\" in favor of a percussive salsa flavor.

Theorems about absoluteness typically establish relationships between the absoluteness of formulas and their syntactic form. There are two weaker forms of partial absoluteness. If the truth of a formula in each substructure N of a structure M follows from its truth in M, the formula is downward absolute. If the truth of a formula in a structure N implies its truth in each structure M extending N, the formula is upward absolute. Issues of absoluteness are particularly important in set theory and model theory, fields where multiple structures are considered simultaneously. In model theory, several basic results and definitions are motivated by absoluteness. In set theory, the issue of which properties of sets are absolute is well studied. The Shoenfield absoluteness theorem, due to Joseph Shoenfield (1961), establishes the absoluteness of a large class of formulas between a model of set theory and its constructible universe, with important methodological consequences. The absoluteness of large cardinal axioms is also studied, with positive and negative results known. == In model theory == In model theory, there are several general results and definitions related to absoluteness. A fundamental example of downward absoluteness is that universal sentences (those with only universal quantifiers) that are true in a structure are also true in every substructure of the original structure. Conversely, existential sentences are upward absolute from a structure to any structure containing it. Two structures are defined to be elementarily equivalent if they agree about the truth value of all sentences in their shared language, that is, if all sentences in their language are absolute between the two structures. A theory is defined to be model complete if whenever M and N are models of the theory and M is a substructure of N, then M is an elementary substructure of N. == In set theory == A major part of modern set theory involves the study of different models of ZF and ZFC. It is crucial for the study of such models to know which properties of a set are absolute to different models. It is common to begin with a fixed model of set theory and only consider other transitive models containing the same ordinals as the fixed model. Certain properties are absolute to all transitive models of set theory, including the following (see Jech (2003 sec. I.12) and Kunen (1980 sec. IV.3)). * x is the empty set. * x is an ordinal. * x is a finite ordinal. * x = œâ. * x is (the graph of) a function. Other properties, such as countability, are not absolute.  Failure of absoluteness for countability  Skolem's paradox is the seeming contradiction that on the one hand, the set of real numbers is uncountable (and this is provable from ZFC, or even from a small finite subsystem ZFC' of ZFC), while on the other hand there are countable transitive models of ZFC' (this is provable in ZFC), and the set of real numbers in such a model will be a countable set. The paradox can be resolved by noting that countability is not absolute to submodels of a particular model of ZFC. It is possible that a set X is countable in a model of set theory but uncountable in a submodel containing X, because the submodel may contain no bijection between X and œâ, while the definition of countability is the existence of such a bijection. The L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem, when applied to ZFC, shows that this situation does occur.  Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem  Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem shows that \\\\Pi^1_2 and \\\\Sigma^1_2 sentences in the analytical hierarchy are absolute between a model V of ZF and the constructible universe L of the model, when interpreted as statements about the natural numbers in each model. The theorem can be relativized to allow the sentence to use sets of natural numbers from V as parameters, in which case L must be replaced by the smallest submodel containing those parameters and all the ordinals. The theorem has corollaries that \\\\Sigma^1_3 sentences are upward absolute (if such a sentence holds in L then it holds in V) and \\\\Pi^1_3 sentences are downward absolute (if they hold in V then they hold in L). Because any two transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals have the same constructible universe, Shoenfield's theorem shows that two such models must agree about the truth of all \\\\Pi^1_2 sentences. One consequence of Shoenfield's theorem relates to the axiom of choice. G√∂del proved that the constructible universe L always satisfies ZFC, including the axiom of choice, even when V is only assumed to satisfy ZF. Shoenfield's theorem shows that if there is a model of ZF in which a given \\\\Sigma^1_3 statement œÜ is false, then œÜ is also false in the constructible universe of that model. In contrapositive, this means that if ZFC proves a \\\\Sigma^1_3 sentence then that sentence is also provable in ZF. The same argument can be applied to any other principle which always holds in the constructible universe, such as the combinatorial principle ‚óä. Even if these principles are independent of ZF, each of their \\\\Sigma^1_3 consequences is already provable in ZF. In particular, this includes any of their consequences that can be expressed in the (first order) language of Peano arithmetic. Shoenfield's theorem also shows that there are limits to the independence results that can be obtained by forcing. In particular, any sentence of Peano arithmetic is absolute to transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals. Thus it is not possible to use forcing to change the truth value of arithmetical sentences, as forcing does not change the ordinals of the model to which it is applied. Many famous open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis and the P = NP problem, can be expressed as \\\\Pi^0_2 sentences (or sentences of lower complexity), and thus cannot be proven independent of ZFC by forcing.  Large cardinals  There are certain large cardinals that cannot exist in the constructible universe (L) of any model of set theory. Nevertheless, the constructible universe contains all the ordinal numbers that the original model of set theory contains. This \\"paradox\\" can be resolved by noting that the defining properties of some large cardinals are not absolute to submodels. One example of such a nonabsolute large cardinal axiom is for measurable cardinals; for an ordinal to be a measurable cardinal there must exist another set (the measure) satisfying certain properties. It can be shown that no such measure is constructible. == See also == * Conservative extension == References == *Jech, Thomas, 2003. Set Theory: The Third Millennium Edition, Revised and Expanded.

These include online check-in, room service, in-room controls, guest-staff communication, virtual concierge and more.http://www.hospitalityupgrade.com/_magazine/magazine_Detail.asp?ID=686 Tablets ‚Äì T-commerce: Innovative Guest-facing Applications by Michael L. Kasavana, Ph.D., NCE, CHTP These new functionalities are mainly used by guests on their own mobile devices or such provided by the hotel in lobbies and/or rooms. A good PMS should give accurate and timely information on the basic key performance indicators of a hotel business such as average daily rate, RevPAR or occupancy rate and help the food and beverage management control the stocks in the store room and help deciding what to buy, how much and how often. ==Local government== Property management systems are used in local government authorities, since these authorities hold and manage large property estates ranging from schools, leisure centres, social housing and parks not to mention investment properties such as shops and industrial estates - even pubs. All of these are necessary income earners for a local authority, so the efficiency gained through an automated, computerized system is essential. ==Manufacturing and logistics industries== Property management systems are used to manage, control and account for personal property. Property is defined as the equipment, tooling and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair and maintain end item deliverables. Property Management involves the processes, systems and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including Acquisition, Control, Accountability, Maintenance, Utilization, and disposition. ==Commercial properties== Property Management systems allow local property managers and maintenance personnel to manage the day-to-day operations of their properties. Property maintenance for commercial properties includes major focus areas such as risk management, maintenance, communication, and tenant satisfaction. Usually a certain agreed percentage of the rent payment will be deducted on each rent payment collected by the property management as their service fee. There are also other ways of charging the property owners using the service but percentage collection is the common one. ==See also== *Hotel Technology Next Generation *Hotel reservation system *Computer reservation system *Computer-aided facility management *Property management software ==References== Category:Travel technology Category:Property management ","title":"Property management system"},{"id":"12374250","text":"NK Vinogradar is a Croatian football club based in the village of Loko≈°in Dol, part of the town of Jastrebarsko, currently playing in the Croatian third division. ==History== During the 1960s, people in Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages began to play football more seriously and to form the first football clubs. At the beginning of the 1970s, neighborhoods of Jastrebarsko as well the nearby villages began to play football tournaments. After one such tournament the idea was born of establishing NK Vinogradar (\\"FC Winegrower\\"). The idea was started by Mladen Bo≈æiƒçeviƒá, and supported by Francis Fabijaniƒá and ≈Ωeljko Jambroviƒá. The first meeting was held in the spring of 1973 in the premises of the fire brigade in Zdihovo, a village near Jastrebarsko. The club played in the local city league for most of its existence, taking two years off in 1992 and 1993 for the Croatian War of Independence. Around 1997, Ivan Rubiniƒá, the owner of a successful carpentry company, began financing the club. Under Rubiniƒá, the club rose from the county leagues to the Croatian second division where they played an important role between 2007 and 2013. In six seasons in the second division, the club only finished below mid-table once.http://stattosoftware.com/football/teams.php?team=NK%20Vinogradar During their rise, Vinogradar won the county cup in 2003, the year they were promoted to the fourth division. In June 2013, the club assembly decided to withdraw from Croatian second division due to increased financial requirements and the probable withdrawal of main club sponsor DIR. As a result, the club were relegated to the fifth division. However, the club achieved back-to-back promotions and for the 2015‚Äì16 season again played in the Treƒáa HNL. They won the 2016-17 and 2017-18 Western group, but due to financial disputes with the city of Jastrebarsko, did not apply for promotion to the 2. HNL. They defended their 3.HNL West title again in 2018-19, but again did not apply for a second division license. Cup history Vinogradar have reached the quarterfinals of the Croatian Football Cup four times as of 2018, never having advanced past that stage. During the 2010s, Vinogradar consistently qualified for the cup as one of the top 16 teams based on their coefficient. Their first cup appearance was in 2003-04, when they lost in the preliminary round. The club first made the 2005‚Äì06 Croatian Football Cup quarterfinals as a third division side, losing 10‚Äì1 to NK Rijeka on aggregate. Vinogradar also reached the quarterfinals of the 2011‚Äì12 Croatian Football Cup before losing to HNK Cibalia 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. Most impressively, Vinogradar reached the quarter- finals of the 2014‚Äì15 Croatian Football Cup as a fourth division side, beating two higher-placed teams in the process, NK Meƒëimurje from ƒåakovec and top flight side NK Slaven Belupo. The club then played Hajduk Split in the quarterfinals but lost 6‚Äì0 on aggregate. The season before, 2013‚Äì14, Vinogradar also played Hajduk Split in the second round of the cup, losing 1‚Äì3, but only after extra time. Vinogradar again made the quarterfinals in 2018 after beating Jadran Ploƒçe 4-2. However they were eliminated after losing 3-0 to Inter Zapre≈°iƒá. ==Stadium== In 1980 the Mladina sports complex opened. It is still home to the club and has undergone modern renovations. The small stadium is in a small valley. The western hill has a motocross track and forest and the other hill has a large vineyard. The stadium features one covered stand behind the north goal and one uncovered stand to the west. The east and southern parts of the complex are undeveloped. In 2017, Vinogradar began playing games in the SC Vojarna complex in the center of Jastrebarsko. Mladina hosted a Wales-Croatia under-19 match in 2018. ==Honours== Treƒáa HNL ‚Äì West: *Winners (4): 2006‚Äì07, 2016‚Äì17, 2017‚Äì18, 2018‚Äì19 ==ReferencesExternal links== *NK Vinogradar at Nogometni magazin Category:Association football clubs established in 1973 Category:Football clubs in Croatia Category:Football clubs in Zagreb County Category:1973 establishments in Croatia ","title":"NK Vinogradar"},{"id":"12374256","text":" USS Signet (AM-302) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. She received four battle stars during World War II. She was decommissioned in December 1945 and placed in reserve. In February 1955, while still in reserve, her hull number was changed from AM-302 to MSF-302, but she was not reactivated. She was transferred to the Dominican Republic in January 1965 and renamed Tortuguero (BM455) (or Tortugero in some sources). She was employed as a patrol vessel in Dominican Navy service. Her pennant number was changed from BM455 to C455 in 1995. Tortuguero was stricken and hulked in 1997. ==U.S. Navy service== Signet was laid down on 8 April 1943 by Associated Shipbuilders at Harbor Island Seattle, Washington, and was launched on 16 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Bernice Moore, and commissioned on 20 June 1944, Lieutenant Commander C. L. Grabenhorst, USNR, in command. Signet spent the summer of 1944 completing her fitting out and undergoing minesweeping trials, shakedown, and antisubmarine warfare training. On 26 August, she reported to the Commander, Western Sea Frontier, at San Francisco, California. That same afternoon, she departed San Francisco escorting SS Eugene Skinner to Honolulu. Over the next five months, the minesweeper made two voyages from Hawaii to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands and one to San Francisco. On all three occasions, she served as escort for supply ships. She visited Kwajalein while returning from her first voyage to the Western Pacific, and Majuro en route back from the second. Upon her return to Hawaii from San Francisco, California, on 3 December, Signet began a three-week period of availability, followed by patrols and exercises in the islands. On the morning of 22 January 1945, she sortied with the escorts of a convoy of 39 LSTs, LSMs, and LCIs bound for Eniwetok. The convoy arrived on 3 February and, after a day of logistics, Signet got underway for the Marianas en route to the Iwo Jima invasion. Signet saw her charges into Saipan Harbor on the 10th, then joined Sweep Unit 2 at Tinian. She stayed there four days, then sortied with Mine Unit 1 on 13 February headed for Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands. Signet arrived off Iwo Jima on 16 February, three days prior to the assault. The minesweeper remained in the vicinity of Iwo Jima until 7 March. During the intervening period, she swept mines and screened the transports, particularly during the nightly retirements from action. Her crew rescued a downed American flier during evening of 21 February and watched the U.S. Marines hoist the colors on the summit of Mount Suribachi on the 23d. On 4 March, Signet's crew began to understand the significance of Iwo Jima as they watched the first crippled B-29 land on its airfield. On 7 March after a little more than three weeks of sweeping, patrolling, and being harassed by enemy planes Signet cleared Iwo Jima for Ulithi Atoll in the Carolines. The minesweeper was at Ulithi from the 10th to the 19th. There her crew enjoyed rest and relaxation periods alternated with stints of work to prepare for the next operation: Okinawa. Signet sortied from Ulithi on the 19th, with the ships of six sweep units and a gunboat support division. They arrived off Kerama Retto, Okinawa Gunto, on the 25th and immediately began sweeping minefields around that stepping-stone to Okinawa. For the next three months, Signet swept mines, patrolled, screened transports, fought off air attacks, and supported ground troops. Up until 7 April, her gun crews had to content themselves with watching their sister ships and combat air patrols splash Japanese planes. That evening, however, the minesweeper received a message from indicating the approach of an enemy \\"Betty.\\" Soon Signet 's gunners were able to see the medium bomber's exhaust flames as it approached their ship. At 2033 the port guns opened fire. The plane passed low over the minesweeper and began to flame as the starboard gunners loosed their fusillade. Burning as he went, the Japanese plane splashed into the sea about 1,000 yards from Signet. The wreckage floated and burned for a while as Signet searched fruitlessly for survivors. Soon thereafter, she returned to her patrol station. On the night of 18 April, Signet supported the stranded crew of an LCVP. Under fire from entrenched Japanese, they requested light from Signet. The minesweeper responded, silencing the Japanese position each time her searchlight exposed them. This continued through most of the night. The stranded men were finally rescued by a tug early on the morning of the 19th. In early June, she supported the landings at Iheya Shima to the northwest of Okinawa, then returned to minesweeping and anti-suicide boat patrol. She departed Okinawa on 8 July, headed for the Philippines and made Leyte Gulf on the 13th. She remained in the Philippines through the cessation of hostilities on 15 August and departed Leyte on the 18th. She returned to Okinawa on the 24th and remained there until the 30th when she got underway with a large group of minesweepers to help sweep the Yellow Sea in support of the Korea occupation forces. For the first seven days of September, she made daily sweeps in the Yellow Sea and cleared the area at night. On 8 September, Signet headed for Japan and, the next morning, began sweeping the approaches to Sasebo. For two months, she swept the area around Sasebo during the day and anchored at Matsu Shima, Ky≈´sh≈´, at night. From late September until early October, her crew enjoyed liberty in Sasebo. From 11 to 21 October, Signet swept the area around Iki Island and Tsushima Island off the northwestern coast of Ky≈´sh≈´. Between 26 October and 10 November, Signet conducted operations in the East China Sea southwest of Ky≈´sh≈´. On her final sweep, 17 November to 5 December, Signet returned to the vicinity of Tsushima. On 11 December 1945, with her homeward- bound pennant flying, she departed Sasebo. With the other ships of Mine Squadron 12, she steamed out of the harbor, passing in review before Rear Admiral Struble Commander, Minecraft, Pacific Fleet, and receiving the salutes of the assembled ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Upon her return to the United States later that month Signet was placed out of commission, in reserve, and berthed at Orange, Texas. There she remained for the next 19 years. She was reclassified MSF-302 on 11 February 1955 and declared excess to the needs of the Navy in January 1965. Accordingly, her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 January 1965. Signet was sold to the Dominican Republic on 13 January 1965 under the terms of the Military Assistance Program. Awards Signet earned four battle stars during World War II. ==Dominican Navy service== The former Signet was acquired by the Dominican Republic on 13 January 1965 and renamed Tortuguero (BM455). Employed as a patrol vessel in Dominican Navy service, her pennant number was changed to C455 in 1995. Tortuguero was stricken and hulked in 1997. ==NotesReferences== * * ==External links== * Photo gallery at navsource.org Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Admirable- class minesweepers of the Dominican Navy ","title":"USS Signet (AM-302)"},{"id":"12374265","text":"Daniel Bissell may refer to: *Daniel Bissell (spy), American spy during the Revolutionary War *Daniel Bissell (general), American soldier, active during the War of 1812 *Daniel P.

It can be used to characterize the prime numbers, perfect numbers, deficient numbers, abundant numbers, and untouchable numbers, and to define the aliquot sequence of a number. ==Examples== For example, the proper divisors of 15 (that is, the positive divisors of 15 that are not equal to 15) are 1, 3 and 5, so the aliquot sum of 15 is 9 i.e. (1 + 3 + 5). The values of s(n) for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are: :0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7, 4, 8, 1, 16, 1, 10, 9, 15, 1, 21, 1, 22, 11, 14, 1, 36, 6, 16, 13, 28, 1, 42, 1, 31, 15, 20, 13, 55, 1, 22, 17, 50, 1, 54, 1, 40, 33, 26, 1, 76, 8, 43, ... ==Characterization of classes of numbers== write that the aliquot sum function was one of Paul Erd≈ës's \\"favorite subjects of investigation\\". It can be used to characterize several notable classes of numbers: *1 is the only number whose aliquot sum is 0. A number is prime if and only if its aliquot sum is 1. *The aliquot sums of perfect, deficient, and abundant numbers are equal to, less than, and greater than the number itself respectively. The quasiperfect numbers (if such numbers exist) are the numbers n whose aliquot sums equal n + 1\\\\. The almost perfect numbers (which include the powers of 2, being the only known such numbers so far) are the numbers n whose aliquot sums equal n ‚àí 1\\\\. *The untouchable numbers are the numbers that are not the aliquot sum of any other number. Their study goes back at least to Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (circa 1000 AD), who observed that both 2 and 5 are untouchable. Erd≈ës proved that their number is infinite. The conjecture that 5 is the only odd untouchable number remains unproven, but would follow from a form of Goldbach's conjecture together with the observation that, for a semiprime number pq, the aliquot sum is p + q + 1. ==Iteration== Iterating the aliquot sum function produces the aliquot sequence n, s(n), s(s(n)), ... of a nonnegative integer n (in this sequence, we define s(0) = 0). It remains unknown whether these sequences always converge (the limit of the sequence must be 0 or a perfect number), or whether they can diverge (i.e. the limit of the sequence does not exist). == See also == * Divisor Function : The sum of the (xth powers of the) positive divisors of a number ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Arithmetic dynamics Category:Arithmetic functions Category:Divisor function ","title":"Aliquot sum"},{"id":"12374303","text":"Catlettsburg Refinery The Catlettsburg Refinery is an American oil refinery.

The disc features Steve Perry from Journey on backing vocals on \\"Still in Love\\" and a duet with Eugene Wilde on \\"What If We Fall In Love\\". Many songs from the album were covered by other artists: Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris featured \\"Wanna Give My Love\\" and \\"What If We Fall In Love\\" on a 1987 duet album What If We Fall in Love; Celine Dion recorded \\"The Last to Know\\" on 1990's Unison; Patti LaBelle covered \\"Still In Love\\" on 1989's Be Yourself and Pia Zadora recorded \\"Floating Hearts\\" on 1989's Pia Z.

He was head of a wing of Cuba‚Äôs Communist Party until after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, when he allegedly quarrelled with Fidel Castro and left the country. He moved to Venezuela, where he became an insurance salesman. He was successful at this, and rose to control a conglomerate of insurance companies, banks, real estate, radio stations and newspapers. He was reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in Venezuela. His Grupo Empresas Latinoamericanas included the Banco Progreso in Venezuela, the Banco Progreso Internacional de Puerto Rico, and the Banco Latinoamericana in the Dominican Republic.Jorge Castro‚Äôs Illegal Campaign Contributions, and Why They Were Never Prosecuted in: Investigation of Political Fundraising Improprieties and Possible Violations of Law, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Interim Report, Sixth Report, Volume 3, House Report 105‚Äì829, November 5, 1998, pp. 2935-36 ==The fight over Banco de Venezuela== In 1990, he bought a large block of shares in the prestigious Banco de Venezuela (BdV), a bastion of Caracas's old-money elite, and tried to get on its board of directors. However, according to Castro, he was never accepted in exclusive political and economic circles and was considered unfit by the Venezuelan elite to lead the country‚Äôs most important banking institution. At a stockholders' meeting, when Castro wanted a seat on the board, BdV's chairman suspended the meeting and muffled Castro's protest by shutting off his microphone.The Troublemaker, Gaeton Fonzi, The Pennsylvania Gazette, November 1994 \\"Remembranzas de Orlando Castro\\", Dinero, May 1996. Available at ashenoff.com Retrieved on July 21, 2007 Castro now attempted a hostile takeover of BdV, which was bitterly contested by BdV's management. He worked through his subsidiary Grupo Progreso Latinoamericana, supported by Banco Consolidado of Jos√© Alvarez Stelling, and Grupo Banco Uni√≥n. A small group of shareholders, all members of the Caracas Country Club, joined with the Banco Provincial, the powerful industrial group Grupo Polar, and Finalven to oppose the takeover. BdV hired Thor Halvorssen Hellum, Special Commissioner for International Narcotic Affairs in the administration of President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, to investigate rumors of money laundering by Castro. Halvorssen concluded that Castro was laundering drug money and was involved in other financial irregularities. He gave his information to friendly members of the Venezuelan Congress, who had parliamentary immunity. Castro‚Äôs allies started a media campaign to discredit Halvorssen. Bombas por negocio Dinero, November 1, 1993 ==Money laundering accusations== In March 1991, after the allegations of money laundering were made public, the US Customs Service froze Banco Progreso accounts at Bank of America International in New York City. Castro employed his business associate Charles Intriago to counter the allegations. Intriago was Castro‚Äôs principal legal advisors on matters related to the United States. Castro Llanes had provided US$80,000 in start-up capital for Intriago‚Äôs newsletter Money Laundering Alert. Intriago eventually got US Customs to release the accounts. Intriago used his government connections to purge law enforcement files of information linking Castro Llanes to drug trafficking. He hired former US officials and investigators, who between 1991 and 1995 approached several different US government agencies for information. They eventually obtained DEA's intelligence files on Castro Llanes, and the names of at least four confidential informants against Castro Llanes for Customs. A former IRS agent working for Intriago found that some US$4 billion had passed through a Castro account in New York. He gave this information to US Customs agents and was fired by Intriago.Ex-Prosecutor Linked to Alleged Obstruction Effort , The Washington Post, September 16, 1999; Page A23.

Source: USGS Carbonate- hosted lead-zinc ore deposits are important and highly valuable concentrations of lead and zinc sulfide ores hosted within carbonate (limestone, marl, dolomite) formations and which share a common genetic origin. These ore bodies range from 0.5 million tonnes of contained ore, to 20 million tonnes or more, and have a grade of between 4% combined lead and zinc to over 14% combined lead and zinc. These ore bodies tend to be compact, fairly uniform plug-like or pipe-like replacements of their host carbonate sequences and as such can be extremely profitable mines. This classification of ore deposits is also known as Mississippi Valley Type or MVT ore deposits, after a number of such deposits along the Mississippi River in the United States, where such ores were first recognised; these include the famed Southeast Missouri Lead District of southeastern Missouri, and deposits in northeast Iowa, southwest Wisconsin, and northwest Illinois. Similarly Irish-type carbonate lead-zinc ores, exemplified by Lisheen Mine in County Tipperary, are formed in similar ways. ==Sources== The ultimate source of the mineralizing fluid(s) in MVT deposits is unknown. The ore fluids of MVT deposits are typically low temperature (100 ¬∞C-150 ¬∞C) and have the composition of basinal brines (10-30 wt.% NaCl equivalent) with pH's of 4.5-5 (buffered by host carbonates). This hydrothermal fluid may or may not carry the required sulfur to form sulfide minerals. Mobile hydrocarbons may have played a role in delivering reduced sulfur to certain MVT systems, while methane and other organic matter can potentially reduce sulfate carried by an acidic fluid. The ore fluid is suspected to be derived from clastic red bed sequences (potential metal source) that contain evaporites (potential sulfur source). ==Transport== Two potential transportation mechanisms for the metal-bearing ore fluid have been proposed. The first involves compaction of sediments in basins with rapid sedimentation. Mineralizing fluids within the basin become trapped within discrete, over-pressured aquifers and escape episodically and rapidly. The second fluid transportation mechanism is topographically-driven gravitational fluid flow. This occurs during uplift that is commonly associated with an orogenic event. One edge of a basin is uplifted during the formation of a foreland fold and thrust belt, and basinal fluids migrate laterally away from the deformation front as the basin is uplifted. Migration of the fluids through deep portions of the basin may result in the acquisition of metals and sulfur contained within the basin. ==Trap== The trap for carbonate-hosted lead-zinc sulfides is a chemical reaction which occurs as a consequence of concentration of sulfur, often hydrocarbons, and zinc and lead which are absorbed by the hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons can either leak out of the fault zone or fold hinge, leaving a stockwork of weakly mineralized carbonate- sulfide veins, or can degrade via pyrolysis in place to form bitumens. Once hydrocarbons are converted to bitumen, their ability to chelate metal ions and sulfur is reduced and results in these elements being expelled into the fluid, which becomes saturated in zinc, lead, iron and sulfur. Sulfide minerals such as galena, sphalerite, marcasite and pyrite thus form. Commonly MVT deposits form by the combination of hydrocarbon pyrolysis liberating zinc-lead ions and sulfur to form an acidic solution which dissolves the host carbonate formation and replaces it with massive sulfide accumulations. This may also take the morphology of fault-hosted stockworks, massive tabular replacements and so forth. Porous limestones may form disseminated ores, however most MVT deposits are massive sulfides with knife-like margins between carbonate and sulfide mineralogies. ==Mineralogy and alteration== Ore minerals in carbonate replacement deposits are typically lead sulfide, galena, and zinc sulfide sphalerite. Weathered equivalents form anglesite, cerussite, smithsonite, hydrozincite and secondary galena and sphalerite within the supergene zone. MVT and Irish type deposits are commonly associated with a 'dolomite front' alteration, which manifests as a yellow-cream wash of dolomite (calcium- magnesium carbonate) within calcite-aragonite assemblages of unaltered carbonate formations. Most ore bodies are quite sulfidic, and most are very low-iron, with pyrite-marcasite contents typically below 30% of the mass of sulfides. This makes MVT lead-zinc deposits particularly easy to treat from a metallurgical view. Some MVT deposits can, however, be very iron-rich and some sulfide replacement and alteration zones are associated with no lead-zinc at all, resulting in massive accumulations of pyrite-marcasite, which are essentially worthless. There is sometimes an association with quartz veining and colloform silica, however silicate gangue minerals are often rare. ==Oil synergies== The importance and synergies between hydrocarbon source-transport- trap 'fairways' and MVT and Irish Type lead-zinc deposits has been known for several decades. Often the prospectivity of particular carbonate formations for lead-zinc deposits of this nature is first identified by core drilling by oil explorers. This concept of a cogeneration of hydrocarbons and precursor brines by the same process allows many lead-zinc explorers to use hydrocarbon basin models to predict if a carbonate sequence is likely to host MVT or Irish Type mineralization. ==Exploration== Exploration for MVT deposits is relatively complex in theory and straightforward in practise. During the area selection phase, attention must be paid to the nature of the carbonate sequences, especially if there is a 'dolomite front' alteration identified within oil exploration wells, which is commonly associated with lead-zinc mineralisation. Thereafter, attention must be paid to picking floral facies of any reef carbonates formed from coral reef accumulations. The facies of the carbonate sequence is critical, as this is controlled mostly by faults which are the ultimate target of exploration. A fore-reef/back-reef transition is the 'sweet spot', and thus depending on the age of the carbonate sequence, familiarity with coral palaeontology is considered essential. Finally, once a basin model of the carbonate sequence is formulated, and the primary basin- margin faults are roughly identified, a gravity survey is often carried out, which is the only geophysical technique which can directly detect MVT deposits. Gravity surveys aim to detect significant accumulations of lead and zinc due to their greater density relative to their surrounding host rocks. Finally, the 'pointy end' of an exploration programme is to drill each and every one of the gravity targets in sequence, with no favour or prejudice given to the strength or amplitude of any anomaly. It is well known that unsubtle and unsophisticated methods of pattern drilling have found MVT deposits missed by more selective explorers, for instance the Lennard Shelf Deposits in Western Australia were found on the second last hole of an extensive drilling programme. == Similar deposit styles == Similar deposit styles may be encountered in sheared and deformed carbonate belts where zinc- lead sulfides are hosted at the sheared contact of carbonates with siliciclastic sequences. Examples include the Dharwar Basin zinc-lead deposits, India where sulfides are hosted in shears within dolomite sequences. ==Examples== * Admiral Bay, Zn-Pb-Ag deposit, Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, theorised to be an MVT replacement type (undeveloped) * Pine Point Mine, Zn-Pb, deposit, Northwest Territories, Canada.

This album includes Easton‚Äôs final US Top 20 hit to date, \\"What Comes Naturally\\", which remained on the pop chart for 10 weeks. The single reached number 4 in Australia, where the album also made the top 40. Other singles released were \\"You Can Swing It\\" and \\"To Anyone\\", both which failed to chart. Like her previous release, the 1988, \\"The Lover in Me\\", Easton's management sought to make the Scottish singer's image more accessible to a younger market. The artwork for the album cover to \\"What Comes Naturally\\", Art Direction and Design by John Coulte, features the singer in a solid black leotard and thigh high boots straddling a toddler's high chair. According to Mr. Coulte in a January 1991 interview with New York City based Reader's Digest, \\"We were going for a sort of tramped up ballerina who moonlights as either a casino craps dealer or a New Jeresy hairdresser with a gambling addiction. We struggled with props, ultimately going with a toddler's high chair over an infant's seesaw.\\" The album charted in the United States at number 90. Easton is the co-writer on three tracks on the album. Easton is one of the few Pop artists to adopt the new jack swing sound from the early 1990s with chart success. ==Track listingCharts== {  style=\\"width:40em;\\" - !YearSinglesChartPosition - rowspan=\\"8\\"1991 rowspan=\\"6\\"\\"What Comes Naturally\\" US Billboard Hot 100  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"19 - US Hot Dance Club Play  center;\\"39 - US Hot R&B; Singles  center;\\"39 - US Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales  center;\\"13 - New Zealand Singles Chart  center;\\"12 - Australian Singles Chart  center;\\"4 -  \\"You Can Swing It\\" - \\"To Anyone\\" } ==Production and personnel== * Track 1 arranged by Nick Mundy.

He primarily plays mandolin; however, he also plays fiddle, guitar, mandocaster and banjo. Skaggs was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2018. ==Biography== Early career Skaggs was born in Cordell, Kentucky. He started playing music at age 5 after he was given a mandolin by his father, Hobert Skaggs. At age 6, he played mandolin and sang on stage with Bill Monroe. At age 7, he appeared on television's Martha White country music variety show, playing with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. He also wanted to audition for the Grand Ole Opry at that time, but was told he was too young. In his mid-teens, Skaggs met a fellow teen guitarist, Keith Whitley, and the two started playing together with Whitley's banjoist brother Dwight on radio shows. By 1970, they had earned a spot opening for Ralph Stanley and Skaggs and Keith Whitley were thereafter invited to join Stanley's band, the Clinch Mountain Boys. Skaggs later joined The Country Gentlemen in Washington, DC, J. D. Crowe's New South. In 1976, Skaggs formed progressive bluegrass band Boone Creek, including members Vince Gill and Jerry Douglas. For a few years, Skaggs was a member of Emmylou Harris's Hot Band. He wrote the arrangements for Harris's 1980 bluegrass-roots album, Roses in the Snow. In addition to arranging for Harris, Skaggs sang harmony and played mandolin and fiddle in the Hot Band. ==Country career== Skaggs launched his own country career in 1980, achieving 12 No. 1 hits, 8 CMA awards, and 8 ACM awards. In 1982, he became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, the youngest to ever be inducted at that time. Guitarist and producer Chet Atkins credited Skaggs with \\"single-handedly\\" saving country music. Skaggs is considered one of the pioneers of the Neotraditional country sub-genre. In 1981, he debuted on Epic Records, Waitin for the Sun to Shine, which brought him to both the country and pop charts and produced two No. 1 hits. In 1982, he released Highways & Heartaches, his only platinum album, featuring the instrumental heavy Highway 40 Blues. Keeping with his instrumental heavy themes, he released \\"Country Boy\\" on the album of the same name. He also had Bill Monroe as a guest on this album. Exploring a role as producer, Skaggs produced Dolly Parton's album White Limozeen, which started her comeback in country music. Skaggs also guested on other albums. In 1995, he sang with Vince Gill on '\\"Go Rest High on That Mountain\\", which later won CMA's Song of the Year and was determined by BMI to be the Most-Performed Song in 1997. ==Later career== In 1996, Skaggs went back to his bluegrass roots, and also experimented with new sounds. With his band, Kentucky Thunder, he is a perennial winner of Grammy Awards and International Bluegrass Music Association for best bluegrass album. Skaggs performing in 2007 In 2000, he shared the stage with Vermont-based jam band, Phish. On March 20, 2007, Skaggs released an album with rock musician Bruce Hornsby. In 2008, Skaggs released an album he recorded with The Whites on his Skaggs Family Records label. In 2008, Skaggs recorded a bluegrass version of \\"Old Enough\\" by the Raconteurs with Ashley Monroe and the Raconteurs. He played the mandolin on the track as well as sharing vocals with Jack White, Brendan Benson, and Ashley Monroe. In 2011, Skaggs, along with other musicians including the Irish band The Brock McGuire Band, released their album 'Green Grass Blue Grass\\", an exploration of the connection between Irish Traditional Music and American Bluegrass and Appalachian music. Ricky Skaggs and Sharon White, McGlohon Theater, Charlotte, NC, August 19, 2015 Also in 2011, Skaggs contributed to Moody Bluegrass TWO...Much Love, a bluegrass tribute album to the British Progressive Rock band the Moody Blues. Skaggs sang lead vocal on the song \\"You And Me\\". In 2012, Skaggs collaborated with Barry Gibb on the song, \\"Soldier's Son\\" which was released on Music to My Ears. In 2015, Skaggs toured with Ry Cooder, Sharon White and other members of The Whites. In 2016, he produced the Grammy- winning album Love Remains for Lady Antebellum member Hillary Scott. In 2019, he collaborated with Steven Curtis Chapman for Chapman's album Deeper Roots: Where the Bluegrass Grows In 2019, Skaggs performed at the 6th Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum Concert and Induction Ceremony. As of recent years, Skaggs continues performing at the historic Grand Ole Opry house in Nashville, Tennessee. ==Personal life== Ricky Skaggs was previously married to Brenda Stanley and has two children, Andrew and Mandy, from that relationship. Skaggs has been married to Sharon White of The Whites since August 1981. They have 2 children; a daughter, Molly, and a son, Lucas.

The game was released in North America on June 9, 2009 (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), in southwestern parts of North America (Microsoft Windows) as well as Oceania on June 10, and in Europe on June 12. Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on July 14, 2015 alongside the sequel as Prototype Biohazard Bundle. Separate versions of the games became available in August 2015. Set in Manhattan, the game follows a powerful amnesiac shapeshifter named Alex Mercer who must stop an outbreak of Blacklight, a plague that mutates individuals into hideous violent monsters. During his quest, Alex tries to uncover his past while also coming into conflict with both the US military and a black operations force called Blackwatch. Parallel to the game's storyline is the ability to play the game as a sandbox-style video game giving the player freedom to roam Manhattan. The game was a critical and commercial success, with critics praising the game for its originality and engaging gameplay. Many reviewers compared and contrasted it with Infamous, another open world action- adventure game released one month prior to Prototype. A sequel, Prototype 2, was released in April 2012. ==Gameplay== Alex's primary superpower is his ability to shapeshift, changing his body into anyone. Going hand-in-hand with this power is his ability to \\"consume\\" others, absorbing them entirely. This process allows Alex to quickly regain health by absorbing the biomass of his enemies. This also allows him to take on the forms of the human enemies he absorbs, thereby allowing the player to move about the enemy as one of them. The disguise will only last as long as Alex remains inconspicuous. Alex has incredible physical strength, and will kill most humans in a single punch. He can perform various melee attacks without shapeshifting, as well as more gymnastic moves such as air combos, sliding along the ground using any humanoid enemy's body, and a high-speed rolling cannonball attack. Alex can also transform parts of his body into a selection of martial implements acquired over the course of the game, either as purchased upgrades or being given them. Offensive powers include the large and powerful Blade arm, fast razor-sharp Claws (which can also erupt large spikes from the ground), the telescoping Whipfist, Musclemass that augments his strength, and the slow but powerful Hammerfists. Defensive options consist of a large shield on Alex's left arm for blocking ballistic attacks that needs to regenerate after excessive damage, and full body armor that exchanges agility and speed for toughness in hand-to-hand combat; both will allow Alex to plow through most obstacles when active. Vision modes include thermal vision, which allows Alex to see enemies through smoke and other obstacles at the expense of a decreased vision range, and Infected vision, which highlights those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus as well as military units. Both vision modes muffle all of Alex's other senses, such as hearing, in order to concentrate on his sight. One defensive and offensive power may be active at a time, and using either will negate Alex's current disguise. In addition to his own abilities, Alex can take the weapons from defeated or absorbed enemies. These include automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and missile launchers. He can also seize control of military vehicles, such as tanks and helicopters. Alex's most powerful attacks are the Devastators, which require Alex to be in Critical Mass- either a state of near-death or the exact opposite, having excess stored biomass and increased health. These include the Tendril Barrage, which fires impaling tendrils from his body in all directions, the Groundspike Graveyard, which erupts massive spikes from the ground all around Alex, and the Critical Pain, which fires a single beam of hardened biomass from his hands to severely damage a single target. For movement around the city, Alex uses his increased physical abilities. When sprinting, he will automatically hop over cars, barriers and other obstacles without losing momentum. Alex will also scale any wall he comes into contact with and simply knock aside any humanoids that get in his way without stopping. He can jump great heights and distances, enough to clear five-story buildings, and can sprint at extreme speed indefinitely. Falls cause no damage to the player even from the greatest heights. Even small jumps are enough for Alex to dent the ground beneath him, and falls from sufficient heights will create shockwaves at the point of impact which will kill most humans nearby and send objects as large as cars flying. Falling height also factors into several of Alex's melee attacks. Enemies in the game are the Infected: those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus, and the Military. The Infected consist of ordinary civilians infected with the virus that are generally not a threat to Alex. However, the Hunters, huge creatures created from Infected water towers, are one of the main enemies in the game. Evolved Hunters referred to as Leaders are one of the most powerful creatures in the game and are incredibly hard for Alex to kill. The Military consist of ordinary soldiers which are usually not a threat to Alex, although they are capable of operating weaponry that is extremely dangerous to Alex, such as tanks and heavily armed helicopters. The Military also consists of BLACKWATCH, an agency dedicated to combating biological and nuclear warfare. BLACKWATCH is one of the intricate parts of the game's story and create some of the most deadly biological weaponry to combat Alex, including viral detectors capable of detecting Alex even in his disguise, and, introduced later in the game, the deadly poison Bloodtox, capable of slowly killing Alex and the Infected. Introduced later in the game are heavily armored and durable soldiers referred to as Super Soldiers, capable of fighting against Alex and some of the strongest Infected. In order to gain more advanced upgrades, Alex is capable of sneaking into Military Bases using a disguise and stealthily consume various officials within the base. He can also set off an alert within the base, in which the only way to escape is to slaughter whoever is in the base. Alex can also gain upgrades from the Infected by collecting genetic data. Infected Hives, like Military Bases, are located all over the city, and produce genetic data constantly. Alex can destroy the Infected Hives or simply absorb the data on the outside as it is being produced. At the start of the game, only small factions of the Infected and Military are present in the city. However, as the game progresses, the Military and the Infected begin to expand. Territory in the city is made out of three distinct zones. Blue Zones are in Military control and are relatively clean of the Infection. Red Zones thrive with the Infection, although there still remains a strong Military presence. In some areas of the city, a Blue Zone and a Red Zone might converge, creating a new and distinct Purple Zone. In these Zones, the Military and the Infected are in a constant battle for control. How the player decides to act in these Zones determine which faction seizes the territory. The game takes place in a medium-sized version of Manhattan with all its famous landmarks, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, 40 Wall Street, 28 Liberty Street, the Conde Nast Building, the Metlife Building, One New York Plaza, and the New York Life Building, among others. ==Plot== The game follows Alexander J. \\"Alex\\" Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to \\"consume\\" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by Jeffrey Pierce), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex. Alex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by Lake Bell), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT, and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeats Cross, when Cross mentions 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a pathologist linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills. Alex later finds and kills Karen in revenge for setting him up. The origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in Hope, Idaho, designed to target predetermined races. Although the entire town was infected, no ill effects manifested until Elizabeth Greene's infection. An anomaly in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code and causing her to take control of the infected town, becoming hostile in the process. The entire population of Hope, Idaho was liquidated by Blackwatch with only Greene and her son, codenamed PARIAH, surviving. Although kept separate, the two were held in captivity for further research. With samples taken from Greene's blood, Gentek's team led by Mercer synthesized the current strain of BLACKLIGHT virus. Alex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to leaks and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as \\"insurance\\". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in Penn Station. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance, shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level. The contact and Alex pump a new \\"BLOODTOX\\" biological agent underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. Alex, with the help of the contact - revealed to be Cross - infiltrates the USS Ronald Reagan to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ (New York Zero, the name given to the city after the outbreak) they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough to survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the Atlantic Ocean with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow. During the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has \\"become something less than human, but also something more\\". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, with the virus close to eradicated. Alex, standing on top of the Reuters Building in Times Square, comments that his work is almost done. ==Development and release== The main protagonist Alex Mercer is voiced by Canadian actor Barry Pepper. Alex's sister Dana Mercer is voiced by Lake Bell and the primary antagonist, Robert Cross (CODENAME: THE SPECIALIST) is voiced by Jeff Pierce. Phil LaMarr voiced Dr. Bradley Ragland, who was helping Alex when Cross injected him with an Anti-Blacklight virus. Alex Mercer ex-girlfriend Karen Parker is voiced by Vanessa Marshall. Alex's boss Dr. Raymond McMullen is voiced by Paul Guilfoyle who also played Jim Brass in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Gordon Clapp voiced Gen. Peter Randall who wants to contain Alex. Randall 2nd in-command Ian Taggart is voiced by Richard McGonagle. Kari Wahlgren voiced Elizabeth Green also known as \\"The Mother\\" who was infected with the virus in 1969.

All additional characters are voiced by Dave Fennoy, Dave Wittenberg, David Andriole, David Lodge, and Diane Hsu. Comic book A six-issue comic book series made by DC Comics Wildstorm was a spin-off as a prequel to the game and released alongside. It reveals more about Hope Idaho, Elizabeth Greene, and the viral outbreak. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Prototype was released on Steam as well as in retail stores and topped the Steam sales on the week of its release. The Xbox 360 version of Prototype was the top selling game of June 2009 in North America, with over 419,900 units sold. This made the game a Platinum Hit. As of March 2012, the game had sold 2.1 million copies worldwide. GameSpot praised the game for its \\"intriguing storyline and protagonist\\" and \\"massive arsenal of moves and abilities\\", but criticized it for its \\"occasionally fiddly controls\\" and \\"dull scenery\\". The Escapist said the Xbox 360 version was a perfect \\"summer fling,\\" praising the combat and movement systems as well as the unique mechanic of the Web of Intrigue. The A.V. Club gave the same console version an \\"A‚àí\\" ranking, calling the movement style \\"exhilarating\\" and saying it was a \\"mature, science-fiction superhero fantasy that somehow makes players feel simultaneously powerful and vulnerable.\\" 411Mania gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"an entirely different type of sandbox game that will attract and please most gamers.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it a similar score of eight out of ten and said it \\"offers an action-filled experience that few games can match, and the array of attacks on offer is almost unparalleled in both its variety and its easy accessibility. The pure adrenaline-boosting entertainment value of the finished product is enough to push most visual and gameplay niggles far enough into the background so as to eradicate them as concerns in all but the most snobbish of gamers.\\" Edge also gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game \\"does what it does, and does it with distinction.\\" However, Teletext GameCentral gave it five out of ten, concluding, \\"The initial feelings of power and freedom hide another badly designed and unimaginative superhero sim.\\" Prototype was released two weeks after Sucker Punch Productions' Infamous, a game with many similar concepts including a character with superpowers, and a large open world environment that can be traveled by climbing up buildings and gliding about the city. This led many game critics to compare and contrast the games. In his Zero Punctuation review of Prototype, Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw compared the two games point for point, and determined that he could not tell which was the better game - Prototype won on open world gameplay and combat, while Infamous won on story and side missions. To decide which one was better, he jokingly stated that he'd award the best game to the team which created the best picture of the other main character wearing \\"a woman's bra\\". To his surprise, both development teams rose to the challenge, producing said images, and forcing Croshaw to call it a near-tie, edging out in favor of Infamous, though he still noted that, like their games, both images created independently were nearly equal in the themes that they included. A review on GameSpot.com says: \\"[Mercer is an] incredibly fun character to play as in a game that also counts an intriguing story, varied missions, and some memorable boss battles among its features.\\" ==Sequel== Prototype 2 was released on April 24, 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on July 24, 2012 in North America and July 30, 2012 in Europe for Windows. Prototype 2 takes place three years after the events of the first game and stars a new protagonist, U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller. Alex Mercer, on the other hand, becomes the franchise's main antagonist. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2009 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Activision games Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:Hack and slash games Category:Video games about genetic engineering Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Parkour video games Category:Radical Entertainment games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games about shapeshifting Category:Video games about viral outbreaks Category:Stealth video games Category:Superhero video games Category:Bioterrorism in fiction Category:Video games scored by Cris Velasco Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Video games set in 2008 Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Biopunk ","title":"Prototype (video game)"},{"id":"12374530","text":"Li Kui may refer to: *Li Kui (legalist), government minister in the Wei state *Li Kui (chancellor), chancellor of the Tang Dynasty *Li Kui (Water Margin), fictional character in the Water Margin ","title":"Li Kui"},{"id":"12374539","text":"A Combined Anti-Armor Team or Combined Arms Assault Teams, (CAAT) is an organization of a United States Marine Corps weapons company where one or more platoons are operated in a detached role to combat ground armored vehicles and air defense vehicles with heavy weapons systems. CAATs often use weapon systems such as M2 .50 caliber machine guns, Mk-19 grenade launchers, and anti-armor missile systems such as BGM-71 TOW missiles and/or FGM-148 Javelins . In the Marine Corps, members of a CAAT are typically weapons company infantrymen who receive additional training in the CAAT role as well as cross training in all of the weapons systems employed by the CAAT. In addition to their usual role of dedicated anti-armor operations, CAATs are a vehicle- mounted heavy weapons quick reaction force for the infantry units they support. CAATs may also serve as security elements for a variety of military elements. == Personnel == A USMC CAAT is composed of 0331 Machine Gunners and 0352 Antitank Missile Gunners pulled from the Marine weapons company Antiarmor Platoon and Heavy Machine Gun Platoon, These will be led by 0365 Infantry Squad Leaders, who in turn will be led by 0369 Infantry Unit Leaders and 0306 Infantry Weapons Officers. == Basic operations against armored vehicles == In its most basic role, a CAAT platoon and its various sections and teams will engage armored vehicles at standoff ranges, where the enemy will be unable to effectively engage the CAATs forces. Due to the highly mobile, but lightly armored nature, the CAAT will employ ambush tactics or flanking maneuvers to engage the enemy from unexpected directions. Heavily armored vehicles such as main battle tanks will be engaged by the anti-armor missile sections, while lighter threats such as armored personnel carriers will be engaged by the machine-gun or grenade launcher sections. The machine-gun and grenade launcher sections also act as protection against enemy infantry, which anti-armor sections are very weak against. == Reconnaissance Missions == CAATs are often used by battalion commanders as reconnaissance platoons. This is due in part to the armor threat with the fight against isis being non-existent. These missions are allowed due to these teams being so mobile, along with the extensive training each member of a CAAT is cross trained in, along with the capability of members of a CAAT platoon having special training pertaining to mission specific requirements. CAAT members are also extensively trained in Military Operations on Urban Terrain, (MOUT) Close Quarters Battle, (CQB) and multiple small arms operations. Additional missions According to \\"Machine Guns and Machine Gun Gunnery\\"; in the defense CAAT could be assigned such missions as \\"...conducting anti-armor ambushes forward of the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA), supporting a combat outpost, or reinforcing a counter attack force.\\" (MCWP 3-15.1 6-8) In the offense, CAAT \\"...can act as a motorized scout element that seeks to find and maintain contact with the enemy while the unit‚Äôs main body maneuvers to engage, or they can conduct route reconnaissance and provide reports about the trafficability of a unit‚Äôs planned route of march.\\" (MCWP 3-15.1 6-8) ==Organization of a CAAT platoon== A CAAT is not a formal unit, but an ad-hoc organization of the existing weapons company. As such, it has no formal Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE), and no set size or precisely defined organization. With that said, it typically makes use of the weapons company section format, with each section being dedicated to a single weapons system. Operationally, the sections are broken up and organized into teams, with each team composed of 2-4 vehicles equipped with a combination of weapons systems, most usually a single anti- armor missile system and 1-2 machine guns or automatic grenade launchers. A vehicle will be led by an NCO. With a team being led by either an NCO, SNCO, or officer depending on the exact organization. There are many roles in the CAAT. listed below are some of the most common roles of each member in the CAAT. *Vehicle Commander (VC) - The vehicle commander makes all decisions regarding the vehicle and its inhabitants. The VC will usually be on the radio (or other communications device, i.e., laptop) and communicate directly with other vehicles. Exceptions to this rule are officers who usually have another Marine use the radio. *Driver - The driver not only drives the vehicle but is responsible for its entire upkeep and maintenance. The driver coordinates with the motor pool and its Marines to ensure timely repairs and maintenance. In addition, during ship-borne deployment, the driver is responsible whenever the vehicle must be moved. During missions, the driver takes cues from the VC as to where to go and how to get there. *Gunner - The gunner maintains and operates the gun, and also provides a view to the VC from atop the vehicle. The gunner is quite visible in the turret of the vehicle, and so he can also be a communicator to any people outside the vehicle. *Corpsman - The platoon's Corpsman is a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman with additional field medical training. The corpsman takes a full part in operations with the rest of the team, but also provides medical assistance and coverage when necessary. *Dismount - The dismount is responsible for anything that needs to be done outside of the vehicle such as obtaining visual information that is not possible from the vehicle's point of view. This billet may be combined with any of the other billets, except usually not for the VC or the driver. *Ammo man - The Ammo man is another combined billet. When the gunner is using the gun, someone may be responsible for taking old ammo and providing the gunner with live ammo (missiles or rounds). This improves the rate of fire of the weapons system. ==See also== *Mobile Assault Platoon ==References External links == *3/3's CAAT platoon, deployed to Afghanistan as of late 2007 *CAAT Photo by Gunnery Sgt.

He also won the WBO junior flyweight title in 2000, but was stripped of the title for failing a drug test. == Professional career == Grigsby turned pro in 1988 and lost his second professional fight, to flyweight legend Michael Carbajal who was making his professional debut. In 1998 he captured the vacant IBF light flyweight title by decisioning Ratanapol Sor Vorapin. He defended the belt once before losing it to Ricardo Lopez in 1999.

Robert Carl (born July 12, 1954 in Bethesda, Maryland) is an American composer who currently resides in Hartford, Connecticut, where he is chair of the composition program at the Hartt School, University of Hartford. ==Music== Carl studied with Jonathan Kramer, George Rochberg, Ralph Shapey, and Iannis Xenakis. From each respectively, the composer has commented that he feels he learned about time, history, counterpoint/phrasing, and form. His music finds its roots in the spirit of eclectic juxtapositions, transcendentalism, and experiment embodied in the output of Charles Ives and other American \\"ultramodernists\\", including Carl Ruggles.Carl, Robert. \\"Macro- Structure in Carl Ruggles's Sun-Treader: A Fearful Symmetry\\", Sonus, Vol.15, No.2 Spring 1995 Carl‚Äôs music until 1997 tends to explore different styles, and to create unusual syntheses thereof. A history major as an undergraduate at Yale University, he has felt that the musical past is a fertile source to be manipulated for new expressive purposes. Duke Meets Mort (1992) is a saxophone quartet that interprets the harmonic changes of Duke Ellington‚Äôs Mood Indigo in the voice of Morton Feldman. Time/Memory/Shadow (1988) is a double trio (piano quintet and harp) based on a march written in the composer‚Äôs adolescence, which is slowly ‚Äúexcavated‚Äù in the course of the piece, and only revealed at the end. From 1998, starting with Open for string trio, Carl‚Äôs music has become less referential. Since 2001 he has developed a technique of basing his harmonies on the overtone series, with common partials above different fundamentals serving as pivots for progressions and modulations. In American Music in the Twentieth Century, critic Kyle Gann described Carl's more recent style: \\"(he) has settled into a more serene, meditative idiom, but still with a dissonant edge.\\"Gann, Kyle. American Music in the Twentieth Century. New York: Schirmer Books, 1997. Pg. 250. More recent works that represent this approach include The Wind‚Äôs Trace Rests on Leaves and Waves (2005) for string quintet (premiered by the Miami String Quartet and Robert Black); Marfantasie (2004) for electric guitar and large ensemble; Shake the Tree for piano four-hands (2005); A Musical Enquiry Into the Sublime and Beautiful (2006‚Äì07) for chamber orchestra; La Ville Engloutie (2007) for wind ensemble; Fourth Symphony (2008); The Geography of Loss (2010) for soprano, baritone, chamber chorus, and instrumental octet; and Piano Quintet, \\"Search\\" (2012). Carl also frequently collaborates with sculptor Karen McCoy, creating sound components of installation art works, including pieces for the Sculpture Key Festivals of 2009 and 2010, and the 2013 Wintergreen Festival. Carl's music has been released by Innova Recordings, New World Records, BMOPSound, and Centaur Records, among others. He has received both the Charles Ives Fellowship and a Music Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, as well as grants from the NEA and Chamber Music America. ==Writings== Since 1994, Carl has been a critic for Fanfare magazine, where he writes extensively on new music recordings. In addition, he has completed a book on Terry Riley‚Äôs In C, published in 2009 by Oxford University Press. His interest in Japanese music (Carl often performs his own music on the shakuhachi) led to a residency in Tokyo in spring 2007, which resulted in interviews with 25 contemporary Japanese composers. In 2013, Carl published \\"Eight Waves a Composer Will Ride in This Century\\" on an emerging common practice period that he observes in twenty-first-century compositional practice, based on the universality of music technology, globalism, cross- disciplinary collaboration, and sonic essentialism. This essay has become the basis for Music Composition in the 21st Century: A Practical Guide for the New Common Practice, to be published by Bloomsbury in 2020. He has also edited the final (posthumous) book of Jonathan Kramer, Postmodern Music, Postmodern Listening, also published by Bloomsbury. ==Selected works== Orchestral and Ensemble * Symphony No. 2 \\"Liberty and/or Death\\" (1989‚Äì1992) *Marfantasie for electric guitar and large ensemble (2004) *A Musical Enquiry Into the Sublime and Beautiful for chamber orchestra (2006‚Äì2007) *La Ville Engloutie for wind ensemble (2007) * Symphony No. 4 \\"The Ladder\\" (2008) *Rocking Chair Serenade for string orchestra (2013) *Symphony No. 5, \\"Land\\" (2013) *What's Underfoot for chamber orchestra (2016) *Symphony No. 6, \\"Dome of Refuge\\" (2017) ; Chamber Music * String Quartet No. 1 \\"A Path between Cloud and Light\\" (1985) *Roundabout for contrabass and fixed electronic part (1988) *Time/Memory/Shadow for double trio (piano, 2 violins, viola, cello, harp or synthesizer/sampler) (1988) *Duke Meets Mort for saxophone quartet (1992) *A Sampler of the Senses for viola, cello and piano (1994) *Open for string trio (1998) * Violin Sonata No. 2 \\"Angel Skating\\" (1999) * String Quartet No. 2 \\"Fear of Death/Love of Life\\" (2001) * Piano Trio No. 2 \\"The Blossom\\" (2002) *Excavating the Perfect Farewell for viola and piano (2003) *The Wind's Trace Rests on Leaves and Waves for string quintet (2005) *A Clean Sweep for shakuhachi and Max/MSP (2005) *River's Bend for flute duo (2012) * Piano Quintet, \\"Search\\" (2013) *Open/Empty for Pierrot sextet (2014) *Jyun On for two shakuhachis and ichigenkin (2016) *Piano Quartet, \\"Just Listen\\" (2018) ; Piano * Piano Sonata No.1 \\"Spiral Dances\\" (1984) *Piano Sonata No. 2, \\"The Big Room\\" (1993-99) *Braided Bagatelles for solo piano (2001) *Shake the Tree for piano four-hands (2005) *Piano Sonata No. 3, \\"Clouds of Clarification\\" (2014) ; Vocal *Our Heart and Home Is with Infinitude for soprano and piano (1998) *Simic Songs, 15 Madrigals for 4 voices on poems of Charles Simic (2004) *Geography of Loss, for soprano, baritone, chamber choir, and eight instrumentalists (2010) *Harmony, opera in two acts (libretto by Russell Banks) (2018) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Carl, Robert. 2009.

He was a scholar and jurist who played an important role in the Sunni struggle against the SÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´ øa missionaries and successfully opposed the progress of Mu'tazilism in the Abbasid Caliphate during the 10th‚Äì11th (4th‚Äì5th AH) centuries. His books include creedal and methodological refutations against the Shias, Qadaris, Mu'tazilis and Ash'aris. ==Biography== Al-Barbahari was born in Baghdad, Iraq, and learned from the students of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. In addition, al-Barbahari took Ibn Hanbal's views and championed them. Al-Barbahari had several widely known students, including the famed scholar Ibn Battah. His status as an authority within the Hanbali school was not universal, however, and al-Barbahari and his students were often in conflict with Abu Bakr al-Khallal, generally considered to be the sole preserver and codifier of the school.Christopher Melchert, The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law: 9th‚Äì10th Centuries C.E., p. 150. Issue 4 of Studies in Islamic Law and Society, V. 4. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. While al- Barbahari contributed little to jurisprudence, he was well known as a polemicist. His book Sharh as-Sunnah was written to educate the Atharis in methods to identify heretics.Joseph Norment Bell, Love Theory in Later ·∏§anbalite Islam, p. 49. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1979.

His audience was strong in the Hanbalite quarter of the city.Gerhard B√∂wering, The Mystical Vision of Existence in Classical Islam: The Qur'anic Hermeneutics of the Sufi Sahl At- Tustari, Parts 283‚Äì896, p. 89.

He was very influential among the urban lower classes, and exploited popular grievances to foment what often turned into mob violence against religious minorities and supposed sinners.Ira M.

Kraemer, Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam: The Cultural Revival During the Buyid Age, p. 61. Volume 7 of Studies in Islamic culture and history. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1992. From 921 until his death in 941 CE, al-Barbahari fought for orthodox Sunni thought and practice, leading masses of Sunnis in actions to stop the sale of wine and visits to the \\"tombs of certain religious figures\\", destroy musical instruments, combat Shiism and Mu'tazilism. Under the influence of al-Barbahari and popular pressure of his followers, the Caliphs Al-Muqtadir and Al-Qahir enforced Sunni orthodoxy (according to Athari creed) as the state creed, exiling and imprisoning al-Barbahari's enemies and even burying renowned Muslim historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari -- considered a heretic by most Atharis at the time -- in secret due to fears of mob violence were a funeral to be held at the public graveyard. The efforts of al-Barbahari and the Baghdad Atharis were put to an end in 935 by the new Caliph Ar-Radi. Al-Barbahari had ordered groups to check any homes suspected of containing wine or musical instruments. The crowds confiscated from shops and physically enforced female entertainers to leave their practices.Christopher Melchert, Studies in Islamic Law and Society, vol. 4, p. 151. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. Ar-Radi ended the favored status of the Atharis. ==Thought== Like other Hanbali, Barbahari strongly opposed bid ªah (religious innovation), defined as anything that the first generation of Muslims, (known as the Companions of the Prophet or Sahabah), \\"did not do\\". Thus he taught that \\"whoever asserts that there is any part of Islam with which the Companions of the Prophet did not provide us has called them [the Companions of the Prophet] liars\\". While not opposed to reason in religion, provided it was put to good use and did not contradict doctrine such as divine attributes, he nonetheless, opposed asking \\"'Why?' and 'How?' Theology, polemic, disputation, and argument are an innovation which casts doubt into the heart\\".Cook, Michael, The Koran, a very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2000, p.109 == See also == * Islamic scholars * Notable Hanbali Scholars == References == Category:940 deaths Category:Hanbalis Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:People from Baghdad Category:Hadith scholars Category:Iraqi Sunni Muslims Category:Year of birth unknown Category:10th-century people of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:10th-century Arabs Category:10th-century jurists ","title":"Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari"},{"id":"12374597","text":"My Cherie is the 12th album by Scottish singer Sheena Easton, released in 1995 on MCA Records.

She received four battle stars during World War II. She was decommissioned in December 1945 and placed in reserve. In February 1955, while still in reserve, her hull number was changed from AM-303 to MSF-303, but she was not reactivated. She was transferred to the Dominican Republic in January 1965 and renamed Separaci√≥n (BM455). She was employed as a patrol vessel in Dominican Navy service and renamed Prestol Botello in 1976. Her pennant number was changed from BM454 to C454 during a 1995 refit. , Prestol Botello remained in active service for the Dominican Navy. == U.S. Navy service == Skirmish was laid down on 8 April 1943 by Associated Shipbuilders of Harbor Island, Seattle, Washington; launched on 16 August 1943; and commissioned on 30 June 1944, Lt. Bruce M. Hyatt, USNR, in command. After completing fitting out and trials in the Seattle area and shakedown and anti-submarine warfare training out of San Pedro, California, and San Diego, California, respectively, Skirmish departed the west coast on 2 September 1944. The minesweeper escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving on 9 September. After 20 days of minesweeping and antisubmarine drills in the Hawaiian Islands, Skirmish stood out of Pearl Harbor to escort USS Boreas (AF-8) to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The two ships arrived on 12 October, and Skirmish departed the next day to return to Pearl Harbor. Upon her return, on 20 October, she resumed training exercise around Oahu until 3 November when she formed up with a San Francisco-bound convoy. She stayed in San Francisco for a week from 14 to 21 November, visited Los Angeles, California, from the 21st to the 23d, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 December. On 12 December, Comdr. L. F. Freeburghouse broke his pennant in Skirmish, and she became the flagship of the Commander, Mine Squadron 12. Following a yard overhaul and more exercises Skirmish departed the Hawaiian Islands on 22 January 1945 in the screen of another Eniwetok-bound convoy, arriving on 4 February. This time she did not return to Pearl Harbor. Instead, she departed Eniwetok the next day in company with a large contingent of landing craft, escort ships, and minesweepers. Sailing by way of Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas, Skirmish arrived off Iwo Jima, in the Volcano Islands, on 16 February. For the next three days, she and the other minesweepers conducted sweeps. Then, after the assault on 19 February, she remained in the area on the \\"ping line\\" to give advance warning of air attack or submarines. On 8 March, she cleared Iwo Jima for Ulithi Atoll in the Carolines, arriving on 10 March and remaining until the 19th. On 25 March, Skirmish arrived off Okinawa, the major island of the Ryukyus, and commenced sweeping the waters around the island. During the evening of the following day, an enemy \\"Betty\\" swooped in on her port side, firing as it closed. Up went the cry, \\"Action to port,\\" as all guns blazed away at the intruder. As the twin-engine bomber passed over her bow, Skirmish's fusillade ripped into its engines, causing a storm of parts to rain down on her forecastle deck. The \\"Betty\\" continued across the bow and splashed to starboard. The minesweeper continued to patrol and sweep around Okinawa until 8 July, putting into port periodically at either Buckner Bay or Kerama Retto. From 26 March on, action was not so close as on that date, but Skirmish's crew continued to fight off air attacks and sweep mines. She suffered her only casualty of the war at Okinawa on 2 April, when a dud crashed into a 20 millimeter gun mount, demolishing it and killing one sailor. On 8 July, Skirmish sailed from Okinawa for San Pedro Bay area of Leyte Gulf. She was still at Leyte on 10 August when the news of the Japanese surrender offer came. The whole bay exploded into one gigantic 4th-of-July celebration - searchlights blazing, sirens screaming and fireworks going off everywhere. By the 18th, everyone settled down with the realization that there was much to be done in spite of the cessation of hostilities. Accordingly, Skirmish got underway with the other minesweepers on 18 August to return to Buckner Bay. She stayed at Okinawa for a week and a day, from 22 to 30 August, then departed to sweep the Yellow Sea in support of the Korea occupation forces. From 1 to 7 September, she swept in the area of the Korean coast then headed for Sasebo, Japan, where she swept the approaches to Sasebo and Nagasaki. During the ensuing three months she continued operations around Ky≈´sh≈´, departing that area once to sweep a shallow field in the Tsushima Strait. On 11 December, Skirmish hoisted her homeward bound pennant and led Mine Squadron 12 in review before Rear Admiral Struble, Commander, Minecraft Pacific Fleet. As they sailed out of Sasebo, the ships assembled in the harbor rendered honors, and the crews of two cruisers, USS Boston (CL-69) and USS Oklahoma City (CL-90) were paraded in dress blues. Upon arrival in the United States later in December, Skirmish was placed out of commission, in reserve, and berthed at Orange, Texas. She remained there for the next 19 years. She was redesignated MSF-303 on 11 February 1955 and declared excess to the needs of the Navy in January 1965. Her name was struck from the Navy list on January 1965, and she was sold to the Dominican Republic on 14 January, under the terms of the Military Assistance Program.  Awards  Skirmish earned four battle stars for World War II service. ==Dominican Navy service== The former Skirmish was acquired by the Dominican Republic on 14 January 1965 and renamed Separaci√≥n (BM454). Employed as a patrol vessel in Dominican Navy service, she was renamed Prestol Botello in 1976. During a 1995 refit, her pennant number was changed to C454 in 1995. , Prestol Botello was in active service with the Dominican Navy. ==Notes References == * * Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Admirable- class minesweepers of the Dominican Navy Category:Active patrol vessels of the Dominican Republic ","title":"USS Skirmish (AM-303)"},{"id":"12374684","text":"Nogometni Klub Primorac 1929 (), commonly referred to as Primorac Stobreƒç, is a Croatian football club based in the small coastal town of Stobreƒç near the city of Split in central Dalmatia.

Designed by Thomas W. Lamb, it is the city's only surviving example of the opulent theatrical venues of the 1920s. The Landmark is on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The Loew's Corporation announced plans for a new theater on February 19, 1926. It would be built at the intersection of South Salina Street and West Jefferson Street, previously the location of the Jefferson Hotel. The Loew's State Theatre opened on February 18, 1928, and offered double bills of famous vaudeville stage acts and first-run films. During the Great Depression and World War II it continued to do good business, as theater patrons escaped for a few hours into its plush grandeur. However, by the 1970s, the theater suffered from low attendance and was in disrepair. It closed in 1975 and was in danger of demolition. In 1976, Syracuse Area Landmark Theatre, or SALT, was formed to preserve and renovate the venue. With the help of an October 11, 1977 benefit concert by Harry Chapin, the group successfully raised $65,000 to purchase the property, at which time Loew's State was renamed the Landmark Theatre. SALT gained ownership of the theater while the remainder of the building including the upper floors remained with then-owner Sutton Real Estate. The Landmark eventually purchased the first two floors of the building and a $16 million renovation project lasting from October 2010 to November 2011 expanded the backstage area, also providing new dressing rooms and green rooms in a plan to try to attract larger, longer-running events to the theater. The aging, recessed loading dock in the theater's rear on South Clinton Street was removed and replaced with a new two-bay dock. The box office was relocated from Jefferson Street to Salina Street, next to the lobby entrance and the original wooden ticket booth, both disused since its Loews State days. Awnings over the street-level storefronts were removed. In addition to the theater, the building also includes several storefronts and offices on the upper floors.and Accompanying three photos, exterior and interior, from 1975 The Clinton Street storefronts were eliminated during the backstage expansion, the display windows now used for event posters. The upper floors have a separate entrance on West Jefferson Street and are collectively referred to as the Loews Building. Two floors have been converted by developer Robert Doucette into 24 condominium apartments. On September 12, 2008, the Landmark hosted the world premiere of The Express, a fictionalized account of the life of Syracuse University alumnus Ernie Davis, attended by stars Rob Brown and Dennis Quaid. Several blocks of South Salina Street, normally a main thoroughfare through downtown, were closed to traffic for the event. ==Architecture and decor== Loews State Theatre, broader view of exterior. According to Peter Baum of SALT, Loew's State was the first great \\"Oriental- style\\" movie theater, predating two of Loew's \\"Oriental palaces\\" in New York City. Architect Thomas Lamb described the theatre as \\"European, Byzantine, Romanesque ‚Äì which is the Orient as it came to us through the merchants of Venice.\\" A large chandelier once hung in the lobby, originally designed by Louis Tiffany for Cornelius Vanderbilt's mansion. The chandelier was sold during the 1970s. A 1,400-pipe Wurlitzer organ was also once a major feature of the venue, but was also gone by the time SALT purchased the property. The promenade lobby, reached via a grand staircase, once held a fishpond with a Japanese pagoda fountain. The Landmark's red and gold decor and several large murals have been preserved and restored. The restored lobby is closed to the public and is only open for special events. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Landmark Theatre official site *Landmark Theatre at Cinema Treasures Category:Concert halls in New York (state) Category:Theatres in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Syracuse, New York Category:Movie palaces Category:Culture of Syracuse, New York Category:Theatres completed in 1928 Category:Tourist attractions in Syracuse, New York Category:Loew's Theatres buildings and structures Category:1928 establishments in New York (state) Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Onondaga County, New York Category:Thomas W.

On 20 January 1992, the aircraft operating the flight, an Airbus A320, crashed in the Vosges Mountains, France, near Mont Sainte-Odile, while circling to land at Strasbourg Airport. 87 of the 96 people on board were killed, while the remaining nine were all injured. ==Aircraft== The aircraft, an Airbus A320-111, registration F-GGED, serial number 15, first flew on 4 November 1988, and was delivered to Air Inter on 22 December 1988. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated a total of 6,316 airframe hours. ==Accident== Flight 148, commanded by 42-year- old Captain Christian Hecquet and 37-year-old First Officer Jo√´l Cherubin, departed Satolas Airport in Lyon, France. While being vectored for a VOR/DME approach to runway 05 at Strasbourg, it crashed at 19:20:33 CET in the mountains at an altitude of . The Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) found that Flight 148 crashed because the pilots left the autopilot set in Vertical Speed Mode instead of Flight Path Angle Mode and then set \\"33\\" for \\"3.3¬∞ descent angle\\", resulting in a high descent rate of per minute into terrain. The pilots had no warning of the imminent impact because Air Inter had not equipped its aircraft with a ground proximity warning system (GPWS). It is speculated that this was because Air Inter ‚Äì facing ferocious competition from France's TGV high-speed trains ‚Äì may have encouraged its pilots to fly fast at low level (up to below , while other airlines generally do not exceed ), and GPWS systems gave too many nuisance warnings. The accident occurred at night, under low cloud and with light snow. Emergency response was slow and journalists were the first to find the crash site over four hours later.List of Mayday episodes#Season 9 (2009) ==Aftermath== The crash site of Flight 148 with a memorial plaque Accident investigators recommended 35 changes in their report. Airbus modified the interface of the autopilot so that a vertical speed setting would be displayed as a four-digit number, preventing confusion with the Flight Path Angle mode.

City Choir Dunedin, formerly the City of Dunedin Choir, (trading name of the Dunedin Choral Society Incorporated) is an auditioned mixed-voice choir in Dunedin, New Zealand. It accepts singers of all age groups from the wider Dunedin community and performs large-scale classical choral works. The choir's membership grew from an initial 45 to around 120 as of 2012. The Choir is a member of the New Zealand Choral Federation (NZCF), which was formed in 1985 to promote high quality choral singing in New Zealand. ==Repertoire== The choir's repertoire encompasses Baroque, Classical and Romantic symphonic choral works, and includes contemporary New Zealand choral music. The choir is usually involved in four or five concerts a year and regularly performs with the Dunedin Symphony Orchestra. Occasionally the choir performs with other orchestras such as the Dunedin Youth Orchestra, the Saint Kilda Brass Band and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, as well as with other choirs like the Christchurch City Choir, Voices New Zealand Chamber Choir, Auckland Choral Society, the Southern Youth Choir, Invercargill A Capella Singers and the Southern Children's Choir. ==History== In October of 1863 the Dunedin Philharmonic Society, conducted by W. Haydn Flood, was founded by George R. West. The Dunedin Choral Society, conducted by Charles J. Bates, was founded in the same week with its first practice being held on 28 October. Burchell, Jenny. The Life and Times of a Choral Society, Dunedin‚Äôs City Choir 1863-2013. Dunedin Choral Society Inc., 2019, p. 16.

The album was released on November 1, 1972 on the budget label, RCA Camden. The contents of the album consist primarily of soundtrack recordings from various Presley films of the 1960s, augmented by both sides of his 1972 hit single, \\"Burning Love\\". Presley's recordings were generally issued by RCA on the standard Victor label, and not the budget Camden label; a similar compilation album, Separate Ways, was issued a month later, which also featured a recent chart hit leading a collection of older, non-hit soundtrack recordings. Upon its release, the album reached number 22 on the Billboard chart. In the mid 1970s, RCA Records leased the rights to reissue certain RCA Camden recordings by Presley and other RCA recording artists to the budget reissue label Pickwick Records. Burning Love was reissued with the same cover art on the Pickwick label. After Presley's sudden death in 1977, his recordings were in great demand and RCA sought to reclaim the rights to their Pickwick/Camden recordings, and reissued and repackaged several of them. Burning Love was first reissued on compact disc on the RCA Camden label in 1987. The album was certified Gold on March 27, 1992, Platinum on July 15, 1999 and 2x Platinum on January 6, 2004 by the RIAA.

The series was set during the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s. The original series consisted of 13 one-hour episodes, filmed in colour and on location in Bullengarook, Victoria.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 103 It was created by Russell Hagg and Patrick Edgeworth who met working at Crawford Productions. They said they were $5,000 short making the show - the balance was provided by Ron Casey. Production began in July 1974 and the series premiered on the Seven Network in Brisbane on 17 April 1975, Sydney on 26 May 1975 and Melbourne on 29 May. The series was also shown at Sunday lunchtime in the United Kingdom by the London Weekend Television (LWT) Network, in advance of its airing in Australia. It was also screened at the Cannes Film Festival and sold to Sweden, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Ireland, Norway, Rhodesia and Nigeria. It was produced by Homestead Films, a TV production company set up by Patrick Edgeworth and Russell Hagg, who had worked together at Crawford Productions on Matlock Police. Edgeworth's brother is the musician Ron Edgeworth, who was married to Judith Durham of The Seekers. The episodes dealt with the adventures of bushrangers Sam Cash (Serge Lazareff) and his partner Joe Brady (Gus Mercurio) and a helpful widow, Jessica Johnson (Penne Hackforth-Jones). Cash and Brady were fugitives, constantly absconding from the authorities, led by the corrupt police trooper Lieutenant Keogh (Bruce Kerr). Other regular and recurring characters included Jessica's father in law (John Frawley) and her servant, Annie (Anne Scott- Pendlebury). The series was shot almost entirely on location at Sunbury, Victoria, the same area where Mad Max (1979) was filmed. (Patrick Edgeworth and Russell Haig have no idea where the following story came from. It is false. In fact, being so impressed with Gerard Kennedy's work on the last ep. of Cash, we told the Seven Network he was our choice to replace Lazareff. And they agreed.) Lazareff decided to leave at the end of the first series, when a second series was still in the planning stages. His character was replaced by Ryler, a former bounty hunter, played by Gerard Kennedy, a former cast member of Division 4. The Ryler character had appeared in one episode of Cash & Co. and Kennedy was recruited to replace Lazareff after Seven told the Homestead Films that they would not buy a second series unless the popular Logie-winning actor was cast in the new series. The series was renamed Tandarra as the character of Sam Cash was no longer featured, and the fugitives from justice story line was removed. The character of Keogh was also dropped, and the character of Annie (Jessica's maid, played by Anne Pendlebury) only appeared in one episode. The character of Sam Cash was not mentioned at all in Tandarra, and all flashback sequences from the first series removed any reference to him. Although the series title is taken from history, the story, events and timeline are of no relation to real life Australian bushranger, Martin Cash, whose gang went by the name of Cash and Co. Umbrella Entertainment released the series on DVD Region Free on 2 April 2014. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Classic Australian Television website * Watch Cash and Company opening and a first scene * Umbrella Entertainment website listing Category:Australian drama television series Category:Television series set in the 1850s Category:Television shows set in Victoria (Australia) Category:Seven Network original programming Category:Television shows set in colonial Australia Category:1975 Australian television series debuts Category:1975 Australian television series endings Category:Australian Western (genre) films ","title":"Cash and Company"},{"id":"12375123","text":"Sotirios Krokidas Sotirios G.

When the Greek army was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War and the government of Petros Protopapadakis fell, Greece was plunged into a political crisis. In September, 1922, Nikolaos Triantaphillakos was Prime Minister as the military revolted in Thessaloniki and then in Mytilene. A revolutionary committee led by Stylianos Gonatas demanded the abdication of King Constantine and on September 26, 1922, the king abandoned his throne and the government of Triantaphillakos resigned. The revolutionary committee selected Alexandros Zaimis as Prime Minister, but as he was out of the country, Krokidas was appointed as interim Prime Minister. Until Krokidas could reach Athens to be sworn in, the Minister of the Army, Charalambis was sworn in as Prime Minister on September 29, and served for one day. On September 30, 1922, Krokidas became Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. He was responsible for constituting the extraordinary and controversial Trial of the Six which sentenced three former Prime Ministers and the General in command of Greek troops in the Greco-Turkish War to death for Greece's defeat in the war.TO BHMA online The politicians and General were executed on November 15, 1922.

Although it is sometimes played in Europe and the United States, Generala is most popular in Iberoamerica. == Rules == Generala is a game played by two or more players. Players take turns rolling five dice. After each roll, the player chooses which dice (if any) to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to three times on a turn.  Scoring  The following combinations earn points: * Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives or Sixes. A player may add the numbers on any combination of dice showing the same number. For example, 4-4-4-2-6 would score 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 points in \\"Fours\\" or 2 points in \\"Twos\\" or even 6 points in \\"Sixes\\". Once a player has taken points on a specific combination, he or she may not take points for that combination again during the game. * Straight. 20 points. A straight is a combination of five consecutive numbers (1-2-3-4-5, or 2-3-4-5-6); it also includes consecutive numbers with 6 and 1, such as 3-4-5-6-1. In essence, any set of five unmatched dice are a straight. A variation allows a 1 to replace a 2 in a straight, e.g. 1, 1, 3, 4, 5 or 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. * Full house. 30 points. Any set of three combined with a set of two. For example, 5-5-5-3-3. * Four of a kind. 40 points. Four dice with the same number. For example, 2-2-2-2-6. * Generala. 50 or 60 points. All five dice with the same number. * Double Generala (optional). 100 or 120 points. All five dice with the same number for the second time in a game.

The change in format and title was necessitated by the departure of Serge Lazareff who played the title character Sam Cash in the original series Cash and Company. Two of the original characters continued in Tandarra: Joe Brady (Gus Mercurio) and Jessica Johnson (Penne Hackforth-Jones). The other main character was Ryler (Gerard Kennedy). who had been introduced in the final episode of Cash and Company. He had been a bounty hunter who was later convinced of Joe's innocence and decided to join him. The title was taken from the name of the homestead owned by Jessica, and the series primarily dealt with the adventures of running the large farming property.http://www.australiantelevision.net/tandarra.html The premise of the first series, namely that Joe and Sam were fugitives from the law and were being assisted by Jessica, was totally removed. No reference to the Sam Cash character was ever made in this series. The previous antagonist, the corrupt police trooper, Lieutenant Keogh (Bruce Kerr) only appeared in the first episode of Tandarra, and the character of Jessica's servant, Annie (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) only appeared in the second.

His family moved to Olathe, Kansas, when he was three years old. He received his education in the public schools. He married Ora May Murray and they had two children. ==Career== Hodges had a successful career as a businessman with holdings in the lumber, hardware, and the loan industries, as well as owning a newspaper, the Johnson County Democrat. Hodges was elected to the Olathe City Council in 1896, serving alongside his brother, Mayor Frank Hodges. George Hodges was elected to one term as Mayor of Olathe after his four year as a city councilman. Hodges served in the state legislature as a senator from 1905 to 1913, where he was particularly active on the railroad committee in the senate and known for leading the charge for progressive laws for the state of Kansas. He was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor in 1910 and was elected governor in 1912, defeating Republican Arthur Capper by 23 votes in the closest election in Kansas history. In his January 14, 1913 State of the State Address, Hodges called for equal suffrage for women, the direct election of U.S. Senators, closed primary elections, to allow taxation on mortgages held by non-residents of Kansas on property owned in Kansas, repeal of the inheritance law, expansion of the state's mileage of permanent dirt roads, an overhaul of the state's grain inspection law, new child labor laws, new employment safety laws, a review of proposals for the state to publish school textbooks, the reduction of contingency funds for statewide officeholders excluding the state attorney general, giving the state new powers over river beds, the merger of the state livestock sanitary commissioner into Kansas State University and an elected state labor commissioner with additional powers. Hodges also used his inaugural address to call for four amendments to the state constitution: *Permitting statewide initiative and referendum *Permitting recall of elected officials *Expanding statewide and county officials terms from two years to four years *State aid for road and bridge construction The administration of Governor Hodges brought the following changes: *a corporation tax was sanctioned *a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution was authorized *the board of administration was granted power to control all state agencies *Control of all state schools was placed under the State Board of Education *Repeal of the inheritance tax *New power for the Kansas Bureau of Labor *Allowed for the state publication of school textbooks *New miner safety laws *Created a hospital for patients with tuberculous *Placed public hospitals under the control of county governments *Created the office of prison matron for women's county jails *Created the office of divorce proctor *women's roles were advanced in state government. On March 10, 1913, he delivered a speech to the Kansas Legislature calling for an overhaul of the Legislature by combining the Kansas House of Representatives and Kansas Senate into a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of one or two members from each congressional district with the governor serving as the presiding officer. He said the size of the Legislature was too large for the state. Hodges also proposed moving the state from having legislative sessions in odd number years to holding annual legislative sessions, suggesting the biennium procedure caused legislators to rush through their business and not have ample time to study legislation. Hodges was the last governor of Kansas to serve with a Democratic legislature. After losing his reelection bid, Hodges returned to his various business interests as he had established a successful career as a businessman. He was a member of the State Board of Regents from 1925 to 1927. He also served on the State Textbook Commission. ==ReferencesExternal links== *National Governors Association article on George Hartshorn Hodges *Political Graveyard * *Speeches delivered by Governor Hodges *Online resources on George H.

It is used to describe a hyperlink that points to a location within the Internet where the user can download a file. When used in conversation, DDL distinguishes itself from other forms of peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading architectures in that it uses a client‚Äìserver architecture, where 100-percent of the file is stored on a single file server or in parallel across multiple file servers in a server farm. Originally, P2P was used to distribute large sized files without requiring much bandwidth on the part of any one node. However, because of sharing issues, such as the lack of seeding of torrents, throttling of a node's file sharing ports by an Internet service provider, or lawsuits because of uploading copyrighted material, direct downloads has become a popular and legal ernative among Leechers. There is also an increase in businesses offerihttps://pin.it/1eadLn2 ==Subverting a Site Maintainers' Policies== DDL has also taken on a meaning of providing direct links within a site where the original site's maintainers impede a user from accessing a file directly. Typical impediments include: * Requiring the user to register and/or log in before being provided a link to the content they desire. * Using ECMAScript or similar programming along with altering the DOM so as to initiate a download instead of clicking or right-clicking directly on a link. * Downloading a trampoline stub program which, when executed, downloads the complete file. * Downloading a \\"download manager\\" application which then downloads the desired file (which is similar to downloading a stub, but is used for more than one file or package from the same site). The maintainers of the site may have arguably good reasons for these impediments, such as: * being able to inform (email) users of available updates so as to reduce the time software is vulnerable * attempting to bind the user to a legal agreement (license, terms of use, acceptable use policy, etc.) before dispensing the files or software (a form of shrink wrap contract or browse wrap license) * always downloading the latest version and therefore reducing their software's extant vulnerability * reducing their Internet bandwidth requirements by only transferring files the user is likely to need However, many users see this as quite unnecessary, because they generally know what they need and don't want to go through the site's mechanics (such as filling out forms over and over) to get said file. Also, there may be bugs in the site's detection and/or download methods, thus forcing the user to obtain the file directly. Another example is when the site maintainer tries to identify the user's platform, and the user is simply using something other than the target platform to download the file (for example, using a Microsoft Windows system to download a Linux program, where the same program is built and offered for both platforms). Therefore, some users may collaborate on sites other than the one offering the desired files, and post URLs which they have identified as being for the desired file. Thus a user wanting the same file does not have to endure the impediments encountered from the original site's maintainers, and simply obtains the file directly. ==See also== *File hosting service *Client‚Äìserver model *File sharing Category:Hypertext Category:Data transmission ","title":"Direct download link"},{"id":"12375415","text":"Federal Route 131, or Jalan Raja Perempuan Zainab II, is a federal road in Kelantan, Malaysia.

He came to this position following the murder of his brother Rulon Allred on orders of rival polygamist leader Ervil LeBaron, in 1977. Allred was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. He had eight wives, twenty-three children and over two hundred grandchildren. In 1942, he was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) when he married his second wife. After his death, he was succeeded by J. LaMoine Jensen. Shortly after Allred became head of the AUB, Spencer W. Kimball, the then-president of the LDS Church announced that all worthy males would be able to hold the priesthood without regard to race or color. This effectively ended a century-long prohibition preventing black men from holding priesthood office in the LDS Church. Owen Allred stridently opposed this new practice. He immediately declared that the temples of the LDS Church had been desecrated by the presence of black Latter-day Saints. In response, the AUB built its own Endowment House in Bluffdale and began performing ordinances. Owen Allred is perhaps best known for his outspoken criticism of child abuse and marriages of girls under the age of 18. He publicly denounced the child abuse that occurred in many polygamist groups and encouraged members of the AUB to report such activities to law enforcement officials. Additionally, he campaigned for the legal marriage age in Utah to be raised from 14 to 16, noting that AUB members are forbidden to engage in any courtship before the age of 17. In 2003, a federal judge ordered Owen Allred to return money that the AUB had received from Virginia Hill. Hill had accused the group of misrepresentation in a business transaction. Approximately 1300 people attended his funeral. ==References== *Leigh Dethman and Lucinda Dillon-Kinkead, \\"Polygamist Owen Allred dies\\", Deseret Morning News, 2005-02-17 *Charlie LeDuff, \\"A Holdout Polygamist, 88, Defies the Mormons\\", New York Times, 2002-03-23 p.

Adult males have prepollex that is ossified, enlarged, and blunt (the \\"spikethumb\\"), and bears small nuptial excrescences. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are cloud forests with pristine streams at elevations of above sea level. They breed in streams. Individuals have been found on a mossy rock wall at night, sitting in the spray of a small waterfall, and in direct sunlight on rocks in the middle of a stream. Sarcohyla celata has always been a rare species. The decline of the species is attributed to chytridiomycosis, habitat loss and change caused by logging and other human activities, and desiccation. ==References== Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Endemic fauna of Mexico Category:Natural history of Oaxaca Category:Sierra Madre del Sur Category:Amphibians described in 1995 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Sarcohyla celata"},{"id":"12375574","text":"Sarcohyla cembra, also known as the Southern Sierra Madre treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

However, the species was rediscovered in field surveys in 2011‚Äì2012, extending its range with a new locality about 10 km north of the type locality. ==Etymology== The specific name cembra is Latin for \\"timber\\" and refers to the pine-oak forest this species inhabits. ==Taxonomy== It was initially thought that the female specimen that became the holotype of Sarcohyla miahuatlanensis could be a female Sarcohyla cembra, but it was eventually identified as a new, distinct species. Nevertheless, the two species are morphologically similar. ==Description== The holotype is a male that measures in snout‚Äìvent length, depending on the source. The second specimen, also a male, measures SVL. The body is moderately robust. The tympanum is small and indistinct. Skin is smooth on the dorsum and limbs, weakly granular on venter, chin, and ventral surfaces of thighs. The fingers are without webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum was bright greenish yellow upon capture, changing to dull green. There is brown and green reticulations along sides. The throat and chest are white. The ventral sides of limbs and belly are pinkish tan. The iris is brownish yellow. Male advertisement call is a short \\"wrack\\", often followed by a series of low \\"chuckles\\". Tadpoles found at the type locality, provisionally allocated to this species, measured up to in total length. ==Habitat and conservation== The natural habitats of this species are pine-oak forest. The holotype was found calling at night from under a piece of bark on a large log in a small stream at above sea level. The second specimen was found inside an arboreal bromeliad on a fallen oak tree at asl. This species was only known from two specimens collected in 1969 and 1993, until it was again found in 2011‚Äì2012.

The venter and chin are greenish-yellow, as are the outer toes and fingers. The ventral surfaces of limbs to the inner toes and fingers bright are yellow-orange. The iris is pale bluish-gray. Males have enlarged non-projecting prepollex (the \\"spikethumb\\") but not nuptial excrescences. ==Habitat and conservation== The natural habitats of this species are pristine cloud forest with low or moderate streams, its probably breeding habitat. It is known from elevations between above sea level. At night, these frogs were found submerged on the bottom of large pools or at the edges of pools, with only their heads above water, and escaping to deeper water if disturbed. By day, they occurred near the same pools but mostly sitting on rocks several centimeters above the water. The only other anuran in the habitat was what at the time was identified as Plectrohyla siopela, but later described as a new species, Plectrohyla celata. Sarcohyla cyanomma was once relatively common and conspicuous in its habitat. However, it was last collected in 1980, and is possibly now extinct. The stream at the type locality is still in good condition, so the decline might be caused by chytridiomycosis. Habitat loss is occurring elsewhere in the area and could have contributed to the overall decline of this species. ==References== Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Endemic fauna of Mexico Category:Natural history of Oaxaca Category:Amphibians described in 1974 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Janalee P.

The species is endemic to the United States. The natural habitats of P. brachyphona are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, swamps, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, ponds, open excavations, and canals and ditches. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Physical characteristics== The mountain chorus frog is a small frog, but an intermediate size for the genus Pseudacris. It is colored different shades of grey or brown, including sorghum brown, deep brownish- drab, or mars brown. It is stocky in the body and broader in the head, which is very close to the structure and size of H. femoralis, the pine woods tree frog. The adult frog grows from in head and body length. The males are usually between 24 and 32 mm and the females between 27 and 34 mm. The mountain chorus frog has a triangle between the eyes and a white line on the upper lip; the male has a dark throat. ==Geographic range and habitat== The mountain chorus frog can usually be found on the hillsides of southwestern Pennsylvania, western Maryland, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, and Tennessee. They live on springy hillsides, grassy pools, and ditches, typically distant from water. The wooded hillsides where the frogs live are up to in elevation. ==Vocalization== The mountain chorus frog has a unique call. It is a faster, higher note, and holds a distinct quality and form. The repetitions are quicker and the pitch higher. It resembles the call of the Pacific Chorus Frog rather closely but is less clearly two syllabled. When a whole chorus of them are heard, one can tell them apart from other groups. The Mountain chorus frog's call has a rate of 50 to 70 times a minute and can be continued for several minutes, though they usually stop in 15 to 20 seconds. This distinct call is rapid and can be heard on a clear night up to a quarter mile away.Wright & Wright, pp. 230-231. Their voice has a bit of a nasal quality to it and sounds like a wagon wheel turning that needs oil. It is a harsh, raspy \\"wreeck\\" or \\"reek\\" sound. ==Taxonomy== Mountain chorus frogs are part of the family Hylidae, also known as the tree frogs. Tree frogs are one of the largest families in the order Salientia (also called Anura). Because they are so colorful and have many acrobatic talents, they have been called the \\"clowns and high-wire artists\\" of the amphibian world. The almost 500 species of tree frogs are found all over the world, in tropical regions and to the Canadian woods, and Australia. They are found in places where toads are usually found. ==Breeding== The mountain chorus frog breeds in February through April. The female lays eggs in small, shallow bodies of water in the woods or waterways near the woods. If the frog lives near the base of a hill, it will lay eggs in ditches, pools along streams, or springs. The eggs are laid in groups of 10 to 50. They attach to vegetation and total about 500 eggs. The tadpole stage lasts for about 50 to 56 days. Once the tadpoles reach 8 mm, they metamorphose into frogs. ==Food== Mountain chorus frogs feed on invertebrates, such as insects, because they do not climb much, and if they do, it is into the weeds to pursue insects. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Knapp, Walter W. . \\"Mountain Chorus Frog.\\" The Frogs & Toads of Georgia. 09 Sept 2006. 27 Oct 2007. . * Mattison, Chris. 1987.

One study suggests that it only occurs in ponds with aquatic vegetation. It is often found floating at the water surface, anchored motionless to the leaves of aquatic plants, with only the eyes, nostrils, and tympanum out of the water. It appears to use both visual and sensory clues to detect threats, to which it responds by diving. Breeding takes place in water. Pseudis bolbodactyla is active both day and night. A study from Goi√°s found diet consisting primarily of insects, with a minor contribution of arachnids. The majority of the diet were diurnal insects associated with vegetation. Aquatic insects made a small contribution, and then as winged adults only. Pseudis bolbodactyla appears to be an opportunistic sit-and-wait predator. ==Conservation== Pseudis bolbodactyla is a common species that can suffer from overgrazing by domestic livestock, infrastructure development (including dams), and water pollution from agriculture.

It is endemic to southern Brazil and is known from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paran√°. The specific name cardosoi honors Ad√£o Jos√© Cardoso, a Brazilian herpetologist. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is robust. The head is broad and the snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The forearms are robust with robust fingers; no webbing is present. The hind limbs are short and robust with extensively webbed toes. The body and the limbs are dorsally light to dark green, olive, or brownish. There are usually some darker spots or blotches of irregular form. A black or dark green stripe runs along the canthus rostralis; it can be narrow or broad and blot-like. The tympanum is olive, tan or light brown. The lateral surfaces of head, body, and thigh are light yellow. Ventral surfaces are white. Males have paired vocal sac. left The male advertisement call is loud, modulated, and variable, resembling the grunting of a pig. Three tadpoles in Gosner stages 34‚Äì37 measured . Of this, the ovoid body made little more than one third. The tail is higher than the body but ends with a flagelliform tip. ==Habitat and ecology== Pseudis cardosoi is strictly aquatic and typically occurs in permanent pasture ponds and still-water pools of slowly flowing creeks at elevations of above sea level. It appears to be a diet generalist. The diet consists of mostly insects (mainly Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera) and plant matter. Whether the plant matter is accidentally ingested or represents a supplementary source of nutrition is unknown. Arthropods other than insects and other invertebrates are sometimes present. Breeding activity has been observed through the warmer season, when temperature exceeds 8‚Äì10¬∞C. Tadpoles can be found throughout the year, reflecting their long development time. Males call during both day and night, floating on the water surface. The eggs are deposited singly or in small clumps and fixed to submerged plants. The total clutch size of four amplectant pairs was 70 to 189 eggs. The egg diameter is . ==Conservation== Pseudis cardosoi is a common species that is not facing major threats. It is present in the Aparados de Serra and Serra Geral National Parks. Nevertheless, its ability to colonize new habitat appears limited: two formerly inhabited ponds that dried out did not become recolonized within the next three years, despite their proximity to other inhabited ponds. ==References== cardosoi Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 2000 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pseudis cardosoi"},{"id":"12375741","text":"John Atterbury (born 4 August 1941) is a British actor.http://www.englishtheatre.at/english/season-201819/tuesdays-with- morrie/cast/john-atterbury.html ==Filmography== * Doctor Who (TV series) (1968‚Äì1969) (4 episodes)https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bafbeee54 ** The Mind Robber: Episode 1 (1968) ** The Mind Robber: Episode 4 (1968) ** The Mind Robber: Episode 5 (1968) ** The War Games: Part 4 (1969) * NASSER (1997) * The Parent Trap (1998) as Gareth * The Jump (TV series) (1998) (1 episode) ** Episode #1.1 as the judge * Gosford Park (2001) as Merrimanhttps://www.fandango.com/people/john-atterbury-26372/film-credits * Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) as Phineas Nigellus Black * Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) as the marriage priest *Midsomer Murders (2009)https://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/xgdg/midsomer-murders-- s12-e7-the-great-and-the-good/ * Robin Hood (2010) as Exchequer *Love's Kitchen (2011) * Darkest Hour (2017) as Sir Alexander Cadogan == References External links== * *John Atterbury at Rotten Tomatoes Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:British male film actors Category:British male television actors Category:20th-century British male actors Category:21st- century British male actors ","title":"John Atterbury"},{"id":"12375742","text":"Pseudis fusca is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

From 1991 until the end of their coverage in 2002, CBS televised one game on the first Saturday of the World Series besides the championship game. Format change Prior to 1988, the College World Series was a pure double- elimination event. Beginning in 1988, the tournament was divided into two four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was made for broadcast television, with the final game on CBS on Saturday afternoon. The end of CBS' coverage In 2003, the tournament was shifted entirely to cable on ESPN, which had begun covering all of the other games of the CWS since 1982 (and a partial schedule since 1980). The championship final became a best-of-three series between the two bracket winners, with games scheduled for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings. In 2015, college baseball returned to CBS Sports in the form of a multi-year agreement between the American Athletic Conference and CBS Sports Network. Under the terms of the package, CBS Sports Network would air three Houston Baseball games in 2015, as well as the first two contests of the 2015 American Athletic Conference Baseball Championship. Carter Blackburn provided play-by-play for all seven games of the package, while analyst duties would be handled Darryl Hamilton and Ray King along with Brandon Tierney. ==Commentators== 2000s { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" Year Play-by-play Color commentator(s) - 2002 Greg Gumbel Rick Cerone - 2001 Greg Gumbel Ray Knight - 2000 Greg Gumbel Jerry Kindall - } 1990s { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" Year Play-by- play Color commentator(s) - 1999 Sean McDonough Joe Carter - 1998 Sean McDonough Fred Lynn - 1997 Sean McDonough Fred Lynn - 1996 Sean McDonough Steve Garvey - 1995 Sean McDonough Jeff Torborg - 1994 Greg Gumbel Jeff Torborg - 1993 Greg Gumbel Jim Kaat - 1992 Greg Gumbel Jim Kaat - 1991 Greg Gumbel Jim Kaat - 1990 Greg Gumbel Jim Kaat - } 1980s { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" Year Play-by-play Color commentator(s) - 1989 Brent Musburger Joe Morgan - 1988 Brent Musburger Rick Monday } ==ReferencesExternal links== *College Baseball - CBSSports.com *NCAA Men's College World Series Records - CWS TELEVISION RATINGS (1997-2002) Category:CBS Sports Category:College baseball on television in the United States Category:CBS original programming CBS Category:1988 American television series debuts Category:2002 American television series endings Category:1990s American television series Category:2000s American television series Category:CBS Sports Spectacular ","title":"College World Series on CBS"},{"id":"12375876","text":"Ololygon brieni is a species of frogs in the family Hylidae.

It is found in valleys of the Eastern Andes in southern Bolivia, and controversially, in Argentina. Its type locality is Laguna de Bermejo. It is similar to Scinax fuscovarius but differs in call characteristics. The specific name castroviejoi honors Javier Castroviejo Bol√≠var, a Spanish zoologist. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Scinax castroviejoi was described based on eight specimens (holotype and seven paratypes) collected both from Laguna de Bermejo, and an additional three paratypes from Arroyo Los Naranjos in Provincia de Jujuy, Argentina. It is intermediate between Scinax fuscovarius and Scinax nasicus. Reliable identification cannot be based on morphology alone, as was done in the original species description for the Argentinian types. A later survey in the Jujuy location did not find Scinax castroviejoi but only Scinax fuscovarius. Presence of Scinax castroviejoi in Argentina is plausible but remains uncertain. ==Description== Adult males in the type series measure on average in snout‚Äìvent length (SVL); the holotype is SVL. The only female was collected from collected from the Jujuy location and measures . The body is moderately robust. The tympanum is distinct; the supratympanic fold is short but covers the upper part of the tympanum. Both fingers and toes bear relatively large discs. The fingers are basally webbed whereas the toes are about two thirds webbed. The dorsum varies from uniform beige to dark greenish-brown. Distinct spots may be present. About half of the males have two distinct X-shaped spots but in the rest they only slightly evident or nearly absent. The venter is creamy yellow and the vocal sac is yellow. The iris is bronze-brown. The male advertisement call is a biphasic, noisy, strong note lasting about 0.06 seconds and repeated about 87 times per minute. ==Habitat and conservation== Scinax castroviejoi occurs in open areas in inter-Andean valleys, montane Tucumano-Bolivian forest, and Yungas forest. It is a locally common, arboreal species. Males have been found calling at sunset from the ground or perching on vegetation surrounding a lake. It has also been recorded next to ponds or water tanks on emergent vegetation. It is threatened by habitat loss. However, it is considered \\"Data Deficient\\" because of uncertainty about its distribution and ecological requirements. ==References== castroviejoi Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians described in 1993 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Scinax castroviejoi"},{"id":"12375896","text":"Ololygon catharinae is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

It is found in northwestern Argentina, Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, southern, central, and eastern Brazil, and in scattered localities in the lowlands of eastern Venezuela and savannas of Guyana and southern Surinam as well as adjacent Brazil. As currently defined, it is one of most widespread Neotropical frogs; the northernmost records refer to what was formerly recognized as Scinax trilineatus. Common name brown-bordered snouted treefrog has been coined for this species. ==Taxonomy== Scinax fuscomarginatus, as currently defined, consists of what until 2014 were recognized as separate but morphologically similar species. Based on genetic data and the lack of morphological or advertisement call characteristics that could separate the species, Scinax parkeri, Scinax trilineatus, Scinax lutzorum, and Scinax pusillus are now regarded as synonyms of Scinax fuscomarginatus. ==Description== Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is subelliptical in dorsal view. The head is longer than it is wide. The tympanum is small and not very distinct; its upper part is hidden by the supra-tympanic fold. The fingers are short and bear elliptical discs; there is some reduced webbing. The toes are slender and bear elliptical discs; the degree of webbing varies but is more developed than in fingers. The dorsum (in preservative) is light brown with a pattern of brown dorso-lateral stripes in combination with a median line and an inter- ocular stripe that show great variability among individuals. The chest and the belly are immaculate or finely pointed. Males have a large, subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call a single multi-pulsed note with modulated frequency. The note duration is 0.3‚Äì0.9 seconds and the dominant frequency is about 3780 Hz (range 2960‚Äì4590 Hz). ==Habitat and conservation== Scinax fuscomarginatus occurs in open habitats of the Pantanal, Cerrado, Humid Chaco, Beni savanna, and Chiquitano dry forests, as well as in open habitat enclaves in the Atlantic and Amazon forests. It occurs at least up to above sea level. The IUCN assessment of the species from 2004 predates the major taxonomic revision that lead to recognizing a more widely distributed species than before. At the time of the IUCN assessment, no major threats to the species could be identified. ==References== fuscomarginatus Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Taxa named by Adolfo Lutz Category:Amphibians described in 1925 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Scinax fuscomarginatus"},{"id":"12375956","text":"Scinax fuscovarius is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

The single topped the charts in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number four in Denmark and number five in Australia. The song was featured in the trailer for the film The Best Man and later in the film Save the Last Dance. The song heavily samples \\"Love Like This\\" by Faith Evans, which in turn is made of a covered loop from Chic's \\"Chic Cheer\\".

Originating from a large renowned family of Rabbis and scholars, De Sola was recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodox Judaism in the United States during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Born in London, England, the sixth child of David Aaron de Sola and Rebecca Meldola, his maternal grandfather was Haham Raphael Meldola, a prominent English Rabbi. His sister Eliza married Rabbi Abraham Pereira Mendes and was the mother of Rabbi Frederick de Sola Mendes and Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes. Abraham de Sola delivering opening prayer at the House of Representatives on January 9, 1873 In 1846, De Sola was elected minister of the Shearith Israel congregation of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and he arrived in that city early in 1847. In 1848, De Sola was appointed lecturer, and in 1853 professor, of Hebrew and Oriental literature at McGill University, Montreal, and he eventually became the senior professor of its faculty of arts. He was president of the Natural History Society for several years, and addressed its members frequently on those branches of scientific investigation which came within its province. The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him in 1858 by McGill University. This was the first instance of a Jew attaining that honor in an English-speaking country. In 1873, by invitation of President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, De Sola opened the United States Congress with prayer. The event was of significance, as De Sola was a British subject, and this was the first indication of a more friendly feeling between the United States and Great Britain after the dangerously strained relations that had been caused by the recently adjusted \\"Alabama Claims.\\" Mr. Gladstone, then premier, as well as Sir Edward Thornton, the British ambassador at Washington, extended the thanks of the British government to De Sola. Abraham de Sola frequently visited the United States, and, through his pulpit addresses and numerous contributions to the press, became recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodoxy, at a time when the struggle between the Orthodox and Reform wings of the community was at an acute stage. He was intimately associated with Isaac Leeser, Samuel Myer Isaacs, Bernhard Illowy, J. J. Lyons, and other upholders of Jewish tradition, and on the death of Isaac Leeser was invited to become successor to his pulpit; but this and many similar offers he declined. For twenty years he was a constant contributor to Leeser's \\"Occident,\\" and after the latter's death he purchased the copyrights and stereotype plates of his works and continued their publication. He married Esther Joseph on 30 June 1852. Amongst their children was Clarence de Sola, a businessman and pioneer Canadian Zionist. Abraham de Sola died in New York City in 1882 and was buried in Montreal. His archive is held at McGill University Archives. ==Literary works== *1848. Scripture Zoology. *1852.

The character first appeared on the pages of The Darkhold #1 (October 1992). She was the first openly lesbian character for Marvel, and created by writer and editor Christian Cooper. ==Fictional character biography== Montesi is the only child of Monsignor Vittorio Montesi; the Montesi line was long ago designated as the guardians of the Darkhold, a tome of ancient black magic which has the potential to summon the Elder God Chthon to wreak havoc upon the Earth, but Victoria, half-American, disbelieves her father's claims and takes up hospital work in Rome, where she lives with her lover, karate instructor Natasha \\"Nash\\" Salvato. However, when pages from the Darkhold are distributed to unsuspecting mortals by a demonic Dwarf and Nash is rendered quadriplegic and comatose following an explosion intended to kill Victoria, she joins with occult expert Louise Hastings and Interpol agent Sam Buchanan to recover the pages as the Darkhold Redeemers. Midnight Sons In Darkhold #1, Montesi, Hastings and Buchanan began working with the Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze when they discovered Lilith, an ancient demonic entity, had sought Montesi's death. Thereafter, the group was loosely affiliated with Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, the NightStalkers, and the other \\"Midnight Sons\\". These alliances draw them into many adventures unrelated to the hunt for Darkhold pages. Their involvement with the forces of darkness had been predicted long ago as part of the 'nine', a group of heroes destined to destroy much evil. Killing one of the group would mean much success for the forces of darkness, even against the eight survivors. In once incident, Victoria and Sam become involved in Lilith's rebirth from the haunted grounds of the Salem Fields Cemetery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn. A mist seeping from the ground is bringing with it demonic creatures of all sorts. Sam, Victoria, Ghost Rider, Caretaker, the Nightstalkers and other heroes try to their best to stop it but end up on the run and under siege in the storyline appropriately known as Siege of Darkness. The group, as a trio, hunts down the Darkhold pages whenever they can. In Hawaii, they fight demonic soldiers brought forth from the mind of a Pearl Harbor survivor. In a small mountain town, Victoria helps protect a school full of children from rampaging demonic creatures. She and Sam are assisted by Sabretooth. In short order, Victoria deals with the apparent betrayal of Sam and the sacrifice of Louise Hastings, who perishes soon after giving her soul to bring to life many of the Midnight Sons, including Victoria herself. Louise's place in the group is filled by her grandson Jinx, who has the magical ability to nudge luck into his favor. He develops a childish crush on Victoria, but still ends up a trusted ally. She takes him on a trip to New York to hunt down a page, which ultimately leads to a confrontation with Spider-Man, the Paralyzer and Zzzax.Midnight Sons Unlimited #3 (Oct. 1, 1993) Victoria ultimately becomes entranced by the pages of the Darkhold as the demonic dwarf offers her the chance to restore the vitality and movement of Nash. As with all Darkhold incidents, this becomes corrupted as innocent people are killed in order to steal their vitality. Nash, through her bond with Victoria, convinces her to neutralize the Darkhold spell. Doctor Strange After some months of such adventures, Victoria's life takes an even worse turn when it is revealed that she is in fact Chthon's daughter, created when the sterile Vittorio used magic to guarantee himself an heir, and she is mystically impregnated with Chthon himself; Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange kept Victoria in mystic stasis for a time to delay Chthon's rebirth into the Earth dimension, and he was ultimately able to prevent it. When last seen, Victoria was being spirited away by the Midwife, a creation of Chthon's who nevertheless rebelled against her master's rebirth and sought to help Victoria recover from her ordeal. The FBI later recruits Victoria to help them track Carnage, who had absconded to the Indian Ocean with the Darkhold. ==Powers and abilities== Victoria Montesi can sense when someone has accessed a page from the Darkhold tome. Originally thought to be due to her Montesi family bloodline, Victoria's powers were actually due to her creation through the magic of the Darkhold by her sterile father, Vittorio Montesi. She is also a trained doctor and has limited martial arts training taught to her by her lover, Nash Salvato, and later by her teammate, Sam Buchanan. ==References External links == * Category:Marvel Comics characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional lesbians Category:LGBT characters in comics ","title":"Victoria Montesi"},{"id":"12376207","text":"Sphaenorhynchus palustris, the Linhares lime treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

It is endemic to south-eastern Brazil where it occurs in the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira ranges in the states of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, and Minas Gerais. However, Araujo-Vieira and colleagues suggests that the Serra da Mantiqueira population could represent Sphaenorhynchus canga; the two species are similar. ==Systematics== This species was originally described by Franz Werner in 1894 based on a specimen with no other collection information than its origin, \\"S. Amerika\\". In 1981 designated a neotype for the species, erroneously believing that the holotype (the only known specimen, in the collections of the Institut f√ºr Zoologie der Universit√§t Wien) was lost. However, the neotype specimen was not a hylid but a centrolenid, later described as a distinct species, Centrolenella savagei (now synonym of Ikakogi tayrona). ==Description== The holotype is a female, in poor condition of preservation. It measures in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is robust and the snout is rounded. The fingers are one-third and the toes four-fifths webbed. It is clearly distinct from other Sphaenorhynchus species. Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is pointed or truncate-subovoid from above and acute in the lateral profile. The finger and toe tips bears discs; both the fingers and toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum is green. Black mottling or spots may or may not be present. The dorsolateral stripes are yellow above and black below. The ventrum is green or greenish yellow. Males have a single vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Sphaenorhynchus platycephalus lives on vegetation above large ponds or lakes or at the edge of forests. Breeding takes place in relatively deep permanent ponds and lakes. It is threatened by drainage of its breeding habitat for mosquito control and the application of insecticides to kill mosquitoes. This practice also occurs within protected areas. ==References== platycephalus Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1894 Category:Taxa named by Franz Werner Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Sphaenorhynchus platycephalus"},{"id":"12376216","text":"Sphaenorhynchus prasinus, or Bokermann's lime treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

He was a designer of colorful textiles, and was one of the founders of the Art Deco movement. As a soldier in the French Army in World War I, Mare led the development of military camouflage, painting artillery using Cubism techniques to deceive the eye. His ink and watercolour painting Le canon de 280 camoufl√© (The Camouflaged 280 Gun) shows the close interplay of abstract art and military application at that time. He authored the book Cubisme et Camouflage, 1914‚Äì1918. Mare sketched and painted scenes based on his experiences in World War I. His works include: American Troops Marching Through the Arch of Triumph, 1930, and The Funeral of Marshal Foch, 1931. After the war Mare combined his talents with the skills of architect Louis Sue and became a leader in the Art Deco movement. He designed pavilions, textiles and furnishings for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925. and interiors of residences and the French ocean liners. A common feature of his work was the stylized rose, in garlands or bouquets. ==Early life== Mare was born in Argentan, in Normandy. His childhood friends included the painter Fernand L√©ger. The young Mare had a passion for drawing, and decided to go to Paris to study art and design. In 1904, he enrolled at the School of Decorative Arts, and also took courses at the Acad√©mie Julian. In 1906, he showed his paintings and designs at the Salon des ind√©pendants. In the following years, he participated in the Salon d'Automne, where he showed works along with those of his friends Roger de La Fresnaye, Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, Maurice Marinot and Marcel Duchamp. His designs in 1911 included very elaborate and stylized floral patterns for textiles, breaking away from traditional and Art Nouveau models. Guillaume Apollinaire commented on his skill in designing furniture.L'Ind√©pendant, 14 October 1911. At the 1912 Salon d'Automne he and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Marie Laurencin, Fernand L√©ger and Roger de La Fresnaye collaborated in the design of the La Maison Cubiste, an architectural installation designed to display cubist paintings. Mare designed the colorful wallpaper, which featured stylized roses and floral patterns, along with upholstery, furniture and carpets with similar motifs. It was a distinct break from traditional decor, and became a prototype for Art Deco interior design. The installation attracted considerable attention, and some scandal, in the press.Eve Blau, Nancy J. Troy, \\"The Maison Cubiste and the meaning of modernism in pre-1914 France\\", in Architecture and Cubism, Montreal, Cambridge, MA, London: MIT Press‚àíCentre Canadien d'Architecture, 1998, pp. 17‚Äì40, .Christopher Green, Art in France: 1900‚Äì1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000 ==War and camouflage== Self-portrait during World War I Cubist artist's work for the French army in World War I. During the First World War, Mare worked on camouflage for the French army, in a section of camoufleurs created by Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scevola and directed by his friend Dunoyer de Segonzac. He also worked for the British and Italian armies with his friend Fernand L√©ger and other painters including Forain, Charles Camoin, Charles Dufresne, Villon, and Marcoussis; and with the sculptors Henri Bouchard and Charles Despiau‚Äîand with stage designers from the theatre. Mare applied the principles of disruptive coloration camouflage using forms derived from Cubism: bands of colour juxtaposed to prevent the eye from recognizing the shape of a gun barrel, for example. Colours are chosen to overlap with those of the surrounding landscape. At that time, Mare painted ten of his many watercolour sketchbooks in Cubist style. His sketched designs include hollow camouflaged armoured trees for use as observation posts.Art of the First World War: Andr√© Mare and Leon Underwood . The Elm at Vermezeele (a camouflaged iron tree). Retrieved 2 June 2012. In 1916 Mare was badly wounded by shrapnel from a shell on the front in Picardy while helping to set up an observation post.Art of the First World War: Andr√© Mare . Retrieved 2 June 2012. On 10 August 1916 Mare was awarded the Military Cross by King George V of England. ==Art Deco== At the end of the War, Mare returned quickly to his artistic work. In 1919, he was commissioned, along with Louis S√ºe and Gustave Louis Jaulmes, to design the decorations for the Champs-√âlys√©es and the Arc-de-Triomphe to celebrate the first Bastille Day after the war. In 1919 he also joined with Lous S√ºe to create the Compagnie des Arts Fran√ßaise, an interior design firm. He began producing designs for wallpapers, upholstery and other fabrics with his signature designs of baskets and wreaths of roses. Mare and S√ºe worked together for eight years, making some fifty different architectural ensembles, including interiors for the French Embassies in Warsaw and Washington, for the house of perfume manufacturer Jean Patou, and the grand salon of the ocean liner Ile-de-France. They were also invited by the composer Maurice Ravel to design sets and costumes for his new ballet, L'Heure Espanol, at the Paris Opera. In 1926, Andr√© Mare was made a knight of the French Legion of Honour for his services to the decorative arts. In 1921, Mare and S√ºe published a manifesto called Architectures, with illustrations by artists including Paul Vera, Roger de La Fresnaye, Marie Laurencin, and Charles Dufresne, and text by Paul Val√©ry. They declared that their objective was to create ensembles which were \\"serious, logical, and welcoming.\\" The Dining Room for Paul Girod (1920‚Äì21), (now in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris) was typical of the Mare and S√ºe Art Deco style; it featured exquisite craftsmanship and extremely expensive materials; the walls were covered with rosewood and mahogany, and the lighting fixtures were set in a ceiling decorated with gold leaf. On the upper portion of the walls, Bas-reliefs in gilded stucco by Paul Vera illustrated \\"Summer\\" and \\"Autumn\\". The room also featured a fountain and faucets with sculptural decoration of gilded bronze.Descriptive panel for Girod Dining Room, (1921 in the Mus√©e des Arts Decoratifs. Paris However, in his later years, his health, damaged during the war, began to fail. In 1927 Andr√© Mare decided to leave the Compagnie des Arts Fran√ßais for health reasons, and instead devoted himself exclusively to painting. In 1930, he painted a large panel: The Funeral of Marshal Foch with landscapes inspired by his native Normandy. In November 1932, he died of tuberculosis, a result of serious mustard gas poisoning in the war. He is buried in the small cemetery of Lignerits in the Auge. In October‚ÄìNovember 1933, a large body of his works was shown in the 23rd exhibition of the Soci√©t√© Normande de Peinture Moderne in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.L'Esprit fran√ßais, October 10, 1933, No. 85, page 216.

Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \\"copy hands\\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.

It has been found in the State of Bahia and the State of Sergipe, occurring approximately 1,000 km away from the other species in its genus, Xenohyla truncata. Like its relative, this frog spends the day hiding in bromeliads, emerging at night to hunt and forage. While X. truncata loses its white stripes when it matures, X. eugenioi keeps them as an adult. Additionally, X. eugenioi prefers to inhabit agrestes while X. truncata inhabits restingas. Both environments are xeric and both species breed in temporary pools formed by rainwater. Males grow from 30.9 to 31.5 mm (1.22 to 1.24 in) SVL while females reach 39.5 to 45.5 mm (1.56 to 1.8 in) SVL. It is currently unknown if this frog is also frugivorous like its relative. Xenohyla eugenioi is named after the Brazilian herpetologist Eug√™nio Izecksohn. Izecksohn described the type species Hyla truncata in 1959 and later established the genus Xenohyla where he transferred it to in 1998. == Gallery == File:Xenohyla-eugenioi- side-view.pngSide view File:Xenohyla-eugenioi-dorsal-view.pngTop view File:Xenohyla-eugenioi-holotype.pngHolotype File:Xenohyla-eugenioi-holotype- illustration.pngHolotype illustration ==References== Category:Xenohyla Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1998 Category:Taxa named by Ulisses Caramaschi Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Xenohyla eugenioi"},{"id":"12376345","text":"Izecksohn's Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) is a species of frugivorous tree frog in the family Hylidae endemic to the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The range of this frog ranges from the southern border of Esp√≠rito Santo down to Ilha da Marambaia, inhabiting mostly restingas near the coast and on some islands. They shelter inside bromeliads such as Neoregelia cruenta during the day and breed in temporary pools. When disturbed, this tree frog will tilt its head down, outstretch its legs, and puff up. This posture breaks up the frogs outline and makes it appear larger. These tree frogs are listed as near threatened because they are restricted to an area of less than 20,000 square kilometres and because human development modifies or destroys their restinga habitats. As a juvenile, Xenohyla truncata has white stripes down the sides of its body but they disappear at maturity, leaving the adult frog a uniform brown or orange. Defensive posture of Xenohyla truncata This species of frog is unique in that it is the only known frugivorous frog in the world. This frog will eat various types of plants, including Anthurium harrisii, Erythroxylum ovalifolium, and Maytenus obtusifolia. Inside the stomach contents of Xenohyla truncata were found many different types of arthropods, fruits, seeds, pods, pulp and Ô¨Çowers. The amount of plant material eaten by the frog likely depends on the blooming and fruiting periods of the plants, with various types of arthropods eaten instead when plants are unavailable. The frog will locate the fruit and simply snap at it, swallowing it whole. The frog has been found to defecate viable seeds and likely helps in the spread of the plants it consumes. The plants Erythroxylum ovalifolium and Maytenus obtusifolia both contain toxic alkaloids and terpenes, and Xenohyla truncata has been found to excrete from its skin the chemical compound N-phenyl-acetamide, which is capable of causing liver and kidney damage in vertebrates.Xenohyla truncata perched on Erythroxylum ovalifolium, a type of shrub which it consumes the fruit of.Several of the arthropods consumed by the frog have been found to inhabit bromeliads. These arthropods are cockroach larvae, dragonfly larvae, and crab spiders. This suggests that the bromeliads not only provide cover during the day, but also a food source. Sand has also been found in the digestive tract, meaning that the frog forages on the ground. ==References== Category:Xenohyla Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1959 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians of Brazil ","title":"Xenohyla truncata"},{"id":"12376364","text":"Geney is a commune in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© region in eastern France.

It was the successor to the Nissan R380-II, which had been originally developed by the Prince Motor Company ==Development== Following the defeat of the Nissan R380-II at the 1967 running of the Japanese Grand Prix, Nissan set about developing an improved car for the 1968 event. Aware of the new CanAm series in North America that ran under the new Group 7 classification, the new R381 became a much more powerful and faster car in comparison to the previous model. Knowing that the original Prince GR8 Straight-6 would not be powerful enough, Nissan planned to use a new Prince- built V12. However the engines was not completed in time (partially due to this being the first time Nissan or Prince had constructed a V12), so the company turned to a Chevrolet 5.5L V8 which produced nearly 450 hp, twice the amount of the Prince GR8. Also borrowing from CanAm, most notably Chaparral, large rear wings were placed on the new design. These dual wings placed side by side could be driven by hydraulics that moved either the left or right wing up or down in order to increase cornering ability. For bodywork, the R381 was initially an evolution of the R380's coupe design. The rear tail was lengthened and the engine cover made flat in order to increase rear downforce in conjunction with the rear wing. The back of the car was also made flat, with a Kamm tail effect. However, upon becoming aware of the new Toyota 7 car which also ran in Group 7 rules, Nissan chose to cut the roof of the R381 off. A thin windshield was all that remained, while a tiny rollbar was placed on the engine cover. ==Racing history== Debuting at the fourth Japanese Grand Prix, three R381s fought alongside three older R380-IIs as well as three of the new Toyota 7s. Several Porsches also made up the field. The entire Nissan contingent performed well, taking five of the top six spots, with a Porsche 910 taking second. The R381 of Moto Kitano took the race win. Following the Japanese Grand Prix, the R381 was replaced by the newer R382, which featured an entirely Nissan-built engine.

Hewlett was born in Chetnole, Dorset to Timothy Hewlett. In his early 20s he established a school in Shacklewell, Hackney. During this period, he became acquainted with the young Mary Wollstonecraft, then running her own school at nearby Newington Green. Hewlett persuaded her to write her first book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, and sold the yet-unwritten manuscript to the radical publisher Joseph Johnson. He also introduced her to the great lexicographer Samuel Johnson. In 1786 he was admitted as a sizar to Magdalene College, Cambridge. The Cambridge Alumni Database lists him as \\"a ten-year man\\", which the University defines as: \\"Under the 1570 statutes it was made possible for a man over the age of twenty-four to proceed to the degree of BD ten years after matriculation without first proceeding to the degrees of BA and MA . The privilege was not much used until shortly before its abolition in the mid-nineteenth century when it had degenerated into a system whereby a man could proceed BD without any formal test of his ability.\\" In 1796 he was awarded the Bachelor of Divinity. Around 1802, he sold the school and accepted the position of morning preacher at the Foundling Hospital in London. He was appointed rector of Hilgay, Downham, Norfolk in 1819 and served as professor of belles-lettres (literature) at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. He is buried in the catacombs of the Foundling Chapel. Hewlett published on several subjects. His Vindication of the Parian Chronicle (1789) discussed one of the Arundel marbles, some of which are now at the Ashmolean Museum. The Parian Chronicle is a Greek chronology, covering the years from 1582 BC to 299 BCE, inscribed on a stele. He translated Leonhard Euler's Elements of Algebra, one of the first textbooks to set out algebra in a manner we would recognise today. After the death of George Gregory, Hewlett continued publishing a newly edited Bible serially. He published numerous books of sermons and theology as well as an Introduction to Reading and Spelling (1816). His most important work, however, was his edition of the Bible (1812), which included five volumes of commentaries (1816).Boase, G. C. and Matthew, H. G.

A small number of engineers, company directors, and managers from Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea have also moved to the Middle East. ==Demographics== Theravada Buddhism is the predominant religion of workers from Thailand and Sri Lanka. Mahayana Buddhism is the predominant religion of workers from East Asia and Vietnam, although Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto are also represented among these people.

Several royal heirs inhabited Kuchesar Fort to enhance their profiles, which increased the trading post's popularity. Eventually, government officials closed the fort down due to a significant number of deaths and illnesses. In 1790, the fort was conferred upon the Singh family on a perpetual lease by Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. In 1994, the fort was restored and turned into a hotel known as the Mud Fort Kuchesar or Rao Raj Vilas, and has become a popular tourist attraction for the city. The hotel preserves the fort's mid-18th century influences and reflects the vibrant mix of cultures. ==Description== The fort is located in the Ganges River basin 24 kilometers from the bank of the river.https://www.mudfortkuchesar.com/ The main palace was built on top of a large bastion. Although it has been restored, the fort retains much of its original 18th-century architecture with the addition of several turrets built during the British era. ==History== Kuchesar Fort was built in 1734 as an opium trading post, by the rulers of Kuchesar , which belonged to the Dalal clan of the Jat people. In 1763 Afrasiab Khan, governor of nearby Koyal, took over the fort with a plot involving a royal eunuch spiking drinks with opium. The Jat rulers reclaimed the fort in 1782 and have held it ever since. After the Pashtun Najib ad-Dawlah bestowed the Jat family with the title of Rao Bahadur, the fort served as the seat of the Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Jat people competed with Marathas, Rohillas, French colonists, traders, explorers, and the British East India Company for control of the area. In 1790, the fort was granted to Ajit Singh's family on a perpetual lease by Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. This grant was reaffirmed by the British in 1803. Kuchesar Fort was also a Center for the Rai Brahmins or Bhatts (a branch of the Kashmiri Brahmins), who were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State, performing a role similar to that of a poet laureate. ==Restoration and present-day operations== Over the centuries, the property and foliage surrounding Kuchesar Fort became difficult to manage and fell into disarray. In 1994, residents began to restore the fort, Neemrana Hotels transforming it into a heritage-style hotel known as Mud Fort Kuchesar or Rao Raj Vilas.https://www.cleartrip.com/activities/delhi/mudfort-kuchesar The restoration project included the design and construction of a new dining hall, swimming pool, and residential units for families, the balconies of which bear a resemblance to Mughal architecture with their arches and lattice edges.

Soon thereafter Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng also came to work at Le Travail (ƒê·ªìng was also a Politburo member and long time communist functionary). Vo Nguy√™n Giap stated that the paper had to be written in French to get around colonial administrative difficulties. == Establishment of the newspaper == Apparently, Vo Nguy√™n Giap had tried to publish another paper few months earlier under the name Hon Tre Tap Moi [Soul of Youth, new edition] in Vietnamese, to fight for democracy, to claim amnesty for political prisoners, and to approve of the French Front Populaire. Vo Nguy√™n Giap had found out from a news bulletin that in May 1936, the French \\"Front Populaire\\" composed of ten political organizations, among them the communist and socialist parties, forming the nucleus of the Front, had won general elections. Vo Nguy√™n Giap then was preoccupied with how to fight the anticolonialist war, immediately thought of taking advantage of this situation for his movement. The news paper was used as a political tool. Hon Tre Tap Moi was practically the first newspaper in Vietnam to promote democracy, and demand amnesty for the political prisoners. It was published on June 6, 1936, two days after L√©on Blum, then the new French prime minister came to power. The paper was a success until the French closed it down on the fifth issue. To get around the problems, Vo Nguy√™n Giap had decided to publish a newspaper in French. Thus Le Travail was born on September 16, 1936. Vo Nguy√™n Giap became the editor in chief. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh joined in when he was released from jail in late 1936. [Chinh was already a longtime member of the Politburo and a communist functionary]. Soon thereafter Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng also came to work at Le Travail (Dong was also a Politburo member and long time communist functionary). == Life of Le Travail == Many students from Albert Sarraut joined in without much knowledge about communism, including Ho√†ng VƒÉn Ch√≠. On 16 April 1937 the French Resident ordered stopping all publication of Le Travail. By then thirty issues of the paper had been published over the seven months of its existence. ==References External links == 1\\\\.

Distinguishing the species can be difficult, with many similar in appearance and colour, forcing the use of swim bladder morphology as a definitive feature. All species are benthic in nature and generally coastal fish, living in shallow, protected waters although there are exceptions. Minor fisheries exist around various species of Sillago, making them of minor importance in most of their range. This genus has the widest distribution of any smelt-whiting genus, spanning much of the Indo-Pacific. The genus ranges from the east coast of Africa to Japan in the east and Southern Australia in the south, with most species concentrated around South East Asia, the Indonesian Archipelago and Australia. Many species have overlapping distribution, often making positive identification hard. ==Taxonomy== The genus Sillago is one of five genera in the family Sillaginidae, itself part of the Percoidea, a suborder of the Perciformes. The name was first coined by famed taxonomist Georges Cuvier as a genus for his newly described species, Sillago acuta, which was later found to be a junior synonym of S. sihama. John Richardson placed the genus, along with Sillaginodes and Sillaginopsis in a family, which he named the Sillaginidae in 1846. Many species, both valid and invalid were added to the genus and it was not until 1985 when Roland McKay of the Queensland Museum published a revision of the family Sillaginidae that the complex relationships between these names was cleared up. McKay further divided Sillago into three subgenera based primarily on the morphology of the swim bladder.McKay, R.J. (1985): A revision of the fishes of the family Sillaginidae.

Fish are taken by a variety of methods including seine, gill and cast nets as well as by line. Recreational fishing for them is common, especially in Australia where they are valued as food fish or for live bait for larger species. Estuarine aquaculture in India, Japan and Taiwan has utilized sillagos as an important species and similar trials have been conducted in Australia.

The operators of nearby Phoenix International Raceway argued that the event's original planned dates were too close to the Checker Auto Parts 500, a NASCAR race that is a major event for the race track. A compromise to postpone the proposed downtown race eased the fears and PIR officials withdrew their opposition, clearing the way for city council approval. A test run of the track held on March 6, 2007, featuring Team Australia drivers Will Power and Simon Pagenaud eased noise concerns and earned the approval of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, apparently clearing the final hurdle to the race. ==Cancellation== Race organizers experienced difficulties in securing adequate sponsorship for the event in spite of the favorable support from the Phoenix city council.

In July 1872, at the age of fourteen, Krauskopf emigrated to the United States, expecting to join his older brother, Manaseh, in New Jersey. Tragically, his brother was murdered just as Krauskopf arrived in the United States and instead he went to Fall River, Massachusetts, where he had cousins. There he found employment as clerk in a tea-store. While not denying or renouncing his own faith, he attended the local Unitarian Church (there was no Jewish congregation in the city), and became a prot√©g√© of Mrs. Mary Bridges Canedy Slade, who was the assistant editor the New England Journal of Education, a well-known author and composer, and the wife of the principal of the local high school, Albion Slade. Mrs. Slade directed Krauskopf's self- education, as he could not afford to quit work to attend school. In 1875 Mrs. Slade recommended him to Isaac Mayer Wise who was organizing the first rabbinical class at the newly founded Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. Rabbi Wise probably respected Slade's recommendation because she was a prominent hymnist and author of children's literature. Also writing a letter of recommendation for Krauskopf was William Reed, the editor of the Fall River Daily Evening News. Thus, through the intervention of this devoutly Christian woman, Krauskopf went to rabbinical school. ==Rabbinical education and early career== Krauskopf arrived in Cincinnati in 1875 to be part of the first class at Hebrew Union College. This was Krauskopf's first opportunity to enter a program of formal education since arriving in the United States three years earlier at the age of fourteen. Krauskopf spent the next eight years at Hebrew Union College. In this time, he earned a high school degree, a bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati, and finally rabbinical ordination from Hebrew Union College in 1883. Therefore, in Cincinnati, he effectively went to high school, college, and rabbinical school simultaneously. While studying at Hebrew Union and at the University of Cincinnati, Krauskopf earned money as a tutor, contributed articles to journals, and published and marketed (with his future brother-in-law, Henry Berkowitz) the Union Hebrew Reader (1881, commonly known as the First Union Hebrew Reader), the Second Union Hebrew Reader (1884), and Bible Ethics: A Manual of Instruction in the History and Principles of Judaism, According to Hebrew Scriptures (1884) (full text). A contemporary journal, which focused on the study of Hebrew language and literature, praised the first Union Hebrew Reader (which sold for 25 cents) for providing ordered lessons that would \\"lead to the needed familiarity with the Hebrew page.\\" In 1899 both of his Hebrew readers were being sold through the \\"Educational Catalogue for 1899\\" advertised in the publishing industry trade journal, Bookseller, Newsdealer, and Stationer. While studying for his ordination, Krauskopf served as a student rabbi in Peoria, Illinois, and in Kalamazoo, Michigan. After his ordination, he became the rabbi at Congregation B'nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1885, he finished work on his graduate degree and earned a Doctor of Divinity from Hebrew Union College. In Kansas City, Krauskopf was enormously popular within his synagogue and the larger urban community. He gave widely attended public lectures, some of which were later published as books. Additionally, he was involved in a wide range of civic activities. The governor of Missouri made him a life- member of the board of what was then known as the National Conference of Charities and Corrections. In 1885 he was instrumental in organizing a convention of reform Rabbis in Pittsburgh. Although only two years out of rabbinical school, he was elected vice-president of the Pittsburgh Conference, of which Isaac Mayer Wise was president. This conference wrote the Pittsburgh Platform, which became the defining statement of Reform Judaism at that time. In July 1887 Krauskopf accepted an offer from Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel of Philadelphia. His Kansas City congregation tried to prevent him from leaving, and even state and local politicians pressured him to reject the offer from KI. A delegation from Kansas City failed in its attempt to get KI to release Krauskopf from his contract. All of this caused some embarrassment and delayed his move, but he finally left for Philadelphia in late October. ==Career at Keneseth Israel== Krauskopf was formally installed at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel (KI) on October 23, 1887. Once in Philadelphia, Krauskopf quickly established himself as a leading figure in both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Krauskopf's congregation was almost entirely made up of Jews from Germany and other parts of central Europe. From the beginning of KI (in 1847) services and board meetings had always been conducted in German. Krauskopf was from Germany and spoke fluent German. Nevertheless, he transformed KI into an English speaking and thoroughly Americanized house of worship. For example, while continuing to hold religious services on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, Krauskopf also established a Sunday service which followed the traditions of American Protestantism. These Sunday services were more educational than religious, with Krauskopf giving sermons or lectures that lasted more than an hour. He spoke on theology, religion, ethics, social science, natural science and current events. A talented and popular speaker, he drew as many as 1,000 listeners to his Sunday services, including non- members and non-Jews who came to hear him speak. Krauskopf published these sermons and lectures as pamphlets which sold briskly. Under Krauskopf, KI flourished and became the largest reform Jewish congregation in the United States. Following the intellectual lead of his teacher, Isaac Mayer Wise, he was committed to the study of Jewish-Christian relations and even attempted to reclaim the apostle Paul as a model for Judaism. He worked closely with Catholic and Protestant leaders in Philadelphia, and was a force for ethnic and religious pluralism. On a national level, he helped organize the Jewish Publication Society of America, in 1888. Krauskopf's congregation was almost entirely made up of German Jews. However, at this time, the American Jewish world was being transformed by massive immigration from Russia, Poland, and other parts of Eastern Europe. In 1894 Krauskopf visited Russia to investigate the condition of Jews in that notoriously anti-Semitic nation. Initially the Russian government refused to give him a visa, simply because he was Jewish. This led to a resolution in Congress, proposed by Representative Isidor Rayner of Maryland, urging the United States to abrogate the existing treaty with Russia. Congressman Rayner argued that if an American citizen could not freely travel in a country (Russia), then the United States should not maintain a treaty of friendship with that country. Krauskopf was uncomfortable with this publicity, but later admitted it probably led to Russia finally granting him a visa. While in Russia, Krauskopf gained a first hand look at the condition of the Jews within the Pale of Settlement. Krauskopf met with American diplomats, Russian political leaders and various intellectuals including Leo Tolstoy, best known as the author of War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). Tolstoy told Krauskopf that the Jews had no future in Russia. At Tolstoy's suggestion, Krauskopf visited Jewish agricultural colonies in the Russian Empire and the Jewish Agricultural School at Odessa. On his return he worked to establish a similar institution outside of Philadelphia, believing that it would attract Jews from Russia and help provide them with an education to begin a new life in the United States. By 1895, Krauskopf had raised enough money to start a school, which was established in 1896 as the National Farm School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The school was non-sectarian, and indeed non-religious, but most of the early students were Jewish. Support came from private donations, state funds, and the Federation of Jewish Charities of Philadelphia. Krauskopf served as the first president of the institution, which is now Delaware Valley University. Krauskopf spent a great deal of time raising money for the school, and in 1905 led a capital campaign that raised $50,000 (about $1.5 million in 2015), including a $12,500 donation from Andrew Carnegie. When Krauskopf came to KI, the congregation had 250 member families. Within a few years it had over 400 member families. By 1892 the Congregation had moved to a newly constructed impressive building on Broad Street with seating in the sanctuary for over 1600 people. A year later the Congregation hired an assistant rabbi to work under Krauskopf. By 1900, KI's religious school had over 500 students. Under Krauskopf KI abolished the traditional Bar Mittzvah for thirteen-year-old boys and replaced it with a confirmation for boys and girls at age sixteen or seventeen. Shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Krauskopf became a leader of the National Relief Commission, and was one of three special field commissioners to visit army camps of the United States and Cuba. Almost immediately after he arrived in Cuba, Krauskopf contacted the Jewish philanthropist Nathan Strauss, persuading him to donate an ice factory to support the needs of American troops in Cuba. Two weeks later the entire ice plant was shipped to Santiago, Cuba. In Cuba, Krauskopf became friends with Col. Theodore Roosevelt and conducted services for the eight Jewish soldiers in Roosevelt's Rough Riders (the First United States Volunteer Cavalry). Krauskopf and Roosevelt would remain friends and when Roosevelt died Krauskopf had a large stained glass window commissioned in his honor which today, is part of the entrance foyer in the Keneseth Israel synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. In March 1903, Krauskopf was elected director-general of the Isaac Meyer Wise Memorial Fund, and in July of the same year he became president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the main professional organization of reform rabbis. During World War I Krauskopf continued his patriotic public service, working under Herbert Hoover in the U.S. Food Administration. During this period he spent a good deal of time in Washington. He served on the Liberty Loan Committee for Philadelphia and was worked on issues involving food conservation. This dovetailed with his long relationship to the National Farm School. ==Writings and scholarship== Krauskopf was a prolific writer. After his ordination he published 14 major books, hundreds of sermons as pamphlets, numerous journal and newspaper articles, and various other publications. The Jews and Moors in Spain came from a series of eighteen public lectures Krauskopf gave while he was the Rabbi at Congregation B'Nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri. These lectures were initially published in the Kansas City Journal These lectures were enormously popular among \\"both Jews and Christians\\" and thus Krauskopf consented to their publication in book form. Indicative of their popularity, and the political significance of Krauskopf's interfaith activities, the book had letters of endorsement from Thomas T. Crittenden, the former Governor of Missouri and U.S. District Judge Arnold Krekel. In his book Evolution and Judaism, Krauskopf accepted the idea that science might \\"overshadow\\" religion but that the science needs to be well understood and properly connected to religion. Krauskopf accepted the scientific legitimacy of evolution and Darwinian theory. He argued, in a chapter titled \\"Darwinism,\\" that \\"Supreme order is the manifestation of supreme intelligence. If I had no other proof for my belief in the existence and sovereignty of an Intelligent Final Cause, I would derive it from my recognition of the fact that supreme order, uninterrupted harmony, eternal and immutable law, control all nature, heaven and earth, all inorganic and organic, in but one way, and in no other.\\" He argues that evolution is simply part of the law of nature and that \\"this natural law shape matter with design and direct force with a purpose, and design and purpose presuppose intelligence.\\" Krauskopf argued that evolution was the same as \\"Supreme Governing Power, Supreme Will, Supreme Natural Law\\" and that \\"by theologians it is called 'God.'\\" With \\"this conception of the nature of God\\" he argued that \\"every difference between science and religion disappears\\" and \\"with this conception of God, as manifested in nature, I am prepared to accept even Darwinism.\\" Thus, Krauskopf accepted evolution, as set out by Darwin, as consistent with the existence of God, because God provided the \\"supreme intelligence\\" to let evolution happen. Under this analysis, there could be no conflict between religion and science, and \\"Darwinism, though disagreeing with the Biblical account of creation is with religion, not against it.\\" He praised Darwin, declaring that \\"God has had no better interpreter of the greatness and magnificence of His handiwork.\\" He acknowledged that Darwin \\"opposed\\" the \\"Biblical account\\" of creation, because modern research proved the Biblical account of creation imperfect,\\" But Krauskopf argued that this science, and Darwinian notions such as natural selection, actually supported the idea of a superior being ‚Äì God ‚Äì who set into motion evolution through natural selection. He concluded that \\"Judaism and ever progressive religion with a conception of God ... can freely and conscientiously accept the theory of organic evolution.\\" Thus, the \\"sum of Supreme Will, Supreme Power, Supreme Intelligence, evolutionists name The Reign of Natural Law, the theologians call it God.\\" Evolution and Judaism is also interesting because, at the same time as adopting a sceptical approach to traditional readings of the bible, Krauskopf attempted to justify Jewish religious continuity by presenting a Jewish form of panentheism that viewed the universe as an evolving phenomenon and presented a biological argument for the reality of life beyond death. In Jesus‚ÄîMan or God? Kraukopf argued Jesus was centrally a Jewish scholar and compares his teachings to those of the Jewish philosopher/ scholar Hillel that the historical persecution of Jews was a result of Christianity rejecting, or forgetting, its Jewish and Old Testament origins and in effect, becoming paganized. As a result of this \\"the [Christian] church, founded on love and peace and justice, became a church of hatred and inhumanity.\\" He argued that the Protestant Reformation led to \\"the slow return from the pagan Christ to the Judean Jesus, the gradual stripping away of the many foreign-borrowed accretions under which the Nazarene prophet and patriot had well-night been buried\\" and thus \\"after eighteen hundred years of cruel separation, Christian and Jew are drawing closer to each other.\\" He argued that \\"Unitarian and Reformed Jewish Churches\\" were \\"the advance guard of both factions have met.\\" Krauskopf believed that Christianity ‚Äì and especially the New Testament ‚Äì had been corrupted by \\"foreign material and falsified history, of pagan mythology and Persian demonology and Egyptian mysticism.\\" He argued that one modern Christianity purged itself of this invasive material Christianity would move back toward its Jewish roots based on \\"the Judaism that was taught by a Jewish prophet, and patriot and martyr, the Rabbi of Nazareth.\\" ==Personal life== In 1883 Krauskopf married Rose Berkowitz, the sister of his close friend and intellectual collaborator, Henry Berkowitz. In the same ceremony, Henry Berkowitz married Flora Brunn. The ceremony was conducted by Rabbi Isaac Meyer Wise, who had been the mentor to both men at HUC. The Krauskopfs had three children, Harold, Eleanore, and Manfred, before Rose died in 1893. After her death Krauskopf was absorbed in professional duties and activities, including his trip to Russia and founding the National Farm School. However, during this period he managed to court Sybil Feineman, who was the daughter of Krauskopf's former congregants in Kansas City. In fact, Krauskopf had taught her when she took a confirmation class in Benai Jehuda. In 1896 he went back to Kansas City to marry her, in a ceremony at her parents‚Äô house. The Rabbi was 38 at the time and his new wife was 25. They had one child, Madeleine. In 1923 KI made Krauskopf a rabbi for life, with the expectation that he would retire soon. However, shortly after that, on June 12, 1923 Krauskopf died. Members of his family continued his traditions in many ways. His great nephew was Rabbi Malcolm H. Stern, who became an assistant rabbi at KI, published First American Jewish Families (1960, revised 1991), and was the president of the American Jewish Genealogical Society. Rabbi Krauskopf's son, Manfred, served as the president of the Board of Trustees of the National Farm School, which his father had founded. The Rabbi's grandson, Joseph L. Krauskopf served on the Board of Trustees of the Farm School and his great-grandson, Joseph Charles Krauskopf, currently serves on the board of the same institution which has evolved into Delaware Valley University. ==Selected publications== * * * Sunday Discourses (1887‚Äì1902) * * Service Ritual (1888) * Service Manual (1892) * My Visit to Tolstoy: Five Discourses (cir. 1894) * Gleanings from Our Vineyard (1895) * The Mourners' Service (1895) * Sabbath-School Service (1896) * Society and Its Morals (1900) * (reprint available:  2018 Global Grey) * The Seven Ages of Man (1902) * Old Truths in New Books (1902) * ==References== * * Goldman, Yosef.

Originally, three Tests were arranged and England won two of these after losing the first. Although the actual sequence of events has never been completely confirmed, it was after England won the third Test that Ivo Bligh was somehow presented with a small urn which is believed to contain the ashes of a burnt bail. He brought this back to England and it is now the most famous exhibit in the museum at Lord's Cricket Ground. England and Australia have been contesting these mythical Ashes ever since.

Popular techniques include the use of toy cameras or pinhole cameras, for their distinctive stylistic effects. It can be considered a reaction to the perceived ease of creating technically perfect photos in the digital age. Some emphasize a return to film, while others use digital technology to accomplish the same effects. Low-fidelity photography has also been commonly linked with lo-fi music as well. \\" == Additional Information == Use of Lo-fi photography is slowly becoming a popular genre of Photography. It uses the basics of digital photography to usually create more of a soft look to photos compared to crisp and high definition photographs. This is a variation that is among some photographers are attracted to. However, lo-fi photography can be unpredictable with its exposure. Lo-fi photography is less of methodical format photography and more of a pick the best kind of photography. Lo-fi allows the photographer to basically take as many photos as possible and choose the best from the bunch. This is what makes lo-fi photography enjoyable. The unpredictability makes it so even the photographer does not know what they will receive. Creating lo-fi photography is also cheap and can be done with any low mega-pixel camera. When it comes to low megapixels you can use a toy camera or something as simple as a disposable camera. This is especially good for traveling because if something breaks it is a cheap replacement. However, there are specific cameras for purchase that can be used to create lo-fi photography. Since it is a low cost, minimal training type of photography, it is no surprise that lo-fi photography was discovered more prominently through Instagram. The softer lines and hazy aesthetic of a lo-fi photograph make it completely unusable to forms of print such as magazines, or any form of photographic research. However, the low budget cameras and lack of needed equipment make it an easy type of photography to produce for up and coming photographers looking for an outlet and this type of photography is accessible enough that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before this trend changes into a more well-known genre of photography with well-known artists endorsing it. Lo-fi photography has already been fully embraced vintage enthusiasts, who prefer the timelessness of the photography style as opposed to state of the art cameras. This style of photography is less of a straight edge photography style, and more of an art style, making the images taken hard to place in a timeline, with no other use other than to appeal to the eye. The clouded lens is extremely reminiscent of art styles that many painters have used in their works, and many people are drawn in by the similarities of the photography to hand-drawn art forms. == See also == * Toy camera * Pinhole camera * Instant camera * Redscale * Cross processing * Sprocket hole photography * Outsider Art ==References== Category:Photography by genre ","title":"Lo-fi photography"},{"id":"12376712","text":"Wasteland is an American drama that aired on ABC from October 7 until October 21, 1999.

Built to the Group 7 motorsports formula, the car featured Nissan's first V12 engine. It was a replacement for the Nissan R381 from the previous year. ==Development== Although the previous R381 had shown its potential in terms of aerodynamics and reliability, the car had been unable to use the planned 600 hp 5954 cc V12 engine that Prince was building for Nissan. With the V12 completed soon after the R381 won the Japanese Grand Prix, Nissan turned instead to developing an all-new car to house the V12 engine, now named GRX-3. A GRX-II V12 engine R382 on track The bodywork of the new open-cockpit R382 was scratch built, sharing nothing with the R381. A wide rectangular front end replaced the rounded front of the R381, while the adjustable rear wings were eliminated due to their being outlawed by the FIA. Instead, a wing was designed into the bodywork of the tail, forming the rear fenders. Instead of allowing air freely through the bottom of the rear wing, a radiator was placed in the opening in order to better cool the new V12 engine. A large intake was also placed on top of the engine in order to better feed air to the motor. ==Racing history== For the 1969 Japanese Grand Prix, Nissan was facing more competition than ever before. The Porsche factory decided to bring one of their new 917s to the event with Jo Siffert and David Piper. Various other Porsches were also part of the field. Toyota had been continuing in development of their 7, while Isuzu entered for the first time with their R7-Chevrolets.

This article addresses the chemical contamination of foods, as opposed to microbiological contamination, which can be found under foodborne illness. The impact of chemical contaminants on consumer health and well-being is often apparent only after many years of processing and prolonged exposure at low levels (e.g., cancer). Unlike food-borne pathogens, chemical contaminants present in foods are often unaffected by thermal processing. Chemical contaminants can be classified according to the source of contamination and the mechanism by which they enter the food product. ==Agrochemicals== Agrochemicals are chemicals used in agricultural practices and animal husbandry with the intent to increase crop yields. Such agents include pesticides (e.g., insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides), plant growth regulators, veterinary drugs (e.g., nitrofuran, fluoroquinolones, malachite green, chloramphenicol), and bovine somatotropin (rBST). ==Environmental contaminants== Environmental contaminants are chemicals that are present in the environment in which the food is grown, harvested, transported, stored, packaged, processed, and consumed. The physical contact of the food with its environment results in its contamination. Possible sources of contamination and contaminants common to that vector include: *Air: radionuclides (caesium-137, strontium-90), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) *Water: arsenic, mercury *Soil: cadmium, nitrates, perchlorates *Packaging materials: antimony, tin, lead, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), semicarbazide, benzophenone, isopropylthioxanthone (ITX), bisphenol A * Processing/cooking equipment: copper or other metal chips, lubricants, cleaning and sanitizing agents *Naturally occurring toxins: mycotoxins, phytohemagglutinin, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, grayanotoxin, scombrotoxin (histamine), ciguatera, shellfish toxins (see shellfish poisoning), tetrodotoxin, among many others. ==Pesticides and carcinogens== There are many cases of banned pesticides or carcinogens found in foods. * Greenpeace exposed in 2006 that 25% of surveyed supermarkets in China stocked agricultural products contaminated with banned pesticides. Over 70% of tomatoes that tested were found to have the banned pesticide Lindane, and almost 40% of the samples had a mix of three or more types of pesticides. Tangerine, strawberry, and Kyofung grape samples were also found contaminated by banned pesticides, including the highly toxic methamidophos. Greenpeace says there exists no comprehensive monitoring on fruit produce in the Hong Kong as of 2006. * In India, soft drinks were found contaminated with high levels of pesticides and insecticides, including lindane, DDT, malathion and chlorpyrifos. * Formaldehyde, a carcinogen, was frequently found in the common Vietnamese dish, Pho, resulting in the 2007 Vietnam food scare. \\"Health agencies have known that Vietnamese soy sauce, the country's second most popular sauce after fish sauce, has been chock full of cancer agents since at least 2001\\", reported the Thanh Nien daily. \\"Why didn't anyone tell us?\\" The carcinogen in Asian sauces is 3-MCPD and its metabolite 1,3-DCP, which has been an ongoing problem affecting multiple continents. Vietnamese vegetables and fruits were also found to have banned pesticides. * The 2005 Indonesia food scare, where carcinogenic formaldehyde was found to be added as a preservative to noodles, tofu, salted fish, and meatballs. * In 2008 Chinese milk scandal, melamine was discovered to have been added to milk and infant formula which caused 54,000 babies to be sent to the hospital. Six babies died because of kidney stones related to the contaminant. ==Hair in food== There is a heavy stigma attached to the presence of hair in food in most societies. There is a risk that it may induce choking and vomiting, and also that it may be contaminated by toxic substances. Views differ as to the level of risk it poses to the inadvertent consumer. In most countries, people working in the food industry are required to cover their hair because it will contaminate the food. When people are served food which contains hair in restaurants or caf√©s, it is usual for them to complain to the staff. There are a range of possible reasons for the objection to hair in food, ranging from cultural taboos to the simple fact that it is difficult to digest and unpleasant to eat. It may also be interpreted as a sign of more widespread problems with hygiene. The introduction of complete-capture hairnets is believed to have resulted in a decrease in incidents of contamination of this type. Sometimes protein from human hair is used as a food ingredient, in bread and other such similar products. Such use of human hair in food is forbidden in Islam. Historically, in Judaism, finding hair in food was a sign of bad luck. ==Processing contaminants== Processing contaminants are generated during the processing of foods (e.g., heating, fermentation). They are absent in the raw materials, and are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided. Technological processes can be adjusted and/or optimized, however, in order to reduce the levels of formation of processing contaminants. Examples are: nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heterocyclic amines, histamine, acrylamide, furan, benzene, trans fat, 3-MCPD, semicarbazide, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and ethyl carbamate. There is also the possibility of metal chips from the processing equipment contaminating food. These can be identified using metal detection equipment. In many conveyor lines, the line will be stopped, or when weighing the product with a Check weigher, the item can be rejected for being over- or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it. ==Emerging food contaminants== While many food contaminants have been known for decades, the formation and presence of certain chemicals in foods has been discovered relatively recently. These are the so-called emerging food contaminants like acrylamide, furan, benzene, perchlorate, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), 3-monochloropropane-1,3-diol (3-MCPD), 4-hydroxynonenal, and (4-HNE). ==Safety and regulation== Acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and tolerable concentrations of contaminants in individual foods are determined on the basis of the \\"No Observed Adverse Effect Level\\" (NOAEL) in animal experiments, by using a safety factor (usually 100). The maximum concentrations of contaminants allowed by legislation are often well below toxicological tolerance levels, because such levels can often be reasonably achieved by using good agricultural and manufacturing practices. Regulatory officials, in order to combat the dangers associated with foodborne viruses, are pursuing various possible measures. *The EFSA published a report in 2011 on ‚Äúscientific opinion regarding an update of the present knowledge on the occurrence and control of foodborne viruses‚Äù. *This year, an expert working group created by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), is expected to publish a standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in food. *The CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) is also working on a guideline which is now ready for final adoption. *European Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 indicates that ‚Äúfoodstuffs should not contain micro-organisms or their toxins or metabolites in quantities that present an unacceptable risk for human health‚Äù, underlining that methods are required for foodborne virus detection.Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005, Official Journal of the European Union, 15 November 2005, Retrieved 7 April 2015 ==Food contaminant testing== To maintain the high quality of food and comply with health, safety, and environmental regulatory standards, it is best to rely on food contaminant testing through an independent third party, such as laboratories or certification companies. For manufacturers, the testing for food contaminants can minimize the risk of noncompliance in relation to raw ingredients, semi-manufactured foods, and final products. Also, food contaminant testing assures consumers safety and quality of purchased food products and can prevent foodborne diseases, and chemical, microbiological, or physical food hazards.Study finds novel method to test food for contamination The establishment of ADIs for certain emerging food contaminants is currently an active area of research and regulatory debate. == See also == * Bad Bug Book from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration * The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives ==ReferencesExternal links== *Office of Food Additive Safety at the US Food and Drug Administration's website *Chemical Risks in Food from the World Health Organization *Briefing on GM Food Contamination *Pesticides and Chemical Contaminants from the US Food and Drug Administration's website Category:Food safety * Category:Nutrition ","title":"Food contaminant"},{"id":"12376810","text":"Habƒ´b ibn MadhƒÅhir al-Asadi () was of the Banu Asad clan, and one of the companions of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali.

A polymath, he was highly respected for his innovative skill in miniaturization. ==Youth== Gustave Trouv√© was born into a modest family, his father, Jacques Trouv√©, was a cattle dealer.George Barral, \\"L‚Äôhistoire d‚Äôun inventeur: Expos√© des d√©couvertes et des travaux de M. Gustave Trouve dans le domaine de l‚Äô√©lectricit√©\\" (Paris: Georges Carr√©, 1891) In 1850, he studied to be a locksmith in Chinon College, then in 1854-55 at the √âcole des Arts et M√©tiers in Angers.Reference ETP 812, Departmental Archives of Maine-et-Loire His studies incomplete through poor health, he left his local region for Paris where he obtained a job with a clockmaker.Archives de la Ville de Paris ==Paris== From 1865 Trouv√© set up a workshop in central Paris where he innovated and patented many widely differing applications of electricity, regularly reported on by popular science magazines of the time such as La Nature.La t√©l√©graphie militaire (military telegraphy), La Nature, 1876 He invented a carbon-zinc pocket-sized battery to power his miniature electric automata which soon became very popular.

In 1872 he developed a portable military telegraph whose cabling enabled rapid communication up to a distance of one kilometer, enabling the swift transmission of both orders and reports back from the Front. In 1874, he developed a device for locating and extracting metal objects such as bullets from human patients, the prototype of today‚Äôs metal detector.Le XIXe Si√®cle 12 August 1874 In 1878, he improved the sound intensity of Alexander Graham Bell‚Äôs telephone system by incorporating a double membrane. The same year he invented a highly sensitive portable microphone. Trouv√© soon came to be known and respected by his talent for miniaturization. The same year, using a battery developed by Gaston Plant√©, and a small incandescent airtight bulb, he innovated a \\"polyscope\\", the prototype of today‚Äôs endoscope.S√©gal,Alain, ¬´ Place de l‚ÄôIng√©nieur Gustave Trouve dans l‚Äôhistoire de l‚Äôendoscopie ¬ª, TOME XXIX, Histoire des Sciences M√©dicales, Organe Officiel de la Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise d‚ÄôHistoire de la M√©decine, n¬∞ 2, http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1995x029x002/HSMx1995x029x002x0123.pdf 1995 ==The 1880s== Gustave Trouv√©'s tricycle, world's first electric car In 1880 Trouv√© improved the efficiency of a small electric motor developed by Siemens and using the recently developed rechargeable battery, fitted it to an English James Starley tricycle, so inventing the world‚Äôs first electric vehicle.Ernest Henry Wakefield, History of the Electric Automobile, 540 pp, Society of Automobile Engineers, USA , 1993. Although this was successfully tested on 19 April 1881 along the Rue Valois in central Paris, he was unable to patent it.La Nature, 16 April 1881 Trouv√© swiftly adapted his battery- powered motor to marine propulsion; to make it easy to carry his marine conversion to and from his workshop to the nearby River Seine, Trouv√© made it portable and removable from the boat, thus inventing the outboard engine.Desmond, \\"A Century of Outboard Racing\\", Van de Velde Maritime. 2000. On 26 May 1881 the 5m Trouv√© prototype, called Le T√©l√©phone reached a speed of 1 m/s (3.6 km/h) going upstream at 2.5 m/s (9 km/h) downstream.Communication made by Trouv√© to the Acad√©mie des Sciences de Paris, 1881 Trouv√© exhibited his boat (but not his tricycle) and his electro-medical instruments at the International Electrical Exhibition in Paris and soon after was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur.Pantheon of the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur, January 1882 He also miniaturized his electric motor to power a model airship, a dental drill, a sewing machine and a razor.Exposition Internationale de l‚ÄôElectricit√© 1881, Administration-jury-rapports, Tome Premier, 1883, ParisPublicity, ¬´ Overview of the prices of Trouv√© luminous electric jewels, the sole inventor patented in France and abroad ¬ª, in l‚ÄôElectricit√© au theatre, bijoux √©lectromobiles, 1885. Gustave Trouv√© next invented his \\"Photophore\\", or battery-powered frontal headlamp, which he developed for a client, Dr Paul H√©lot, an ear-nose- and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct shaft, lighting system could be oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouv√© soon modified their frontal headlamp both for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as \\"luminous electric jewels\\" and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.Overview of the prices of Trouv√© luminous electric jewels, the sole inventor patented in France and abroad, in l‚ÄôElectricit√© au theatre, bijoux √©lectromobiles, 1885. In 1884, Trouv√© fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport.Letter from G Trouv√© to Paul H√©lot, 25 July 1883 He developed a portable electric safety lamp.Trouv√©, Lampes √©lectriques portatives, communication to the Acad√©mie des Sciences, November 10, 1884 In 1887, Trouv√©, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: Œµ·ΩïœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ± =‚ÄúI have found‚Äù, translated into French ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai trouv√©), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887). Around the same period, Trouv√©, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy but at the time unheard-of flight of 80 meters.M√©moire presented by G. Trouv√©, on 24 August 1891. Conserved at the Acad√©mie des Sciences, Paris, reference arch-2007/26. In 1889, he also fitted the battery-electric rifle he had developed in 1866, with a frontal light enabling nocturnal hunting. He also developed a battery-electric alarm system for nocturnal fishing. ==The 1890s== In 1891 Trouv√© developed electric multi- colored fountains for domestic and outdoor use. Seeing the limitations of electrical supply without the reliable support of a national grid, in 1895 he took the recent discovery of acetylene light and had soon harnessed it for domestic lighting.Journal mensuel de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie nationale de l‚ÄôIndustrie agricole manufacturi√®re et commerciale, December 1895. Among his 75 innovations,(see below) he also developed an electric massaging machine, an electric keyboard instrument based on Savart's wheel, a battery-powered wearable lifejacket, a water-jet propelled boat and a streamlined bicycle, as well as several children's toys. In 1902, Trouv√© was working on his latest innovation, a small portable device which used ultra-violet light to treat skin diseases, the prototype of PUVA therapy when he accidentally cut his thumb and index finger. Neglecting the wound, sepsis set in and after amputations at the Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, the 63-year-old inventor died on 27 July 1902. ==Disappearance and rehabilitation== When the obligatory concession for his tomb in the cemetery of his native town of Descartes was not renewed, Trouv√©‚Äôs remains were thrown into the common grave. His archives were destroyed in February 1980 during an accidental fire in the Town Hall. In 2012, following a French biography by English transport historian Kevin Desmond, a commemorative plaque was officially unveiled on the site of his birthplace. Four years later, following an extended English-language biography, on 15 October 2016, a second plaque was officially unveiled by Desmond and Jacques Boutault, Mayor of Paris 2nd District, on the wall outside his former workshop, 14 rue Vivienne. The search for rare surviving examples of his instruments has become worldwide. On 24 September a Trouv√©/Cadet-Picard gold skull stick pin automaton sold at Bonhams of London for $8,000.\\"Fine Jewellery\\" Bonhams London Thursday 24 September 2015 An exhibition celebrating the 180th anniversary of his birth, entitled \\"Gustave Trouv√©, the da Vinci of the 19th Century\\", took place at his birthplace in Descartes, France during the month of May 2019. Sixteen of his original instruments were brought together, while a line-up of modern electric cars, boats, drones and bicycles were assembled in his honour. In 2020, A Canadian website Plugboats.com launched a competition to vote online for the best electric boats of the year calling it the Gustave Trouv√© Award. The medals portraying Trouv√© were called the Gussies (Gustave). Over 4,000 people voted between May and July 2020. ==Inventions and innovations in chronological order== Outboard motorboat of Gustave Trouv√© Mechanical bird 1864 Electro-spherical Geissler tube motor 1865 The Lilliputian sealed battery 1865 Electro-medical apparatus 1865 Electro-mobile jewelry 1865 Electric gyroscope 1866 Electric rifle 1867 Electro-medical kit 1869 Liquid-fuelled pantoscope 1870 Device imitating the flight of birds 1872 Portable Military Telegraph 1873 Improved dichromate battery 1874 Explorer-extractor of bullets 1875 Electric almanac or calendar 1875 Portable Dynamo-electric machine 1875 Oxygen spacesuit for balloonists 1877 Simulation of muscle contraction 1877 Electric paperweight 1878 Exploratory polyscopes for cavities of the human body 1878 Telephones and improvement of the microphone 1880 Improved Siemens motor 1881 Manufacture of magnets 1881 Luminous electric jewels 1881 Electric boat 1881 Miniaturized dental drill 1881 Marine outboard motor 1881 Electric tricycle 1883 Underwater lighting. 1883 Trouv√©-H√©lot frontal headlamp 1883 Electric vehicle headlamp 1884 Electric safety lamp 1885 Electrical apparatus for lighting physiology and chemistry laboratories 1885 Underwater lighting used during the Suez Canal 1886 New system for constructing propellers 1886 Electric siren as an alarm signal 1887 Working model electric helicopter (tethered) 1887 Electric auxanoscope (image projector) 1889 Electric counter 1889 Dynamo electric demonstrator 1889 Improvements to the electric rifle 1889 System for transporting plate glass sheets 1890 Universal dynamometer 1890 Electric lighting for horse-drawn carriages 1890 Electric orygmatoscope for the inspection of geological layers. 1890 Mobile electric-pneumatic streetlamp lighter 1891 Second mechanical bird 1891 Improvements in luminous electric fountains 1892 Electric trigger mechanism for time-lapse photography 1892 Hand-held medical dynamometer 1892 Battery-electric massage instrument for hernia 1893 Electric industrial ventilation system 1894 System for automatic fishing by night. 1894 Electric stunning lance for hunting 1894 Luminous electric jewelry belt 1894 Electric keyboard instrument based on Savart‚Äôs wheel 1894 Luminous electric jumping rope 1895 Acetylene domestic lighting 1895 Universal AC/DC electric motor 1895 Improved pedal bicycle 1895 Manual/electric hybrid massaging machine 1897 Device for automatic bottling of acetylene 1897 Device for hermetically sealing containers of acetylene 1897 Windmill toy for hats and canes 1898 Multi-task manual-electric industrial gyratory pump 1899 Carburetor for internal combustion engines 1900 Battery electric inflatable wearable lifejacket 1901 Binoculars for the Navy 1901 Phototherapy instruments 1902 Spring-loaded harpoon gun toy 1902 Propulsion of model boat or submarine by acetylene ==ReferencesExternal links== * Biography \\"Gustave Trouv√© French Electrical Genius (1839‚Äì1902)\\" - McFarland Books - Author: Kevin Desmond * Biography \\"A la recherche de Trouv√©\\" - Pleine Page √©diteur - Author: Kevin Desmond * Trouv√© dedicated website: http://www.gustave-trouve-eureka.com Category:French electrical engineers Category:French physicists Category:French inventors Category:1839 births Category:1902 deaths ","title":"Gustave Trouv√©"},{"id":"12376875","text":"There have been six baronetcies created with the surname of Leigh: two in the Baronetage of England, one in the Baronetage of Ireland, one in the Baronetage of Great Britain and two in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

The Leigh Baronetcy, of Tyrone, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in February 1622 for Sir Daniel Leigh. The title became extinct on the death of, his son Sir Arthur Leigh, 2nd Baronet in 1638. The Leigh Baronetcy, of South Carolina, America, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 15 May 1773 for Egerton Leigh, Attorney-General of the British colony of South Carolina, grandson of the Revd Peter Leigh, of West Hall, High Legh, Cheshire by his wife Elizabeth Egerton, only daughter and eventual heiress of The Hon. Thomas Egerton, of Tatton Park, third son of John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgwater. It is not known whether there exist any male descendants of Thomas Egerton Leigh, planter of Georgetown County, South Carolina, the fourth but third surviving son of the first Baronet, thus the title became dormant after the death of the third Baronet. The Leigh Baronetcy, of Whitley in the County of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 27 December 1814 for Robert Holt Leigh. He was a classical scholar who also represented Wigan in the House of Commons. The title became extinct on his death in 1843. He left a life interest in his estates to Thomas Pemberton (son of his cousin Margaret Leigh), who assumed the additional surname of Leigh and who was subsequently raised to the peerage as Baron Kingsdown: see Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown. The Leigh Baronetcy, of Altrincham in the County of Chester, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 9 February 1918 for the newspaper proprietor and Conservative politician John Leigh. He was owner of the Pall Mall Gazette and represented Clapham in the House of Commons between 1922 and 1945. During the First World War he funded the equipment of a hospital for wounded officers at Altrincham. As of 2016 the baronetcy is held by his grandson, Sir Richard Leigh, 3rd Baronet, who succeeded his uncle in the title in 1992.

The Kaga Domain was based at Kanazawa Castle in Kaga Province, in the modern city of Kanazawa, located in the Ch≈´bu region of the island of Honshu. The Kaga Domain was ruled for its existence by the tozama daimy≈ç of the Maeda, and covered most of Kaga Province and Etch≈´ Province and all of Noto Province in the Hokuriku region. The Kaga Domain had an assessed kokudaka of over one million koku, making it by far the largest domain of the Tokugawa shogunate.Totman, Conrad. (1993). Early Modern Japan, p. 119. The Kaga Domain was dissolved in the abolition of the han system in 1871 by the Meiji government and its territory was absorbed into Ishikawa Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture. ==History== Map of Kaga Domain (green), Daish≈çji Domain (orange) and Toyama Domain (brown) in late Edo period. Maeda Toshiie was a distinguished military commander, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga and a close friend of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A member of the Council of Five Elders who ruled Japan during the Sengoku period, he was granted the Kaga Domain in 1583. His eldest son, Maeda Toshinaga, supported Tokugawa Ieyasu in his rise to power and was rewarded by an increase in his lands to 1.25 million koku. Toshinaga was succeeded by his brother Maeda Toshitsune, who created two cadet branches of the clan: *Toyama Domain (100,000 koku), headed by descendants of Toshitsune's second son Toshitsugu (1617‚Äì1674) *Daish≈çji Domain (100,000 koku), headed by descendants of Toshitsune's fourth son Toshiaki (1638‚Äì1692) A third cadet line was founded by Toshitsune's brother Maeda Toshitaka for his services during the Siege of Osaka. This branch held the Nanokaichi Domain, rated at the minimum of 10,000 koku. The Maeda clan ruled the Kaga Domain for the entirety of its existence until the abolition of the domains in 1871 afer the Meiji Restoration and the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

The aircraft was essentially a stretched version of the Yakovlev Yak-30 (1948), with a more powerful engine and greater wing sweep. The Yak-50 is perhaps most significant as the first Yakovlev aircraft equipped with velosipednoye (bicycle) landing gear, a trademark of later Yakovlev designs. The Yak-50 designation was later reused for a propeller-driven aerobatic and trainer aircraft.Gunston, 1997 ==Development and design== On February 21, 1949 a Sovmin order requested the Yakovlev OKB to design a lightweight, radar-equipped, all-weather and night interceptor capable of Mach 0.97 at 4,000 m (13,000 ft). The aircraft was to utilize the Klimov VK-1 engine which first appeared on Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters. This engine was itself a Soviet copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal turbojet initially known as the RD-45. The leading fighter OKBs each created a prototype to meet the requirement, which included the Lavochkin La-200, Mig I-320, Suchoi Su-15 (unrelated to the later aircraft with the same designation) and the Yak-50 (again, unrelated to the later aircraft). A major difference was that while Yakolev used one engine, the other design bureaus used two.Gunston, 1997 == Testing == The aircraft first flew on 15 July 1949,Gunston, 1997 with test pilot Anokhin achieving supersonic speed (Mach 1.03 at 10,000 m (33,000 ft)) in a shallow dive during one of the test flights. Ultimately, none of the newly developed aircraft was selected, and an upgraded MiG-17 was eventually employed. Yakolev later used the velosipednoye landing gear in the Yak-140 fighter and the Yak-120, and later in the Yak-25 and Yak-28 where it proved highly successful.Gunston, 1997 The Yak-50 never received an ASCC name or USAF reporting number.Gunston, 1997 == Operators == ; * Soviet Air Force == Specifications See alsoReferences== * Gunston, Bill.

The control surfaces are fabric-covered to save weight. The aircraft is not equipped with flaps. The supercharged engine may be the Vedeneyev M14P (standard production line version), M14PF or M14R, producing between 360 and 450 hp and driving the propeller via a reduction gearbox. The landing gear, brakes and engine starter are operated by compressed air. Replenished by an engine-driven compressor, the main and emergency air bottles are contained within the forward fuselage between the firewall and fuel tanks. The Yak-50 has exceptionally fine handling characteristics enhanced by a relatively high power-to-weight ratio. It has a tough and agile airframe - the type was twice World Aerobatic Champion. It has been used as a military trainer by several countries. Aircraft serving with the Soviet National Aerobatic team were typically scrapped after about 50 flight hours, due to the intense stresses imposed on the airframe during unlimited aerobatics. There were numerous cases of main spar failure; among its victims were the 1976 World Aerobatic Champion Viktor Letsko and many others. Two modifications (Service Bulletin 61DA for S/N 0102-2007 and Service Bulletin 79 for S/N 1201-2806) were made to strengthen the wings spars for the extreme loads experienced during unlimited aerobatics, and no further failures occurred. Other aircraft serving with DOSAAF were \\"officially\\" scrapped or placed into storage after they were superseded by the Yak-55 and Su-26. It is these aircraft that form the bulk of airworthy \\"survivors\\" today.

He was raised in Westwood, Kansas and is a 1963 graduate of Shawnee Mission North High School, where he was a finalist in the National Merit Scholarship Program. He is managing partner of Hendricks Sports Management, L.P., and managing member of Hendricks Interests LLC, both in Houston, Texas. ==Education== * Bachelor of Science degree in pre law/finance, with honors, University of Houston, 1968 * Doctor of Jurisprudence, with honors, University of Houston Law Center, 1970 * Chancellor, Order of the Barons, University of Houston Law Center, 1969, Articles Editor, Houston Law Review, 1969-70. ==Career== He practiced law with the Houston firm of Baker Botts out of law school. While there, he represented his first professional athlete. In 1972, he joined with his brother, Alan, to form Hendricks Sports Management. Hendricks was involved in the movement for free agency, a change for professional athletes from the reserve system. Hendricks concentrated on this area until the players earned their free agency in the late 1970s. He continuously represented a significant number of professional athletes for over 40 years. The Hendricks brothers formed Hendricks Sports Management and built an agency which represented approximately 10% of all major league baseball players for nearly 20 years. In 1999, the Hendricks sold their company to SFX Entertainment [2], (now Live Nation), where Randy became Chairman and CEO of the baseball group. Following the conclusion of their management contracts in 2004, the brothers reformed Hendricks Sports Management, which reestablished their profile as leaders in their industry [3]. Hendricks is the author of Inside the Strike Zone, published in 1994 and nominated for the Casey Award for best baseball book for that year. Hendricks has negotiated many record contracts, including several for Roger Clemens [4] and his $28 million one-year contract for Roger Clemens is the highest in the history of baseball. He negotiated a record $37.25 million contract for 21 year old Cuban defector Aroldis Chapman. Less well known has been Hendricks' career for over 40 years in managing a real estate portfolio of raw land and residential developments in the greater Houston area[5]. In May 2014 he sold a significant tract of land for the expansion of The Woodlands, Texas[6][7], the most successful \\"new town\\" master-planned community in the United States. That land is now known as The Woodlands Hills development. ==Recognition== Hendricks has been named the top agent by Baseball America [8], and among the 100 most powerful people in sports by The Sporting News [9]. Forbes Magazine recognized him as one of the most effective agents for his clients [10]. He has frequently been recognized as one of the best in his profession for over 30 years [11]. Hendricks has been recognized for both his preparation and advocacy in arbitration and collusion cases, and holds one of the best lifetime records in those cases [12]. Hendricks was appointed as a member of the Houston/Harris County Public Sports Advisory Committee in 1995 by Houston Mayor Bob Lanier. Hendricks wrote the election day editorial for the Houston Chronicle in favor of the referendum for new sports stadia in Houston and Harris County, Texas[13]. The measure passed in a close vote, and led to the construction of new sports facilities for professional teams, including Minute Maid Park for the Houston Astros, NRG Stadium for the Houston Texans and Toyota Center for the Houston Rockets. ==See also== *Sports agent: for listing of prominent sports agents, by field. ==References== *1.

Named after counties in Kentucky and Tennessee, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-825 on 2 October 1944 by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company, Evansville, Indiana; launched 11 November; sponsored by Mrs. John Spindler; commissioned at New Orleans on 8 December with Lieutenant Henry V. Hartsell in command. ==Service history== World War II, 1944‚Äì1946 After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, USS LST-825 loaded oil and cargo at New Orleans and sailed for the West Coast. She arrived at San Diego on 30 January 1945, discharged her cargo and continued on to Seattle, arriving on 4 February. Loading oil, ammunition and embarking troops, LST-825 sailed for the Pacific on 26 February 1945. The momentous Pacific campaign was in full swing at Okinawa when LST-825 reached that rocky Japanese fortress via Pearl Harbor, Guam, Eniwetok, and Ulithi on 21 April to discharge troop reinforcements and cargo. LST-825 retired to Saipan, where she loaded cargo and supplies for the famed Seabees and returned to Okinawa on 26 June. A late July convoy took the LST to Iwo Jima with cargo and supplies; and she returned to Okinawa on 4 September. Hostilities having ended on 15 August, LST-825 embarked troops and equipment of the Fifth Air Force destined to participate in the occupation of Japan. Entering Tokyo Bay on 25 September, she disembarked the occupation forces and their equipment and set course for Okinawa. During November 1945 LST-825 completed a second Okinawa-Japan trip. On the 16th the landing ship embarked 514 enlisted men at Guam and sailed for the United States via Pearl Harbor as part of the Operation Magic Carpet fleet bringing home veterans, arriving San Francisco on 22 December. After a few months of tactical operations along the West Coast, LST-825 decommissioned at Swan Island, Portland, Oregon and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 22 May 1946. Korean War, 1950‚Äì1954 With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, LST-825 recommissioned on 3 November 1950 with Lieutenant Thomas R. Ashton in command. After training out of San Diego, LST-825 entered Pearl Harbor on 8 April 1951 where she transported passengers and cargo among the Hawaiian Islands until returning stateside on 1 July. On 17 September she returned to Hawaii and operated there until her return on 16 December to San Diego. Departing San Diego on 26 April 1952, the LST arrived at Yokosuka on 11 June via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island. She made several cruises to the Korean coast to participate in tactical amphibious exercises and maneuvers of U.S. and Republic of Korean troops. LST-825 also carried prisoners-of-war from Korea to Japan. She returned to San Diego on 5 March 1953 for scheduled amphibious landing exercises and fleet tactics along the western seaboard. Her second Western Pacific cruise began on her departure from California on 20 January 1954. Spring and early summer were spent in operations along the Japanese and Korean coast as well as cargo duty between Eniwetok and Bikini Atoll.NOTE above statements not exact! The 825 left San Diego on the way to the far east in the fall of 1951, laying over I Hawaii and leaving Pearl Harbor Dec, 7, 1951 on its way to Japan via Midway Isle. Prisoners were transported to a prison camp in the southern part of Korea, not Japan. At least, that's a fact for the year 1952. Operation Passage to Freedom, 1954‚Äì1955 On 11 August 1954 LST-825 departed Yokosuka for French Indochina, where she assisted in \\"Operation Passage to Freedom.\\" When the French withdrew from Indochina, after their defeat in the First Indochina War, and the subsequent partition of Vietnam, over 800,000 North Vietnamese chose to forsake their homes and move to the southern half of the country. Nearly 100 ships of the U.S. Navy under Rear Admiral Lorenzo S. Sabin helped transport the refugees in a mass exodus. In all, the U.S. Navy evacuated 310,848 North Vietnamese as well as 68,757 tons of cargo and over 8,000 vehicles. Hard-pressed and cramped sailors were rewarded when many of the 184 children born on the \\"Passage to Freedom\\" were named after U.S. ships and officers. Part of this task force from 26 August to 5 October 1954, LST-825 made five trips from the Northern capital, Haiphong, to southern ports with Vietnamese refugees and French troops and equipment. In recognition of her efforts the ship was awarded the Vietnamese Presidential Unit Citation. LST-825 returned to San Diego on 27 November 1954 and operated out of there until decommissioned on 20 September 1955, having been renamed USS Hickman County (LST-825) on 1 July. Dominican Republic, 1963‚Äì1965 Hickman County recommissioned in service at San Diego on 22 March 1963 with Lieutenant Edward F. Powers in command. Assigned to LST Reserve Squadron 2, she reported to the U.S. Naval Amphibious Base at Little Creek, Virginia on 19 June 1963. For the next two years she underwent various phases of training in amphibious warfare. In May 1965 the Dominican Republic crisis erupted and Hickman County sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 8 May laden with supplies for the logistical support of the U.S. Armed Forces keeping the peace in that country. Hickman County remained in the Caribbean area as a standby ship supplying the United States contingent in the Dominican Republic until 15 July when it called at Puerto de Haina, Dominican Republic to embark Army troops and sailed for Sunny Point, North Carolina, debarking them on 22 July 1965. From 26 August until 9 December, the busy ship transferred military personnel and cargo between the United States and the Dominican Republic and acted as host to foreign ships at San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 10 December she arrived at Little Creek, departing for Brooklyn, New York four days later for overhaul. Vietnam, 1966‚Äì1969 On 23 February 1966 the ship transited the Panama Canal, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 19 March and departed KƒÅne'ohe Bay, Oahu on 4 April 1966 for the Western Pacific.

While admired for their exactitude (unprecedented in Romanian art),DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.139 these works have drawn criticism for their impersonality. Among his most distinctive works is a mountainous landscape of the Olt at the meanders of Cozia (known locally as C√¢rlige, \\"Hooks\\"), which was attributed by some to his nostalgia for the Alpine landscape. A similar feeling motivation was deduced from his earlier paintings, the Romantic picturesque landscapes showing the Southern Carpathian areas of Transylvania. Trenk was also active in research towards improving the paint used in fine arts, publishing in several chemistry journals. His aim was to find a paint which would be durable, but also matte, avoiding distracting reflections on the painting's surface. His successful invention of such a paint was announced in a February 1869 note by Carol Szathmari, court painter of Domnitor Carol I of Romania.Zeitschrift f√ºr bildende Kunst, Volume 4, Ed. E.A.

When Zuhayr was called back from fighting to pray, Imam Hussain asked him and a few other men to hold a shield and protect the women and men who are praying.

The city's location made it a natural crossroads, as it lay between Cydonia on the northwest coast and Knossos, and between the shore, where it controlled its ports, Stavromenos and Panormos, and the great sanctuary cave near the peak of Ida, Idaion Andron. The Dorian city evolved in the Archaic Period in a similar vein as did Lato and Dreros, its contemporaneous Dorian counterparts.C.Michael Hogan, \\"Lato Fieldnotes\\", The Modern Antiquarian, Jan 10, 2008 In 220 BC the city of Eleutherna triggered the outbreak of the Lyttian War by accusing the Rhodians of the assassination of their leader Timarchus. The Eleuthernans eventually declared war on Rhodes. During the following conflict Eleutherna was at first allied with Cnossus and Gortys, but later they were compelled to change sides by the Polyrrhenians and joined the opposite coalition led by the Macedonian king Philip V. With the Roman conquest of Crete in 68/67 BCE, luxurious villas, baths, and other public buildings demonstrate that Eleutherna was a prosperous centre through the Imperial period, until the catastrophic earthquake of 365 CE. Eleutherna was the seat of a Christian bishop: bishop Euphratas constructed a large basilica in the mid-seventh century. The attacks of caliph Harun Al-Rashid in the later eighth century, together with another earthquake in 796, and the subsequent Arab rule in Crete, led to the final abandonment of the site. Following the occupation of the island by the Republic of Venice, a Catholic diocese was established, still a Roman Catholic titular bishopric today.Eleutherna (Titular See) Public exhibitions in 1993 and 1994, and especially the comprehensive exhibition of 2004 at the Museum of Cycladic Art, Athens, have introduced the archaeological site to the general public.Ekathimerini, \\"The treasures of ancient Eleutherna on display\\" ; \\"Cretan excavation sheds light on Dark Ages of Greek history\\" On the last occasion the Louvre lent the seventh-century BCE \\"Lady of Auxerre\\", now given a definitive Cretan context with comparable finds at Eleutherna. == See also == * Museum of Ancient Eleutherna * Eleutherna Bridge * List of ancient Greek cities == Notes Bibliography== * Nicholas Chr.

It was written by Len Wein. The first issue was penciled by John Byrne and inked by Jim Aparo. The second and third issues were drawn entirely by Aparo. Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez drew the covers for the entire series. The primary plot elements of the story are retellings of the origins of several Batman characters. It is the second miniseries published by DC Comics as well as the first starring Batman. In 1989, as a marketing tool, each issue of the series was available in a special \\"MPI Audio Edition\\", accompanied by an audio cassette containing a performance of the text of the issue, with musical cues. That same year, the series was reprinted in smaller format as a premium for Batman breakfast cereal. ==Plot synopsis== Issue #1: In The Beginning Batman opens a package to find the shredded remains of a bat costume once worn by his father. He investigates to find the costume missing from its display case in the Batcave, with a threatening note left in its place: THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING, BATMAN! BEFORE I'M DONE, I WILL DESTROY YOU! Batman reminisces about the time when his father, Dr. Thomas Wayne, wore the costume to a charity costume party and was taken hostage by a group of thugs looking for a doctor. He was taken to see their boss, bank robber Lew Moxon, who had been shot and needed the doctor to remove the bullet. Instead, Dr. Wayne attacked the thugs and defeated them. He turned them over to the police, including then-Lieutenant James W. Gordon. Wayne testified against Moxon, who was convicted. Years later, he was released and threatened to have his revenge against Wayne. Several weeks later, Dr. Wayne and his wife Martha were shot dead in front of their son Bruce (Batman) by an apparent mugger named Joe Chill. Batman recalls those who looked after him following his parents' deaths - Leslie Thompkins and Mrs. Chilton, housekeeper of Bruce's uncle, Philip Wayne (who had been appointed Bruce's guardian, but was seldom at home as his work required him to travel a lot). Unbeknownst to him, but known to his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, Mrs. Chilton was Joe Chill's mother. Young Bruce dedicated his life to bringing his parents' killer to justice and waging war against all criminals. He studied and trained hard, and followed the career of a police detective named Harvey Harris. Bruce created a costume (that of the original Robin) to hide his identity and set out to meet Harris. Bruce happened upon a criminal waiting to attack Harris, and managed to thwart the would-be attacker. To repay him, Harris taught Bruce everything about the art of detecting, and gave him the name \\"Robin\\". Bruce continued training and went on to college to study criminology. A lesson learned in a law class - that the law and justice are not one and the same - dissuaded Bruce from becoming a police officer as he had intended, feeling that he would be too hampered by the law. While trying to decide what kind of symbol to become in order to strike terror into the hearts of criminals, a bat flew through his window of his study, inspiring him to become Batman. After years of crimefighting and failure to locate his parents' killer, Batman happened upon a smuggling enterprise run through a trucking company owned by Joe Chill. He confronted Chill with his story, and revealed his secret identity to him. Batman let Chill run scared; he ran for help to his henchmen at his garage and told them what had happened. But after they learned he was responsible for creating Batman who had plagued them for years, the henchmen shot and killed Chill before he could reveal Batman's secret identity. Several months later, Bruce happened upon his father's costume and journal. He learned from the journal that Chill had not been a mugger, but was working for Lew Moxon. Moxon had been in a car accident and suffered from amnesia. He did not remember Thomas Wayne or what he had done. With his own costume torn during a fight with Moxon's henchmen, Batman decided to wear his father's costume instead when he confronted Moxon. The costume jogged Moxon's memory, and he ran in fear from Batman right into the path of an oncoming truck, which killed him. Issue #2: \\"With Friends Like These...\\" Batman goes to a bar to find someone who can give him information about the package. After he is attacked he almost beats his informant to death, until Robin arrives to bring him back to his senses. In trying to understand Batman's anger, Robin recalls his own origin. He recalls the night in Newtown where his parents, the Flying Graysons, performed their trapeze act for the final time, as the ropes snapped, sending them plummeting to the ground. Later that night, Dick Grayson (Robin) learned that the trapeze had been rigged by mobsters looking to extort protection money from the owner of the circus. Dick was prepared to go to the police when Batman approached him and told him of \\"Boss\\" Zucco, a mobster who controlled the whole town. Bruce Wayne took legal guardianship of Dick, and taught him the arts of crimefighting. He gave Grayson his old Robin costume, and the name to go with it. They set out on Zucco's trail, and found him throwing one of his henchmen off of a scaffolding. Robin took a photo that led to Zucco's arrest and apparent execution. After that, he became Batman's partner. He found it hard to deal with the taunts of his classmates, but eventually graduated and left Wayne Manor to attend Hudson University. That was when Bruce and Alfred moved to the penthouse atop the Wayne Foundation Building in Gotham City, and built a new Batcave in an abandoned subway tunnel beneath the building to go with it. Robin has returned to Gotham City now at the call of Alfred, who is worried about Batman. Alfred struggles to understand Batman's painful memories by recalling his own past. He remembers in the closing days of World War II when he helped refugees escape the Nazis, and regrets needing to kill enemy soldiers. After the war, he turned to the London theater as an actor. But as his father lay dying, he swore that he would carry on the family tradition of being a butler. Alfred got on a boat to America and sought out Bruce Wayne, whose father, Thomas Wayne, had employed his own father. Alfred tended to Bruce and Dick, unaware of their alter egos, until one night when they returned from crimefighting, and Bruce had been injured. Dick needed Alfred's help to attend to him. From that point on, Alfred was entrusted with the duo's secrets. Meanwhile, sorting through headshots of his rogues gallery, Batman points out that many of his enemies hate him enough to do this to him. He recalls the Joker's origin as an example. In their first meeting, at the Monarch Playing Card Company, the Joker was a masked criminal known as the Red Hood. To escape Batman, he dove into a basin of chemical waste and swam through a drainage pipe out to the river. The special oxygen system in his helmet helped him survive, but the chemicals disfigured him and transformed him into the Joker. Another villain, Two-Face, was once Harvey Dent, Gotham's youngest District Attorney. During the trial of \\"Boss\\" Maroni, who was being charged with the murder of \\"Bookie\\" Benson, Batman was testifying. While Dent presented Maroni's lucky piece, a two-headed silver dollar, as evidence, Maroni threw a container of acid at him. Batman dove to block the container, but only deflected it enough for it to hit the left side of Dent's face, disfiguring him and turning him into Two- Face. Robin suggests that they go see Commissioner Gordon for help, but as he starts the Batmobile, an alarm sounds, indicating that the ignition has been tampered with. Everyone dives safely for cover as a bomb goes off, destroying the car. Another threatening note is discovered in the wreckage: ONE BY ONE, I WILL DESTROY THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU WHAT YOU ARE‚ÄîAND THEN I WILL DESTROY YOU! Issue #3: The Man Behind The Mask! Batman goes off on his own to take vengeance on the person behind what is going on. Meanwhile, Robin calls Jack Edison, a stunt driver who has built the latest Batmobile for the Dynamic Duo, and commissions him to build another one at his usual fee with a bonus for the inconvenience. He gladly does so because Batman once saved his life by pulling him from a flaming car wreck. Batman searches the city, asking every informant he has about the case, but with no luck. He finally goes to see Commissioner Gordon at Gotham City Police H.Q. The Commissioner suggests that Batman does not want to find any clues because the suspect is someone close to him. Batman suddenly leaves Gordon to reminisce about the first time he met Batman; how Batman initially only left scrawled notes on the criminals he tied up and left for the police, until one day he caught a man about to attack Gordon with a knife. Batman quickly left, but later that night, he came to Gordon's office. Gordon pulled a gun and prepared to shoot him, but Batman explained that they were two of a kind, and that he was able to bend the law that Gordon could not in order to achieve justice. Gordon grudgingly accepted Batman. Gordon recalled how Batman had influenced his daughter, Barbara. She fell madly in love with him at first sight and she began studying martial arts alongside her library science Ph.D. She wore a Batgirl costume one night to a policeman's masquerade ball, but on the way to the ball, she noticed Bruce Wayne being kidnapped by a gang of Killer Moth's henchmen. She promptly attacked the men and freed Bruce, helping to bring Killer Moth to justice and starting her career as Batgirl. The next morning, Bruce cancels all his appointments. His friend and associate, Lucius Fox, tries to talk to Bruce, but Bruce does not want to talk. Lucius reminds him of their first meeting, back when he was in the Wayne Foundation's finance division, and brought a portfolio suggestion to Bruce, who liked the idea and started Lucius on the path that made his entire career. Bruce continues to try to figure out who is behind the attacks, until he comes to a realization. He hurries back to Wayne Manor as Batman. He sees visions of himself and his parents when he was a child. He enters the Batcave at Wayne Manor and realizes that the person behind everything is himself: a vision of Bruce Wayne reveals to Batman that he has attempted to destroy Batman because of how it has ruined his life as Wayne. As the walls of the Batcave begin to close in on him, he sees his father in the original bat costume. He explains that a warehouse explosion Batman had recently been caught in has temporarily affected his mind. His father begs Batman to leave the Batcave while he holds the walls apart, but Batman will not let him die again. Batman dives, carrying both himself and his father out of harm's way. Once they are safe, Bruce's father removes his mask to reveal that he is, in fact, Robin. Batman reveals that he knew all along, but that the important part is that he has come to his senses. Batman says that he needs to be alone, and heads for a rooftop to look over Gotham City. ==Features of the \\"Audio Edition\\" comic books== :This section describes the Audio Edition books, and does not represent the original issues In June 1989, the series was reprinted and packaged with an audio cassette tape that included the story. The issues were smaller than standard DC comic books, at nine inches tall and six inches wide.

Versions of this algorithm have been proposed by , , , , and ; of these, Dijkstra's version was the first to achieve linear time.History of Path-based DFS for Strong Components, Harold N. Gabow, accessed 2012-04-24. ==Description== The algorithm performs a depth- first search of the given graph G, maintaining as it does two stacks S and P (in addition to the normal call stack for a recursive function). Stack S contains all the vertices that have not yet been assigned to a strongly connected component, in the order in which the depth-first search reaches the vertices. Stack P contains vertices that have not yet been determined to belong to different strongly connected components from each other. It also uses a counter C of the number of vertices reached so far, which it uses to compute the preorder numbers of the vertices. When the depth-first search reaches a vertex v, the algorithm performs the following steps: #Set the preorder number of v to C, and increment C. #Push v onto S and also onto P. #For each edge from v to a neighboring vertex w: #* If the preorder number of w has not yet been assigned, recursively search w; #*Otherwise, if w has not yet been assigned to a strongly connected component: #**Repeatedly pop vertices from P until the top element of P has a preorder number less than or equal to the preorder number of w. #If v is the top element of P: #*Pop vertices from S until v has been popped, and assign the popped vertices to a new component. #*Pop v from P. The overall algorithm consists of a loop through the vertices of the graph, calling this recursive search on each vertex that does not yet have a preorder number assigned to it. ==Related algorithms== Like this algorithm, Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm also uses depth first search together with a stack to keep track of vertices that have not yet been assigned to a component, and moves these vertices into a new component when it finishes expanding the final vertex of its component. However, in place of the stack P, Tarjan's algorithm uses a vertex-indexed array of preorder numbers, assigned in the order that vertices are first visited in the depth-first search. The preorder array is used to keep track of when to form a new component. ==NotesReferences== *. *. *. *. *. *.

Baxter. ==Poetry== Dennison began performing poetry in Dunedin, New Zealand, during his time there in 2003‚Äì2007. He performed his distinct yet Baxteresque performance poetry at all of the local poetry performance venues: the Arc Caf√©, the Port Chalmers Hotel (The Tunnel), and the Dunedin Public Library. While preferring the orality of performance, a few poems were published in student magazine, The Critic. His poems frequently interlace the gravity of biblical imagery with the banalities of modern existence, forcing their confrontation and overcoming any simple binary interpretations. This is evident in his poems, Retail Therapy and Fool's Repair. ==Poetry criticism== In \\"Ko te Pakeha te teina: Baxter's cross-cultural poetry\\", Dennison explores \\"the potential of Baxter's engagement to inform a radical understanding of Pakeha identity\\"‚Äîthe theme of Dennison's Master of Arts dissertation at the University of Victoria, Wellington, New Zealand. Dennison seeks to overcome the interpretation of Baxter's engagement with te ao MƒÅori in terms of a simplistic dichotomy between MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ; spiritual and rational; pre- modern and modern. In Baxter's later poetry, Dennison finds that Baxter's use of te ao MƒÅori is not for the purposes of setting up an opposition to PƒÅkehƒÅ culture, nor is it a simple model for PƒÅkehƒÅ culture to emulate, but it functions to inspire a rethinking of what it is to be PƒÅkehƒÅ. Instead of being defined by opposition or assimilation, Dennison's thesis is that Baxter was suggesting a reconfiguration of PƒÅkehƒÅ identity, one shaped by the tuakana- teina (elder brother-younger brother) familial relationship. ==Doctoral research== In April 2007, Dennison was awarded the highest value scholarship from the New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission. The scholarships awarded by the New Zealand Government were embroiled in controversy, when Opposition MPs criticised the award of $96,000 for the study of bogans. Dennison's scholarship was awarded to fund his doctoral research at St Andrews University, Scotland, looking at the ways in which Heaney's poetry addresses political conflict in Northern Ireland. Dennison's research is for the purpose of considering Seamus Heaney's poetry and its social implications. ==Publication of 'Otherwise'== In 2015, Dennison published his first volume of poetry, 'Otherwise'. It was published simultaneously by Carcanet in the United Kingdom and Auckland University Press in New Zealand.John Dennison, 'Otherwise'. Auckland: Auckland University Press, 2015. Noted New Zealand poet and critic, Vincent O'Sullivan, said of the poems that \\"they remind you, as good poetry does, that fashion and easy assumptions are drab stuff in the face of the real thing\\".Comments from dustjacket to 'Otherwise'. With help from Creative New Zealand, Dennison toured the United Kingdom in March 2015 to promote 'Otherwise', which included a joint poetry reading with former Archbishop Rowan Williams. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Retail Therapy * Fool‚Äôs Repair * \\"Ko te Pakeha te teina: Baxter's cross-cultural poetry\\", in The New Zealand Journal of Literature] * 'A Kind of Genius': Gregory O'Brien on John Dennison's Otherwise Category:21st-century New Zealand poets Category:New Zealand male poets Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:University of Victoria alumni Category:21st-century New Zealand male writers ","title":"John Dennison"},{"id":"12377448","text":"Dolce II dell'Anguillara (also spelled degli Anguillara) (1401 ‚Äì March 1449) was an Italian condottiero, a member of the Anguillara family of northern Lazio, brother of Everso II.

The number of Bulgarian-born people resident in the UK has risen from 5,351 at the time of the 2001 Census to an estimated 103,000 in 2018. Since 1 January 2014, Bulgarians have freedom of movement and work in the United Kingdom as citizens of the European Union. ==History== A true Bulgarian community in the United Kingdom was formed relatively recently as compared to Bulgarian communities in other countries in Western Europe. Few Bulgarian students enrolled at British universities before World War II; political and economic emigration was also scarce. It was only around 1944‚Äì1945 that a more apparent circle of Bulgarian political emigrants was formed in the United Kingdom. During the Cold War, when Bulgaria was a socialist state known as the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1944‚Äì1989), the Bulgarian community in the United Kingdom numbered some 3,000‚Äì4,000, mostly in England. Emigration to the United Kingdom was very active in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2000, the Bulgarian community numbered over 10,000 according to unofficial data. Other estimates from the early 21st century claim over 30,000 Bulgarians live permanently or temporarily (as students and workers) in the capital London alone. The 2001 UK Census recorded 5,351 people born in Bulgaria. When Bulgaria joined the European Union in January 2007, the British government placed transitional restrictions on the rights of Bulgarians to move to the UK, which were subsequently extended and these transitional restrictions expired on 1 January 2014. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 69,000 Bulgarian-born immigrants were resident in the UK in 2015.

Accessed June 18, 2008. ==Academic year and leadership== St. Benedict's school year differs from most high schools. The school year is divided into three \\"phases\\"; Summer phase, Fall/Winter phase and Spring phase. During Summer phase the whole student body of St. Benedict's gathers for a five-week session of half-day classes during August. For the members of the Freshman class, the session begins with the five-day overnight. The Freshman class is divided into 18 groups of about eight students each, with an older student acting as counselor for the week, preferably a sophomore or junior student. Meals are taken \\"family style\\" in the dining room as each student takes a turn being the waiter for his color group, setting the table, serving the food, and clearing up afterward. Freshmen meet faculty members and older students, discover Benedict's history and traditions and learn the school songs. At the end of the week the students will be verbally quizzed on the school's history by current faculty, leaders, and alumni. The amount of questions depends solely on who the person is, and passing will result in the students earning his colors (Garnet & Gray). During the fall/winter phase students have regular school days with classes beginning at 7:50 and daily convocation in the Shanley Gym at 7:50 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Wednesday is an early dismissal at 2:15pm. On Thursday school begins with convocation at 7:50 followed by Mass (Catholic church service) for one of the four sections of the school. The sections alternate turns going to Mass each week approximately attending Mass once a month. During convocation, prayers are said and songs are sung with the whole community present. At the end of convocation there is a brief time period in which the entire community takes part in sharing announcements with the rest of the school body. These announcements are about upcoming events, results from past events, meetings for leadership, opportunities for extra help, and things that the community is either doing well with or needs to improve on. Spring phase ends the academic year. Students choose projects to work on for four weeks such as community service, US history, Gardening, Dancing, Music Production, Photography, Journalism, Finance, Acting, Physics, Intense Exercising, karate, and cooking. Freshmen don't have a choice. At the end of the Freshmen Year, Freshmen spend a week together. They sleep in tents.

The segregation involves Northern Ireland's two main voting blocs ‚Äì Irish nationalist/republicans (mainly Roman Catholic) and unionist/loyalist (mainly Protestant). It is often seen as both a cause and effect of the \\"Troubles\\". A combination of political, religious and social differences plus the threat of intercommunal tensions and violence has led to widespread self-segregation of the two communities. Catholics and Protestants lead largely separate lives in a situation that some have dubbed \\"self-imposed apartheid\\".\\"Self-imposed Apartheid\\", by Mary O'Hara, published in The Guardian on Wednesday 14 April 2004. Accessed on Sunday, 22 July 2007. ==Education== Education in Northern Ireland is heavily segregated. Most state schools in Northern Ireland are predominantly Protestant, while the majority of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the Catholic Church. In 2006, 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland were in segregated schools,Lord Baker of Dorking, Daily Hansard, 18 July 2006 : Column 1189 www.parliament.uk, retrieved 22 July 2007 by 2017 that figure had risen to 93%. The consequence is, as one commentator has put it, that \\"the overwhelming majority of Ulster's children can go from four to 18 without having a serious conversation with a member of a rival creed.\\"\\"Stop this Drift into Educational Apartheid\\", by Nick Cohen. Published in The Guardian on Sunday 13 May 2007. Accessed on 22 July 2007. The prevalence of segregated education has been cited as a major factor in maintaining endogamy (marriage within one's own group).Michael P. Hornsby- Smith, Roman Catholics in England: Studies in Social Structure since the Second World War. Cambridge University Press, 1987. The integrated education movement has sought to reverse this trend by establishing non-denominational schools such as the Portadown Integrated Primary. Such schools are, however, still the exception to the general trend of segregated education. Integrated schools in Northern Ireland have been established through the voluntary efforts of parents. The churches have not been involved in the development of integrated education.\\"Churches and Christian Ethos in Integrated Schools\\", Macaulay,T 2009 However, both the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, along with state-run institutions, have supported and organized cross-community school projects such as joint field trips, educational classes and forums wherein pupils can come together to share their beliefs, values and cultures.http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/crosscommunity- school-project- launched-28688767.htmlhttp://www.ark.ac.uk/publications/updates/update55.pdf The academic John H. Whyte argued that \\"the two factors which do most to divide Protestants as a whole from Catholics as a whole are endogamy and separate education\\".John Whyte (1990) Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 48 ==Employment== Historically, employment in the Northern Irish economy was highly segregated in favour of Protestants, particularly at senior levels of the public sector, in certain then important sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering, and strategically important areas such as the police.\\"Northern Ireland,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 Emigration to seek employment was therefore significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s. A 1987 survey found that 80 per cent of the work forces surveyed were described by respondents as consisting of a majority of one denomination; 20 per cent were overwhelmingly uni-denominational, with 95‚Äì100 per cent Catholic or Protestant employees. However, large organisations were much less likely to be segregated, and the level of segregation has decreased over the years.Claire Mitchell, Religion, Identity And Politics in Northern Ireland: Boundaries of Belonging and Belief, p. 63. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2006. The British government has introduced numerous laws and regulations since the mid-1990s to prohibit discrimination on religious grounds, with the Fair Employment Commission (originally the Fair Employment Agency) exercising statutory powers to investigate allegations of discriminatory practices in Northern Ireland business and organisations. This has had a significant impact on the level of segregation in the workplace; John Whyte concludes that the result is that \\"segregation at work is one of the least acute forms of segregation in Northern Ireland.\\" John Whyte, Interpreting Northern Ireland, p. 37. Clarendon Press, 1990. ==Housing== Gates in a peace line in West Belfast. Back of a house behind a \\"peace line\\", on Bombay Street Belfast Public housing is overwhelmingly segregated between the two communities. Inter-communal tensions have forced substantial numbers of people to move from mixed areas into areas inhabited exclusively by one denomination, thus increasing the degree of polarisation and segregation. The extent of self-segregation grew very rapidly with the outbreak of the Troubles. In 1969, 69 per cent of Protestants and 56 per cent of Catholics lived in streets where they were in their own majority; as the result of large-scale flight from mixed areas between 1969 and 1971 following outbreaks of violence, the respective proportions had by 1972 increased to 99 per cent of Protestants and 75 per cent of Catholics.Frank Wright, Northern Ireland: A Comparative Analysis, p. 205. Rowman & Littlefield, 1988. In Belfast, the 1970s were a time of rising residential segregation.Paul Doherty and Michael A. Poole (1997) Ethnic residential segregation in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1971‚Äì1991, Geographical Review 87(4), pp. 520‚Äì536 It was estimated in 2004 that 92.5% of public housing in Northern Ireland was divided along religious lines, with the figure rising to 98% in Belfast. Self-segregation is a continuing process, despite the Northern Ireland peace process. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 1,400 people a year were being forced to move as a consequence of intimidation.Neil Jarman, Institute for Conflict Research, March 2005 http://www.serve.com/pfc/misc/violence.pdf In response to inter- communal violence, the British Army constructed a number of high walls called \\"peace lines\\" to separate rival neighbourhoods. These have multiplied over the years and now number forty separate barriers, mostly located in Belfast. Despite the moves towards peace between Northern Ireland's political parties and most of its paramilitary groups, the construction of \\"peace lines\\" has actually increased during the ongoing peace process; the number of \\"peace lines\\" doubled in the ten years between 1995 and 2005.New Statesman, 28 November 2005, newstatesman.com retrieved 22 July 2007 In 2008 a process was proposed for the removal of the peace walls.\\"A Process for Removing Interface Barriers\\", Tony Macaulay, July 2008 The effective segregation of the two communities significantly affects the usage of local services in \\"interface areas\\" where sectarian neighbourhoods adjoin. Surveys in 2005 of 9,000 residents of interface areas found that 75% refused to use the closest facilities because of location, while 82% routinely travelled to \\"safer\\" areas to access facilities even if the journey time was longer. 60% refused to shop in areas dominated by the other community, with many fearing ostracism by their own community if they violated an unofficial de facto boycott of their sectarian opposite numbers. ==Intermarriage== In contrast with both the Republic of Ireland and most parts of Great Britain, where intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics is not unusual, in Northern Ireland it has been uncommon: from 1970 through to the 1990s, only 5 per cent of marriages were recorded as crossing community divides.Edward Moxon-Browne, 1991, \\"National Identity in Northern Ireland\\", in Peter Stringer and Gillian Robinson (eds.), 1991, Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland: The First Report, Blackstaff Press: Belfast This figure remained largely constant throughout the Troubles. It rose to between 8 and 12 per cent, according to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, in 2003, 2004 and 2005.ARK, If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2003ARK, If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2004ARK, If married or living as married...Is your husband/wife/partner the same religion as you? 2005 Attitudes towards Catholic‚ÄìProtestant intermarriage have become more supportive in recent years (particularly among the middle class) and younger people are also more likely to be married to someone of a different religion to themselves than older people. However, the data hides considerable regional variation across Northern Ireland.Valerie Morgan, Marie Smyth, Gillian Robinson and Grace Fraser (1996), Mixed Marriages in Northern Ireland, Coleraine: University of Ulster ==Anti-discrimination legislation== In the 1970s, the British government took action to legislate against religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The Fair Employment Act 1976 prohibited discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of religion and established a Fair Employment Agency. This Act was strengthened with a new Fair Employment Act in 1989, which introduced a duty on employers to monitor the religious composition of their workforce, and created the Fair Employment Commission to replace the Fair Employment Agency. The law was extended to cover the provision of goods, facilities and services in 1998 under the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.Equality Commission, http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=2&cms;=Your+Rights_Fair+employment+%26+treatment&cmsid;=2_56&id;=56 In 1999, the Commission was merged with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Northern Ireland Disability Council to become part of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.Equality Commission, Anti-discrimination law in N Ireland ‚Äì a brief chronology An Equality Commission review in 2004 of the operation of the anti-discrimination legislation since the 1970s, found that there had been a substantial improvement in the employment profile of Catholics, most marked in the public sector but not confined to it. It said that Catholics were now well represented in managerial, professional and senior administrative posts, although there were some areas of under-representation such as local government and security but that the overall picture was a positive one. Catholics, however, were still more likely than Protestants to be unemployed and there were emerging areas of Protestant under-representation in the public sector, most notably in health and education at many levels including professional and managerial. The report also found that there had been a considerable increase in the numbers of people who work in integrated workplaces.Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (2004), Fair Employment in Northern Ireland: a generation on.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building. The main structure, a substantial three-storey rectangular pele tower with rounded turrets and battlements, was constructed about 1370, and was the home of the Middleton family. In 1614 Thomas Middleton built a new manor house attached to the tower. A west wing was added in 1711 but was later largely demolished in 1872 by Sir Arthur Middleton when the remainder of the house was considerably altered. The castle was abandoned as a residence by the family in the early 19th century when Sir Charles Monck built Belsay Hall close by. The interiors were largely removed and it was then used as a ready- made folly, as was fashionable among the aristocracy at the time, serving as setting for garden parties and other entertainments.

It lies north of Longbridge Road, and is near the boundary with Loxford. The park was the first council- controlled park in the Borough, and was established as a classic Victorian park in 1896. It was officially opened on 9 April 1898 by Councillor C. L. Beard JP, Chairman of Barking Town Urban District Council.Commemorative plaque by the main gates in Longbridge Road. The park's most significant feature is a 910 metre long boating lake on the north side of the park. Rowing boats were introduced first, and then on 1 April 1953, motor boats and a Mississippi style paddle steamer called Phoenix II made their debut. The paddle steamer continued to operate on the lake until 1967. Other facilities include tennis and basketball courts, two bowling greens (indoor and outdoor), a children's playground, a waterpark, football pitches and a flower garden. A lido was built in 1931 but this was closed permanently in 1988.The Borough's parks and open spaces , Local studies info sheet #6, Barking and Dagenham Council. Retrieved 1 January 2013. The longstanding park cafe was demolished and a roller-skating park built on the site. The park contains a war memorial, renovated in 2000, for men of the Barking Town Urban District who fell in World War I and World War II. Every year on Remembrance Day (usually the 2nd Sunday in November) a commemorative ceremony is held at the war memorial preceded by music from a local marching band. In 2006 the council received \\"stage one\\" funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to develop a proposal for restoration and improvement of the park.

It originally consisted of three coaches hauled by a steam locomotive named \\"The Empress\\", running over a length of gauge track, from the main park entrance at Longbridge Road to a turntable at the boating lake. After being replaced by a sit-in diesel locomotive named \\"Little Nan\\", The Empress was eventually restored and re-gauged to and is now running at the Eastleigh Lakeside Steam Railway. About halfway along the line, trains went through a gated level crossing. When trains were not running, the level crossing afforded access to the park from the adjacent Park Avenue, but this side entrance has now been permanently closed. The railway ran until 2005 when it was closed by the owner, who felt that it was no longer cost effective to maintain and repair the train; however, the railway has since been redeveloped by a father & son team who bought the line from the previous owner. It now features new trains, and new gauge track, with wheelchair-friendly station access. The new train service ran a few times during 2008 but the official grand re-opening took place at Easter in 2009.

It was produced in 1977 and released in 1978 by EMI Italy, through its Harvest label. All the sounds in this album were generated by the MCS70, a monophonic analog synthesizer designed, built and programmed by the Italian engineer Mario Maggi. Automat was Musumarra's initiative ‚Äì after learning about the new instrument, he proposed to EMI Italy that he produce an album of electronic instrumental music. Although at the time such a project was considered risky, the answer was positive. EMI suggested, however, that Claudio Gizzi, a more experienced composer that already worked with them, also participate in the project. The composition work was divided: Gizzi contributed to side A, who filled it with a long suite with 3 movements, and Musumarra contributed to side B, who composed three shorter pieces. They had very little time to complete the project with only four weeks in the studio. As a result, the last track, Mecadence, was left somewhat incomplete. The sound engineer in charge of the project was Luciano Torani. == Tracks == Side A (by Claudio Gizzi): * 01 ‚Äì Automat : (The) Rise (6:07) : (The) Advance (4:06) : (The) Genus (6:31) Side B (by Romano Musumarra): * 02 ‚Äì Droid (5:30) * 03 ‚Äì Ultraviolet (6:44) * 04 ‚Äì Mecadence (4:00) ==Production== Automat was the result of an unrepeatable sequence of events. The final result did not please either Musumarra and Gizzi nor the producers. They never collaborated on any other project nor had the opportunity to use the MCS70 again. Automat has only been released on CD once. Despite this (or perhaps because of it) the album achieved a \\"cult\\" status among many fans of electronic music. Musumarra and Gizzi subsequently had successful careers as movie soundtrack composers. Musumarra also had many partnerships as a songwriter and/or producer with famous pop artists, among them the Canadian singer C√©line Dion. His remarkable style of electronic arranging and composition can be heard, for instance, in the track \\"Je Danse Dans Ma T√™te\\", from the C√©line's 1991 album Dion chante Plamondon.  Equipment  Besides the MCS70 they also used: Sequential Circuits 3 row by 16 steps analog sequencer synced to a 16 track recorder for overdubs, EMT digital reverberation unit, Horban parametric equalizer (x2), 30 band graphic equalizer, natural echo chamber for reverberation, a 2 track recorder for delay effects. The condition imposed by Mario Maggi to participate on the project was that the MCS70 were the only synthesizer used in it. All the sounds had to be obtained from it, even the drum sounds. The MCS70 would be presented in the 1978 Frankfurt Musikmesse and, for Maggi, the album would be a demonstration of the capabilities of his new synth. MCS means \\"Memory Controlled Synthesizer\\". It was common for synths at the time to need the manual adjustment of every control in the panel to get a desired sound, a task that often took a considerable amount of time. In the MCS70 a sound, once programmed, could be stored in memory and quickly recovered later. Mario Maggi filled the 64 available memory positions with sounds created by him and these were the sounds used in the album. Only one MCS70 was ever built. Before going into production, polyphonic synthesizers like the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 arrived at the market and, all of a sudden, monophonic synths were considered obsolete. Mario Maggi then dropped the MCS70 project and started what would be his most famous synthesizer project ever: the polyphonic Elka Synthex. In many regards, though, the MCS70 was superior. The MCS70 was bought by Patrizio Fariselli, member of the Italian Progressive Rock band Area, and used extensively in the band's 1980 album Tic-Tac. ==Reception== French musician Jean Michel Jarre was the first person to get a copy of Automat. While Automat was being produced, Jarre released his album Oxyg√®ne, which became one of the most famous works of electronic music ever. Through the intervention of Claude Cavagnolo, at the time the representative of Montarbo's audio products in France, Mario Maggi was introduced to Jarre and met him in his studio in Paris in 1978. At this occasion Jarre listened to a copy of Automat on tape and, after giving an autographed copy of Oxyg√®ne to Mr. Maggi, was given a copy of Automat as a gift (although the album was not yet available in the music stores). ==Back cover== In the back cover, besides the production credits, the album had the following text: This text was inserted by the EMI's commercial personnel.

There were actually three elections in one as voters were electing members of two levels of regional government as well as the House of Representatives. This was to be the last election of President Suharto's New Order regime, which collapsed a year later. Like the preceding New Order elections, it was won outright by the Golkar organization. ==Participants== Indonesian law at the time only allowed three organisations to participate in elections - the United Development Party (PPP), the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and Golkar (functional group), an organisation which started off as a confederation of NGOs, and was officially not a party. ==Election campaign== The 27-day campaign ran from April 27 to May 23, with a quiet period of five days before polling day. Media coverage The mass media tended to favour \\"a particular election participant\\", for example Suara Karya newspaper only reported on Golkar campaign activities, and did not mention the PDI or PPP campaigns at all. On the other hand, the daily Media Indonesia was rather more balanced, but overall, Golkar campaign speakers received far more coverage. In the later stages of the campaign, media coverage was dominated by reports of campaign violence. Suara Karya in particular reported three times as many violent incidents involving the PPP than any other paper. Campaign issues Not a single election participant started the campaign by announcing or focusing on its main themes, therefore the public really had no idea what they were offering. The campaign was dominated by \\"sloganistic issues\\" with very little substance. For example, all three election participants promised to address problems such as poverty and corruption, but none actually said how they would do this. In fact, Kristiadi says that the only difference between this campaign and the previous one in 1992 was that there was less use of verses from the Koran to try and attract support. The \\"Mega-Bintang Phenomenon\\" Following the government's forced replacement of PDI leader Megawati Sukarnoputri by Soeryadi at the party's 1996 Medan conference, the PDI tried hard to put forward an independent image. Meanwhile, many of Megawati's supporters gravitated towards the PPP, in a phenomenon known as the \\"Mega- Bintang\\" coalition. Bintang means \\"star\\", and was the symbol of the PPP. This was an entirely unexpected occurrence. Megawati was seen as representing secular politics, while the PPP was an Islamic party, but the two found common ground as a coalition of the oppressed. PPP officials explicitly rejected the term \\"coalition\\", and said the increase in their support was a symbol of the revival of their party. However, posters and symbols carried by Megawati supporters made it clear what the \\"Mega-Bintang\\" coalition really meant. The government then banned the use of \\"Mega-Bintang\\" posters and symbols, saying it was contrary to election regulation. This ban was used by the security forces as an excuse to remove all such symbols. Campaign participants According to Kristiadi, there were three types of people who took part in the campaigns: * People ordered to do so or who were after money, or who wanted to see the entertainers laid on at rallies * People who voluntarily attended because they were proud to support their organisation * Young people releasing energy More than 200 people died during the course of the campaign, mostly in road traffic accidents and through being trapped in burning buildings during the disturbances in Banjarmasin. Intimidation and other irregularities There were reports in the press of intimidation and ‚Äúbuying support‚Äù, for example pressure on teachers to urge older high school students (the minimum voting age was 18) to vote for \\"a particular election participant\\" with a 'reward' for compliance and 'punishment' for failure. There were also other reports of known PPP and PDI supporters being intimidated. There were also disputes between employees, who wanted voters to cast their ballots at their places of work, and local government officials, who wanted them to vote near their homes, as each wanted to ensure they met their responsibility to achieve their quota of Golkar votes. ==Results== While Golkar won 282 seats in the MPR, the PDI lost 45 (winning 56 seats) while the PPP, thanks in part to the pro-Megawati PDI wing support, won 62 seats, an increase of 27.

The shell of Pseudosuccinea columella is horny brown, thin, translucent, fragile and very finely striated. The apex is pointed. The shell has 3.5‚Äì4 weakly convex whorls with a shallow suture. The last whorl predominates. The aperture is ovate. The upper palatal margin descends steeply. The columellar margin is reflected only at its upper section; the lower columellar margin sharp and straight. The width of the shell is 8‚Äì13 mm. The height of the shell is 15‚Äì20 mm. { Apertural view of the shell Abapertural view of the shell } The animal is dusky with whitish spots. The eyes are small and black and are located at the inner base of the tentacles. The haploid number of chromosomes is 18 (n=18). == Habitat == In North America, Pseudosuccinea columella lives in stagnant waters, at the edges of lakes, ponds, muddy and sluggish streams, among lily pads and reeds on sticks and mud. In Europe it occurs predominantly in greenhouses, but also sometimes in outdoor habitats (Austria, Hungary). It needs warm water and does not survive Central European winter temperatures. It is also found above the water on floating leaves of aquatic plants; in northern Greece it was found in a spring near a road. == Parasites == Parasites of Pseudosuccinea columella include: * In North America, Pseudosuccinea columella is major intermediate host of Fasciola hepatica.Torgerson P. & Claxton J.

It is starring Deddy Mizwar, Tora Sudiro, Lukman Sardi, Darius Sinathrya and Michael Muliardo.

This movie is a sequel to 1986 hit movie Nagabonar. The story revolves around the relationship between the now old Nagabonar, a pickpocket who became a self-proclaimed general during Indonesia's War of Independence, and his only son Bonaga. The movie touches on various subjects concerning the different views of the older generation and the younger, post-modern generation of Indonesia. These subjects include patriotism, traditional values, and love. The story begins when old Nagabonar comes to Jakarta from Medan at the request of his son, a successful young businessman who runs a large company with three of his closest friends, Pomo (Darius Sinathrya), Ronnie (Uli Herdinansyah) and Jaki (Michael Muliadro). Conflict and hilarity ensues when Bonaga tells his father the plan to sell their old palm plantation, where his mother and grandmother are buried along with his father's best friend Bujang. Nagabonar's outrage at what he thinks of as a desecration is then quickly subdued by Bonaga's consultant and love interest, Monita (Wulan Guritno), At least until Nagabonar learns that the would-be buyers of his land are Japanese, people who come from the very same country he fought against during the war of independence. ==Cast== *Deddy Mizwar as Nagabonar *Tora Sudiro as Bonaga *Wulan Guritno as Monita *Michael Muliadro as Jaki *Uli Herdinansyah as Ronny *Darius Sinathrya as Pomo *Lukman Sardi as Umar ==Awards & nominations== The film won five Citra Awards at the 2007 Citra Awards for Best Film, Best Screenplay (Musfar Yasin), Best Leading Actor (Deddy Mizwar), Best Supporting Actor (Lukman Sardi), and Best Sound Editing (Adityawan Susanto and Adimolana Machmud). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Nagabonar Jadi 2 at TheSuperMovie.com * Naga Bonar Jadi 2 at The Best Movie Review Category:2007 films Category:Indonesian films Category:Best Film Citra Award winners Category:Indonesian-language films Category:2007 comedy films Category:Films shot in Indonesia Category:Indonesian comedy films ","title":"Nagabonar Jadi 2"},{"id":"12377848","text":"The European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering medicinal chemistry and published by Elsevier.

This comprised a reserve of individuals rather than units, with civilian skills that could be transferred to military use. Reservists were required to undertake two weeks of military training per year and could be called up under the same conditions as the Regular Reserve regiments. As part of the Army Emergency Reserve the Royal Army Service Corps established ten transport columns and additional sub-units with other logistic roles. By 1962 this had been reduced to two; 101 Tank Transport Column and 104 Transport Column, plus sub-units. In 1965, when the Royal Corps of Transport (RCT) was formed, these columns where redesignated regiments. ==First formation== In the 1967 Defence Review the Territorial Army and the Army Emergency Reserve were merged and renamed the Territorial & Army Volunteer Reserve (T&AVR;). As a result, on 1 April 1967, 160 Transport Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport (Volunteers), was formed at Grange Camp, Bedford, the location of the RCT's Central Volunteer Headquarters (CVH), from personnel from 101 and 104 Transport Regiments RASC (AER). This new unit comprised 260 (Ambulance) Squadron, 261 (Bridging) Squadron, 262 (Petroleum Transport) Squadron and 263 (Tipper) Squadron. It initially provided engineering support as part of the Logistic Support Group (LSG) for the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF) in NATO's Northern European Command. In 1972 260 (Ambulance) Squadron was transferred to 161 Ambulance Regiment, RCT(V). In 1976 the regiment moved to new headquarters at Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, Grantham. On 1 April 1982, 160 Transport Regiment became part of 2 Transport Group, Royal Corps of Transport, an RCZ (Rear Combat Zone) formation of the British Army of the Rhine, exchanging roles with 155 (Wessex) Transport Regiment (Volunteers) which took over the engineer support role, and became a transport unit. It now comprised a Regimental HQ & Headquarters Squadron, 261 (General Transport) Squadron, 262 (Petroleum Transport) Squadron and 263 (General Transport) Squadron. At this time 261 Squadron was operating the AEC Militant GS 10-ton truck which remained in service until around 1990. In 1990 a number of members of the regiment volunteered to serve with 15 Transport Squadron RCT, on a 6-month operational tour supporting the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. The Options for Change Defence Review of 1990, drastically reduced the size of both the Regular and Territorial Army, with the Royal Corps of Transport being merged into the Royal Logistic Corps in April 1993, and at the same time 160 Transport Regiment was disbanded, with many of its personnel being absorbed by 161 Ambulance Regiment, RLC (V). ==Second formation== However, on 1 April 1995 160 Transport Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps was re- established to provide logistic support, particularly fuel resupply, to the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). The regiment now comprised the Regimental HQ & 260 (Headquarters) Squadron, 261 (General Transport DROPS) Squadron, 262 (Fuel) Squadron and 263 (General Transport DROPS) Squadron. Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, 160 Transport Regiment was merged with 164 Transport Regiment, with squadrons from each being disbanded. The regiment now comprised the Regimental HQ, 261 (General Transport) Squadron and 263 (General Transport) Squadron (from 160), and 270 (General Transport) Squadron (from 164). In 2001 the regiment provided support to civil authorities during an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. In January 2003 the Government decided to mobilise elements of the Territorial Army to support of military operations in Iraq (Operation Telic), and around 120 members of the regiment served there attached to other units. In April 2006 160 Transport Regiment was augmented by the addition of 126 (Petroleum) Squadron, transferred from 166 Supply Regiment RLC, which specialized in the construction and operation of bulk fuel installations. The regiment was twinned with 8 Transport Regiment RLC, during operations in Afghanistan (Operation Herrick), with personnel from the regiment providing replacements and backup, and also on detachment to other units. As a result of the Army 2020 review, 160 Transport Regiment was disbanded at Grantham on 17 May 2014. However, personnel from the regiment then formed 160 (Lincoln) Transport Squadron, as part of 158 Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps, based at Sobraon Barracks, Lincoln. ==Commanding officers== ;Royal Corps of Transport * Lieutenant Colonel E.

One of the first critically acclaimed acts was the rock band Super Nova from Skopje, which utilized rap music elements in some of its songs. The group recorded several rap music tracks for the music production branch of the Macedonian Radio-Television, including Hip-hop blues, Rap, Vero and others, some including pop, rock, funk, reggae or other elements. One of those songs was the anti-war themed Rapovanje. Its catchy rhyme, (\\"Better to rap, than to wage war\\") made it very popular across the country in 1989. In the same year, they performed at two prominent festivals in (Subotica and Zajecar). The most notable members of the group were: Vikto Mastoridis (guitar, vocals), Miki Kostadinov (drums), Vlatko Georgiev (keyboards) and Vlasto Janevik-Lucky (bass). Currently, one of the notable underground hip hop performers and producers in North Macedonia is Vladimir Agovski-Ago from Skopje. He became involved in the Macedonian hip-hop scene since childhood as a young b-boy in 1986. In the following year, he formed a juvenile rap act called The Masters of Rap and recorded his first studio track in 1988. In 1991, he joined the band Instant Beat, which performed around the country and made recordings in the Macedonian Radio-Television production, which were never officially released. Later, he formed another group, The Most Wanted, which in 1995, released the first Macedonian hardcore rap album, called \\"Judgment Day\\". After the group disbanded in 1996, he continued to work under the name Temnata strana (The Dark Side) and he founded the first Macedoninan hip-hop label, called \\"Dolina na senkite\\" abbreviated \\"DNS\\" (Valley of the Shadows) to promote his own works and other upcoming Macedonian hip hop acts as well. The group ƒåista okolina was formed in 1989 by joining several previously existing juvenile rap bands, and later it rose to one of the most prominent hip hop acts in the country. ƒåista okolina released the album \\"Noviot aspekt na starata ≈°kola\\" (The New Aspect of the Old School) in the spring of 1996. During its existence, it also released a song together with the prominent alternative rock group Last Expedition. One of the ƒåista okolina's former members, Vele Solunƒçev, later became a frontman of the mixed- style music group appropriately named Mosaique because it combined various elements such as hip hop, jazz fusion, alternative rock and ethno-jazz.  Notable figures  One of the most successful hip hop acts in the country is SAF (Sakam Afro Frizura) formed in 1993. It consists of the emcees Smilen Dimitrov and Mitko Ga≈°tarovski aka Pikisipi, as well as the band's backing DJ and turntablist, Goce Trpkov. In 1996, they released their well-known anti- drug abuse theme called Miss Stone. Its title is a pun between the historical person Miss Stone, the US missionary who met Jane Sandanski in Macedonia in the 1900s, and the phrase stoned. As the group became critically acclaimed, in the following year they started a music TV show called Hiphop teza. They released their debut album titled Safizam in 2001 and played a promotional concert with the prominent US hip hop band Das EFX as a support act. Prominent Macedonian hip hop artists in the 2000s include: Da D≈æaka Nakot, Legijata, Klan Istok, Edinstvena opcija, Puka kozmetika, Green Out, Str2 and many others. In 2003, the first all-female Macedonian hip hop band, No Exit, was formed in ≈†tip by Ana Ilievska, Kristina Angelova, and Marija Burovska. The early 1990s saw the emergence of many Macedonian pop-rap artists influenced by the then-popular MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice. These artists included for example the female solo singer Ena Veko, who released the LP \\"Bubaƒçki i gradski dzverki,\\" and the duo Lastovica, which consisted of Robert Sazdov and Vlado Janevski, who later became a solo pop singer and represented Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998. Behind most of these successful pop-rap acts was the prominent Macedonian composer and producer To≈°e Pop Simonov. The group Nulta Pozitiv was formed in parallel. Gradually, they became more mainstream and popular across the country, especially after recording the rap track nicknamed after the famous Macedonian folk song \\"Otvori go Pend≈æerƒçeto\\" (\\"Open the Window\\"). It featured an unconventional refrain for a rap song sung by the notable folk music singer Mirko Mitrevski. They released an album titled Transfuzija. Later, another pop-rap artist named Kristijan Gabrovski emerged from Prilep and was nicknamed Risto Bombata after Afrika Bambaataa. He and his backing band became very popular across the country for their mix of rap, pop- rock and pop-folk. In the mid-1990s, an offshoot of Nulta Pozitiv, named Attack, was the harder-sounding group which released the famous song \\"Atentatot na Kiro\\" after the assassination-attempt on the then-President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov in 1995. Later, one of the former Nulta Pozitiv members, Darko Dimitrov rose to a prominent Macedonian composer and producer. Dimitrov also worked with the late 1990s/early 2000s pop-rap artists such as Vrƒçak and Ugro. One of the first prominent Macedonian rap music festivals was the so-called \\"Rap'n'Roll\\" fest which was held in the early 1990s in MKC, the Youth Cultural Centre in Skopje, followed by many others. Currently North Macedonia hosts many hip hop festivals featuring both domestic and foreign performers. A hip hop clubbing scene also exists.

McKenzie resigned on 2 February 2020 after a government funding scandal, and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack held the post on an acting basis from 2 February until 6 February when Littleproud was reappointed to the post again after a ministerial reshuffle, without his previous water resources portfolio. The minister is assisted by the Assistant Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources, held by Senator Richard Colbeck since August 2018. Senator Anne Ruston previously served in the position from 2015 to 2018.

Formed in late December 1972 as cover band Silver Star, the group changed its name to Twisted Sister in February 1973 and originally included lead vocalist Michael \\"Valentine\\" O'Neill, guitarists Jay Jay French and Billy \\"Diamond\\" Stiger, bassist Kenny Neill and drummer Mel \\"Starr\\" Anderson. The band took a short hiatus in December 1974, after O'Neill instigated a fight with Anderson and threatened to shoot the drummer. They returned early the following year with new vocalist Frank \\"Rick Prince\\" Karuba and guitarist Keith \\"Angel\\" Angelino (in place of Stiger), although both had left before the end of the year, with French and Angelino's replacement Eddie \\"Fingers\\" Ojeda taking over lead vocal duties temporarily before another short hiatus. By February 1976, Twisted Sister had returned with new frontman Dee Snider and drummer Kevin John Grace. Tony Petri took over on drums a few months later. Neill left two years later in December 1978, with his place taken by Mark \\"The Animal\\" Mendoza. The band changed drummers three more times in the early 1980s, first when Ritchie Teeter replaced Petri in December 1980, followed by Joey Brighton in April 1981, and finally by Anthony \\"A. J.\\" Pero in April 1982. The lineup of Snider, French, Ojeda, Mendoza and Pero released four studio albums between 1982 and 1985, before Pero left in 1986 to rejoin his former band Cities. He was replaced by Joey \\"Seven\\" Franco, who performed on the group's last album Love Is for Suckers before breaking up in early 1988, following Snider's departure in October 1987. Twisted Sister reunited in 1998 to record \\"Heroes Are Hard to Find\\" for the film Strangeland, written and co-produced by Snider. The band reformed again to perform live for the first time in 14 years at New York Steel in November 2001, a benefit concert for organisations affected by the September 11 attacks. A more permanent reunion followed in 2003, spawning new studio recordings and live releases. The band retained the same lineup until March 2015, when Pero died of a heart attack while touring with Adrenaline Mob. Following the drummer's death, the band announced that it was to embark on a final tour before breaking up in 2016, enlisting Mike Portnoy to take over from Pero. The final Twisted Sister show took place on November 12, 2016 in Monterrey, Mexico at the Corona Northside Rock Park Meeting Fest. ==Members== Classic lineup {  border=\\"1\\" width=100% - !width=\\"75\\"Image !width=\\"170\\"Name !width=\\"125\\"Years active !width=\\"140\\"Instruments !Release contributions -  Jay Jay French  rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"all Twisted Sister releases -  Eddie \\"Fingers\\" Ojeda  -  Dee Snider  lead vocals -  Mark \\"The Animal\\" Mendoza   -  Anthony \\"A.

He is known as the discoverer of Ediacaran fossils, although it was later found that a then 15-year-old schoolgirl named Tina Negus had discovered the first Charnia fossil a year before he did. He is now a professor at the China University of Geosciences at Wuhan. ==Charnia discovery== Mason grew up in the English Midlands city of Leicester, where he attended Wyggeston Boys‚Äô Grammar School. In April 1957, while rock climbing with friends in Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, he spotted what looked like a leaf embedded in the rock. Mason took a rubbing of the rock. He showed the rubbing to his father, the minister of Leicester's Great Meeting Unitarian Chapel, who also taught at the local university and knew Trevor Ford, a geologist there. Mason took Ford to the site; Ford wrote up the discovery in the Journal of the Yorkshire Geological Society. Ford identified it as a Precambrian fossil and named it Charnia masoni after the forest and Mason. Mason credits this first step in his geological career to \\"[his] father‚Äôs encouragement and the enquiring approach fostered by [his] science teachers\\". The holotype (the actual physical example from which the species was first described) now resides, along with a cast of its sister taxon Charniodiscus, in Leicester Museum & Art Gallery, Leicester. Decades later it came to light that Tina Negus, then a 15-year-old schoolgirl, had seen this fossil a year before the boys, but her geography schoolteacher discounted the possibility of Precambrian fossils. Mason acknowledges, and the museum's Charnia display explains, that the fossil had been discovered a year earlier by Negus, \\"but no one took her seriously\\".\\"In April 1957, I went rock- climbing in Charnwood Forest with two friends, Richard Allen and Richard Blachford (‚ÄòBlach‚Äô), fellow students at Wyggeston Grammar School, Leicester. I was already interested in geology and knew that the rocks of the Charnian Supergroup were Precambrian although I had not heard of the Australian fossils. Richard Allen and I agree that Blach (who died in the early 1960s) drew my attention to the leaf-like fossil holotype now on display in Leicester City Museum. I took a rubbing and showed it to my father, who was Minister of the Great Meeting Unitarian Chapel in East Bond Street, taught part-time at University College (soon to be Leicester University) and thus knew Trevor Ford. We took Trevor to visit the fossil site and convinced him that it was a genuine fossil. His publication of the discovery in the Journal of the Yorkshire Geological Society established the genus Charnia and aroused worldwide interest. ... I was able to report the discovery because of my father‚Äôs encouragement and the enquiring approach fostered by my science teachers. Tina Negus saw the frond before I did but no one took her seriously.\\" She was recognised at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the official discovery. Mason's discovery was mentioned on the February 2009 David Attenborough documentary Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life, and again in Attenborough's 2010 series First Life and the documentary that accompanied it, Attenborough's Journey. Attenborough, a keen fossil hunter as a boy, mentioned that he attended Wyggeston a few years ahead of Mason, and having been in the same part of Charnwood a few years before Mason, but the prevailing wisdom at the time was that the rocks were too old to bear fossils and so Attenborough did not search them. == References == * New Scientist, 14 April 2007, p. 34, \\"Life's long fuse\\" Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:English academics Category:English geologists Category:People educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys Category:People from Leicester ","title":"Roger Mason (geologist)"},{"id":"12378015","text":"Riyadh ul Haq (born 1971) is a British Islamic scholar.

Short excerpts from his spiritual discourses are published online.Content Soul Content Soul These make it clear that his spiritual teachings cover a range of topics including social etiquettes and responsibility, love, and family ties.

It borders the Lugo municipalities of As Nogais, Cervantes, Folgoso do Courel, Samos and Triacastela. Its eastern boundary borders the province of Le√≥n. It belongs to the comarca of Os Ancares. The French Way of the Way of St. James enters Galicia from Le√≥n through the municipality and passes through the village of O Cebreiro. The village has some pallozas, including one that houses a small ethnographic museum. The Royal St. Mary's Church, also known as the Church of St. Benedict, was built in O Cebreiro in 1965‚Äì71 on the foundations of a pre-Romanesque church rediscovered in 1962. ==History== left The history of the town is strongly influenced by the importance of its port, the importance it has in the Camino de Santiago and the main gateway to the north of Galicia. The pallozas, archaic type of homes from which some specimens are preserved in the village of O Cebreiro, testify to a settlement before the Romans. Some of them have been restored to house an ethnographic museum and a refuge for pilgrims. The Port of Piedradita was crossed by a Roman road that led from Astorga to Triacastela, on the interior the ancient Galicia. Later that road gave way to medieval roads leading to Camino de Santiago and a Camino Real. The religious importance of this step was reinforced by the legendary miracle of the Holy Grail, which occurred in O Cebreiro, and since then a must for the Jacobean pilgrims. In 1486 the Catholic Monarchs, on a pilgrimage to Santiago, stopped at the monastery of O Cebreiro and donated the shrine where the relics of the miracle. The old Romanesque monastery chalice appears in the arms of Galicia. The road also had great importance in the Spanish War of Independence, due to its strategic position between Le√≥n and Galicia. In 1809 it was used by the Scottish troops of General John Moore, in his retreat to La Coru√±a as he was pursued by the French. Several hundred British were killed due to the harshness of that winter. During this period, the relics of O Cebreiro were hidden in the village of Foxos, but the documents of the monastery were destroyed. From the nineteenth century Piedrafita do Cebreiro was a passage of the first modern highway between Galicia and the plateau. In the twentieth century it became the first motorway, which crosses the harbor by two tunnels. == Demography == Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.7) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.9) ImageSize = width:580 height:300 PlotArea = left: 60 bottom: 30 top: 20 right: 20 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:5000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = late ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:2000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar: 1877 text: 1877 bar: 1887 text: 1887 bar: 1900 text: 1900 bar: 1910 text: 1910 bar: 1920 text: 1920 bar: 1930 text: 1930 bar: 1940 text: 1940 bar: 1950 text: 1950 bar: 1960 text: 1960 bar: 1970 text: 1970 bar: 1980 text: 1980 bar: 1990 text: 1990 bar: 2000 text: 2000 bar: 2010 text: 2010 PlotData= color:barra width:20 align:center bar: 1877 from:3937 till: 0 bar: 1887 from:4134 till: 0 bar: 1900 from:4402 till: 0 bar: 1910 from:4899 till: 0 bar: 1920 from:4388 till: 0 bar: 1930 from:4687 till: 0 bar: 1940 from:4632 till: 0 bar: 1950 from:4223 till: 0 bar: 1960 from:3770 till: 0 bar: 1970 from:2943 till: 0 bar: 1980 from:2520 till: 0 bar: 1990 from:2144 till: 0 bar: 2000 from:1552 till: 0 bar: 2010 from:1201 till: 0 PlotData= bar: 1877 at:3937 fontsize:S text:3.937 shift:(0,5) bar: 1887 at:4134 fontsize:S text:4.134 shift:(0,5) bar: 1900 at:4402 fontsize:S text:4.402 shift:(0,5) bar: 1910 at:4899 fontsize:S text:4.899 shift:(0,5) bar: 1920 at:4388 fontsize:S text:4.388 shift:(0,5) bar: 1930 at:4687 fontsize:S text:4.687 shift:(0,5) bar: 1940 at:4632 fontsize:S text:4.632 shift:(0,5) bar: 1950 at:4223 fontsize:S text:4.223 shift:(0,5) bar: 1960 at:3770 fontsize:S text:3.770 shift:(0,5) bar: 1970 at:2943 fontsize:S text:2.943 shift:(0,5) bar: 1980 at:2520 fontsize:S text:2.520 shift:(0,5) bar: 1990 at:2144 fontsize:S text:2.144 shift:(0,5) bar: 2000 at:1552 fontsize:S text:1.552 shift:(0,5) bar: 2010 at:1201 fontsize:S text:1.201 shift:(0,5) From:INE Archiv ==Civil parishes== * O Cebreiro (Santa Mar√≠a) * Fonfr√≠a (San Xo√°n) * Hospital (San Xo√°n) * Li√±ares (Santo Estevo) * Lousada (San Vicente) * Louzarela (San Xo√°n) * Pacios (San Lourenzo) * Padornelo (San Xo√°n) * Pedrafita do Cebreiro (Santo Ant√≥n) * Riocereixa (Santa Mar√≠a Madanela) * Veiga de Forcas (Santa Mar√≠a) *Zanfoga (San Marti√±o) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Municipality of Pedrafita do Cebreiro (Concello de Pedrafita do Cebreiro) Category:Municipalities in the Province of Lugo ","title":"Pedrafita do Cebreiro"},{"id":"12378103","text":"Marina van der Merwe (born February 7, 1937) is a former field hockey coach, who was born in Cape Town, South Africa. ==Coaching career== She was the head coach of the Canada women's national field hockey team from 1976 to 1995.

She was Stan Laurel's professional partner and common-law wife from 1917 to 1925. ==Childhood and career in Australia== She was born May Charlotte Dahlberg on 24 May 1888, in the inner Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, Victoria, Australia, to Louis, a labourer, and Mary Jane (nee Gundry). By 1905 she had begun to earn a reputation performing as a singer and dancer on the Australian stage, with positive reviews.Critic, Sat 5 Nov 1910, Page 2, \\"Miss May Dahlberg\\" Accessed 2017-4-15 The Brisbane Courier, Mon 15 Jan 1912, Page 5, \\"Entertainments\\" Accessed 2017-15-4 In 1906 she married baritone and fellow performer Rupert Cuthbert while in Hobart, Tasmania.Punch, Thursday 13 Jan 1910, Page 34, \\"Greenroom Gossip\\" Accessed 2017-15-4 A child, Rupert Clifton Saxe Cuthbert, was born of the union in 1908, in Melbourne. In about 1913, Dahlberg and Cuthbert sailed for the United States. ==Career in the US== Dahlberg and Cuthbert's personal and professional relationship apparently did not last. While performing in a \\"sister act,\\" in California, Dahlberg met and formed a variety act with Stan Laurel. In 1917 she played in a comedy short, Nuts in May, notable as the screen debut of Stan Laurel (credited as Stan Jefferson). Mae Dahlberg is credited as \\"Mae Laurel\\" in several of her films. Though Stan and Mae never married, as professional partners they lived together as common-law husband and wife from 1917 to 1925. Mae maintained that it was she who suggested Stan change his name to Laurel.Simon Louvish, Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy, Faber & Faber 2001 By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two- reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation, that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films; Rock thought her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, when she started interfering with Laurel's work, Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted.Bergan 1992, p. 33.The Sun, Tue 3 Mar 1925, Page 10 \\"NINE YEARS IN U.S.A\\" Accessed 2017-4-15 Her last film had been Wide Open Spaces, made for Hal Roach in 1924 with Laurel and fellow Australian Ena Gregory in the leading roles.

During his time on the List he was based in Clacton-on-Sea in Essex and was by profession a teacher. ==Career== Foakes did not become a Football League linesman until the age of thirty seven in 1984. However, it then took him just three more years to graduate to the full Referees List. His first few years of officiating culminated in taking charge of an FA Cup quarter final at White Hart Lane between Tottenham (the eventual Cup winners) and Notts County. He officiated regularly in the former League Division One and was therefore an unsurprising choice for the new Premier League in 1992-93. Over the next two years he handled a number of matches at Premier level. However, he was approaching retirement age and was not included on the reduced Premier League list of referees for season 1994-95. He reverted exclusively to the Football League . In April he handled the Associate Members' Cup Final between Birmingham City and Carlisle United. He was back at Wembley at the end of May to finish his career with a significant game, as Bolton took on Reading in the Division One play-off Final for a place in the Premier League. In this match, Bolton won 4-3 after extra-time. Reading had been leading 2-0 and then missed a penalty before Bolton's comeback.1995 Division One Play-Off Final: Royals.org (Reading F.C.) website.

While metabolomics can provide instantaneous information on the metabolites in a biological sample, metabolism is a dynamic process. The significance of fluxomics is that metabolic fluxes determine the cellular phenotype. It has the added advantage of being based on the metabolome which has fewer components than the genome or proteome. Fluxomics falls within the field of systems biology which developed with the appearance of high throughput technologies. Systems biology recognizes the complexity of biological systems and has the broader goal of explaining and predicting this complex behavior. == Metabolic flux == Metabolic flux refers to the rate of metabolite conversion in a metabolic network. For a reaction this rate is a function of both enzyme abundance and enzyme activity. Enzyme concentration is itself a function of transcriptional and translational regulation in addition to the stability of the protein. Enzyme activity is affected by the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, the substrate concentrations, the product concentrations, and the effector molecules concentration. The genomic and environmental effects on metabolic flux are what determine healthy or diseased phenotype. == Fluxome == Similar to genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, the fluxome is defined as the complete set of metabolic fluxes in a cell. However, unlike the others the fluxome is a dynamic representation of the phenotype. This is due to the fluxome resulting from the interactions of the metabolome, genome, transcriptome, proteome, post-translational modifications and the environment. == Flux analysis technologies == Two important technologies are flux balance analysis (FBA) and 13C-fluxomics. In FBA metabolic fluxes are estimated by first representing the metabolic reactions of a metabolic network in a numerical matrix containing the stoichiometric coefficients of each reaction. The stoichiometric coefficients constrain the system model and are why FBA is only applicable to steady state conditions. Additional constraints can be imposed. By providing constraints the possible set of solutions to the system are reduced. Following the addition of constraints the system model is optimized. Flux-balance analysis resources include the BIGG database, the COBRA toolbox, and FASIMU. In 13C-fluxomics, metabolic precursors are enriched with 13C before being introduced to the system. Using an imaging technique such as mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the level of incorporation of 13C into metabolites can be measured and with stoichiometry the metabolic fluxes can be estimated. ==Stoichiometric and kinetic paradigms== A number of different methods, broadly divided into stoichiometric and kinetic paradigms. Within the stoichiometric paradigm, a number of relatively simple linear algebra methods use restricted metabolic networks or genome-scale metabolic network models to perform flux balance analysis and the array of techniques derived from it. These linear equations are useful for steady state conditions. Dynamic methods are not yet usable. On the more experimental side, metabolic flux analysis allows the empirical estimation of reaction rates by stable isotope labelling. Within the kinetic paradigm, kinetic modelling of metabolic networks can be purely theoretical, exploring the potential space of dynamic metabolic fluxes under perturbations away from steady state using formalisms such as biochemical systems theory. Such explorations are most informative when accompanied by empirical measurements of the system under study following actual perturbations, as is the case in metabolic control analysis. ==Constraint based reconstruction and analysis== Collected methods in fluxomics have been described as \\"COBRA\\" methods, for constraint based reconstruction and analysis. A number of software tools and environments have been created for this purpose. Although it can only be measured indirectly, metabolic flux is the critical link between genes, proteins and the observable phenotype. This is due to the fluxome integrating mass-energy, information, and signaling networks. Fluxomics has the potential to provide a quantifiable representation of the effect the environment has on the phenotype because the fluxome describes the genome environment interaction. In the fields of metabolic engineering and systems biology, fluxomic methods are considered a key enabling technology due to their unique position in the ontology of biological processes, allowing genome scale stoichiometric models to act as a framework for the integration of diverse biological datasets. == Examples of use in research == One potential application of fluxomic techniques is in drug design. Rama et al. used FBA to study the mycolic acid pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycolic acids are known to be important to M. tuberculosis survival and as such its pathway has been studied extensively. This allowed the construction of a model of the pathway and for FBA to analyze it. The results of this found multiple possible drug targets for future investigation. FBA was used to analyze the metabolic networks of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. By performing in silico single and double gene deletions many enzymes essential to growth were identified. ==References== Category:Bioinformatics Category:Systems biology Category:Computational biology ","title":"Fluxomics"},{"id":"12378174","text":"Pass the Buck was an Australian game show hosted by John Burgess based on the American game show of the same name, airing on the Nine Network from 11 February 2002.

Before the start of the game, the contestant who was responsible for answering first Each contestant had three seconds to give one answer at a time, proceeding left to right, and remained in the game for each valid answer. If a contestant repeated a previous response, failed to respond within the allotted time, or gave a response that the judges deemed invalid, he or she was eliminated, and a new category was played. This process continued until there were two contestants remaining. Once four contestants remained, the contestant who gave a valid response must state who was the next person to give an answer on each question. Some rounds were designated as \\"Memory Moment\\" rounds, where the contestants were given a list of valid answers to the question. Once two contestants remained, a 90-second speed round was played. The two remaining contestants had to give one answer at a time to a series of questions, with one point being earned for each valid answer. The question was replaced immediately after an invalid response was given. The contestant with the most points at the end of that round won the game and advanced to the \\"Major Prize Round\\". If there was a tie at the end of that round, one final question was played; the first contestant to give an incorrect response to that question was eliminated. In the \\"Major Prize Round\\", the champion was shown a list of ten prizes and was given 20 seconds to recite as many prizes as possible; he or she won the prizes that were correctly recited. Contestants remained on the show until they were defeated or have won five games; the prize for winning five games was a car. ==See also== * List of Nine Network programs * List of Australian game shows ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Australian game shows Category:2000s Australian game shows Category:Nine Network original programming Category:2002 Australian television series debuts Category:2002 Australian television series endings ","title":"Pass the Buck (Australian game show)"},{"id":"12378197","text":"Ty Girlz were girl dolls manufactured by Ty Inc.About.com mention . Similar to the Ty Beanie Babies, the Ty Girlz are on a limited release pattern with dolls being introduced and older ones retired at various times. PlayZak Magazine Ty Girlz are plush toys that are connected to an online virtual worldVirtual Worlds News at TyGirlz.com. Introduced to the global market on April 13, 2007, Ty Girlz was one of only a few virtual worlds geared to girls. The line was discontinued in 2013 and the virtual world shut down on June 7 of that same year. ==Advertising== When the Ty Girlz were debuted at toy fairs, Ty had posters and cut-outs of the Girlz to promote them. Ty even had a billboard in Atlanta, Georgia, showing Sizzlin' Sue saying \\"Who's that Girl?\\". That phrase soon became a popular tag for the line. In September 2007, the Ty Girlz got a MySpace and YouTube page. In the Spring 2008 Ty retailer catalog, retailers were able to purchase clothing made exclusively for Ty Girlz. ==Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia controversy== In January 2009, Ty released two new Ty Girlz, one named Sweet Sasha and the other named Marvelous Malia. Media reports linked the names to Sasha and Malia Obama, daughters of President Barack Obama. On January 21, a Ty spokesperson told the Chicago Sun-Times that the Obama daughters were indeed the inspiration for the dolls. In response to Ty, Michelle Obama's press secretary said that Ty did not ask permission to use the Obama daughters' first names, saying \\"It is inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes.\\" On January 22, when asked whether the new Ty Girlz were inspired by Sasha and Malia Obama, Ty's Senior Vice President of Sales said that the dolls were not made to physically resemble either of the Obama daughters and that the names chosen \\"worked very well with the dolls\\". Ty said that the process of naming dolls is proprietary information and would not say how the names were given to the dolls. In February 2009, Ty decided to retire the original dolls and give them new names, Marvelous Mariah and Sweet Sydney. The CEO of Ty said the name change was due to Michelle Obama's disapproval of the original names. Ty stated that, while the original names were inspired by \\"this historic time in our nation's history\\", they were not named after the Obama daughters. Ty promised to donate the profits from sales of the original dolls to a charity, the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation for youth education. Following the recall, dolls that had already been shipped to the marketplace sold on eBay for $3,000. ==List of dolls== {  - ! Name ! Hair Color: ! Eye Color: ! Special Clothing ! Release Date !

In the quarter final replay against Coventry City, United found themselves 1-0 down at Bramall Lane with 2 minutes left. Holdsworth popped up to equalise from a corner, sending the game to extra time and then penalties, which United went on to win. Birmingham City In March 1999 Holdsworth transferred to Birmingham City. He helped Birmingham to the play offs at the end of that season where they faced his former club Watford. However Holdsworth was sent off as they lost on penalties. He spent three full seasons there, helping them to the 2001 League Cup Final in which he was an unused substitute in the defeat to Liverpool. In January 2002 he went on loan to Walsall. At Walsall he scored once against Coventry but was sent off twice in 3-0 defeats to Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves. Later career After being released by Birmingham in 2002, he joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer where he played alongside his brother Dean again. However, he only made one appearance for the Trotters: in a League Cup defeat to Bury (David started and his brother Dean came on as a substitute).

All these bands were hosted under the Object Music record label. Many of them shared musicians, thus the movement looked more like a musical collective (there was indeed a Manchester Musicians Collective, co- founded by Dick Witts of The Passage). Leader and heart of the band was Steve Solamar (real name Steve Scrivener), a distinct song/lyrics writer with a peculiar vocal style that has been described as either \\"terrible\\",Trouser Press review or at least \\"idiosyncratic\\".Louise Alderman In summer 1978, they recorded their first LP, Past And Parcel. Their best came with Elliptical Optimism (1979) and Further Ellipses (1980). The former still keeps contact with punk and 60s garage sound. Further Ellipses somewhere departs from the DIY sound of previous releasesReview on Boomkat, October 2008 and puts more emphasis on ultra-romantic melodic synthesizer tunes (The \\"Final Part\\", \\"The Root\\"), a small share of Latin guitar melancholy and a better polished production. Nevertheless, tracks like Set Free betray the strong influence of gospel & rhythm & blues; an unusual feature for a British post-punk band of that period. In 1980, Solamar collaborated with Steve Miro as the Noyes (i.e. \\"noise\\") Brothers, to produce more experimental music forms. They recorded a double LP (Sheep From Goats), which was far more unconventional than anything they had created with their own bands. Other Solamar projects were Warriors and Alternomen Unlimited, while John Bisset Smith was involved into the band Grow Up (all recording for Object Music). In 1981, Spherical Objects recorded their last LP, No Man's Land. It was a return to more archetypal rock forms like those perverted and twisted in Elliptical Optimism.\\" After 1981 very little information exists for Steve Solamar or other Spherical Objects members. Solamar changed genderSimon Reynolds, Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978-1984 and, soon after No Man's Land, disbanded Spherical Objects and stopped supporting the Object Music label, because he wanted to make a radical change in his (her) life.

They have sub castes - Dasa Pantha and Bhakti Pantha. They are known to be the followers of Sri Raamanujachaarya .They originated from Melukote of Mandya district. They are an agricultural community, though agriculture once formed an important source of income. The people of the community use Naik (‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≥ç‡≤ï), Nayak (‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤ï), and Namadhari (‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤Æ‡≤ß‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤ø) as surnames. The community considers the Lord of Tirupati as their deity, apart from the local gods as family deities depending on their place of origin. ==Origin== According to the People of India series by the Anthropological Survey of India it, the Halepaiks/Komarpaiks are migrants from Andhra Pradesh. It refers to the legend of king Gopala Krishnaraya who was ruling Vijayanagar, when the Halepaiks were living in Kumarakshetra near the capital (read: Hampi). It says that one of the Halepaiks, Narayana, son of Ranga Naik and Laxmi Devi, impressed the king by faithfully serving him, pleased with which the King granted him the village of 'Halepaik' as inam. Halepaiks find continuous reference in Kuvempu's Malegalalli madumagalu and Kanuru Heggaditi which deal with life in the Western Ghats in the 19th century. The then contemporary condition of Halepaiks, vague reference to their origins, social standings, inter relation with other communities, ongoing class struggle can be summed up from this work.Kanooru Subbamma Heggaditi, Kuvempu Kuvempu indicates that there was a decision taken among the landlords that Halepaiks were to be not allowed to hold their own lands and were to be confined to tilling others' lands. The discrimination extended to ceremonies and rituals as well with the Halepaik groom not allowed to ride a horse to his marriage as was the practice for ages.Malegalalli madumagalu, Kuvempu The landlords seem to have guarded this privilege of theirs very closely. This also indicates the social downfall Halepaiks had attained by then. ==Present conditions and social status== The martial Halepaiks took to agriculture in peacetime and down the centuries were left with small landholdings, a condition which led to them being downtrodden and marginalized. Until recently Halepaiks were known for their status as resident cultivators (Gross-crop sharing), that is working on lands passed on by heredity on the condition of parting with a portion of produce. This system is known as Geni paddati (tenure system) in Kannada. There are two versions, Moola geni (protected tenant with certain rights; similar to Bhoomidar of Uttar Pradesh) being the hereditary one and Chala geni (tenant at will; ex Sirdars and Asamis of U.P)Land Revenue, M.G. Pimputkar, http://www.lbsnaa.ernet.in/lbsnaa/research/trdc/annualreport/ar2000_2001.doc M.G. Pimputkar land revenue given on a contract lasting 4‚Äì5 years. Halepaiks became almost synonymous with the Moolageni system. With the undergoing changes at the socio-political level and the onset of lenders the condition became such that over the last century every family which was poor to own land by themselves took to the above said system irrespective of caste, creed and community. From Brahmins to Muslims they were at it for livelihood.Kaada toreya jaadu: Autobiography of Kadidal Shamanna Most became resident cultivators in their own land due to debt trap. Even so, there was oppression in the Geni system with the landlords resorting to arm twisting and violence to extract greater share. This led to one of the most important agrarian movements in post independent India, the Kagodu satyagraha. The Kagodu Satyagraha of 1951 turned out to be a memorable period for the community, with many from community assuming leadership in the movement. The doyen of community like H.Ganpatiyappa, Savaji Beera Naik, Mandagadale Ram Naik worked closely with leaders like Shantaveri Gopalagowda, Yusuf Meherally to make it a success.Kagodu ondu nenapu, C.B.

Although German troops mainly operate in the comparatively quiet north of the country, the Bundeswehr has suffered a number of casualties during participation in the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan. ==Overview== As of May 5, 2013, 54 German soldiers and three policemen died in Afghanistan, raising the death toll to 57. Among them are the first German reservists to fall in hostile actions and the first German policemen to die in a deployment abroad since World War II. In addition to these fatalities, 245 German soldiers and four police officers suffered injuries of varying degree caused by hostile activity. ==Controversy== The number of fatalities has caused a stir in Germany since it is the highest of all deployments abroad that the German army has ever participated in since World War II and because the German participation in the conflict is controversial. ISAF participation marks the first time since World War II that German ground troops have been confronted with an organized enemy. Prior to 2002, the Armed Forces had sustained only two losses of life connected to direct hostile activities, (A soldier with UN troops in Cambodia was shot dead in 1993 and a medical officer died when the helicopter he was travelling in was shot down by Georgian insurgents in 2003). As a direct result of the number of deaths, German Federal Minister of Defence, Franz Josef Jung, presented plans to establish a central memorial for fallen soldiers in Berlin on June 17, 2007. Furthermore, the Bundeswehr has unveiled a new order which is to honour acts of heroism achieved in deployments abroad: The Cross of Honour for Bravery. An incident that occurred on June 26, 2005 which was at first declared an accident by the Cabinet of Germany turned out to have been an attack with a remote-controlled device. The cause of death of a soldier who died on September 8, 2007 at an unknown location in Afghanistan has not yet been disclosed. It appears to be a result of suicide. The cause of death of two soldiers who died in the first half of 2003 has yet to be disclosed. As no official sources specify the circumstances of their deaths, they are very likely not connected to hostile action. In a statement published on February 2, 2008, Herr Jung mentioned a number of 26 German soldiers who had been killed in Afghanistan. In a 2010 interview, KSK commander Hans-Christoph Ammon said that no KSK soldiers had so far been killed in action. However, a press release from the US European Command confirmed that at least one soldier was wounded in action in Afghanistan sometime between June and October 2005. ==Chronology of incidents== 2002 {  ! style=\\"width: 11%\\"  Date ! style=\\"width: 11%\\"  Location ! style=\\"width: 7%\\"  Nature of incident ! style=\\"width: 9%\\"  Circumstances ! style=\\"width: 54%\\"  Situation Note: Ranks and unit names are listed in English for better understanding ! style=\\"width: 6%\\"  Casualties -  align=\\"center\\"  2002-02-15  align=\\"center\\"  Kabul, Ghazi Stadium  align=\\"center\\"  Hostile  align=\\"center\\"  Riots  Riots during a soccer match left five German and Austrian soldiers injured.

By 1917, there were 200 people living in a shack town, which had a school and 2 grocery stores. The company wanted to buy land from the Federal government to build a townsite, but due to the land being a military reserve they refused. Instead they bought land from a private seller. The land was cleared and construction on houses began in 1920. In all there were 83 houses built. The townsite also had a grocery store, community hall, a tennis court and lawn bowling green, and 2 churches. As of 2015, the Ioco townsite has been sold to a Vancouver developer. == References == Category:Port Moody ","title":"Ioco, Port Moody"},{"id":"12378478","text":"Wiswell is a small village and civil parish in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, England, close to Whalley and Clitheroe at the foot of Wiswell Moor. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 967.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Key Statistics Retrieved 2 September 2015 The parish adjoins the other Ribble Valley parishes of Pendleton, Sabden, Whalley and Barrow. Higher areas of the parish, east of the village, are part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). ==Toponomy== The name Wiswell is commonly spoken as wizel. The true pronunciation is more like 'wize-well' consistent with the original spellings of \\"Wyswell\\" or \\"Wiswall\\". There are several theories about the origins of the name. It is said to take its name from Old Molly's Well, a local landmark, later to become known as Wise Woman's Well (Wise Well). Alternatively, 'Wis' could have been part of the name of an Old English personal name. ==HistoryGovernance== Wiswell was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Clitheroe Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Parts of the parish transferred to Sabden on its creation in 1904. It has since become part of the borough of Ribble Valley. In 2015 Barrow was split from Wiswell to form a separate parish council. Along with Barrow (since 2015), Pendleton, Mearley and Worston, the parish forms the Wiswell and Pendleton ward of Ribble Valley Borough Council. The ward had a population of 1,289 in 2001, rising to 1,316 in 2011. The ward elects a single councillor, who currently is Robert Thompson of the Conservative Party. ==Amenities== The Freemason's Arms Today the village only boasts a pub/restaurant (Freemasons Arms). However, there used to be a small corner shop, school and church; the names of each still stand on the original buildings but they are now prominent houses in the village. The property in which the current pub operates was not originally designed as a public house. It was formerly three small cottages one of which was a freemasons' lodge, which is how it acquired its name. The original village pub, the Lamb Inn, was located adjacent to the public phone box, but no longer exists and is now known as Clegg House, a residence on the corner of Coronation Gardens. The Lamb Inn closed over 150 years ago and Wiswell was without a pub for some time as the Freemasons did not open until considerably later on. ==Population== Towards the end of the 19th century about forty percent of the people who lived in Wiswell left to live elsewhere. This was probably related to job losses (through the temporary closure of the Barrow mill) and significant employment opportunities elsewhere. The British census figures taken every ten years from 1801 to 1871 show the population changes. The census uses the highway from Whalley to Pendleton to divide Wiswell into 'West' and 'East': ;West: :Wiswell township (part of) in the parish of Whalley. All that part of the township of Wiswell which lies on the Western side of the highway leading from the town of Whalley to the village of Pendleton and which passes through the town of Wiswell [and includes Barrow]. ;East: :All that part of the township of Wiswell which lies on the Eastern side of the Highway leading from Whalley to Pendleton including Briggs farm, Busskens Hill, Wiswell Hall, Wiswell Eaves and the remaining cottages on the Eastern side of the Highway. In the censuses from 1801 to 1841, the population rose sharply and stabilised between 1841 and 1851 at about 750 people. Following this the population declined sharply to about 420 in 1871. The change in population in the 1850s was dramatic. It seems likely that the Barrow Print Works closed for a time after 1851 or at least significantly reduced its workforce. Notes in the 1861 census highlight \\"a decrease in the population of the Townships of Wiswell and Whalley which is attributed to the discontinuance of employment in the Printworks.\\" ==See also== *Listed buildings in Wiswell ==References== Notes Citations ==External links== *Wiswell Conservation Area Appraisal *Light Clough SSSI Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Civil parishes in Lancashire Category:Geography of Ribble Valley ","title":"Wiswell"},{"id":"12378500","text":"1895 newspaper article describing the fifth day of the final deciding Ashes match The England cricket team toured Australia and Ceylon in 1894-95.

His given name was Gandharva Narayan, but he changed it to Dinabandhu Mitra. His education started at a village pathshala. His father arranged a job for him on a zamindar's estate in 1840. But the small boy fled to Kolkata, where he started working in the house of his uncle, Nilmani Mitra. Around 1846, he was admitted to the free school run by James Long. Dinabandhu was a bright student and won a number of scholarships. In 1850, he enrolled in Hindu College and was awarded scholarships for academic excellence. However, he did not appear in his last examination, and, instead, started working as a postmaster in Patna in 1855. He served in various posts in the Postal Department in Krishnanagar, Nadia, Dhaka and Orissa. In 1870, he was made supernumerary postmaster in Serampore. In 1872, he joined the Indian Railway as an inspector. ==Literary career== Mitra started writing literary pieces while still at college. His poetic style was inspired by poet Ishwar Chandra Gupta. His poems were able to attract the attention of intellectuals at Kolkata, but his favourite genre was the drama. His work in the postal department had taken him to various parts of the country giving him opportunities to study human life closely and thereby adding to his ability to unfold the drama of life with a degree of realism unknown at that time. Among his books of poems are Suradhuni Kavya (first part appeared in 1871, second part appeared in 1876) and Dvadash Kavita (1872). His plays include Nil Darpan (1860), Nabin Tapasvini (1863), Biye Pagla Budo (1866), Sadhabar Ekadashi (1866), Lilavati (1867), Jamai Barik (1873) and Kamale Kamini (1873). He also wrote a novel titled Poda Mahehshvar. Another one of his noted contributions was Jamalaye Jibanta Manush (An Alive Man in the Abode of Yama), the basic storyline will later be adopted into film in the same name starring Bhanu Bandopadhyay and Basabi Nandi. Nil Darpan English translation of Nil Darpan. Mitra's play Nil Darpan was about the plight of indigo farmers. Indigo revolt (1858) in Bengali was the revolt of the indigo farmers against the indigo planters. It was one year after the Sepoy Revolt, Bengal saw one more important revolt in its history. The play was published from Dhaka and soon after its publication it ignited a major argument in the newspapers.Dinabandhu Mitra, Ajit Kumar Ghoshal, Shahitya Academy Publication His first hand experience of the indigo cultivators, while on the job as the postmaster in rural Orissa and Bengal, were reflected in the drama. Michael Madhusudan Dutt translated the play into English immediately after it was published.Prothom Alo, Sunil Ganguli, Ananda Publishers and Reverend James Long published it. The play got wide publicity in Europe where it was translated into other languages. No other Bengali book at that time got so wide publicity at such large scale. It was so emotionally motivating that when the play was staged, the notable educator and reformer Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar was so taken in by the realism of the performance of Ardhendushekhar Mustafi (the actor playing the role of the indigo planter Mr Wood) that he threw a shoe at the actor. The actor accepted the shoe as a compliment. A lawsuit was filed against Rev. Long on 19 July 1861 for libeling the editor of the Englishman and libeling the indigo planters. Rev. Long was fined a sum of 1000 Rs. and a month of time in jail, the fully packed court house were full with sympathy towards the Rev. and the dramatist. The fined sum was paid at the spot by author Kaliprasanna Singha. The court hearing against the indigo planters went for the next four years. Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay compared Nil Darpan to Uncle Tom's Cabin for its role in arousing people's awareness of the evils of indigo plantations. ==Later life and legacy== Mitra was awarded the title Rai Bahadur by the British Raj for services rendered at the Lushai Expedition. He was the matchmaker between Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rajlakshmi Devi. He died on 1 November 1873. The college Dinabandhu Mahavidyalay (estd. 1947) is named after Mitra. ==References== Category:1830 births Category:1873 deaths Category:People from Nadia district Category:Hare School alumni Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali-language writers ","title":"Dinabandhu Mitra"},{"id":"12378518","text":", son of Kanehira, was a court noble (kugyo) of the Kamakura period.

The army troops and intelligence paramilitary soldiers faced an estimated ~500 al-Qaeda foreign fighters holed up in several fortified settlements, the fighting ended with 17 soldiers dead. It was speculated at the time that Osama bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri was among those trapped by the Pakistan Army, but he either escaped or was never among these fighters. After weeks of fighting, the ISPR admitted that it was actually Tohir Yoldeshev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, who was hiding there. ==Background== Wanna () is a small town inhabitant by the Mehsud and Wazir Tribes. The town is situated in complex series of White mountains range in western Pakistan. The town closely aligned with Tora Bora area of adjacent country, Afghanistan. In early months of 2002, Pakistan Army sent and deployed large formation of Infantry and Mountaineering Divisions. The Mountaineering and Infantry Divisions were deployed under the command of Lieutenant-General Ali Jan Aurakzai, who later became Governor of North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The Army Divisions entered the Tirah Valley in the Khyber Agency for the first time since Pakistan independence in 1947. The troops were later proceeded to move into the Shawal Valley of North Waziristan, and later South Waziristan. In late December 2003, the tension between Pakistan Government and the Waziri tribes mounted as the tribe leaders viewed the action as an attempt to subjugate them. ==Military Intelligence== According to the reports of the military intelligence, there were ~500‚Äì600 al- Qaeda fighters in the region; all militants were Chechens, Uighurs, Uzbeks, Arabs and Tajik fighters. By March 19, 2004, a team of ISI's Covert Action Division (CAD) secretly inserted in the Shin Warsak area, where they confirmed the High-value target presence. The media reports claimed that it was Ayman al-Zawahiri hiding in the area and might be holed up in one of the areas. In describing the military intelligence reports, President Musharraf testified that: > We feel that there may be a high-value target. I can't say who. The > ferociousness of the surrounded fighters indicated that they were protecting > someone particularly significant. After a week of fighting, the ISPR testified that military intelligence sources have confirmed that one of the top al Qaeda leader, Tohir Yo‚Äòldosh, has been injured in the military operation in the tribal area and has fled the area. According to one version of the military intelligence reports reads: > Reports indicate that it was actually Tahir and not Zawahiri, who was > driving in the bullet-proof double-cabin pick- up truck that subsequently > hit a wall and was later found abandoned. ==The Battle for Mountains== On 13‚Äì19 March 2004, a small team of the ISI's Covert Action Division and SS Directorate were inserted by a helicopter in the Shin Warsk area to confirm the militant activities. The CAD and SSD teams confirmed the fighters were Chechens, Uzbeks, and Tajiks; this marked the start of the military operation. On 16 March 2004, the army troops made the first contact with the al-Qaeda foreign fighters around the South Waziristan village of Wanna. Air Intelligence map: The Pakistan Armed Forces troops and the foreign fighters fought the phases of the battle in White Mountains (Safed Koh range) of Pakistan, closely aligned to Tora Bora of Afghanistan. Heavy fighting between army infantry troops and al-Qaeda fighters began in the small village of Wanna, though al-Qaeda had evacuated the village but army had suffered heavy casualties. Soon after the confrontation, the Pakistan Army realised the seriousness of the foreign fighters capabilities, and deployed the 20th Mountain Brigade to support operations in the mountainous areas. Two days later, on March 18, 2004, reports began to surface that the Pakistani military had surrounded a High-value target, possibly Al-Qaeda's second-in- command Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri. However, both the Pakistani and U.S. military refused to confirm or deny Zawahiri's presence. The army surrounded the mountain redoubt where al-Qaeda foreign fighters were well dug-in. The CAD and SSD teams were tasked with finding the high-value target during the armed conflict and that high-value target was reportedly wounded in the battle. Heavy fighting ensued, and repeated assaults were beaten back by al-Qaeda fighters. The Pakistan Army forces suffered heavy casualties. As troops pushed into the mountains, the al-Qaeda fighters launched aggressive attacks on Pakistani troops as more and more foreign fighters began to join the fight. The al-Qaeda fighters had set up their main strategic posts at the top of the mountains allowing them to observe the movements of the Pakistan Army infantry and mountaineering troops. The troops called for air strikes which were carried out by PAF F-16s and the army aviation corps, targeting the suspected posts and hidden positions of al-Qaeda. Following the air strikes, the infantry troops redoubled their efforts to gain control of the mountains. In the night of 18 March 2004, the army troops and foreign fighters again engage in a heavy and bloody gun battle occurred wherein infantry troops had repeatedly beaten the assaults after assaults. After days of fighting, the infantry troops gained control of key positions in the mountains which al- Qaeda had previously held. Sporadic fighting continued as the infantry units began to pursue the al-Qaeda foreign fighters. Soon, all the strategic mountain posts were evacuated by the al-Qaeda fighters as the infantry troops had reached the top of the mountains. By dawn, the infantry troops with the help of 20th Mountain Brigade had taken control of the mountains. In a last attempt to regain their territory, al-Qaeda fighters planned another assault against the army at night which continued until dawn. The army troops and paramilitary officers then counter-attacked, and the battle soon slipped to adjacent mountains as the al-Qaida foreign fighters began to escape. Both sides sustained casualties, and the next morning al-Qaeda fighters began abandoning their positions and retreating from the area. As requested by the theater commander, additional army infantry, combat engineering and Mountain troops were rushed to help the remaining fighting troops. The battle ended soon after as reinforcements arrived and took their positions. With the arrival of the additional mountain troops, the army intensified its search for remaining al-Qaeda fighters. A week later, the Pakistan Army captured the entire mountainous area along with hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters. ==Aftermath== Tunnels were discovered at the site of the battle that led into Afghanistan, possibly the Tora Bora region. The military consolidated its position in the area. On 20 March 2004, the ISI's CAD and Military Intelligence, and a unit of troops reportedly saw a mysterious \\"foreigner\\" fleeing the siege, the Military Intelligence theorized that it may have been Ayman al-Zawahiri, since Uzbek militant Tohir Yuldashev had earlier escaped to Afghanistan while injured in a battle. By 23 March 23, 2004, the last fortified area was taken over by the army troops after a week of combat. Later, the 20th Mountain Brigade of Army took control of the mountains and set up posts. The Army also sent its investigators from \\"M.I. Directorate for High Value Target Acquisition\\". The Army incurred casualties consisting of 17 soldiers killed, 33 wounded, and 11 captured (all of whom were released on March 28, 2004); the military intelligence inflicted on al-Qaeda losses of 55 fighters killed (majority being Uzbeks and Chechens) and 149 captured. The Battle of Wanna also led to the unannounced War in North-West Pakistan. ==See also== *Battle of Tora Bora *Afghan Civil War *Osama bin Laden *War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) *ISI's Covert Action Division *List of drone strikes in Pakistan ==References== Category:Battles of the insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Conflicts in 2004 Wanna Category:Mountain warfare Category:Wars involving the Taliban Category:Waziristan Category:March 2004 events in Asia ","title":"Battle of Wanna"},{"id":"12378558","text":", son of Kanehira, was a court noble (kugyo) of the Kamakura period.

Illustration by Adolph Menzel, 1846 Austria and Prussia were the most powerful principalities in the Holy Roman Empire by the 18th and 19th centuries and had engaged in a struggle for supremacy in Central Europe. Locally known as , the rivalry was characterized by major territorial conflicts, economic, cultural and political contention for sovereign leadership among the German-speaking peoples. Both opponents first met in the Silesian Wars and Seven Years' War during the middle 18th century until the conflict's culmination in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. However, relations were not always hostile, as both countries successfully cooperated during the Napoleonic Wars and the Second Schleswig War. ==Background== Frederick II of Prussia and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor meet at Neisse on 25 August 1769 The Margraviate of Brandenburg was officially declared one of the seven electorates of the Holy Roman Empire by the Golden Bull of 1356. It had extended most of its territory into the eastern Neumark region, and after the War of the J√ºlich succession by the 1614 Treaty of Xanten also gained the Duchy of Cleves as well as the counties of Mark and Ravensberg located in northwestern Germany. It finally grew out of the Imperial borders when in 1618 the Hohenzollern electors became dukes of Prussia, then a fief of the Polish Crown, and the lands of Brandenburg-Prussia were ruled in personal union. In 1653, the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William acquired Farther Pomerania and reached full sovereignty in Ducal Prussia by the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau concluded with the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa. In 1701, Frederick William's son and successor Frederick I reached the consent of Emperor Leopold I to proclaim himself a King \\"in\\" Prussia at K√∂nigsberg, with respect to the fact that he still held the electoral dignity of Brandenburg and the royal title was only valid in the Prussian lands outside the Empire. The centuries-long rise of the Austrian House of Habsburg had already begun with King Rudolph's victory at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld and the final obtainment of the Imperial crown by Emperor Frederick III in 1452. His descendants Maximilian I and Philip the Fair by marriage gained the inheritance of the Burgundian dukes and the Spanish Crown of Castile (tu felix Austria nube), and under Emperor Charles V, the Habsburg realm evolved to a European great power. In 1526 his brother Ferdinand I inherited the Lands of the Bohemian Crown as well as the Kingdom of Hungary outside the borders of the Empire, laying the foundation of the Central European Habsburg Monarchy. From the 15th to the 18th century, all Holy Roman Emperors were Austrian archdukes of the Habsburg dynasty, who also held the Bohemian and Hungarian royal dignity. After the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Habsburgs had to accept the 1555 Peace of Augsburg and failed to strengthen their Imperial authority in the disastrous Thirty Years' War. Upon the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Austria had to deal with the rising Brandenburg-Prussian power in the north, that replaced the Electorate of Saxony as the leading Protestant estate. The efforts made by the \\"Great Elector\\" and the \\"Soldier-king\\" Frederick William I had created a progressive state with a highly effective Prussian Army that, sooner or later, had to collide with the Habsburg claims to power. ==History== Frederick receives homage from the Silesian estates, wall painting by Wilhelm Camphausen, 1882 The rivalry is largely held to have begun when upon the death of the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI in 1740, King Frederick the Great of Prussia launched an invasion of Austrian-controlled Silesia, starting the First Silesian War (of three Silesian Wars to come) against Maria Theresa. Frederick had broken his promise to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and the indivisibility of the Habsburg territories, whereby he sparked off the pan‚ÄìEuropean War of the Austrian Succession. He decisively defeated the Austrian troops at the 1742 Battle of Chotusitz, whereafter Maria Theresa, by the Treaties of Breslau and Berlin, had to cede the bulk of the Silesian lands to Prussia. At the time, Austria still claimed the mantle of the Empire and was the chief force of the disunited German states. Until 1745, Maria Theresa was able to regain the Imperial crown from her Wittelsbach rival Charles VII by occupying his Bavarian lands, but, despite her Quadruple Alliance with Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and Saxony failed to recapture Silesia: The Second Silesian War started with Frederick's invasion into Bohemia in 1744 and after the Prussian victory at the 1745 Battle of Kesselsdorf, by the Treaty of Dresden the status quo ante bellum was confirmed: Frederick kept Silesia but finally acknowledged the accession of Maria Theresa's husband, Emperor Francis I. The terms were again confirmed by the final Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Maria Theresa, still chafing under the loss of the most beautiful gem of my crown, took the opportunity of the breathing space to implement several civil and military reforms within the Austrian lands, like the establishment of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt in 1751. Her capable state chancellor, Prince Wenzel Anton of Kaunitz, succeeded in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, allying with the former Habsburg nemesis France under King Louis XV in order to isolate Prussia. Frederick, however, had completed the \\"stately quadrille\\" by the conclusion of the Treaty of Westminster with Great Britain. He again took action by a preemptive war, invading Saxony and opening a Third Silesian War (and the wider Seven Years' War). Nevertheless, the conquest of Prague failed and moreover, the king had to deal with Russian forces attacking East Prussia while Austrian troops entered Silesia. His situation worsened, when Austrian and Russian forces united to inflict a crushing defeat on him at the 1759 Battle of Kunersdorf. Frederick, on the brink, was saved by the discord among the victors in the \\"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\\", when Empress Elizabeth of Russia died on 5 January 1762 and her successor Peter III concluded peace with Prussia. By the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg, Austria, for the third time, had to acknowledge the Prussian annexations. The usurper kingdom had prevailed against the European great powers and would play a vital future role in the \\"Concert of Europe\\". Austria and Prussia both would fight France in the Napoleonic Wars; after their conclusion, the German states were reorganized into a more unified 37 separate states of the German Confederation. German nationalists began to demand a unified Germany, especially by 1848 and its revolutions. They were conflicted over the best nation-state to accomplish this, a question that became known as the German question. The \\"Little Germany\\" (Kleindeutschland) solution favored Protestant Prussia annexing all the German states except Austria, while \\"Big Germany\\" (Grossdeutschland) favored Catholic Austria taking control of the separate German states. The Schleswig-Holstein Question also became tied up in the debate; the Second Schleswig War saw Denmark lose to the combined forces of Austria and Prussia, but Prussia would later gain full control of the province after the Austro-Prussian War, thus saw Austria being excluded from Germany. After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany was unified under Prussia to become the German Empire in 1871, and the rivalry is often seen as subsiding after the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Germany, led by Prussia, had become the superior power to Austria-Hungary. ==See also== * German question * War of the Austrian Succession * War of the Bavarian Succession * F√ºrstenbund * German confederation * Erfurt Union * Punctation of Olm√ºtz * Austro-Prussian War * Unification of Germany ==References== Category:18th century in Germany Category:19th century in Germany Category:18th century in the Habsburg Monarchy Category:Austrian Empire Category:Geopolitical rivalry Category:Foreign relations of Prussia Rivalry Category:19th century in the Habsburg Monarchy Category:History of Central Europe ","title":"Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry"},{"id":"12378584","text":"Joseph Fawcett (c. 1758 ‚Äì 24 January 1804) was an 18th-century English Presbyterian minister and poet. Fawcett began his education at Reverend French's school in Ware, Hertfordshire and in 1774 entered the dissenting academy at Daventry. At the school, he practiced his preaching on thorn bushes. In 1780 Fawcett was called to be the morning preacher at Marsh Street Presbyterian Chapel in Walthamstow, east of London. His adoption of Unitarianism led to a schism in the congregation and he resigned in 1787. On 23 September 1782, Fawcett married the daughter of his schoolteacher, Charlotte French. In 1785 he began a series of Sunday evening lectures at the Old Jewry meeting house in the City of London. This series established Fawcett as one of the most popular Dissenting preachers of the time. He supposedly drew \\"the largest and most genteel London audience that ever assembled in a dissenting place of worship\\".Monthly Repository (1817), 90. He appealed to a broad audience, including Anglicans, actors such as Sarah Siddons and the Kembles.Duncan Wu, William Hazlitt: the First Modern Man (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 57-8. William Wordsworth was taken to hear Fawcett by his London friend, Samuel Nicholson. Wordsworth admired his sermons, bur felt that Fawcett was unstable, and is said to have modelled the \\"Solitary\\" in his poem \\"The Excursion\\" after him.Wu 2008, pp. 58, 169. In 1795 Fawcett abandoned his preaching and leased a farm called Edge Grove near Aldenham, Hertfordshire. In the late 1790s he published a series of poems opposing Britain's war with France. These were much lauded; Joseph Priestley wrote that his The Art of War revealed \\"a most exuberant imagination ... some parts are very affecting\\".Priestley, Joseph. Theological and Miscellaneous Works. 1/2.323. Fawcett associated with other reformers, such as William Godwin and William Hazlitt. Godwin and Fawcett met in 1778 at Ware and remained friends for their entire lives. Godwin wrote that he was the most important of the \\"four principal instructors\\". Hazlitt wrote \\"with him I passed some of the pleasantest days of my life. The conversation ... of taste and philosophy gave me a delight such as I can never feel again ... he was the person of the most refined and least contracted taste I ever knew\\".Hazlitt, William. Complete Works. 8.224. Unlike many of his time, Fawcett was an open republican.White, Daniel E. (2006). Early Romanticism and religious dissent. Cambridge University Press, p. 93 Fawcett died in 1804 and was buried in Aldenham churchyard.Ruston, Alan. \\"Joseph Fawcett\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

The older Commune of Venice, was replaced by the Signoria from 1423 on, being later officially adopted in the Promissione Ducale by Cristoforo Moro (12 May 1462). It constituted a center of power which included the doge's power. The Signoria can be thought of as the combination of the Doge and the other persons commissioned to collaborate and to rule with him. With the passage of time these functionaries became copartners. The governmental structure of the Venetian Republic == The members of the Signoria of Venice == The Signoria of Venice consisted of: * the Doge, head of the Republic * the Minor Council (Minor Consiglio), created in 1175, which was composed of the 6 advisors of the Doge. * the 3 leaders of the Quarantia, the supreme tribunal, created in 1179. The Doge (from Latin dux - leader) was the chief magistrate in the republics of Venice (until 1797) and Genoa (until 1805). The Signoria was considered a very important body of government, more important than the Doge himself.

On the death of his father in 1915 during service with the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War I, he was elected in his place (opposed by two nationalist contenders) as Irish Parliamentary Party MP for North Tipperary while also serving in the war with the Leinster Regiment, then as Captain with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers with the Intelligence Corps. He was an engineer.Thom's Directory, 1918 ==World War I service== He was one of five Irish MPs who served with Irish regiments in World War I, the others Stephen Gwynn, Willie Redmond, William Redmond and D. D. Sheehan as well as former MP Tom Kettle. John Lymbrick Esmonde served with the forces that put down the Easter Rising. ==Political career== He did not defend his seat at the 1918 general election. He inherited the Esmonde Baronetcy when the senior male line died out in 1943. He subsequently served as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Wexford constituency, where he won a seat at the 1937 general election. He was re-elected at the 1938 and 1943 elections, but lost his D√°il seat at the 1944 general election. He became a barrister at the King's Inns, Dublin, called to the inner bar as Senior Counsel in 1942, and Bencher in 1948. He was re-elected as a TD for Wexford at the 1948 general election serving until the 1951 general election, when he retired from politics. In 1948 he was suggested as possible Taoiseach by Se√°n MacBride, on the grounds that he had no link to either side in the Civil War.Patrick Maume, The Long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891-1918, pp. 153, 227, (1999) He was one of the few people who served as a Members of Parliament in the House of Commons as well as a Teachta D√°la of D√°il √âireann, the lower House of the Irish parliament. ==Notable family== His younger brother Lt. Geoffrey Esmonde (1897‚Äì1916) aged 19 was killed in action in World War I serving with the 4th Tyneside Irish Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers. His second younger brother was Sir Anthony Esmonde, 15th Baronet (1899‚Äì1981). His half-brother Eugene Esmonde was awarded a Victoria Cross posthumously in 1942 during World War II. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==ReferencesExternal links== *Esmonde Family Tree *Department of the Taoiseach: Irish Soldiers in the First World War *Hansard: Contributions in parliament of John Esmonde Category:1893 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Irish barristers Category:Irish farmers Category:Irish Parliamentary Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1910‚Äì1918 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Tipperary constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) Category:Fine Gael TDs Category:Members of the 9th D√°il Category:Members of the 10th D√°il Category:Members of the 11th D√°il Category:Members of the 13th D√°il Category:Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment officers Category:Royal Dublin Fusiliers officers Category:Irish people of World War I Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland Category:Politicians from County Wexford John Category:Alumni of King's Inns ","title":"Sir John Esmonde, 14th Baronet"},{"id":"12378673","text":"was a court noble (kuge) of the early Edo period.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and featuring The Three Bears. The short was released on December 10, 1949, and stars the Three Bears. ==Plot== The cartoon begins with the Narrator introducing the three bears Papa Bear, Mama Bear And Junyer Bear. Junyer Bear is reading a Bugs Bunny comic on Papa Bear's newspaper and begins tickling him. Papa Bear manages to punch Junyer and slaps him in the face hard causing Junyer Bear to land on his bowl of oatmeal. Papa Bear then yells him \\"Eat your oatmeal!\\" and continues reading his newspaper. Junyer Bear cries with oatmeal on his face remarking \\"Pop! What I do?! What I do?!\\". Papa Bear notices something in the newspaper saying, \\"Wanted Trick bear act, Apply at Mingling Bros. Circus\\" and tells Mama and Junyer about it telling to need a little practice. Mama Bear tries to protest but Papa Bear yells, \\"Shut up and let's get going\\". Junyer is delighted and wants to be a trick bear act and grabs him and makes Henry spin like a beach ball. Mama Bear, who at first was hesitant, joins in singing wearing a sport outfit and Junyer Bear lands Papa bear on Mama Bear's finger still upside down. He tries to punch her but misses, (or stopped himself from punching her) spins and makes an angry face at Junyer knowing it's really his fault, so Papa kicks him in the butt and he shakes in rage. Papa Bear and Junyer Bear practice uni-cycling on a string which they tied on two trees. As they start pedaling their unicycles, Junyer's heavy weight makes them fall on the ground and bump into each other. Papa Bear yells him to get off the wire and calls him an \\"oversized freep head\\" which causes Junyer to get off the string sending Papa bear into the air with Junyer chasing him, telling he be a good bear and will not do bad and Papa Bear lands into their fireplace blackening him and he dazedly pedals towards Junyer. Junyer asks him if he's all right. Papa bear tries to punch him but he slips and falls on the floor before fainting with a shocked Junyer looking on. They proceed on the next act to swing and grab the next swing. Junyer does not grab Papa Bear until Papa screams \\"Grab me stupid!\\" which causes Junyer to pick him but falls to the ground as Papa Bear screams to let go of him, to which Junyer sends him into the branch knocking him out. Papa Bear is ready to make a hit on the white circle gong which is held by Mama Bear. Junyer sees this while eating cheese and is ready to hit only to crash each other. Junyer has his head on the board which reads \\"Hit my Baby son 25 cents for 3 shots\\", Papa bear throws a baseball at Junyer but it bounces back and hits him, which in turn, knocks him out. Mama Bear carries a couch chair for Papa Bear to land on and Junyer acts to land on the seesaw to send him into the air to land on the couch but he sends him into the sky and into outer space. They return to their house, giving the impression that Henry died after being sent into the air. The next day, they proceed to return to the exact spots they were at the previous day after Henry was launched, with Mama Bear holding the couch waiting for Papa Bear to land on, but he misses the couch and lands on the ground instead. The next activity is a high diving act. Mama Bear begins playing the drums and Papa Bears dives to the pail of water. However, Junyer steps in eating salt crackers and drinks the pail of water making Papa Bear land on the empty pail. Junyer realizes this what he has done and calls Mama Bear to call for a doctor. Papa Bear proceeds the motorcycle race with Mama Bear holding the finish flag and asks her if she is ready and she replies and Papa Bear starts his motorcycle. Mama Bear swings the flag and watches the race. However, Junyer is eating a banana and throws the banana peel onto the track, causing Papa Bear to crash his motorcycle, injuring him (off screen). Papa Bear wakes up covered in bandages, and thinking that he and his family are ready as they'll ever be asks where the newspaper is. Mama Bear hands it to him and tries to protest, only to be silenced when he yells at her to shut up. Henry proceeds to check the address on the circus ad, but finds out that the newspaper was printed on April 16, 1928 and realizes that they are 21 years too late, because their calendar said August 1, 1949. Junyer jumps to Mama Bear in fear. Mama Bear says she tried to tell Henry. Papa Bear gets upset because he figures out that they have been practicing all for nothing. Unable to accept the reality of his blunder, he questions why he has such an abnormal family. He could not take anymore being a family and decided to escape his house and throws himself off a cliff. However, he lands in a pail of water set by Junyer, who tells him that he done a good thing, resulting in Papa Bear punching him which sends Junyer crying and remarking \\"What I do?! What I do?!\\" as the cartoon comes to an end. ==Availability== Bear Feat is available uncut and restored on Disc 1 of Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1949 films Category:1949 animated films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Short films directed by Chuck Jones Category:1940s American animated films Category:Warner Bros. short films Category:Warner Bros.

Some sources give his birth name as Rudolf (\\"Rudi\\") Spitzer. Rezs≈ë Seress lived most of his life in poverty in Budapest, from where, being Jewish, he was taken to a labor camp by the Nazis during the Second World War. He survived the camp and after employment in the theatre and the circus, where he was a trapeze artist, he concentrated on songwriting and singing after an injury. Seress taught himself to play the piano with only one hand. He composed many songs, including Fizetek f≈ë√∫r (Waiter, bring me the bill), √ân √∫gy szeretek r√©szeg lenni (I love being drunk), and a song for the Hungarian Communist Party to commemorate the chain bridge crossing the river in Budapest, √öjra a L√°nch√≠don. His most famous composition is Szomor√∫ Vas√°rnap (\\"Gloomy Sunday\\"), written in 1933, which gained infamy as it became associated with a spate of suicides. Seress felt a strong loyalty to Hungary, and one reason for his poverty while having a world-famous song was that he never wished to go to the USA to collect his royalties; instead, staying as pianist at the Kispipa restaurant in his home town. This restaurant had a pipe stove at the centre of its dining room, and was remarkably cold for a restaurant. The place was a favourite of prostitutes, musicians, Bohemian spirits and the Jewish working class. As his fame began to wane, along with his loyalty to the communist party, Seress plunged into depression. Though he himself survived the Nazi forced labour in the Ukraine, his mother didn't- which increased his gloom. Seress committed suicide in Budapest in January 1968; he survived jumping out of a window, but later in the hospital choked himself to death with a wire. His obituary in The New York Times mentions the notorious reputation of \\"Gloomy Sunday\\": ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1899 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Composers who committed suicide Category:Hungarian composers Category:Hungarian male composers Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Hungarian pianists Category:Male suicides Category:Musicians from Budapest Category:Suicides by jumping in Hungary Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century pianists Category:Male pianists Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Rezs≈ë Seress"},{"id":"12378745","text":"Ef is a post-rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden.

Born in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, USA, he was the son of Martin Zborowski (or Zabriskie) and Emma Morris. In 1892 he married a wealthy American heiress, born Margaret Laura Astor Carey (1853‚Äì1911), a granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. of the prominent Astor family. She had been Madame de Stuers before her divorce from Alphonse Lambert Eug√®ne, Chevalier de Stuers (1841-1919). They were the parents of the racing driver Louis Zborowski. ==Early life and a change of name== Martin Zabriskie, Eliot‚Äôs father, left the country for the first time in his life in 1873, when he crossed the Atlantic to Paris with his family to be at the wedding of his daughter Anna to Count Charles de Montalbon, Baron de Fontenoy. The aristocratic world he saw in France made a deep impression and he thought back to stories passed down in the family; the first result of which was, he changed the spelling of his name to Zborowski. Martin‚Äôs brother, Christopher, did not follow suit. Martin‚Äôs son William Eliot, now had a countess for a sister. Following his father‚Äôs death in 1878, William Eliot returned from Europe to take possession of his inherited fortune. He also adopted his second name, and discarded William. Part of his inheritance was extensive estates near Central Park and along the banks of the Hudson River. He was indescribably rich. Around this time, when Eliot recrossed to Europe, he called himself Count Eliot Zborowski. An unattributed back-story also began of being descended from the marriage of an American girl to a Polish count. Eliot was reported to have said that he adopted the title Count on his father's death in deference to the wishes of his grandfather (Andrew Christian Zabriskie). All that can be said now about the origin of the title is that in the contents of Martin Zborowski‚Äôs will in The New York Times there was no mention of it. == Inherited wealth brings marriage and a broader horizon == Horses were a passion for Eliot, and since his childhood he had a fine stable. He was an excellent rider and enjoyed the challenge of lengthy rides across rough country. Occasionally his daring left him injured, but it was all part of living life to the fullest. In 1885, having heard about hunting in England, he visited, was welcomed with enthusiasm, and was soon riding with the Quorn. His title seems to have been accepted from the first. Eliot quickly learnt the rules as he hunted and soon became known as someone well to the fore when a tall fence or broad ditch needed clearing. It also became accepted that his riding employed superb hand control. Something attributed to the Count was the tradition of tying a red ribbon at the base of a horse's tail, to distinguish it as a kicker. Many kept hunting boxes in Melton Mowbray, and Zborowski looked around for somewhere suitable. With a hunting box nearby one could be fully immersed in this society. His attention was drawn to Coventry Lodge, which had good stabling and was owned by Sir Fredric Johnstone, a close friend of the Prince of Wales. Put on the market in 1881, Johnstone must have been relieved when in 1886, the Count became its new owner. Being very close to the station it was extremely convenient for someone always restlessly on the move. Still regularly crossing the Atlantic, Eliot did so in the Spring of 1888 for part holiday, part business. After resolving the demands of business, he played polo, and found himself in a game reported as rough and bad-tempered. His injuries kept him off a horse for the rest of the summer. Holidaying in Newport, he met Margaret de Stuers (n√©e Margaret Laura Astor Carey), aged 35 and who was already married, but unhappily. At first the friendship was platonic, and in September, Eliot returned to Britain. The New Year of 1890 found him back in America, where he again met Margaret. From this meeting, things became more serious and the end result was a very messy divorce in 1892.San Francisco Call Newspaper 29 March 1892 http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi- bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=SFC18920329.2.42&srpos;=&e;=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN------- Their New England friends disapproved of their behaviour, which ultimately meant they spent even more time in Britain, where few in their hunting set were troubled by the Countess being a divorcee. They resided in Melton Mowbray and he became a naturalised British citizen. Such was the popularity of the couple, the Prince of Wales often stayed at Coventry House. Their first child was born in 1893, but regrettably died soon after and was buried at Burton Lazars. In February 1895 a second son was born, Louis, and this time the child was more healthy. Eliot had by now altered his business life such that he would not need to return to America very much, and he rented and bought property in London for after the hunting season ended. == The midnight steeplechase == Monday 10 March 1890, The Old Club, Burton St., Melton MowbrayThe Midnight Steeplechase Part 1 (David Bowles and Gillian Lane) http://local-history.org.uk/waltham/pages/local-history/midnight-steeplechase/ The Midnight Steeplechase Part 2 (David Bowles and Gillian Lane) http://local- history.org.uk/waltham/pages/local-history/midnight-steeplechase-2/ Lady Augusta Fane looked around the room at the 25 people dining with her, the men in red dining coats and white breeches. The hunting set. Latecomers stood around the walls, chatting quietly. It was her birthday and she was now 33 and attractive. Everyone there was drawn by the thought of an exciting and different evening ahead. Last Friday the conversation had drifted around to the fact of her coming birthday. Augusta was pressed to choose a way of their celebrating this event with something novel ‚Äì and fun. It was to be a full moon that Monday, so she suggested a Moonlight Steeplechase. The idea was immediately seized upon and an outline of what was needed was decided. At about 9.30 a message was sent into the room that the sky had become overcast and clouds obscured the moon. This was a setback, but there was no thought of cancelling the event. Colonel Baldock slipped down to the Midland Railway‚Äôs station at the bottom of the street, having called for the stationmaster Mr Beddington on the way. Here they borrowed a horse-drawn van, and with the help of a porter, a number of the station‚Äôs lamps were loaded inside. Off they all went to the proposed course, and hung a lamp at each end of every fence. A further lamp was hung high in the tree at the homeward turn. Eleven riders prepared for the coming race, and it was perhaps again concerns for visibility that caused them to decide to ride wearing nightshirts. For those who were wintering at the Bell Hotel, Colonel Wilson, Algy Burnaby of Baggrave, and Colonel Hill Trevor, and those who lived locally, this was simply resolved, but for those who lived further out, they had to borrow something. One rider struggled into a pink gossamer item donated by Lady Augusta. It had been resolved that the event would be carried out in secret, but it was a vain hope. As the time approached the lanes all around were alive with people, carts and carriages. A hum of excited chatter got stronger as the time approached. When 11.30 came, a horn was blown and the riders gathered at the start, and away they went, the riders‚Äô nightshirts helping the spectators pick out where they were. After the turn, the riders rode hard for the finish. One, Count Eliot Zborowski, an American, was neck and neck with Algy Burnaby. A stumble by the other horse let Burnaby through and the Count had to settle for second place. After the excitement, all the riders, and their friends, joined Augusta at Coventry House, the Zborowski home in Melton Mowbray for a ‚Äòsplendid supper party‚Äô. Algy Burnaby was presented with a silver mounted ivory cup donated by the Count, and although Zborowski must have half hoped he would win it himself, there were no hard feelings ‚Äì it had been an exceptional night that would be remembered for decades. The following Sunday, the Vicar of Melton chose as his text for a sermon, Ephesians 5:11 ‚ÄòHave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them‚Äô. After discussion it was decided not to take him to task over the matter, as he was thought to have already made a sufficient fool of himself. And despite all, that room- full of 25 had written an entry in Melton‚Äôs history ‚Äì the night of the Midnight Steeplechase. ==A Change of direction, cars== Eliot Zborowski's destroyed Mercedes In 1898, following a friend‚Äôs motorised visit, Eliot bought a de Dion Tricycle and learnt how to drive and maintain it. Driving became a new passion and he covered 5,000 miles in 4 months. His wife Margaret, thought he should have a real car and not just a single-seater tricycle and Eliot agreed. Most cars and all innovation seemed to be coming from Germany, so that was where he looked. Daimler‚Äôs were at Canstatt, where the Zborowskis visited the works, choosing a Phoenix model. This was delivered to them at their London home, in January 1900. The Count immediately decided that he would drive to Coventry House, which he did, garaging his vehicle in an empty stable. A few weeks later there was a dinner-party at his house in which all the men had something in common: they owned a motor car. After dinner, the Count surprised the party when he announced that all his horses were to go as he had lost interest in them. He was an all round sportsman but particularly liked Mercedes racing cars. Eliot Zborowski was killed when his car crashed during the La Turbie hill climb in 1903; his riding mechanic, the Marquis of Pollange, was thrown clear and survived. His son Louis Zborowski was also killed at the Italian Grand Prix in 1924.

He was interned during the Second World War because of his fascist associations and appealed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords against his detention. In the leading case of Liversidge v. Anderson the Law Lords declined to interfere with ministerial discretion on matters of national security and thus refused to review his detention. ==Early life== Greene was born in Brazil to a mother who had been born a German national, but moved with his family to England as a child, in 1908. He attended Berkhamsted School, where his uncle, Charles Greene, was headmaster and where his cousins, Graham Greene and Hugh Greene, were also pupils. He went up to Wadham College, Oxford, but became committed to the causes of the Labour Party and the Society of Friends (Quakers), and left without graduating. Until 1923 he worked with the Society of Friends, the Save the Children Fund and the American Relief Administration in humanitarian work in Eastern Europe.Simpson (1992) p. 341. Greene was motivated to get involved in politics almost solely by his belief in pacifism.Simpson (1992) p. 342. He returned to London and during the 1923 United Kingdom general election he worked for Clement Attlee in the Limehouse constituency, where he met John Beckett. In 1924 Greene joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and soon became its liaison with Ramsay MacDonald. He fought Basingstoke in the 1924 United Kingdom general election, but without success. He often felt that Labour Party policies were at odds with his pacifism. Greene got married in 1925 and became a businessman, in England and abroad, while serving on Berkhamsted Urban District Council and on Hertfordshire County Council, and becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1937. He unsuccessfully contested Gravesend against Irving Albery in 1931 and 1935. He also continued with human rights work in the Saar and Germany. By 1938 he had become disillusioned with the Labour Party, perceiving it as being in the grip of Communists, and resigned from it. ==Fascist friends== Shocked by conditions in Germany, Greene formed the idea that Britain should co-operate with Nazi officials in order to facilitate the emigration of as many threatened Germans as possible. However, he fell under the influence of an English-born Nazi diplomat, Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, who was all too ready to exploit his naivety. Greene briefly joined the Peace Pledge Union, and started the Peace and Progress Information Service (PPIS) to publish information provided to him by Bohle. Greene tried to connect with anyone who was opposed to war, including fascists, and even joined the British Peoples Party (BPP), becoming its treasurer.Simpson (1992) p. 343. In December 1939 Greene ghosted The Truth About the War for the BPP. Attlee saw a copy, and was shocked by its \\"pro-Hitler\\" tone and its claims that the Poles had been the authors of their own misfortunes.Simpson (1992) p. 344. Greene was a frequent speaker at anti-war meetings, and spoke of the \\"danger of Jewish and American capitalists\\".Simpson (1992) p. 345. ==Detention== In early 1940 Lord Hampden, in his capacity as Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire, approached Maxwell Knight of MI5 and questioned Greene's suitability as a JP. Knight felt that he had no evidence on which to seek the removal of Greene from the post. At the same time Vernon Kell was calling for action against the BPP, in particular for Greene and Beckett's internment under Defence Regulation 18B. The order to detain Greene because of his \\"hostile associations\\" was signed on 22 May 1940 and Greene was arrested on 24 May.Simpson (1992) p. 346. The \\"Reasons for Order\\" cited Greene's membership of the BPP and the British Council for Christian Settlement in Europe, the content of his speeches, his association with Beckett, and his communications with the German government. It also alleged that he desired to establish a National Socialist regime with the assistance of the German Army and had harboured German agents.Simpson (1992) p. 347. The more specific \\"Statement of Case\\" revealed that these allegations had been made by Harold Kurtz.Simpson (1992) p. 348. Kurtz was an MI5 agent who posed as a National Socialist German agent recently released from internment in Britain. Kurtz entrapped Greene with another MI5 agent, Gaertner, as witness, and alleged that Greene had helped him to avoid further internment and clandestinely communicate with Germany, and had told him ways of leaving the country undetected. Kurtz also claimed that Greene had told him that there were \\"men in this country ready to take over the government after a German victory, men trained in and filled with the proper spirit of National Socialism‚Äîa British National Socialism\\".Simpson (1992) p. 348. Greene denied these allegations and claimed that he had reported Kurtz's suspicious behaviour to the police. The police denied Greene's claim.Simpson (1992) p. 349. ==First hearing of the Advisory Committee== Greene challenged his detention at the Advisory Committee headed by A. T. Miller on 24 July. Though the committee was anxious to hear from the MI5 agents who had provided statements, MI5 refused to allow them to attend and the committee accepted the statements as \\"substantially accurate\\". Greene's detention was confirmed.Simpson (1992) pp. 349‚Äì351. The Lord Chancellor's Department was advised and Greene was informed on 10 October of the intention to remove him as a JP, though he was offered the face-saving alternative of resignation. Greene was removed as a JP on 8 November.Simpson (1992) pp. 351‚Äì352. ==Greene's appeal== Greene's brother Edmund sought legal advice from Oswald Hickson, who had been active in internment cases from a liberal rather than a fascist motive. Hickson wrote to the Advisory Committee to protest that the \\"Reasons for Order\\" gave no particulars of the persons who had made the allegations against Greene. The committee spurned Hickson's approach, so he applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The application was heard by the Divisional Court on 21 May 1941. Greene represented himself.Simpson (1992) p. 357. The court dismissed Greene's application, but expressed concern about the technical errors in the drafting of the detention order and criticised the Home Secretary. It also suggested a rehearing of Greene's case.Simpson (1992) p. 360. Greene appealed to the Court of Appeal while the Home Office reissued the order and the \\"Reasons\\", naming Kurtz and Gaertner as the sources of the allegations.Simpson (1992) p. 361. The appeal was heard by Lords Justice of Appeal Scott, MacKinnon and Goddard on 15 to 16 July. They rejected the appeal on 30 July.Simpson (1992) p. 361. Scott delivered the judgment of the court.R v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Greene [1942] 1 KB 87 The court ruled that it was not able to question the discretion of the Home Secretary, honestly exercised.Simpson (1992) pp. 361‚Äì362. Greene appealed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords and his case was joined with that of another detainee, Robert Liversidge. The case was heard as Liversidge v. Anderson and the decision of the Court of Appeal was upheld on 3 November.Simpson (1992) pp. 362‚Äì363. ==Second hearing of the Advisory Committee== A second hearing by the Advisory Committee was convened in November. The committee rejected Kurtz's allegations, as having been discredited, and accepted Greene's undertaking not to hinder the war effort and to avoid contact with Beckett and Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford. Greene's detention order was revoked on 9 January 1942.Simpson (1992) pp. 367‚Äì370. ==A remedy for Greene== Greene sued for damages for libel and for false imprisonment. The purported libel was in the \\"Reasons for Order\\", a document protected by privilege, and to succeed in his claim for false imprisonment Greene would have to have proved that the Home Secretary made the detention order with no honest belief in the facts stated in it.Simpson (1992) p. 372. Hickson withdrew the action before the final judgment and costs of ¬£1,243 were awarded against Greene. Though proceedings were started to bankrupt Greene, these were never brought to court.Simpson (1992) p. 375. ==Later life== Greene continued to be involved in right-wing politics. He left the BPP to form the English Nationalist Association. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:1901 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Members of Hertfordshire County Council Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:English pacifists Category:People educated at Berkhamsted School Category:People detained under Defence Regulation 18B Category:English people of German descent Category:English nationalists ","title":"Ben Greene"},{"id":"12378809","text":"Nikolay Pavlov (; born 12 November 1987 in Plovdiv) is a Bulgarian footballer who plays as a midfielder and forward. ==Career== Born in Plovdiv, Pavlov started his career with local side Spartak Plovdiv.

Gallagher (November 24, 1897 in Faribault, Minnesota ‚Äì March 3, 1985) was a Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1943 until his retirement in 1967. He attended St. Thomas Academy, then located in Saint Paul, Minnesota (1912‚Äì1914) but graduated from Faribault High School in 1915 (it is not clear why he left St. Thomas). He earned his B.A. in 1919 from the University of Minnesota after having interrupted his schooling in 1918 to serve as a commissioned officer in the United States Field Artillery. In 1921 he was graduated from the University of Minnesota Law School with an LL.B.. He practiced law in Minneapolis from 1921 until 1942, at first with his cousin, John E. Tappan, the founder of Investors Diversified Services, Inc. (\\"IDS,\\" then called the Investors Syndicate). In 1929, Judge Gallagher opened his own law office in Minneapolis, where he practiced until 1942. In 1936, Judge Gallagher was the Democratic Party's candidate for the office of Attorney General. He led the Minnesota campaign for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking from a sound truck-trailer on street corners in more than 400 Minnesota villages, towns and cities. In 1938, he was the Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of Minnesota. This was prior to the merger of the Democratic and Farmer Labor parties, now known as the DFL. The Farmer-Labor, and Republican Party candidates received a higher percentage of the vote, than the Democratic candidates for most statewide offices at the time. In 1939 and 1940 Gallagher led a drive promoting the merger of the two parties. Judge Gallagher promoted the ideas and platform of the national Democratic Party, but also was one of the first to espouse merger of the two liberal state political parties. In 1940 he served as Minnesota delegate at large at the Democratic national convention in Chicago. The Minnesota Democratic Party and the Farmer‚ÄìLabor Party did eventually merge on April 15, 1944. Shortly before he died, Franklin D. Roosevelt had appointed Judge Gallagher to serve on the United States District Court, but U.S. Senator Joseph H. Ball, blocked the appointment. Senator Ball was a political ally of fellow Republican Harold Stassen, and disapproved of the domestic policies of F.D.R. and his successor, Harry S. Truman. Thomas Francis Gallagher was elected as an Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1943, and re-elected thereafter until his retirement in 1967. During his twenty-four years on the Court, Judge Gallagher participated in more than 4,000 decisions and personally wrote over 600 majority and dissenting opinions. Judge Gallagher's work on the Court received praise from many. Professor Brainerd Currie of Duke University Law School wrote that Justices Thomas Gallagher, Harlan Stone, Robert H. Jackson and Roger Traynor were \\"among the modern Justices whose work has contributed to the enlightenment and to the cause of justice and reason in the conflict of laws.\\" (13 Stanford Law Review 719.) Judge Gallagher's opinions are regarded by many members of the Minnesota bar as notable for their clarity and brevity. Judge Gallagher also took pride in mentoring his law clerks to think and write clearly. His law clerks who later obtained prominence include Harry M. Walsh, Minnesota Revisor of Statutes, and Walter F. Mondale, Vice President of the United States. When the Court was in recess, Judge Gallagher served on Presidential Emergency Boards created by President Harry S. Truman to avert railway strikes. He served as President of the Minnesota Safety Council for seven years. In 1948, he was Chairman of the Minnesota Branch of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He was active in the American Legion, serving as Commander of Downtown Post 335, and as Judge Advocate for its Fifth District. Each year, he conducted panels for Legion-sponsored \\"Boys' State,\\" in which he outlined for the young delegates the structure, procedure and jurisdiction of the state and federal courts. In 1962, he served as President of the University of Minnesota Law School Alumni Association. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Minnesota State Law Library Biographies of Justices and Judges of the Minnesota Appellate Courts - Category:1897 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Faribault, Minnesota Category:Justices of the Minnesota Supreme Court Category:American jurists Category:Minnesota lawyers Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Minnesota Law School alumni Category:20th-century American judges ","title":"Thomas F.

The map is faced eastwards, and not northwards, as usual in modern cartography. For this reason it is said that the map is oriented.The manuscript was executed ca. 1050 under the orders of the abbot, Gregori de Montaner The Beatus Map or Beatine Map is one of the most significant cartographic works of the European Early Middle Ages: It was originally drawn by the Spanish monk Beatus of Li√©bana, based on the accounts given by Saint Isidore of Seville, Ptolemy and the Holy Bible. Although the original manuscript is lost, there remain several copies extant, which retain a high fidelity with respect the original. The Map is shown in the prologue of the second book of Beatus' work Commentary on the Apocalypse. Its main goal is not to depict a cartographically exact depiction of the world and its continents, but to illustrate the primitive Diaspora of the Apostles. ==The European World View in the High Middle Ages== According to the descriptions from the Book of Genesis (which was one of the main sources for Beatus), the Earth was thought to be a flat plane, and sustained the vault of heaven, where the Sun, the Moon, and other minor luminaries like planets and stars, moved. There were two water masses. The waters above the firmament were contained by the vault of heaven and occasionally fell to Earth in as rain, when the floodgates opened. The waters below, fed the rivers, the streams and the great salt water masses. This image of The Garden of Earthly Delights illustrates the Hebrew Weltanschauung which is reflected in the book of Genesis. The Earth is a disc surrounded by two water masses: the upper waters, which occasionally fall to earth in form of rain when YHVH opens the floodgates of Heaven, and the lower waters, formed by the seas, the lakes and the Ocean. In the depths of the Cosmic Sphere lay the sheol, dwelling of the dead until the Judgement Day.In this mappa mundi, the world is represented as a circular disc surrounded by the Ocean. The Earth is divided in three continents: Asia (upper semicircle), Africa (right lower quadrant) and Europe (left lower quadrant), each of which belonged to the descendants of the three sons of Noah: Shem, Ham and Japheth. The continents are separated by water streams and inner seas, including the Mediterranean Sea (Europe-Africa), the River Nile (Africa-Asia), the Bosporus, and the Aegeus Sea (Europe-Asia). In the center of the world lies Jerusalem, sacred to both Christianity and Judaism. This is where Abraham was about to sacrifice his own son, Isaac, and where the Passion and Resurrection of the Christ happened. The concept of Jerusalem as an ombilicum mundi was typical in medieval Christian theology. For example, in the Divine Comedy, Dante starts his journey to Hell from here. ==The description of the continents== Asia This illustration, from the calendar page of the book The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry, shows Adam and Eve being expelled from the earthly Paradise. During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the Garden of Eden was located at the eastern end of the world, and it was possible, in theory, to reach it. Columbus attempted it.At the eastern end of Asia lies the Garden of Eden, the earthly paradise where it is never cold nor hot, and where trees and wood of all kinds grow. In its center stands the Tree of Life, and next to it, a fountain from which the four rivers of Paradise: Tigris, Euphrates, Pishon and Gihon flow. The entrance to Paradise is protected by a Cherub, who brandishes a sword of fire. On the south coast of the Asian continent is India, an enormous territory traversed by three rivers, the Indus, Ganges and Hipane. It has an abundance of dark-skinned people, elephants, rhinoceroses, spices, and precious stones, such as rubies, emeralds or diamonds. The fields are blessed by the west wind, Favonio, and for that reason they yield two harvests a year. There are the Mountains of Gold, access to which is denied to humans by griffins and dragons. Off the Indian coast are the islands of Taprobane (Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon), abundant with gems and elephants, Chrysa and Argyre, rich in gold and silver, and Tyle, where trees never lose their leaves (it has been speculated that this is an island in Indonesia). To the west of India one finds Parthia, a region that extends between the rivers Indus and Tigris. It is divided into five different provinces. Parthia proper, so called by the Parthians, brave soldiers from Scythia who founded an empire that was on an equal footing with Rome. Assyria, named after Asshur, the son of Shem, was famous for its purple dyes and all types of perfumes and ointments, where Nineveh, the capital of the old empire of the Assyrians is located, and where Jonas the prophet went to preach futilely. Medes (northwest Iran), which is divided in two parts, Greater Medes (Hamadan, Kermanshahan, Qazvin, Tehran and Espahan) and Smaller Medes (Azarbaijan). Finally there is Persia, birthplace of King Cyrus, the anointed one of God, and the region where magical science arose for the first time, introduced by Nebroth the giant, after the confusion of languages had emerged in Babel. Abrahamic tradition makes Ur of Caldea the mother country of the patriarch alt=Mesopotamia is the region located between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. There we find the regions of Babylon and Chaldea. Babylon was the ancient conqueror of the kingdom of Judah and the place where the Jewish people were exiled. In that city the revelations of the prophet Ezekiel took place, which had much influence on the creation of the Prophetic Chronicle. From Chaldea (South of Mesopotamia), the Asturian Chronicles supposed, came the hordes that invaded Spain and were defeated by Pelayo in Covadonga. The most important cities of this region include Ur, the birthplace of the patriarch Abraham, as well as Erech (or Uruk), which was founded by Enoch. To the south of the River Euphrates, and Sinus Persicum (Persian Gulf), Arabia was located, a desert region whose southern part (present-day Yemen) received the name of Arabia Felix, Happy Arabia. It was a rich, fertile land where precious stones, myrrh and incense abounded. In it lived the fabulous Phoenix, a bird, which after dying surrounded by fire, was reborn of its ashes. On the northeast border of Arabia, already in territories of the old Roman Empire, extended the province of Syria, whose limits were the Caucasus and Taurus Mountains to the north, the River Euphrates to the east, the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt to the west, and Arabia to the south. Syria had three different provinces: Comagena, Phoenicia, and Palestine. The territory of Phoenicia extended from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Lebanon and the sea of Tiberiades. Phoenicia contained the famous cities of Sidon and Tyre. In the latter they believed the prophet Elias was Jesus Christ. Further south was Palestine, which was subdivided into four different provinces: Galilee, where they crucified Jesus of Nazareth, the Sea of Tiberiades, where many of the apostles worked as fishermen, and Monte Tabor, the place where the Transfiguration occurred. Africa Africa is obviously from the Nile river with a lake as its source. The Maghreb is named \\"Libia\\" and Africa is surrounded by a sea coloured red. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Le renouveau des connaissances g√©ographiques, Biblioth√®que nationale de France * The Beatus Map Category:8th century maps Category:Historic maps of the world Category:8th century in Spain Category:Geographic history of Spain Category:Illuminated beatus manuscripts ","title":"Beatus map"},{"id":"12378912","text":"Le val d'Andorre (The Valley of Andorra) is an op√©ra comique by Fromental Hal√©vy with a libretto by Saint-Georges.

The station was established by engineer Hans Idzerda, and is believed to have been Europe's first sustained broadcasting station,On 28 March 1914 the first of a short-lived series of weekly concerts, under the oversight of Robert Goldschmidt, was made from a station located at the Royal Castle of Laeken near Brussels, Belgium. (\\"Concerts by Wireless\\", London Times, 30 March 1914, page 8.) However, just four months later the entire station complex was destroyed in order to avoid its falling under the control of invading German troops. as well as one of the first stations in the world to transmit entertainment intended for a general audience.In the United States, Charles \\"Doc\\" Herrold of San Jose, California inaugurated weekly concert broadcasts in 1912. In the fall of 1916, Lee de Forest began daily broadcasts over station 2XG in New York City. Both stations were required to cease operating in April 1917 due to the entrance of the United States into World War I. PCGG's schedule generally featured one or two evening programmes per week. Although located on the west coast of Holland, the station had a large audience across the English Channel in Great Britain. However, Idzerda ran into financial difficulties, and PCGG's licence was revoked on 11 November 1924, one month before his company, Nederlandsche Radio-Industrie, shut down due to bankruptcy. ==History== Formation Hans IdzerdaHans Idzerda's full name was \\"Hans Henricus Schotanus √† Steringa Idzerda\\". He was also known as \\"Hanso\\". was an electrical engineer, who worked with the Philips manufacturing company during World War I. (Holland was a neutral country during this conflict, and largely avoided the immense destruction caused by the war.) Idzerda founded his own company, which became known as Nederlandsche Radio- Industrie by the end of the war. Together with Philips, he developed the Philips-Iduret-Generatorlamp radio tube.The \\"generatorlamp\\" was also known as the \\"IDEEZET tube\\" and the \\"Dutch IDZ valve\\". An agreement with Philips gave Idzerda the exclusive right to sell tubes to the general public and amateur radio enthusiasts. His quota was to sell at least 180 a year, and in the first year achieved 1,200 sales.\\"Communications Commentary: PCGG\\", Electronics & Wireless World, February 1986, page 26. (americanradiohistory.com) In order to promote sales, Idzerda began a series of demonstration transmissions, the first of which was made during the Third Dutch Trade Fair held in Utrecht from February 24 to March 8, 1919.Idzerda, the first radio broadcaster, Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid (Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision) While most audio radio transmissions at this time employed AM (amplitude modulation) signals, Idzerda patented a method for \\"narrow-band\\" FM (frequency modulation) transmissions.\\"U.S. Patent #1,648,402, applied for in the United States on 7 May 1921 and issued on 8 November 1927. In the Netherlands, this was applied for on 14 January 1920 and issued as patent #6976 on 24 February 1922. (This is in contrast to the modern day \\"wide band\\" FM, originally developed in the 1930s by Edwin Howard Armstrong.) This could be picked up by standard receivers, although they had to be slightly deturned in order to receive the signals using slope detection. PCGG was located at the Nederlandsche Radio-Industrie building at Beukstraat 8-10 in the Hague, Netherlands (April 1921)\\"The Hague Concerts\\" by Philip R. Coursey, The Wireless World, 30 April 1921, page 65. On 11 June 1919 Idzerda was granted permission to operate a radio station, although the permit technically limited him to communication with designated military radio stations. The new station was issued the randomly assigned call sign of PCGG. Adopting a generous interpretation of the activities allowed by his station authorization, on 6 November he embarked on a weekly series of entertainment broadcasts. The schedule for the first programme was advertised the day before the broadcast in a local newspaper. Idzerda called it a \\"Radio Soir√©e-Musicale\\" (French for \\"evening musical\\"), which was transmitted from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. on a longwave wavelength of 670 metres (448 kHz). British audience The station began a series of twice-weekly programmes, which soon drew attention, and a majority of its listeners, from across the English Channel in Great Britain. In May 1920 a British publication, The Wireless World, informed its readers that the 29 April and 2 May broadcasts many had heard had originated at PCGG, although many listeners, unaware of the Dutch station, had assumed they were a part of the ongoing test transmissions at the Marconi company's Chelmsford station.\\"Notes and News: Wireless Telephony\\", The Wireless World, 29 May 1920, page 157. In June the magazine further reported that PCGG's schedule was 6:40 to 10:40 p.m. on Thursdays, and 1:40 to 3:40 p.m. on Sundays. The transmitter was rated at about 500 watts, operating on a wavelength that ranged from 800 to 1,000 metres (375 to 300 kHz).\\"Notes and News: The Dutch Wireless Telephony Station\\", The Wireless World, 26 June 1920, page 221. In August, the magazine reported that the summer schedule was reduced to one programme per week, on Thursdays from 6:40 to 9:40 p.m, now operating on 1,000 metres. Also, instead of gramophone recordings, the programmes would feature a small musical band that included a piano, violin and cello.\\"Notes and News: PCGG\\", The Wireless World, 7 August 1920, page 384. The cost of running PCGG began to be a financial burden, especially after the twice-weekly schedule was resumed, as the switch to live performances required hiring paid musicians. In addition, to better serve the British audience the station had incurred costs related to upgrading the signal. In the September 1921 issue of The Wireless World, a letter from W. W. Burnham suggested that the magazine open a subscriptions list to collect donations,Correspondence: Concerts Given by the Nederlandsche Radio-Industrie den Haag, Holland (letter from W. W. Burnham), The Wireless World, 3 September 1921, page 356. and the resulting contributions were forwarded to support PCGG's operations.\\"Dutch Concerts\\", The Wireless World, 1 October 1921, page 415. During this time the London Daily Mail newspaper had been working with the Marconi company to give publicity broadcasts on an irregular schedule, highlighted by a performance by dame Nellie Melba on 15 June 1920.\\"A Newspaper's Use of the Radio Phone\\", The Wireless Age, November 1920, page 10. However, this use of valuable radio wavelengths was considered to be frivolous by the Postmaster General, who on November 23, 1920 informed the House of Commons that the broadcasts \\"have been suspended\\".The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Vol. I: The Birth of Broadcasting by Asa Briggs, 1961, pages 49-50. Seeking an additional outlet, the Daily Mail turned to PCGG, providing financing for its programmes from July 1922 until July 1923. The series debut was held the evening of July 27, 1922, and featured Australian contralto Lily Payling.\\"Radio Concert\\", The Brisbane (Australia) Courier, 29 July 1922, page 7. (Idzerda later commented \\"She had so many pretensions regarding accompaniment, accommodation, care, locality and what a spoiled artist can invent more, that I had to rest for a week after the broadcast to recover from it.\\") Final activities With the end of the Daily Mail support, PCGG again faced daunting financing issues. Reports for this time period state that the station was operating on a wavelength of around 1050 metres (285 kHz), which suffered significant interference from British amateurs operating spark transmitters on 1000 metres (300 kHz). Also, in 1922 the Postmaster General began to relent on the ban of British broadcasting stations, beginning with 2MT at Writtle and 2LO in London. In the fall, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) was formed, which established a network of stations covering the country with strong signals, which greatly reduced British interest in trying to pick up PCGG from across the channel. Expansion in Holland also reduced the interest in PCGG. In the early part of 1924 a syndicate of Dutch listeners was formed to collect money to finance programmes, carried at no expense, by the radio station located at the Nederlandsche Seintoestellen Fabriek (NSF) manufacturing plant in Hilversum.\\"Radio in Holland\\" by W. Peeters, The Wireless World, 17 May 1925, page 505 (americanradiohistory.com) PCGG even had to shut down for a short period in the fall of 1923 when local residents complained about the noise being made by its electrical generators.\\"Stand By: The Dutchman\\", Popular Wireless, 20 October 1923, page 253 (americanradiohistory.com) PCGG's licence was revoked on 11 November 1924 due to Idzerda's financial difficulties, and his company was declared bankrupt a month later. There were a couple of later reports that he had resumed broadcasting, but this appears to have been limited to a few experimental transmissions. A 1926 report stated that Netherland Association Idzerda-Radio had received a new PCGG transmitting licence, but there was no additional information about station activities.\\"Current Topics: PCGG Again on the Ether\\", Wireless World, 28 July 1926, page 125 (americanradiohistory.com) In 1930, a second report stated that a new authorization, with the call letters PF1IDZ, had been issued to the Idzerda Radio Works, for experimental transmissions every Saturday night between 11:40 p.m. and 1:40 a.m. on 299 metres (1000 kHz), but again this was at best a very limited effort.\\"Current Topics: Have You Heard This One?\\", Wireless World, 10 September 1930, page 247 (americanradiohistory.com) Idzerda himself came to a tragic end, executed in 1944 by occupying German troops on the suspicion of espionage. ==See also== *History of radio *List of the world's oldest radio stations *Timeline of radio == References External links== * Idzerda, the first radio broadcaster, Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid (Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision). * \\"The Birth of Radio Broadcasting\\" videos from the above presentation: Part 1: \\"Hanso Idzerda and his PCGG transmitter\\", Part 2: \\"Dutch Radio Pioneers Hanso Idzerda and Jan Corver\\", Part 3: \\"Hanso Idzerda's PCGG Radio Transmitter.

As the LNG market grows rapidly,The Global Liquefied Natural Gas Market: Status and Outlook the fleet of LNG carriers continues to experience tremendous growth. ==History== Diagram of new build rate. The first LNG carrier Methane Pioneer () left the Calcasieu River on the Louisiana Gulf coast on 25 January 1959. Carrying the world's first ocean cargo of LNG, it sailed to the UK where the cargo was delivered. Subsequent expansion of that trade has brought on a large expansion of the fleet to today where giant LNG ships carrying up to are sailing worldwide. The success of the specially modified C1-M-AV1-type standard ship Normarti, renamed Methane Pioneer, caused the Gas Council and Conch International Methane Ltd. to order two purpose built LNG carriers to be constructed: Methane Princess and Methane Progress. The ships were fitted with Conch independent aluminum cargo tanks and entered the Algerian LNG trade in 1964. These ships had a capacity of . In the late 1960s, opportunity arose to export LNG from Alaska to Japan, and in 1969 that trade with TEPCO and Tokyo Gas was initiated. Two ships, Polar Alaska and Arctic Tokyo, each with a capacity of , were built in Sweden. In the early 1970s, the US government encouraged US shipyards to build LNG carriers, and a total of 16 LNG ships were built. The late 1970s and early 1980s brought the prospect of Arctic LNG ships with a number of projects being studied. With the increase in cargo capacity to approximately , new tank designs were developed, from Moss Rosenberg to Technigaz Mark III and Gaztransport No.96. In recent years, the size and capacity of LNG carriers has increased greatly. Since 2005, Qatargas has pioneered the development of two new classes of LNG carriers, referred to as Q-Flex and Q-Max. Each ship has a cargo capacity of between and is equipped with a re-liquefaction plant. Today we see interest for small scale LNG bunker carriers. Some need to stay below the life rafts of Cruise ships and Ropax vessels. Examples are the Damen LGC 3000 (http://products.damen.com/en/ranges/liquefied-gas-carrier) and the Seagas. , a total of 203 vessels had been built, of which 193 were still in service. At the end of 2016, the global LNG shipping fleet consisted of 439 vessels. In 2017, an estimated 170 vessels are in use at any one time. At the end of 2018, the global fleet was approximately 550 vessels. ==New building== LNG carrier under construction at DSME shipyard, Okpo-dong In November 2018, South Korean ship builders locked in 3 years worth of large-scale LNG carrier contracts - more than 50 orders - with a value of $9 billion. South Korean builders captured 78% of LNG-related ship building contracts in 2018, with 14% going to Japanese builders and 8% going to Chinese builders. The new contracts would boost the global LNG fleet by 10%. Of the global fleet, historically, about two-thirds of the ships have been built by South Koreans, 22% by Japanese, 7% by Chinese, and the rest built by a combination of France, Spain, and the United States. South Korea's success stems from innovation and price point; South Korean builders introduced the first ice-breaker type LNG vessels and South Korean builders have been successful in catering to increased customer preference for Q-max vessels over Moss type. In 2018 South Koreas's first LNG powered bulk carrier (Green Iris) will begin construction. It will have at time of writing the world's largest capacity (50,000 tons). According to Tradewinds data, in January 2017 there were 122 new builds on order. The majority of new ships under construction are in the size of , but there were orders for ships with capacity up to . , there were 451 LNG ships engaged in the deepsea movement of LNG in 2010. In 2017, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering delivered the Christophe de Margerie, an icebreaking LNG tanker of 80,200 deadweight tons. Her capacity of is the consumption of Sweden for a month. She completed her first revenue voyage from Norway via the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic Ocean to South Korea. The shipyard has fourteen more on order. In the case of small scale LNG carriers (LNG carriers below ), the optimal size of a ship is determined by the project for which it is built, taking into consideration volume, destination and vessel characteristics. List of small scale LNG carrier builders:cn * Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction * STX Offshore & Shipbuilding * Damen Shipyards Group (http://products.damen.com/en/ranges/liquefied-gas-carrier) ==Cargo handling== A typical LNG carrier has four to six tanks located along the center-line of the vessel. Surrounding the tanks is a combination of ballast tanks, cofferdams and voids; in effect, this gives the vessel a double-hull type design. Inside each tank there are typically three submerged pumps. There are two main cargo pumps which are used in cargo discharge operations and a much smaller pump which is referred to as the spray pump. The spray pump is used for either pumping out liquid LNG to be used as fuel (via a vaporizer), or for cooling down cargo tanks. It can also be used for \\"stripping\\" out the last of the cargo in discharge operations. All of these pumps are contained within what is known as the pump tower which hangs from the top of the tank and runs the entire depth of the tank. The pump tower also contains the tank gauging system and the tank filling line, all of which are located near the bottom of the tank. In membrane-type vessels there is also an empty pipe with a spring- loaded foot valve that can be opened by weight or pressure. This is the emergency pump tower. In the event both main cargo pumps fail the top can be removed from this pipe and an emergency cargo pump lowered down to the bottom of the pipe. The top is replaced on the column and then the pump is allowed to push down on the foot valve and open it. The cargo can then be pumped out. All cargo pumps discharge into a common pipe which runs along the deck of the vessel; it branches off to either side of the vessel to the cargo manifolds, which are used for loading or discharging. All cargo tank vapour spaces are linked via a vapour header which runs parallel to the cargo header. This also has connections to the sides of the ship next to the loading and discharging manifolds. ==Typical cargo cycle== A typical cargo cycle starts with the tanks in a \\"gas free\\" condition, meaning the tanks are full of air, which allows maintenance on the tank and pumps. Cargo cannot be loaded directly into the tank, as the presence of oxygen would create an explosive atmospheric condition within the tank, and the rapid temperature change caused by loading LNG at could damage the tanks. First, the tank must be 'inerted' to eliminate the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce a mixture of gases (typically less than 5% O2 and about 13% CO2 plus N2). This is blown into the tanks until the oxygen level is below 4%. Next, the vessel goes into port to \\"gas-up\\" and \\"cool-down\\", as one still cannot load directly into the tank: The CO2 will freeze and damage the pumps and the cold shock could damage the tank's pump column. LNG is brought onto the vessel and taken along the spray line to the main vaporiser, which boils off the liquid into gas. This is then warmed up to roughly in the gas heaters and then blown into the tanks to displace the \\"inert gas\\". This continues until all the CO2 is removed from the tanks. Initially, the IG (inert gas) is vented to atmosphere. Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flammability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors. The shore terminal then burns this vapour to avoid the dangers of having large amounts of hydrocarbons present which may explode. Now the vessel is gassed up and warm. The tanks are still at ambient temperature and are full of methane. The next stage is cool-down. LNG is sprayed into the tanks via spray heads, which vaporises and starts to cool the tank. The excess gas is again blown ashore to be re-liquified or burned at a flare stack. Once the tanks reach about the tanks are ready to bulk load. Bulk loading starts and liquid LNG is pumped from the storage tanks ashore into the vessel tanks. Displaced gas is blown ashore by the HD compressors. Loading continues until typically 98.5% full is reached (to allow for thermal expansion/contraction of cargo). The vessel can now proceed to the discharge port. During passage various boil-off management strategies can be used. Boil- off gas can be burned in boilers to provide propulsion, or it can be re- liquefied and returned to the cargo tanks, depending on the design of the vessel. Once in the discharge port, the cargo is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo in the cargo vaporiser. Either the vessel can be pumped out as far as possible, with the last being pumped out with spray pumps, or some cargo can be retained on board as a \\"heel\\". It is normal practice to keep onboard 5% to 10% of the cargo after discharge in one tank. This is referred to as the heel and this is used to cool down the remaining tanks that have no heel before loading. This must be done gradually otherwise the tanks will be cold shocked if loaded directly into warm tanks. Cool-down can take roughly 20GIIGNL Fourth Edition 2.6.2 hours on a Moss vessel (and 10‚Äì12 hours on a membrane type vessel), so carrying a heel allows cool-down to be done before the vessel reaches port giving a significant time saving. If all the cargo is pumped ashore, then on the ballast passage the tanks will warm up to ambient temperature, returning the vessel to a gassed up and warm state. The vessel can then be cooled again for loading. If the vessel is to return to a gas free state, the tanks must be warmed up by using the gas heaters to circulate warm gas. Once the tanks are warmed up, the inert gas plant is used to remove the methane from the tanks. Once the tanks are methane free, the inert gas plant is switched to dry air production, which is used to remove all the inert gas from the tanks until they have a safe working atmosphere. Transportation of natural gas both in the form of LNG and by pipeline causes greenhouse gas emissions, but in different ways. With pipelines, most of the emissions stem from the production of steel pipe; with LNG most of the emissions stem from liquefaction. For both pipelines and LNG, propulsion causes additional emissions (pressurization of the pipeline, propulsion of the LNG tanker). ==Containment systems== The inside of a Moss- type LNG carrier Today there are four containment systems in use for new build vessels. Two of the designs are of the self-supporting type, while the other two are of the membrane type and today the patents are owned by Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT). There is a trend towards the use of the two different membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic membrane tanks utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the Suez Canal. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor. Moss tanks (Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks) LNG Moss-type tanker, side view Named after the company that designed them, the Norwegian company Moss Maritime, the Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks are spherical in shape. Most Moss type vessels have 4 or 5 tanks. The outside of the tank has a thick layer of foam insulation that is either fitted in panels or in more modern designs wound round the tank. Over this insulation is a thin layer of \\"tinfoil\\" which allows the insulation to be kept dry with a nitrogen atmosphere. This atmosphere is constantly checked for any methane that would indicate a leak of the tank. Also the outside of the tank is checked at 3-month intervals for any cold spots that would indicate breakdown in the insulation. The tank is supported around its circumference by the equatorial ring, which is supported by a large circular skirt, known as a data-couple that is a unique combination of aluminum and steel, which takes the weight of the tank down to the ships structure. This skirt allows the tank to expand and contract during cool-down and warm-up operations. During cool- down or warm-up the tank can expand or contract about . Because of this expansion and contraction all piping into the tank comes in the top and is connected to the ships lines via flexible bellows. Inside each tank there is a set of spray heads. These heads are mounted around the equatorial ring and are used to spray LNG onto the tank walls to reduce the temperature. Tanks normally have a working pressure of up to , but this can be raised for an emergency discharge. If both main pumps fail then to remove the cargo, the tank's safety valves are adjusted to lift at 100 kPa. Then the filling line which goes to the bottom of the tank is opened along with the filling lines of the other tanks on board. The pressure is then raised in the tank with the defective pumps which pushes the cargo into the other tanks where it can be pumped out. IHI (Prismatic IMO type B LNG tanks) Designed by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, the self-supporting prismatic type B (SPB) tank is currently employed in only two vessels. Type B tanks limit sloshing problems, an improvement over Membrane LNG carrier tanks which may break due to sloshing impact, therefore destroying the ship's hull. This is also of prime relevance for FPSO LNG (or FLNG). In addition, IMO type B LNG tanks can sustain internal accidental damage due for example to internal equipment releases. This was incorporated into the design following several incidents that occurred inside membrane LNG tanks. TGZ Mark III Interior of a non-spherical, Technigaz Mark III stainless steel membrane, LNG tank Designed by Technigaz, these tanks are of the membrane type. The membrane consists of stainless steel with 'waffles' to absorb the thermal contraction when the tank is cooled down. The primary barrier, made of corrugated stainless steel of about thickness is the one in direct contact with the cargo liquid (or vapour in empty tank condition). This is followed by a primary insulation which in turn is covered by a secondary barrier made of a material called \\"triplex\\" which is basically a metal foil sandwiched between glasswool sheets and compressed together. This is again covered by a secondary insulation which in turn is supported by the ship's hull structure from the outside. From the inside of the tank outwards, the layers are: * LNG * Primary barrier of 1.2 mm thick corrugated/waffled 304L stainless steel * Primary insulation (also called the interbarrier space) * Secondary barrier within triplex membrane * Secondary insulation (also called the insulation space) * Ship's hull structure. GT96 Designed by Gaztransport, the tanks consists of a primary and secondary thin membrane made of the material Invar which has almost no thermal contraction. The insulation is made out of plywood boxes filled with perlite and continuously flushed with nitrogen gas. The integrity of both membranes is permanently monitored by detection of hydrocarbon in the nitrogen. An evolution is proposed by NG2, with the replacement of nitrogen by argon as the flushed inert and insulation gas. Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of boil-off gas. CS1 CS1 stands for Combined System Number One. It was designed by the now merged Gaztransport & Technigaz companies and consists of the best components of both MkIII and No96 systems. The primary barrier is made of invar , and secondary from Triplex. The primary and secondary insulation consists of polyurethane foam panels. Three vessels with CS1 technology were built by one shipyard, but established shipyards have decided to maintain production of the MKIII and NO96. ==Reliquefaction and boil-off== In order to facilitate transport, natural gas is cooled down to approximately at atmospheric pressure, at which point the gas condenses to a liquid. The tanks on board an LNG carrier effectively function as giant thermoses to keep the liquid gas cold during storage. No insulation is perfect, however, and so the liquid is constantly boiling during the voyage. According to WGI, on a typical voyage an estimated 0.1‚Äì0.25% of the cargo converts to gas each day, depending on the efficiency of the insulation and the roughness of the voyage.World Gas Intelligence, 30 July 2008 In a typical 20-day voyage, anywhere from 2‚Äì6% of the total volume of LNG originally loaded may be lost. Normally an LNG tanker is powered by steam turbines with boilers. These boilers are dual fuel and can run on either methane or oil or a combination of both. The gas produced in boil off is traditionally diverted to the boilers and used as a fuel for the vessel. Before this gas is used in the boilers, it must be warmed up to roughly 20 ¬∞C by using the gas heaters. The gas is either fed into the boiler by tank pressure or it is increased in pressure by the LD compressors. What fuel the vessel runs on is dependent on many factors which include the length of the voyage, desire to carry a heel for cooldown, price of oil versus price of LNG, and port demands for cleaner exhaust. There are three basic modes available: Minimum boil-off/maximum oil:- In this mode tank pressures are kept high to reduce boil off to a minimum and the majority of energy comes from the fuel oil. This maximises the amount of LNG delivered but does allow tank temps to rise due to lack of evaporation. The high cargo temps can cause storage problems and offloading problems. Maximum boil-off/minimum oil:- In this mode the tank pressures are kept low and you have a greater boil-off but still there is a large amount of fuel oil used. This decreases the amount of LNG delivered but the cargo will be delivered cold which many ports prefer. 100% gas:- Tank pressures are kept at a similar level to max boil off but this is may not be enough to supply all the boilers needs so you must start to \\"force\\". A small pump is started in one tank to supply LNG to the forcing vaporiser, where the LNG is warmed and vaporized back into a gas that is usable in the boilers. In this mode no fuel oil is used. Recent advances in technology reliquefication plants to be fitted to vessels, allowing the boil off to be reliquefied and returned to the tanks. Because of this, the vessels' operators and builders have been able to contemplate the use of more efficient slow-speed diesel engines (previously most LNG carriers have been steam turbine-powered). Exceptions are the LNG carrier Havfru (built as Venator in 1973), which originally had dual fuel diesel engines, and its sister-ship Century (built as Lucian in 1974), also built with dual fuel gas turbines before being converted to a diesel engine system in 1982. Vessels using Dual or Tri-Fuel Diesel Electric, respectively DFDE/TFDE, propulsion systems are now in service. Recently, there has been interest in a return to propulsion by boil-off gas. This is a result of the IMO 2020 anti-pollution regulation that bans the use of marine fuel oil with a sulphur content greater than 0.5% on ships not fitted with flue-gas scrubbing plant. Space constraints and safety issues typically prevent the installation of such equipment on LNG carriers, forcing them to abandon the use of the lower-cost, high-suplhur fuel oil and switch to low-sulphur fuels that cost more and are in shorter supply. In these circumstances, boil-off gas may become a more attractive option. == Consequences of spillage == While no measures exist to prevent all accidents, several past major petrochemical spills, such as the Exxon Valdez or the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig spills, have caused a sense of rising concern within the industry. Compared to oil, there is less public concern over spillage of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) carrying vessels. The LNG sector is known to have a good safety record regarding cargo loss. By 2004, there had been close to 80,000 loaded port transits of LNG carriers with no loss of containment failure.(Pitblado, 2004) An analysis of several spherical carriers showed that the vessels can withstand a 90 degree side-on collision with another similar LNG carrier at 6.6kts (50% of normal port speed) with no loss of LNG cargo integrity. This drops to 1.7kts for a fully loaded 300,000 dwt oil tanker collision into an LNG carrier. The report also notes that such collisions are rare, though are possible. (Pitblado, 2004) HAZID performed a risk assessment of an LNG spill. Taking into account precautions, training, regulations and technology changes over time HAZID calculates that the likelihood of an LNG spill as approximately 1 in 100,000 trips. (Pitblado, 2004) In the event that the tank integrity of a LNG transport is compromised, there is a risk that the natural gas contained within could ignite, causing either an explosion or fire. ==See also== *Compressed natural gas (CNG) *Gas carrier *List of gas carriers *List of tankers *Mozah *Prelude FLNG ==References== Category:Ship types Category:Tankers de:Tanker#Fl√ºssiggastanker ","title":"LNG carrier"},{"id":"12378972","text":"Year's Best SF 5 is a science fiction anthology edited by David G.

Brock and Creative Engineering. The brand emerged following a separation between Brock and Pizza Time Theatre, owners of the Chuck E. Cheese's franchise. ShowBiz Pizza restaurants entertained guests through a large selection of arcade games, coin-operated rides, and animatronic stage shows as a way to provide a complete package of food and entertainment. Both companies became competitors and found early success, partly due to the rise in popularity of arcade games during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The type of animatronics used in the ShowBiz Pizza chain ‚Äì which featured an overall- clad, hillbilly bear named Billy Bob as one of its central characters ‚Äì distinguished it from its rival which offered many of the same services. Following Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy filing in 1984, however, ShowBiz bought the struggling franchise to settle a former court settlement mandate and formed ShowBiz Pizza Time, a combination of the former companies' names. By 1992, all ShowBiz Pizza locations were rebranded as Chuck E. Cheese's. ==History== A child speaking with Billy Bob at ShowBiz Pizza in Fayetteville, Arkansas Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, responsible for bringing the first widely recognized video game Pong to the mainstream, headed a project in the mid-1970s for Atari to launch the first arcade-oriented, family restaurant featuring computer-controlled animatronics. At a time when arcades were popular in bowling alleys and bars, Bushnell sought to increase arcade exposure to a younger audience. In 1977, Atari opened the first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, CA. The concept became an immediate success, and after leaving Atari in 1978, Bushnell purchased the Pizza Time restaurant forming a new company under the title Pizza Time Theatre Inc. As Bushnell heavily marketed the Pizza Time franchise hoping to expand into new markets, the concept began attracting high-profile clients such as Robert L. Brock, best known for his extensive portfolio of Holiday Inn hotels. In 1979, Brock signed a multimillion-dollar franchising agreement with the Pizza Time Theatre Inc., and expected to open as many as 280 Chuck E. Cheese's locations across 16 states in the United States. Shortly thereafter, Brock became concerned about protecting his investment, noticing companies such as Creative Engineering, Inc. (CEI) on the horizon designing more advanced animatronics. He grew concerned that future competitors would emerge with better technology. Bushnell previously reassured Brock at the signing of the franchising agreement that the company's technology would continue to evolve. However, prior to the grand opening of his first location, Brock decided he wanted to void the agreement with Pizza Time, and instead, form a partnership with CEI. The first ShowBiz Pizza Place opened in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 3, 1980. At the time, Brock was quite successful as one of the largest franchisers in the Holiday Inn hotel system. The Brock Hotel Corporation owned 80 percent of ShowBiz Pizza Place, while the other 20 percent was owned by CEI, the company responsible for the production of the chain's animatronics show, The Rock-afire Explosion. By September 1981, the company had 48 company- owned outlets and 42 franchises. The company moved its headquarters in 1982 to Irving, Texas. ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. In 1984, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and its assets were purchased by ShowBiz. As a result of the merger, the newly formed company was named ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. ‚Äì a combination of the former names. However, both restaurants continued operating as separate entities. Richard M. Frank joined the company as president in 1985. Based on customer research, Frank instituted a number of changes to appeal to younger children and parents. Specific measures included increased lighting, a redesigned food menu, table service, self-serve fountain drinks, a revamped ride selection, and distinct toddler areas. However, relations between ShowBiz and Creative Engineering began to deteriorate. Aaron Fechter, founder of CEI and creator of The Rock-afire Explosion, would later claim in 2008 that the fallout was due to a demand by Showbiz to own CEI's licensing and copyrights to the animatronics show. Fechter says he refused, since Showbiz didn't offer monetary compensation for the rights. Despite the refusal, CEI's creative control was jeopardized, as ShowBiz had the ability to program the characters and replicate their voices, allowing them to make changes to the skits. ShowBiz later returned the recording rights to Fechter following CEI's Liberty Show production (in commemoration of the Statue of Liberty's centennial in 1986), but they did not return the programming rights. A child on a ride at ShowBiz Pizza in Fayetteville, Arkansas In 1989, ShowBiz Pizza Time became a public company with its stock market launch. The following year, it severed all ties with Creative Engineering and began restructuring the restaurant chains under \\"concept unification\\". The change consisted of removing the Rock afire Explosion show from their restaurants and converting it into a new show called \\"Chuck E. Cheese & Munch's Make Believe Band\\", featuring the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre characters. In addition, all ShowBiz Pizza locations in the U.S. were rebranded as Chuck E. Cheese's, effectively ending the \\"ShowBiz Pizza\\" brand. By 1992, the conversion was complete, and ShowBiz Pizza Time became known as CEC Entertainment, Inc., in 1998 moving its stock from NASDAQ to NYSE. In February 2014, the company was purchased by Apollo Global Management for $1.3 billion. ==See also== * List of pizza chains of the United States ==References== Category:Pizza chains of the United States Category:Pizza franchises Category:Video arcades Category:Restaurants established in 1980 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 1992 Category:Defunct companies based in Kansas Category:Defunct restaurant chains in the United States Category:Theme restaurants Category:Animatronic attractions Category:1980 establishments in Kansas Category:1992 disestablishments in Texas Category:American companies established in 1980 Category:American companies disestablished in 1992 ","title":"ShowBiz Pizza Place"},{"id":"12379068","text":"Nazeing is a village and parish in Essex, England. Within the parish are the separate settlements of Upper Nazeing, Middle Nazeing, and Lower Nazeing.http://www.visitoruk.com/Harlow/nazeing-C592-V10767.html The Prime Meridian passes to the west of Lower Nazeing. ==Location and topography== Nazeing is approximately four miles north of Waltham Abbey, one mile south- west of Harlow, and is bounded on the west by the River Lea. Most of it is still rural, but during the past 40 years there has been a considerable development of market gardening, light industry, holiday fishing, and boating. The older village of Nazeing is separated by open farmland from the larger Lower Nazeinghttp://www.oneeppingforest.org.uk/documents/LowerNazeing.pdf to the west. The land gradually rises from the river to a small hill and bowl- shaped plateau, about 270 ft. above sea level, in the east. Apart from the alluvium by the river, and a strip of gravel a little to the east of it, the soil is London Clay. Nazeingwood Commonhttps://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2552347 covers much of the eastern plateau and was originally part of Waltham Forest, but in the 13th century was deforested for pasture. It was also ploughed up during the Second World War. From the common a small brook runs west through the middle of the parish. ==History of Nazeing== Early Potsherds of Iron Age A and fragments of Iron Age pots have been found in Nazeing which show that people have lived here for more than 2000 years.http://www.efdhistory.org.uk/locations/nazeing Roman remains include burials found in Nazeing Mead, near the river. The original Saxon settlement was probably in the east of the parish, near the church. The position of this village, now called Upper Park Town, may have given Nazeing its name, which means 'settlers on a spur of land'.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp140-150#anchorn5 The Old English word n≈ìss, or naze, is related to the modern word nose and refers to a spur or headland, while the suffix -ing means \\"the dwellers at\\", so the name can be translated as \\"People of the Headland\\". The Saxons first established compact settlements called hams; more scattered communities with names ending in ing followed a generation or two later. Waltham, the place in the wood, was probably settled by 600 A.D, which would suggest a date some time in the seventh century for its neighbour Nazeing. Until recently the area around Nazeing Primary School was known as the Ham fields, and it is possible that their name recalls the site of the first settlement in Nazeing.http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/0953713504 Story of Nazeing: Five Miles from Everywhere Pt. 1 (Nazeing History Workshop Publication) The Domesday Book records Nazeing or Nasinga in the hundred of Waltham as follows: Canons of Waltham before and after 1066; Odo from Ranulf, brother of Ilger, and 2 freemen from him. ¬Ω fishery.http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/essex3.html Nazeing The manuscript of 1086 records three entries one of which states the village having 7 villagers, 12 smallholders, 1 free man, 7 cattle and 30 pigs.http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TL4106/nazeing/Open Domesday Online: Nazeing, accessed 30 April 2017 White's Directory of Essex 1848 states: 'NAZEING, or NASING, 5 miles North by East of Waltham Abbey, and from 1 to 3 miles East of Broxbourn Station on the North-Eastern Railway, is a picturesque parish of scattered houses, extending three miles eastward from the river Lea, to which it sends a small rivulet.'

The village stands 2¬º miles E of the river Lea at the boundary with Herts, 3 E of Broxbourne r. station, and 4¬º N W of Epping; and has a post-office under Waltham Cross. The parish extends to the river Lea, and comprises 3,893 acres. Real property, ¬£6,710. Pop., 763. Houses, 165.'http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/6836 World War One Nazeing contributed 153 men to serve in the armed forces during the First World War, and the village has four war memorials, recording the names of the 28 men who died. World War Two Nazeing Common was the site of a dummy airfield,https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2551737 designed to be a decoy for nearby North Weald airfield. The land on the site is as it appears today, very hilly, not what one expects from an airfield. The lighting was mounted on wooden poles of varying lengths, so as to keep the proportion and angles right in its appearance from the air.http://nellyurbex.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/decoy- airfield-nazeing-essex-april-2011.html Such dummy airfields were in operation from June 1940, but it is thought the Germans had detected Nazeing as a decoy site by the end of December. The site probably closed by the end of July 1941 as land was needed for agriculture. The decoy was originally built on common grazing land, and this was put to the plough in August 1941. ==Community== All Saints, Nazeing Nazeing is said to be one of the largest villages in the UK. It forms a civil parish of the Epping Forest district and has its own Parish Council. The village has two Anglican places of worship: the modern Saint Giles Parish in Lower Nazeing, and All Saints' Church,http://www.nazeingchurch.co.uk/about by far the older of the two. It also has a Congregational Church http://www.nazeingchapel.co.uk on Middle Street, founded in 1795. Heavy rainfall has been known to flood the village to the point that even All Saints' Church, at the top of the hill, has been affected. The village has a number of pubs: the King Harolds Head,http://www.kingharoldshead.co.uk/ Sun Inn,http://www.mcmullens.co.uk/suninn Black Swan http://www.theblackswannazeing.co.uk/ and the Crooked Billet. The former Ponds petrol station at Nazeing crossroads was bought from Total by the Nazeing Parish Council prior to auction in 2006. There ware plans for it to be made into a community hall; however, these were abandoned in 2013 due to escalating costs.http://www.nazeingparishcouncil.org/totalsite_plans/1401_totalsiteletter.pdf In 2014 the site was on the market after the Parish Council granted planning permission for six houses.http://www.nazeingparishcouncil.org/totalsite.htm The Crooked Billet, Lower Nazeing == Places of interest== Along the lane to Nazeing Common are several cottages and the old post office, all listed as Grade II buildings.

These buildings housed generators for powering the lighting and had an ops room where the lights were operated from, and where contact could be maintained by telephone to the controlling station i.e.: North Weald itself. The other bunker 100 ft further down the hill was used for shelter and a general area for sleeping and cooking. This site was in operation from June 1940, but it is thought the Germans had detected Nazeing as a decoy site by the end of December. The site probably closed by the end of July 1941 as land was needed for increased agriculture and this was put to the plough in August 1941. These bunkers can be located north of the Nazeing Brook on the Lodge Farm side. ==Industry and commerce== For most of its history Nazeing has been a rural parish with agriculture as the main occupation. The river Lea on the west and the forest on the south provided additional employment. During WWII Nazeing as part of the Lea Valley became increasingly important providing the country with much of its fresh salad produce. The Lea Valley also had numerous factories geared to aircraft repairs, furniture manufacture, agro-fertilisers, as well as power stations and sreweries some of which were located in and around Nazeing. During the past forty years in Nazeing there has been considerable development of market gardening and light industry near the river.  Hillgrove Business Park  Nazeing is home to Hillgrove Business Park, a medium size industrial estate which holds over 30 companies. Market gardening and nurseries The Lea Valley, particularly around Nazeing, is associated with market gardening, nurseries and garden centres. The industry once dominated the area in and around the village, this also spawned industries such as Pan Britannica Industries and L F King & Son Ltd.http://www.taylorfuelcontrol.com/about-us In the 1930s the Lea Valley contained the largest concentration of greenhouses in the world.History of the Lea Valley greenhouse industry Today, in most parts south of Cheshunt the greenhouses have been replaced by residential areas. Nazeing Glass Works Nazeing glass workshttp://www.nazeing-glass- factoryshop.co.uk/PBCPPlayer.asp?ID=1175753 ‚Äì Glass making started on the site in 1928 when members of the Kempton family relocated their small glass works from Southwark in London to Nazeing. Nazeing Glass Works is one of the oldest surviving glass manufacturers in the UK and can identify itself in glass manufacturing history back to 1612 in Vauxhall. The registered company Nazeing Glass Works Limited was formed in 1931. In 1956 it was described as having one four-pot, four single-pot and one tank furnace all fired by heavy fuel oil.http://www.glassmaking-in-london.co.uk/later-glasshouses Gravel extraction The other major land use in the area is gravel extraction which has been carried out for a number of years by Redland Gravel Company https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-536000-204000/page/8 and other companies. Throughout the area evidence of this extraction can be seen in the form of flooded gravel pits. However, many of the lakes have now been turned into leisure areas when extraction has been completed for use as water sports facilities and used by sailing clubs,https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/157505 water sports enthusiasts and to provide fishing areas. ==Education facilities== Nazeing has its own primary schoolhttp://www.nazeing.essex.sch.uk ‚Äì Nazeing Primary School is a Community School for children aged 4 to 11 years and is maintained by Essex County Council.

He is best known for his performances in the title role of Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons (From 1937-1947 on NBC Radio's Blue Network, which became the ABC network in 1945, then from 1947 to 1955 on CBS Radio). The drama was one of radio's longest running shows (October 12, 1937 to April 19, 1955), continuing well into the television era. ==Acting career== Unable to find an engineering job in the United States, he became an actor. Kilpack's first acting job was as Michael Cassio in Othello. World War I interrupted Kilpack's early stage career; he became a member of the Royal Flying Corps and was stationed in Canada as salvage department head at a large flying field. In this capacity, he dismantled the plane in which Vernon Castle, the dancer, crashed.Bennett Kilpack (Doc Barclay), Columbia Broadcasting System Biographical Service, 1939-11-29, on file at The New York Public Library, Lincoln Center He toured with Sir Philip Ben Greet's Shakespearean players, had several important parts in Broadway plays, and in 1927 was given the lead role in The Wayside Inn, an early radio serial. He subsequently played the part of Cephus in Way Back Home, which was presented on radio and as a film, with Phillips Lord as Seth Parker. As a radio serial it was also known as Sunday Night at Seth Parker's. Kilpack made his CBS debut in 1935 in Vanished Voices and subsequently played roles on CBS Radio in Hilltop House, Gang Busters, The Goldbergs, The Shadow and Grand Central Station. Kilpack began his run as Mr. Keen in 1937. For 18 years Keen and his faithful assistant, Mike Clancy, entertained followers with their intuitive perception that kept listeners coming back for more. With 1690 nationwide broadcasts, Mr. Keen was the most resilient private detective in a namesake role. The nearest competitors were Nick Carter, Master Detective (726 broadcasts), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (657) and The Adventures of the Falcon (473). Over a span of 13 years, Bennett appeared on nearly 1300 of the 1700 broadcasts. At age 67, Bennett made his last appearance as Mr. Keen on October 26, 1950, the show's 1314th broadcast. ==Family life== Bennett married Mabel Alice Cromer (b. May 4, 1890, Revere, MA) April 29, 1909, in Boston, MA.Mabel's birth certificate filed in the City Clerk's office, Revere, MA; and the Mabel and Bennett's marriage license is filed in the City Clerk's office, Chelsea, MA. Kilpack sent his wife to Paris but, according to The New York Times, failed to follow her there as he promised, so she divorced him there in March 1925 on grounds of desertion.Private conversations between this contributor and a relative, Gilbert Hawthorn Kilpack, who is now deceased, references legal documents indicating that the divorce was actually filed in Seine October 1, 1924. In September 1940, Bennett married a second time, to Dorothy Young Schisler (Mrs. Meryle Raymond Schisler, nee Young). Dorothy had been married once before, to Meryle Raymond Schisler (b.

Just before marrying, Meryle had served as a soldier in the Army at Schofield Military Reservation, Oahu, Hawaii. Prior to marrying Meryle and Bennett, Dorothy had a son, John Charles Stressling, born August 15, 1927, whom Bennett adopted, changing his surname to Kilpack. John's natural father, an emigrant from Germany, had died in an auto accident. John Charlie Young (sic), was admitted to St. Christopher's in Dobbs Ferry on October 4, 1935 -- a school that, at the time, admitted only protestant children of single parents. Records show that he was the child of a single parent -- Dorothy Young -- and that he was being raised by his maternal grandmother, Susan S. Young (nee Griggs, b. Aug. 11, 1876, Dedham, MA - d. July 14, 1954, Bangor, Maine). John met Admission criteria primarily because his grandmother, Susan S. Young, who had become a widow in April 1935, did not have means of support. Also, his mother, Dorothy was single at the time and did not have a job. John's room and board was financed by a foundation connected to St. Christopher's. John's mother later contributed money towards his room and board. John was discharged from the school on June 27, 1941. John Graduated from St. John's School in June 1945.St. John's School was a private military school for grades one through twelve. The academy's final June-Day was in 1958; after which, the property was sold to the Catholic Diocese of New York, and resumed operations as St. Ann's Parish School in Ossining.

Dorothy died of an overdose of sleeping pills (barbiturates).Dorothy Young Kilpack, Death Certificate 2404, General Register of Deaths, Bermuda, December 9, 1956.

White adipose tissue (WAT) or white fat is one of the two types of adipose tissue found in mammals. The other kind is brown adipose tissue. In healthy, non-overweight humans, white adipose tissue composes as much as 20% of the body weight in men and 25% in women. Its cells contain a single large fat droplet, which forces the nucleus to be squeezed into a thin rim at the periphery. They have receptors for insulin, sex hormones, norepinephrine, and glucocorticoids. White adipose tissue is used for energy storage. Upon release of insulin from the pancreas, white adipose cells' insulin receptors cause a dephosphorylation cascade that lead to the inactivation of hormone-sensitive lipase. It was previously thought that upon release of glucagon from the pancreas, glucagon receptors cause a phosphorylation cascade that activates hormone-sensitive lipase, causing the breakdown of the stored fat to fatty acids, which are exported into the blood and bound to albumin, and glycerol, which is exported into the blood freely. There is actually no evidence at present that glucagon has any effect on lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Glucagon is now thought to act exclusively on the liver to trigger glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The trigger for this process in white adipose tissue is instead now thought to be adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenaline and noradrenaline. Fatty acids are taken up by muscle and cardiac tissue as a fuel source, and glycerol is taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis. White adipose tissue also acts as a thermal insulator, helping to maintain body temperature. The hormone leptin is primarily manufactured in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue which also produces another hormone, asprosin. == References == Category:Connective tissue ","title":"White adipose tissue"},{"id":"12379223","text":"Asian Idol is a reality singing competition, which featured winners of Idol competitions from six Southeast and South Asian countries consisting of India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam. Part of the Idol franchise, it originated from the reality program Pop Idol created by British entertainment executive Simon Fuller, which was first aired in 2001 in the United Kingdom. The first season was won by Singapore Idol Hady Mirza, who was awarded an all-expense-paid trip around the world on business class, after almost two million votes were cast. The first season was held on 15 December and 16, 2007 in Jakarta, Indonesia. RCTI (which also broadcasts Indonesian Idol), was the main broadcaster, with the program shown live among participating countries. ==Season 1== The first season was hosted by Amelia \\"Ata\\" Natasha and Daniel Mananta, both from Indonesian Idol, and Malaysian Idol's Soo Kui Jien. Each participating country had its own system of determining its representative. (pdf file) As a kickoff to Asian Idol, all six contestants were introduced through a special presentation called Road to Asian Idol on 8 December 2007. Meanwhile, fans of each contestant will be able to choose the song they want their Idol to perform before the Asian Idol performance show. The Idols performed two songs each‚Äîone in English and another in their native language. In addition to the coverage of Asian Idol, RCTI ran a series of features called Asian Idol Extra between late November to mid-December 2007. Every competing country sent a judge to serve as the contestants' critics, but comments from only three judges on each performer were shown due to time constraints. Special guests in the Results Show included American Idol winner Taylor Hicks, Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian, Indian Idol judge Alisha Chinai, and Vietnam Idol judge Siu Black. It also featured performances by Rivermaya, Peterpan, and Agnes Monica. The production of Asian Idol was put up with the help of the production crew from Australian Idol.

Unlike the latter wherein the viewers get to vote for one contestant, the voting procedure for Asian Idol requires viewers to send SMS votes for two favorite Idols, thus allowing contestants to receive votes aside from their respective countries.Voting Procedures, Terms and Conditions Asian Idol Official Website As consideration on population size among the participating countries, tabulation of votes are done through an \\"Equal and Even Cumulative Method\\", wherein the total votes of each country are converted into percentages.Voting Procedures, Frequently Asked Questions Asian Idol Official Website The winner was said to be determined through 50% viewers' votes and 50% judges' scores, but this was not confirmed during the program. Partial results Daniel Hartono, project manager of Asian Idol, revealed during a press conference that Mohede received the highest number of actual votes at approximately one million in total. However, because of the show's voting process where 50% of votes per country goes to the second option Idol, Mohede's votes were slashed by half and total percentages of votes from other participating countries were added. Hady, meanwhile, got the highest number of \\"second option votes\\". In total, Hady got 115% while Mohede is in second place with 111% and Victor got the fewest votes. The rankings of other contestants were not revealed. Telecast schedule To address differences in time zones (and in some cases, telecast dates), shows about Asian Idol was broadcast on different time slots and dates depending on the country. For instance, viewers in Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia, watched Road to Asian Idol on 8 December 2007, while it was shown in Vietnam on 9 December 2007. Viewers in India and Singapore watched the preview program on 14 December 2007.On-Air Schedule of Asian Idol Asian Idol Official Website, Schedule section The Performance Night was taped on 12 December 2007, in Hall D2 of Arena Pekan Raya Jakarta.Free Ticket Details Asian Idol Official WebsiteEvent Listing of Asian Idol Performance Night PT Jakarta International Expo Website This program was seen first by viewers in Vietnam on 14 December 2007, followed by viewers in other participating countries on 15 December 2007, although in different time slots depending on time zones. The Results Show, meanwhile, was shown \\"live\\" on 16 December 2007, with varying time slots, depending on time zones. Pre-event activities The contestants for Asian Idol participated in activities promoting the program during their stay in Jakarta. On 7 December 2007, the contestants donated Rp12,985,000 (roughly US$1,500) to RCTI's Jalinan Kasih (Love Line Foundation) in Jakarta's Borobodur Hotel. A day later, they visited the presidential palace of Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Bogor. Controversies Sandeep Acharya, the second-season winner of Indian Idol, was dismayed over Sawant's selection to compete in Asian Idol. He claimed that Sony TV India, the broadcaster of Indian Idol, was supposed to hold a competition among its three winners to determine India's representative and he felt he was bypassed. Network representatives clarified that although they have the option to choose their representative, they were toying the idea of competing the three Indian Idol winners‚Äîincluding season 3 winner Prashant Tamang. However, it was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. There were reports of disrupted voting lines the Philippines, making SMS votes delayed by as much as eight hours until the morning of 16 December 2007. According to representatives of ABC, the Philippine broadcaster of Asian Idol, the glitch was caused by \\"a clog in the telephone companies\\". Reactions Hady Mirza's win came as a surprise, as at least three of the judges predicted that the winner would either be Marcelo, Mohede, or Victor. There were claims that Hady may have gotten the crucial second vote outside of his home country, wherein it is claimed that votes for strong candidates were paired with weak ones like Hady and Sawant who were trailing in Asian Idol's online survey. This voting tactic was said to avoid viewers' home Idols be beaten by their closest rivals. In Singapore, the victory stirred hopes of a revival of the country's golden age of music during the 1960s and 70's. Taufik Batisah, first season winner of Singapore Idol, said that the win is something their country should be proud of and hopefully this would \\"open the eyes and ears\\" of listeners. However, there were viewers in Singapore who still doubt Hady's singing ability, claiming that his performance in Asian Idol was not as strong as other competitors and it was a matter of \\"luck over talent\\". Singapore Idol judge Ken Lim reiterated that \\"looks and voice\\" had won the title for Hady. Meanwhile, Hady shrugged off speculations that he won because he was a \\"non- threat\\", but considered himself an underdog and that he did \\"pretty well\\" in terms of sincerity and connecting with the audience. Filipino TV and movie critic Nestor U. Torre mentioned that he was not surprised about Hady's win, even lauding him for his \\"impressively cool yet dynamic\\" performances. He also appreciated Victor and Phuong Vy's performances. While Torre was also equally impressed by Marcelo and Mohede's voices, he also said that their girth worked to their disadvantage. On Sawant, Torre noted that his \\"balladeer\\" projection was \\"less dynamic\\" with his country's large voting population failing him. Despite the surprises and disappointments in the competition, Torre regarded Asian Idol a success as it produced relatively new talents in the Asian and international music scene. ==Season 2== Fotini Paraskakis, FremantleMedia Asia's production director (which holds the Idol franchises in the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia) reported that the second season will not take place in 2008, and is planning to launch on 2009 due to several reasons (Kazakhstan, Malaysian and Singapore franchises ended, relaunch of the Philippine franchise, delayed launch of India and Vietnam, cancellation of the Pakistan franchise). Thailand (which will have its franchise soon) is reported to participate in the event. ==References== Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:2007 television series debuts Category:2007 television series endings ","title":"Asian Idol"},{"id":"12379242","text":"The Cenotaph is a war memorial constructed in 1923 and located between Statue Square and the City Hall in Central, Hong Kong,Brief Information on Proposed Grade I Items, pp. 53‚Äì54 that commemorates the dead in the two world wars who served in Hong Kong in the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force.

Two years later, after defeating the British and French at the Second Battle of the Dagu Forts, he and Li Chaoyi (ÊùéÊúùÂÑÄ) oversaw the construction of artillery batteries in Ninghe, Yingcheng (ÁáüÂüé) and the Dagu Forts to resist an invasion. In 1860, after the British and French defeated Qing forces at the Third Battle of the Dagu Forts and occupied Tianjin, Sengge Rinchen and his army retreated to Tongzhou. When an Anglo-French delegation led by Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch showed up in Tongzhou for peace negotiations with Prince Yi and other Qing representatives, Sengge Rinchen ordered the delegation to be arrested and sent to Beijing, where most of them (excluding Parkes and Loch) died of disease or torture. During the Battle of Baliqiao, he led his elite Mongol cavalry to attack the Anglo-French forces but was utterly defeated and his cavalry was almost completely wiped out. After entering Beijing, Lord Elgin (the British High Commissioner to China) ordered the British and French troops to burn down the Old Summer Palace in retaliation for the torture and deaths of the delegation. Sengge Rinchen was stripped of his nobility title for his failure to drive back the invaders, but retained his appointment as Imperial Commissioner. ==Death== When the Qing imperial court received news of the Nian Rebellion, Sengge Rinchen was ordered to lead troops to Shandong, Henan and Anhui to suppress the rebellion. In 1865, during the Battle of Gaolou Fort, he was ambushed in a tavern near Gaolou Fort in Heze, Shandong by Nian rebels led by Lai Wenguang and Song Jingshi. He attempted to escape with some of his horsemen and take shelter in the woods but was killed by a minor rebel leader, Zhang Pigeng. ==Legacy== The Qing imperial court sent couriers to retrieve and transport Sengge Rinchen's remains back to Beijing, in addition to not holding any court sessions for three days as a mark of mourning. The Tongzhi Emperor, accompanied by the empress dowagers Ci'an and Cixi, personally attended the funeral and ordered a shrine to be erected to commemorate Sengge Rinchen. The shrine, called \\"Xianzhongci\\" (È°ØÂø†Á•†; \\"Shrine of Displaying Loyalty\\"), used to stand at the current location of Kuanjie Primary School (ÂØ¨Ë°óÂ∞èÂ≠∏) in Beijing's Dongcheng District. Sengge Rinchen's loyalty to the Qing Empire is interpreted in official histories of the People's Republic of China as an expression of Chinese patriotism. In 1995, the local government in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia opened a Sengge Rinchen Memorial Museum. ==Family== Sengge Rinchen was survived by his son, Buyannemek√º (–ë—É—è–Ω–Ω—ç–º—ç—Ö, ‰ºØÂΩ•Ë®•Ë¨®Á•ú; 1836‚Äì91), who inherited his princely title. Buyannemek√º's eldest son, Nersu (–ù—ç—Ä—Å“Ø, ÈÇ£ÁàæËòá; 1855‚Äì90), held the title of a beile and married the eldest daughter of Yixuan, Prince Chun. Nersu was, in turn, succeeded by his son, Amurlingkui (–ê–º—É—Ä–ª–∏–Ω–≥—É–π, ÈòøÁ©ÜÁàæÈùàÂú≠; 1886‚Äì1930). Buyannemek√º had five other sons, three of whom became lamas. His sixth son, Bodisu (–ë–æ–¥–∏—Å—É, ÂçöËø™Ëòá; 1871‚Äì1914), was briefly a senator in the National Assembly at the beginning of the Republican era. ==References== *T√™ng, Ssu-y√º (1944). \\"S»áng-ko-lin-ch'in\\".

The nodes are conjoined by an arc, to distinguish them from children of N that might be associated with other methods. A node N, labelled by a problem P, is a success node if there is a method of the form P if nothing (i.e., P is a \\"fact\\"). The node is a failure node if there is no method for solving P. If all of the children of a node N, conjoined by the same arc, are success nodes, then the node N is also a success node. Otherwise the node is a failure node. ==Search strategies== An and-or tree specifies only the search space for solving a problem. Different search strategies for searching the space are possible. These include searching the tree depth-first, breadth-first, or best-first using some measure of desirability of solutions. The search strategy can be sequential, searching or generating one node at a time, or parallel, searching or generating several nodes in parallel. ==Relationship with logic programming== The methods used for generating and-or trees are propositional logic programs (without variables). In the case of logic programs containing variables, the solutions of conjoint sub-problems must be compatible. Subject to this complication, sequential and parallel search strategies for and-or trees provide a computational model for executing logic programs. ==Relationship with two-player games== And‚Äìor trees can also be used to represent the search spaces for two-person games. The root node of such a tree represents the problem of one of the players winning the game, starting from the initial state of the game. Given a node N, labelled by the problem P of the player winning the game from a particular state of play, there exists a single set of conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the opponents responding moves. For each of these children nodes, there exists a set of non- conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the player's defending moves. For solving game trees with proof-number search family of algorithms, game trees are to be mapped to and-or trees. MAX-nodes (i.e. maximizing player to move) are represented as OR nodes, MIN-nodes map to AND nodes. The mapping is possible, when the search is done with only a binary goal, which usually is \\"player to move wins the game\\". ==Bibliography== * * Category:Trees (data structures) Category:Artificial intelligence ","title":"And‚Äìor tree"},{"id":"12379470","text":"Swimming at the 1st Pan American Games took place February 26-March 7, 1951, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.1951 Pan Ams Aquatics history , published by the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2011-10 to mark the 60th anniversary of the games.

Spilsbury was an all-round athlete at Rossall School and later Repton School, where he played football, cricket and athletics. At Repton he was school champion 4 times in long jump, and in 1882 he broke the school record. He enrolled at Jesus College in Cambridge, and he played football for Cambridge University from 1884 to 1887. In his last year at the university, he was also captain of the team. == Career == He made his debut for the international team against Ireland on 28 February 1885. Spilsbury played three games for England, and scored five goals., Retrieved 23 March 2019 His biggest game for England came in 1886, when he scored four of England's goals in a 6‚Äì1 win over Ireland. Derby County F.C. After representing Cambridge University and his country, he played games for Derby County from 1884 to 1889. He is best remembered for scoring the first recorded Derby goal in 1884. In total he played eight FA cup games, scoring seven FA cup goals. He also played one league game, scoring one goal. Spilsbury played a major role in the FA Cup in the years before League football. Inside-right had proved a problem position for Derby County to fill and, by the end of the year, 1888, Derby County had already tried five different players at that position. The last had been Alexander Higgins, known as Sandy Higgins but as the visit to Aston Villa approached (29 December 1888), Higgins was not available, so Derby County called up Spilsbury to make his League debut. Aston Villa dominated the first half and were 2‚Äì0 up by the halfway mark in the first-half. Spilsbury then scored what was described as a fine goal, to put Derby County back in contention. As the first-half came to an end, despite some \\"fine saves\\" by Derby County goalkeeper, Joseph Marshall, Aston Villa re- established their 2-goal lead. The second half was more even. Villa dominated the early exchanges ad went 4‚Äì1 up. Derby County came back into the match and George Bakewell got a second goal for Derby County to make the final score look more respectable. The match against Aston Villa was Spilsbury' only League match. His goal was his only League goal. Spilsbury played one more time for Derby County. He was selected to replace Thomas Needham for the FA Cup first round tie against non-League Derby Junction F.C. The match was played on 2 February 1889 and Derby County won 1‚Äì0. Derby County finished 10th in the Football League scoring 41 goals, and went out of the FA Cup in the second round.

One of the best utility players in the VFL, he was an excellent high mark and long kick. A determined player with a good turn of pace. As a half-forward flanker he was one of the best in the 1933 flag win. Reville debuted for South Melbourne in 1925 and appeared for the club 156 times before leaving. Reville's last game with the southerners was the premiership play-off of the following year when his admirable all round performance as a half forward-cum-follower was insufficient to prevent the Tigers achieving their revenge. Never one to take a backward step, Reville was also reported no fewer than three times during the match, but he escaped suspension by leaving the VFL scene for the VFA. The two administrative bodies often clashed and wouldn't enforce each other's decisions. Players could cross over competition without the need of a clearance. Coburg (VFA) He joined Coburg as captain-coach and stayed two years, winning the Recorder Cup in 1936, the VFA award for the competition's best and fairest player. Fitzroy (VFL) Reville resumed his VFL career in 1938, this time with Fitzroy. Still a handy player, he added 22 games and 27 goals to his tally over the ensuing couple of seasons before finally retiring. ==Military service== Peter enlisted in the Australian Army at Clifton Hill on the 17 November 1939.

It features a Jewish family's emigration from Russia in 1919, to Belgium and ultimately to the U.S., from the perspective of daughter Rifka, based on the personal account by Hesse's great-aunt Lucille Avrutin.Karen Hesse, \\"Author's Note\\", Letters from Rifka (Puffin Books, 1993; ), pp. ix‚Äìx. Hesse and Letters won the 2016 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association, recognizing the best children's book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award. Among contemporary honors it won the 1993 National Jewish Book Award in category Children's Literature. The protagonist's name, Rifka, is the East European Jewish version of Rebecca (Rivk√° in Modern Israeli Hebrew). == Plot == During the Russian Civil War of 1919, Rifka and her family must flee Russia because the Russian army are after her one of her brothers for leaving the army; the penalty for that is death for the entire family. She tells her story in a series of letters to a cousin named Tovah who remains behind in Russia, written in the blank spaces of an edition of Pushkin's poetry. Rifka, her parents, and her brothers, Nathan and Saul (who was abusive towards her in the past but changed throughout the course of the novel), escape Russia, hoping to join the three older sons who have been living in America. Along the way, they face many obstacles such as cruel officials, her mom, dad and older brother all catch typhus. They suffer through hunger, theft, and Rifka gets a skin disease, ringworm, which forces her to stay behind in Belgium while her family travels to America. In Belgium people are kind to Jewish people and she is able to recover from her illness. Once she recovers she can leave Belgium to travel to America to meet her family. She travels to America by a large ship where she befriends and develops romantic feelings for Pieter, a sailor. During the voyage, a dangerous storm occurs, killing Pieter. She arrives to Ellis island where she learns that her skin disease has returned and she can't enter America yet. While she is detained at Ellis Island, she finds she has a talent for nursing others to health. On Ellis island Rifka meets a new friend named Ilya, but he first does not talk to her nor will he eat her LIVA, so everyone thinks he's a simpleton. Once Rifka becomes better friends with him, she discovers that he is very smart. She helps him understand that his uncle is not cruel and wants him to come to America because he loves Ilya, and Ilya reads from Rifka's Pushkin poetry book. He passes the \\"Test\\" and makes it to America. Rifka gets over her ringworm, and gets to America to be with her family. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews called it \\"an unforgettable picture of immigrant courage, ingenuity, and perseverance.\\" while Publishers Weekly wrote \\"Hesse's vivacious tale colorfully and convincingly refreshes the immigrant experience.\\" ==References External links == * Formats and Editions of Letters from Rifka at WorldCat * Karen Hesse at Macmillan US Category:1992 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Epistolary novels Category:Jews and Judaism in fiction Category:Fiction set in 1919 Category:Henry Holt and Company books Category:1992 children's books Category:Novels about immigration to the United States Category:Fictional Russian Jews ","title":"Letters from Rifka"},{"id":"12379565","text":"Giorgos Zampetas (Pronounced 'Zabetas', , sometimes romanized as George Zambetas / George Zabetas / Giorgos Zabetas; 25 January 1925 in Athens ‚Äì 10 March 1992 in Athens) was a well-known bouzouki musician. His origins are from the island of Kythnos. ==Early years== Giorgos Zampetas, Greek music composer, singer and one of the greatest bouzouki artists was born in Metaxourgio area of Athens, on 25 January 1925. His parents were Mihalis Zampetas, a barber, and Marika Moraiti, the niece of a well-known baritone of those years. From a very young age, Zampetas showed a great interest in music: as he was helping his father in his barber shop, he secretly played his first melodies on a bouzouki. Anything that was producing sound seemed exciting to him and helped him in his compositions, as he said in his biography not long before he died. In 1932, as a seven year old first grader, he won his first prize, playing his first song in a school competition. At the young age of 13, Giorgos met one of the most famous figures in Greek music, and one of his idols, Vassilis Tsitsanis which played a fundamental role in his musical career. During the German occupation of Greece, in times of poverty and misery, Zampetas founded his first band in 1942, after having moved to the Egaleo neighborhood of Athens, 2 years prior to that. ==Career== He was one of the most recognized Greek musicians of all times, working in the Greek cinema of those years with stars such as Aliki Vouyouklaki. He appeared in many Greek film productions, and his compositions used in many, one of the most famous being \\"Siko Horepse Sirtaki\\". He also worked with famous Greek composers, such as Manos Hadjidakis in 1959, and there after collaborated with various leading Greek musicians such as Theodorakis, Stavros Xarchakos and many others. == Later years == Despite the struggles of the past decade, due to changes in music fashion, the 1990s brought about new records and releases by Zampetas. However, not too long after his brief revival, by 1992, he had reached not only the twilight of his career, but his life too. In early 1992, his health deteriorated and was diagnosed with bone cancer, which had already reached advanced stages. Prior to that, he had made one final appearance, before his eventual death. == Death == Zampetas died at the age of 67, in the Sotiria Hospital of Athens. He was survived by family in Greece, as well as extended family members throughout the Greek diaspora. == Legacy == He is recognised as one of the most famous and most significant composers, and musicians that have contributed to the Greek La√Øko music genre. His former neighbourhood of Egaleo (where he had spent his late teen years, and early twenties) honoured Zampetas by naming the town square in his name, to commemorate him in September 1990. == Songs == Below is a brief list of some of Zampetas' most recognisable songs; in brackets are the year of creation and the name of the lyricist: *Œ§Œø Œ∫ŒøœÖœÑŒøœçŒ∫Œπ (1960, Eftihia Papagianopoulou) *ŒîŒµŒΩ Œ≠œáŒµŒπ Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒø ŒΩŒ± Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤œé (1963, Dimitris Christodoulou) *ŒöŒπ Œ±ŒΩ Œ∏Œ± Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒØœÇ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩœå (1964, Dimitris Christodoulou) *Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÉœÑŒÆ œÑŒ± œáŒµŒØŒªŒ∑ œÉŒøœÖ (1964, Dimitris Christodoulou) *Œ§Œ± Œ¥ŒµŒπŒªŒπŒΩŒ¨ (1964, Charalampos Vasiliadis) *ŒûŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅœéŒºŒ±œÑŒ± (1965, Dimitris Christodoulou) *ŒúŒµ œÑŒø Œ≤ŒøœÅŒπŒ¨ (1965, Dimitris Christodoulou) *ŒúŒµœÉŒ¨ŒΩœÖœáœÑŒ± œÄŒøœÖ Œ∏Œ± œÉŒµ Œ≤œÅœâ (1965, Dimitris Christodoulou) *Œ£ŒÆŒ∫œâ œáœåœÅŒµœàŒµ œÉœÖœÅœÑŒ¨Œ∫Œπ (1965, Alekos Sakelarios) *ŒßŒ±ŒºœåŒ≥ŒµŒªŒø (1965, Alekos Sakelarios) *Œ§Œø Œ¶Œ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫Œπ (1965, Œì.

The third Baronet was a Deputy Lieutenant of Perthshire. As of 2007 the presumed fourth Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant. He has also chosen not to use his title. ==Muir baronets, of Deanston and Park Gardens, Glasgow (1892)== The grave of Sir John Muir of Deanston, Kincardine-in-Menteith The grave of Sir John Harling Muir, Kincardine-in-Menteith *Sir John Muir, 1st Baronet (1828‚Äì1903) Lord Provost of Glasgow *Sir Alexander Kay Muir, 2nd Baronet (1868‚Äì1951) *Sir John Harling Muir, 3rd Baronet (1910‚Äì1994) * Richard James Kay Muir, presumed 4th Baronet (born 1939) The family are buried at Kincardine-in-Menteith on the road from Deanston to Stirling, just west of Blair Drummond. ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The treaty, signed by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire, ended the second phase of the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì76). It revised the 1672 Treaty of Buchach, and was more favorable to the Commonwealth, which no longer had to pay tribute, and regained about one third of the Ukrainian territories lost in the Buchach treaty. It also stipulated that the Lipka Tatars were to be given a free individual choice of whether they wanted to serve the Ottoman Empire or the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In order to ratify the treaty, the Commonwealth sent to Istanbul Jan Gninski, the voivode of Chelmno Voivodeship. He stayed there in 1677-1678, but in the meantime, Polish Sejm refused to ratify the document. Soon afterwards, the Great Turkish War broke out. After the Treaty of Karlowitz, Podolia returned to Poland.

Barry J Hugman is a Scottish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Hughes started out with semi-professional side Clydebank before joining Chelsea in 1966. However, he was always understudy to Peter Bonetti whilst with the west London side, meaning he made just 11 appearances in four years. Hughes won two Scottish under-23 caps while at Chelsea.Chelsea Football Club The Full Statistical Story 1905-1986 by Scott Cheshire and Ron Hockings Hughes was transferred to Aston Villa for ¬£12,500 in May 1971. Hughes played sixteen times for Aston Villa in 1971-72, when Villa just pipped Brighton & Hove Albion for the Third Division championship. Hughes then lost his place at Aston Villa to Jim Cumbes. He went on loan to Brighton for a month in February 1973 when Brighton were struggling at the bottom of the Second Division. Hughes played three games for Brighton, whose manager Pat Saward was keen to sign him as permanently. Brighton could not match the asking price, and Hughes was transferred to Hereford United in August 1973 for ¬£15,000. He spent nine seasons with Hereford United, and was a part of the side which won the Third Division championship in 1975-76. He was later caretaker manager of the club during the 1982-83 season. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Scottish footballers Category:Clydebank F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Trowbridge Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Hereford United F.C. managers Category:Scotland under-23 international footballers Category:Sportspeople from West Dunbartonshire Category:People from Clydebank ","title":"Tommy Hughes (footballer, born 1947)"},{"id":"12379605","text":"Isurus is a genus of mackerel sharks in the family Lamnidae, commonly known as the mako sharks. ==Description== The two living species are the common shortfin mako shark (I. oxyrinchus) and the rare longfin mako shark (I. paucus).

The Scalan was once a seminary and was one of the few places in Scotland where the Roman Catholic faith was kept alive during the troubled times of the 18th century. ==History== For much of the 18th century, the college at Scalan in the Braes of Glenlivet was the only place in Scotland where young men were trained to be priests, the so-called \\"heather priests\\".Ground floor plan from Scalan.co.uk, retrieved 15 June 2016 From 1717 to 1799, over a hundred were trained despite numerous attacks by Hanoverian soldiers. The college played a vital role in keeping the traditional Catholic faith alive in northern Scotland. It was named after the Gaelic word for turf sheilings (\\"galan\\") found in the Braes during that period. In 1799, the college was moved to a less remote site, Aquhorthies College, which had larger premises and more accommodation. Alexander Geddes, Scottish theologian and scholar, was among the famous figures who studied at the college. George James Gordon, known as the \\"heather priest\\" was educated here and then taught here as a non-Jesuit for many years.http://www.stmaryscathedralaberdeen.org/about-us/brief-history/ The last permanent resident of the Scalan was Sandy Mattheson, who died in late 2005. ==Today== Visitors today will note that the college is largely invisible until you are very close to the college, a factor invaluable in evading detection by the Hanoverian soldiers.

He was an early member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours when it was founded in 1804, and exhibited prolifically, never missing an exhibition for 38 years. Little is known of his early years, except that in 1767 he was born in Orchard Street in London, off Portman Square, where his father lived after moving from his native Ireland. George Barret was seventeen when he and his brothers and sisters were left fatherless, and had to support themselves by their own efforts. Three of them, beside himself, took to the practice of art, but George was by far the most gifted artistically. His earlier works were views of the Thames Valley and Home Counties and a few of Wales, but he increasingly turned to romantic compositions of a Claudian type showing poetic sunrises and sunsets without reference to locality. A truly visionary painter, his artistic power remained unimpaired to the last, even though his life was one long struggle against financial ruin. He lived most of his life in Paddington, where he died on 19 March 1842. He was buried in the ancient churchyard of St. Mary's, Paddington. ==References== *J.L. Roget.

He received his education at Otorohanga District High School, later renamed as Otorohanga College. He attended Auckland Teachers College followed by the University of Auckland. He was a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) pilot in the Pacific in World War II. After demobilizing in 1946 he went to Teachers' College and University, where he studied both anthropology and politics. He had a passion for human rights and was strongly opposed to racism, in particular the apartheid system in South Africa and Rhodesia. This lead him to sign up with the Princes Street branch of the Labour Party in 1949 contrasting with the strong National Party affiliation in his father's family. As a teacher Amos aspired to be his own boss and chose to work at a sole-charge school to avoid taking orders from a principal. He then won promotion to a two-teacher school which he could also be principal of. He later taught at intermediate and secondary schools as well. Amos and his wife Jill worked as teachers in isolated communities where they were confronted by the challenges facing Maori and Pacific people due to rural isolation and later urban migration. There they taught student notions such as non-violence, racial equality and belief in parental involvement in schools. Such attitudes were then uncommon in New Zealand education circles. Political career In he stood for Labour in the Rodney electorate, coming second. He was then elected the Member of Parliament for Manurewa from defeating cabinet minister Leon G√∂tz. He was appointed Labour's education spokesperson by leader Norman Kirk while the party was in opposition. Kirk appointed Amos Minister of Education in the Third Labour Government from 1972 to 1975, and also served as the last Minister of Island Affairs from 1972 to 1974.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vols. 382-389 (1973-1974). As Minister of Education, he passed the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act which drove the integration of Catholic and private schools with a system which provided them with state funding and worked towards the reduction of class sizes. Allowing private schools to voluntarily integrate with the state system without sacrificing their particular character was seen as outside the traditional Labour Party policy sphere. In he was defeated in an upset in the normally safe Labour seat by Merv Wellington. Amos found Kirk's leadership and vision inspiring and thought his death in 1974 to be a crushing blow to Labour. Consequently he was unsurprised when in 1975 the Labour government was defeated by the National Party. Later life In July 1976, less than a year after he had lost his parliamentary seat and cabinet post, he protested the visit of the 20,000 tonne American cruiser Long Beach in his small yacht the Dolphin. He impeded its entry to Auckland Harbour. The cruiser was forced to stop mid-stream to allow grappling hooks to be thrown to pull the Dolphin clear. Afterwards Amos was arrested and charged with obstruction. He was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal by criminal defense lawyer David Lange. Amos' protest instantly became a headline-grabbing piece of political drama from which he took a lot of personal satisfaction at bringing public attention to the ant-nuclear issue. Lange would later become Prime Minister and passed a law banning the visit by nuclear propelled or armed ships with Amos' support. As a friend of the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, he accepted an invitation to be an education advisor as well as a Swahili interpreter/translator, assisting the local police, courts and other government agencies. He lived in a remote part of Tanzania from 1977 to 1988. His wife Jill went back to New Zealand in 1979 and they later divorced. He then worked as a lecturer at a teachers' college before moving with his second wife, a fellow lecturer Odilia, to work a farm near her home village on the remote slopes of Mount Kilamanjaro (even climbing to the top himself). He made a living by operating a flour mill he built to serve local farmers and also grew bananas, avocados, pineapple, corn, and vegetables on the one hectare plot they owned. Amos said the period in his life as one of finding new challenges which met his personal philosophies In 1985 he made headlines in New Zealand again after it was rumoured he had died following a failure to reply to an invitation from David Lange to attend a reception he was also attending in Dar-es-Salaam. Amos later said his \\"disappearance\\" was just an invention of the media. His first wife Jill said it was unusual for a former cabinet minister to voluntarily live in such a remote place but also stating \\"...he always was an unusual politician.\\" A parliamentary colleague Richard Mayson who travelled to Tanzania to visit him, described Amos as living the life of a 20th-century version of David Livingstone. In 1988 he returned to Auckland and immediately became disillusioned with the then state of the Labour Party and horrified by New Zealand's economic reforms, Rogernomics, which pushed for free market economy and privatisation of state assets. He protested by joining Jim Anderton's NewLabour Party (NLP) soon after it was formed and later became president of the party. He told Anderton he was \\"devastated by the actions of the Labour Party\\". He received many invitations to stand for parliament again for the NLP, but declined after consultation with his family who thought he was of better use as a \\"supportive and wise head for the new breed of NLP politicians.\\" Amos was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. Death Amos was a heavy smoker most of his life. He had been admitted to hospital several times in the months before he died in Auckland on 8 June 2007 of lung failure, aged 81. He was survived by his first and second wives and children from both his marriages. ==Personal life== He married Jill Edwina Turner in 1949, the daughter of Ross Turner, and had two sons and one daughter with her. His second marriage was to Odilia. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==Further reading== * :*This interview was conducted by Neville Glasgow.

In 1656, the castle and estate was sold to George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie also known as George MacKenzie of Tarbet. He renamed the estate New Tarbat after Tarbat Castle (now more commonly known as Ballone Castle), the family's original seat near Portmahomack. Mackenzie had the Milntown Castle pulled down and only part of the basement survives. He then replaced the castle with a new mansion built nearby. When the new mansion was built, the old Milntown Castle was remodelled as part of the garden. That mansion was itself demolished and in 1787 was replaced with a Georgian house (now known as Tarbat House) by his descendant John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod. ==Accounts of the castle== Although the castle no longer exists, descriptions of the building are provided in some books including the History of the Earldom of Sutherland by Sir Robert Gordon (1580-1625) and the History of the Munros of Fowlis written by Alexander Mackenzie in 1898.

Alderson suffered an unstable childhood, variously living with relatives, unhappily attending Charterhouse School but, more positively, being tutored by Edward Maltby. He was an able student of mathematics and classics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, about to take exams he heard of the sad death of his sister Isabella. A year later in 1809 he graduated as senior wrangler, First Smith's prize, was First Medallist, and Chancellor's Gold Medallist. During free time he became an ardent debater and avid reader; winning Middle Bachelors, and the Latin Prize for Comparison of Ancient Dialogues with Modern. In his finals year he also won the Members Prize, and Senior Bachelors Prize. He was consequently elected fellow. A pupil of Joseph Chitty, Alderson was called to the bar in 1811 at the Inner Temple and began work on the northern circuit where he established a substantial practice. He joined with Richard Barnewall as a law reporter from 1817 to 1822. On 26 October 1823 he married Georgina Drewe (died 1871) and the couple had many children. An early indication of his abilities came in 1825 when he was instructed by opponents of the proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway, principally the directors of the Bridgewater and Leeds and Liverpool Canals, as their counsel in the committee stage of the private bill needed to establish the railway. Alderson was to cross-examine George Stephenson on his designs for the railway and the surveys on which they were based. Alderson proved an able advocate and Stephenson a poor witness. Stephenson later confessed, \\"I was not long in the witness box before I began to wish for a hole to creep out at.\\" Largely owing to Alderson's devastating closing speech, the bill was lost, the railway was delayed for several years and Stephenson's early reputation badly damaged. ==Judicial career== Alderson was appointed to the Common Law Commission in 1828 and a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1830, with the attendant knighthood. He became a Baron of the Exchequer in the Exchequer of Pleas in 1834, and transferred to the Court of Chancery in 1841. He was an advocate of the plasticity of the common law in adapting to the changing times. According to Hedley, he was popular and jocular, a \\"clever, analytical, and forthright judge, with little patience for those of lesser abilities\\". He never sought to be a Queen's Counsel or Member of Parliament. ==Personality and family== Though, as a criminal judge at the assizes, he was instrumental in suppressing the Luddites and Chartists, he believed that rehabilitation was the principal goal of sentencing. He was dubious of the effects of deterrence and argued for the limitation of capital punishment, himself seeking to disapply it, by whatever technical means he could creatively devise. An active member of the Church of England and a close friend of Bishop of London Charles James Blomfield, Alderson supported the Gorham judgment which held that the Church was subject to secular law. He was a noted advocate of affirmation as an alternative to the oath for witnesses but opposed the growing contemporary campaign for secular education. Hedley describes Alderson as a \\"Conservative... suspicious of the 'tyranny' he saw in democracy\\". Alderson established homes in London and Lowestoft where he wrote poetry, in English and Latin, and corresponded with his cousin, novelist Amelia Opie. He was also an enthusiastic and knowledgeable follower of horse racing.Foulkes (2010) p213 While sitting at Liverpool assizes in December 1856, he heard of a serious injury to one of his sons and collapsed. He died the following January at his London home from a brain disease. He was buried at St Mary Magdalen's Church, Risby, near Bury St Edmunds. Alderson's daughter Georgina Charlotte married British statesman, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury in 1857. Salisbury's father, James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, opposed the marriage owing to Georgina's lack of wealth and social standing.Grenville, J. A. S.

Palmer, Alex. Yalgoo, p. 161-164 ==Description== It was a traditional sheep station until having the lease transferred to a nature conservation estate in 2006. Recognised as an important parcel of land that links the western and eastern end of other conservation estates, also once pastoral leases which were purchased since 1995. The area lies in the Yalgoo IBRA region and is characterised by open mulga woodlands and sandy scrubland. The area is rich in ephemerals and is noted for its rich wildflower displays in spring. ==History== Prior to 1891 the station was owned by Samuel Eakins and S. F. Moore. These partners sold the property in 1897, at the time it occupied an area of and was carrying 1,490 sheep, 7 head of cattle and 10 horses. Dingoes were a large problem at the station, prompting the station owner, Chas Beaton, to write to the Minister of Lands to ask that the bounty for dingoes to be increased. The station continued to prosper with it selling 76 bales of wool at the Colonial Wool Sales in London in 1906, and then 106 bales in 1907. A carpenter named Philip Lothar Scheer, committed suicide at the station in 1910. Donald Beaton, E.A Marsh and H. Stanbridge were empanelled on the jury to conduct an inquest into the man's death. They determined that Scheer died as the result of a self-inflicted gunshot to the mouth while in a fit of temporary insanity. The station sold 167 bales of wool at the London wool sales in January 1910, followed by 87 bales in December the same year then another 85 bales in February 1911 and 25 more bales in April the same year. The flock size in 1912 was estimated at 15,000 sheep with shearing set to commence in early September in the six-stand shearing shed. The lessee in 2012 was the Conservation and Land Management Executive body. ==Lignum Swamp== The station also contains the Thundelarra Lignum Swamp. The wetland is a shrub dominated fresh water marsh with a sandy-clay bed. It lies in a sump that is slightly undulating interspersed with low rocky hills. The wetland receives water from a creek system that originated in a range situated about 25 km away. Filling every five to ten years the wetland reaches a depth of about 1.5m and is regarded as an important habitat and breeding ground for water birds. ==Fiction== The Quidditch team the Thundelarra Thunders has been associated with the name. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==NotesReferences== *Palmer, Alex.(1985) Yalgoo Fremantle, W.A : Lap Industries Category:Mid West (Western Australia) Category:Homesteads in Western Australia Category:Pastoral leases in Western Australia ","title":"Thundelarra"},{"id":"12379792","text":"Bahareh Hedayat (, born 1981) is an Iranian student activist and campaigner for women's rights.

He frequently worked in minor roles with director John Ford and when Raoul Walsh suggested him for the lead in The Big Trail (1930), an epic Western shot in an early widescreen process called Fox Grandeur, Ford vouched for him. Wayne's early period as a star would be brief, as Fox dropped him after only three leads. He then appeared in a string of low-budget action films (mostly Westerns) before garnering more recognition with the 1939 film Stagecoach. During the 1940s and early 1950s, Wayne starred in Reap the Wild Wind (1942), Wake of the Red Witch (1948), Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), Rio Grande (1950), and Red River (1948). Some of his more notable war movies include Flying Tigers (1942), The Fighting Seabees (1944), They Were Expendable (1945), and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. The 1950s would see Wayne star in an Ireland-set romantic comedy The Quiet Man (1952) and two westerns, The Searchers (1956) and Rio Bravo (1959). Wayne also continued his producing activities during this period, and formed his own production company, Batjac. During the 1960s and 1970s, Wayne starred in more Westerns, such as the 1969 film True Grit, in which his role as Rooster Cogburn earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor. He would reprise that role in the 1975 film Rooster Cogburn. He also played in several war films, including The Longest Day (1962) and In Harm's Way (1965). Wayne starred in his final film, The Shootist in 1976, ending his acting career of 50 years, 169 feature length films,Landesman, pp. 417‚Äì418. and various other television appearances or voice-overs. ==Filmography== Blue Steel (1934) Publicity still of Wayne and Nancy Olson for Big Jim McLain (1952) On the set of In Harm's Way (1964) As actor { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Role ! scope=\\"col\\"  Director ! scope=\\"col\\" class=unsortable  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" class=unsortable  Refs. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1926  Brown of Harvard  Yale Football Player  Jack Conway  Uncredited  center\\"  Landesman, pp. 53‚Äì55. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1926  Bardelys the Magnificent  Guard  King Vidor  Uncredited  center\\" Landesman, pp. 29‚Äì31. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1926  ''''  Extra  Lewis Seiler  Uncredited  center\\" Landesman, pp. 124‚Äì126. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1927  Annie Laurie  Extra  John S.

Through these he made the valuable discovery that sunspots generate large amounts of microwaves at the 10.7 cm wavelength, offering a simple all-weather method to measure and predict sunspot activity, and their associated effects on communications. The sunspot detection program has run continuously to this day. ==Early life and education== Covington was born in Regina and grew up in Vancouver. He showed an early interest in astronomy, and had built a refractor telescope after meeting members of the local chapter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.The Development of Solar Microwave Radio Astronomy in Canada He was also interested in amateur radio and operated station VE3CC for a time. He started his career as a radio operator on ships operated by the Canadian National Railways. He put himself through school and eventually earned a bachelor's degree from the University of British Columbia in 1938, and obtained his master's degree from the same institution in 1940 after building an electron microscope. He then moved to University of California in Berkeley where he received his doctoral degree in nuclear physics in 1942.Arthur Edwin Covington (1913-2001) He was still at Berkeley when he was invited to join the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) in Ottawa in 1942 as a radar technician, working at the NRC's Radio Field Station.The Riche-Covington Collection -- History of Radio Astronomy ==Solar observations== Immediately after the war Covington became interested in radio astronomy, and built a small telescope out of the electronic parts from a surplus SCR-268 radar combined with parts from another receiver originally built to test silicon crystal radio parts for radar applications. These electronics were attached to the 4 ft (1.2 m) parabolic dish from a Type III gun-laying radar. The system operated at a frequency of 2800 MHz, or a wavelength of 10.7 cm. Initially the instrument was pointed in the direction of various celestial objects, including Jupiter, the Milky Way, aurora borealis, and the Sun, but it proved too insensitive to pick up any source other than the Sun.The History of the 10.7cm Solar Flux So a solar study program was started. As time passed, Covington and his colleagues realized that the Sun's emission at 10.7 cm wavelength was varying, which was unexpected. Thinking at that time was that the solar emission at centimeter wavelengths would be simply black body emission from a ball of hot gas. Covington became convinced that the effect was due to sunspots, as the flux appeared to vary with the number of visible spots. The resolution of the device, about seven degrees, made it impossible to \\"pick out\\" a spot on the sun's surface for study, making a demonstration of the claim difficult. An opportunity to directly measure this possibility presented itself on November 23, 1946 when a partial solar eclipse passed over the Ottawa area, and Covington was able to conclusively demonstrate that the microwave emissions dropped off precipitously when the Moon covered a particularly large sunspot. This also demonstrated that magnetic fields were instrumental in sunspot activity. It was entirely by accident that the original instrument operated on frequencies suitable to detection of the 10.7 cm signal, and it had never been intended for \\"production\\" use. As the importance of the sunspot measurements became obvious, plans were made to continue these observations over a longer time period. As the Radio Field Station was still actively being used for radar development, and causing heavy interference as a result, a new location was selected about five miles (8 km) away at Goth Hill.Algonquin Radio Observatory, Lake Traverse, Ont., Canada Here they measured the whole-disk flux and averaged the measurements to produce three highly accurate measurements a day. He then set about designing an instrument that could directly resolve portions of the sun's disk. The new telescope consisted of a 150 ft (46 m) long section of 3 by 1¬Ω inch metal waveguide cut with slots in locations to create a simple interferometer with a fan-shaped area of sensitivity. The amount of flux gathered was improved by placing the waveguide in metal trough, and the direction of aim could be changed slightly by rotating the waveguide inside the trough, but in general terms it was used to take measurements as the sun passed through its \\"beam\\". The new telescope started operation in 1951, allowing them to directly measure the flux from the Sun's corona and the temperature of the regions above sunspots (about 1,500,000 ¬∞C). The Goth Hill observatory also included a number of other instruments for a variety of measurements. ==ARO== Increasing radar and radio use in the Ottawa area presented interference problems, and Covington turned his attention to finding a more suitable \\"radio quiet\\" location for the program. This led to the creation of the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO) in Algonquin Park, about 150 km northwest of Ottawa but relatively easy to access on major highways. A new 6 ft (1.8 m) parabolic dish solar flux telescope was built in 1960, operating in parallel before taking over duties from the Goth Hill instrument in 1962. In 1964 an identical instrument was installed at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) in British Columbia. This was followed by a more powerful version of the waveguide instrument, this time focused by a series of thirty-two 10 ft (3 m) dishes arranged over a 700 ft (215 m) waveguide, which opened in 1966. The ARO was greatly expanded in 1966 with the opening of the 150 ft (46 m) deep- space telescope. This was a major research site through the 1960s and 70s, although limitations in its design made it see less use in the 1980s. For some time this instrument was joined by a smaller 18 m telescope originally located at the David Dunlap Observatory outside Toronto, operated by the University of Toronto. The original solar observatories remained in use until 1990 when funding drawdowns at the NRC forced the closure of the entire Algonquin site. In 1991 the 1.8 m dish was moved to the DRAO as a backup instrument.Introducing the Solar Radio Monitoring Programme Covington's work led to other solar-related discoveries. Observations in 1969 led to the realization that certain types of major sunspot breakouts were preceded by a particular type of radio signal, which allowed advanced prediction of upcoming solar storms.Decrease of 2800 MHz solar radio emission associated with a moving dark filament before the flare of May 19, 1969Observations and comments for the solar event of 24 October, 1969 As other teams also started studying the solar flux they noticed that the different teams all came to different conclusions about the total flux, due to differences in the instruments and other effects. Covington worked on an effort to correlate these measurements and solve a single flux number, which was published in 1972.Absolute calibration of solar radio flux density in the microwave region He also played a role in the construction of the Indian River Observatory, an amateur built 200 m interferometer.A Brief History of the Indian River Observatory Radio Interferometer ==Retirement== Covington remained director of the ARO until he retired in 1978. He died in 2001 in Kingston, Ontario, at the age of 88. ==Legacy== In 2003, the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory named their new main building in Covington's honour.New NRC Building Named After Father of Canadian Radio Astronomy The Herzberg Astronomy & Astrophysics Research Centre of the National Research Council of Canada established the Covington Fellowship in 2008.Covington Fellowship Covington had many hobbies including a fondness for rare books, many of which have been donated to Queen's University in the Riche-Covington collection.Arthur Edwin Covington (1914-2001) ==Notes== # The exact location of \\"Goth Hill\\" is not known, as this term does not appear on modern maps. According to the City of Ottawa Archives, it is likely located on a plot of land south of the downtown Ottawa area, a plot formerly owned by Robert Goth that appears in the Beldon Atlas, 1878. The terms \\"hill\\" and \\"ridge\\" were commonly applied to otherwise nondescript land throughout the Gloucester Township area. The Goth plot lies off the eastern end of runway 25 of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport, west of CFS Leitrim. This location fits with all of the known references, which describe it as being \\"five miles south of Ottawa in South Gloucester\\". ==References== Category:1913 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Canadian physicists ","title":"Arthur Covington"},{"id":"12379887","text":"John Stewart Detlie (December 23, 1908 ‚Äì November 30, 2005) was an American motion picture art director/set designer in Hollywood from 1937 to 1942. Detlie earned degrees in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. He was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941 for Best Art Direction for the film Bitter Sweet. Detlie went on to serve in the Army in World War II, including directing the camouflage of Boeing Plant 2 in Seattle. He went on to a career in architecture, designing Temple De Hirsch Sinai in Seattle and a number of large churches and parts of downtown Honolulu. He was an accomplished artist in water colors, acrylics, and oils. ==Personal life== His brother, Stanley Detlie, was a set designer in the 1930s and 1940s. John Detlie was the first husband of actress Veronica Lake, although 14 years older than she; they had two children, one of whom died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1943. Detlie and his second wife, Virginia Crowell, with whom he also had two children, lived in La Quinta, California, for 48 years, until his death from lung cancer several weeks before his 97th birthday. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Washington Post obituary, washingtonpost.com *John Stewart Detlie, Sr. profile, Pacific Coast Architecture Database (digital.lib.washington.edu) Category:1908 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American artists Category:American art directors Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:People from La Quinta, California Category:People from Sioux Falls, South Dakota Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Design alumni Category:Deaths from cancer in California ","title":"John S.

It was drawn in a 'realistic' comic style by Mike Western and Eric Bradbury,Ian Wheeler, Mike Western remembered , Down The Tubes, 21 May 2008 much like Marvel Comics's Spider-Man story (to which it bears numerous similarities), in direct contrast to the stylised cartoony style of the rest of Buster. ==Premise== Billy Farmer lived with his Aunt Joan and Uncle Charlie in the fictional town of Selbridge. He was scratched by a radioactive leopard called 'Sheba' while taking photos at the local zoo for the school magazine, and thereafter gained leopard-like strength, speed, reflexes, and tree-climbing abilities. As with Spider-Man, while he's often fighting crime, he often sells photographs of himself to the local paper, using the money to support his frail aunt. Like Spider-Man, the Leopardman is forever trying to convince the people of Selbridge that he is a hero, not a villain - not easy when you name yourself after a dangerous animal. Unlike Spider-Man, he has to contend with his violent, greedy and lazy uncle. ==Publishing history== His stories were published in French, in the comic Sunny Sun.Mon Journal : Le L√©opard de Lime Street, Un f√©lin appel√© √† r√©gner and Greek in the \\"Blek\\" comics series, mostly during the 80s. The origin of the Leopard from Lime Street was reprinted in the independent comic, Starscape (comic), along with the final published adventure from the Buster Annual 1987.Starscape Comic Rebellion Developments is due to republish the series as part of The Treasury of British Comics.Faceache, Marney, Leopardboy, One-Eyed Jack... coming back!2000 AD to revive children's comics from the '70s and '80s  The Bookseller ==Legacy== An alternate version of the Leopardman was one of the superheroes assembled to fight the Lloigor in the 2000 AD strip Zenith. ==Collected Editions== The Leopard From Lime Street has been collected in the following trade paperbacks by Rebellion Publishing: {  - !

Scott Eyster, a four- year finalist for the Conerly Trophy, would beat him out as a freshman. This led to Adams transferring to Hinds Community College for one season. Hinds only played seven games that year, as several games were cancelled due to Hurricane Katrina, but Adams threw for 1,500 yards and 13 touchdowns and received a scholarship offer to Western Carolina University, a Division 1-AA program.

His manager, Pin Streaver, is left despondent as he had bet an obscene amount of money on Stag, including a large percentage of the prize money, and can't pay what he owes. When Stag's attempts to borrow the cash fails, Pin tries unsuccessfully to rob the boxing arena's safe and is killed while escaping by a security guard's bullet. Stag manages to bring Pin's body to another location and tells police that Pin apparently shot himself, so that Pin won't go down as a criminal.

She taught herbs and aromatherapy at the University of California Extension throughout the 1970s and privately throughout the United States. She has lived in San Francisco since 1967 and established a herbal/aromatic garden and study center. Becoming concerned about the environment and the production of aromatic plants, she organized the aromatherapy industry and a group, The Aromatic Plant Project, to support local and organic production of aromatic plants; to provide resources for growers and distillers; to ensure high quality aromatherapy products and to educate consumers as to the appropriate and beneficial uses of these aromatic products. Rose is the author of over 20 books, including Herbs & Things, The Herbal Body Book, The Aromatherapy Book, and Jeanne Rose's Herbal Guide to Food, and she has taught herbs, aromatherapy and distillation extensively throughout the U.S. She organized and was President of the first large Aromatherapy organization in the United States, NAHA, and speaks widely at many other events and conferences. She teaches distillation techniques for quality essential oils throughout various parts of the world. The word, 'hydrosol' as used for the waters of distillation, was first used and put in place by Jeanne Rose in 1990. == Works == #Herbs & Things ‚Ä¢Jeanne Rose's Herbal; (Perigee Books, 1972; Last Gasp, 2001) #The Herbal Body Book; (Frog, Ltd., 2000) #The Herbal Guide to Food; (North Atlantic Books, 1989) #Ask Jeanne Rose; (Keats Publications, 1984) #Kitchen Cosmetics; (North Atlantic Books, 1978, 1990) #The Modern Herbal; (Perigee Books, 1987) #Herbal Studies Course in Three Parts; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 1988, 2007) #Part 1 - Seasonal Herbal: A Reverence for Nature; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 1988, 2007) #Part 2 - Medicinal Herbal: Caring for the Body with Herbs; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 1988, 2007) #Part 3 - Reference Herbal: From History to Aromatherapy to Garden to Materia Medica; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 1988, 2007) #The Aromatherapy Book:; Applications & Inhalations; (North Atlantic Books, 1992) #Aromatherapy Studies Course; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 1994, 2007) #The World of Aromatherapy; (Frog, Ltd., 1996) #Herbs & AT for the Sex Organs; (Frog, Ltd., 1994) #375 Essential Oils & Hydrosols; (Frog, Ltd., 1999) #Herbal Body Book II; (Frog, Ltd.,2000) #The Natural Formula Book for Home & Yard; (Rodale Press, 1982) #Women's Health Care, A Guide to Alternatives; (Reston Publishing Co., 1984) #Aromatherapy ‚Äî 21st Century: Aromatherapy Course - Home & Family; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2005, 2007) #Blending Essential Oils; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2000, 2007) #Distillation, A Workbook; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2000, 2007) #Lavender, Lavender, Lavender; (Sequim Lavender Growers Association, 2003) #Advanced Perfumery Workbook; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2007) #Hydrosols & Aromatic Waters; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2007) #SPA/SKIN Workbook; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2003, 2007) #Ritual works!; (Institute of Aromatic & Herbal Studies, 2007) == References == *Official Website *http://www.organicinfusions.com *http://www.allnaturalbeauty.us/recipies_jeannerose2.htm *http://www.jeannerose.net/author.html *http://www.aromaticplantproject.com/introduction.html ==External links== Aromatic Plant Project * Institute of Aromatic Studies * Natural Ingredient Resource Center * Lloyd Library * *Associate Member of The Natural Perfumers Guild Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Herbalists Category:American conservationists ","title":"Jeanne Rose"},{"id":"12380215","text":"Manuel Rodr√≠guez Island (Spanish: Isla Manuel Rodr√≠guez) is an island in the Queen Adelaide Archipelago in Magallanes y la Ant√°rtica Chilena Region, Chile.

Shokalsky Island () is an island in the Kara Sea, in Russia. It is located on the eastern side of the mouth of the Ob River, off the tip of the narrow northwestern arm of the Gyda Peninsula. It is separated from it by a narrow strait full of islets known as Gydanskiy Proliv. Its latitude is 72¬∞ 58' N and its longitude 74¬∞ 27' E. The island has an area of 428 km¬≤ and it is covered by tundra. The sea surrounding the island is covered with pack ice in the winter and there are numerous ice floes even in the summer, so that it is often merged with the Gydanskiy Peninsula in the Siberian mainland. This island belongs to the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug which is the northern part of the Tyumen Oblast administrative division of the Russian Federation. This island is also part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia. This island was named after Imperial Russian cartographer Yuly Shokalsky.

It was also the lead track on the Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? EP. This release had an accompanying video. Although never released as a single, the song is a staple of live concerts by the band on their early tours. == Release == \\"The View from the Afternoon\\" was expected to have been the band's third single, following UK number ones \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" and \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\", but the band announced in March 2006 that its next record would be a five-track EP, which thereby disqualified it from being listed in the UK Singles Chart and UK Albums ChartThe Official UK Charts Company ‚Äì \\"Chart Rules (9th edition)\\" because it was too long to be a single and too cheap to be an album. ==Composition== Alex Turner said \\"This is one of the last songs written for the album. There's nothing clever, it's just about anticipating the evening, finding comfort in familiarity and the fact that you know you're bound to send a daft message or something before the sun comes up. I think I've stopped doing that now.\\" ==Music video== The video is based around a young man in a parka jacket playing the drum part of the song in the middle of a courtyard between blocks of high rise flats. A sequence of surreal elements is interspersed throughout: a schoolgirl walks past wearing plastic devil horns; a running fox; three men trying to attract the attention of the drummer who ignores them; the drummer is fed milk by the schoolgirl and then a brief shot in colour of the man floating on his back in shallow water. The music stops, and it is revealed that his drumming has caused his hands to bleed. Next, there is a shot of a man in the dark wielding a baseball bat, then a brief shot of the moon which appears to explode and then the man in the dark struggling to lift his bat. Finally, the man with the bat comes near to the drummer and is about to strike him, but the audio stops and we see a last shot of the male being showered in what could be rain or the fragments of the moon. The video is perhaps based on the story of the Buddha. He was said to have meditated under a tree for days. While he meditated, devils came to seduce and sabotage him, but he resisted. Seeing the Buddha starve himself in order to attain nirvana, a woman gave him milk to quench his thirst. The video is shot in black and white and was filmed near Park Hill flats in the Arctic Monkeys' native city of Sheffield, directed by W.I.Z. for Factory Films. It was also partially filmed later in the courtyard of Bromyard House, Ledbury Estate in Peckham, South East London. A tattoo of the three intersecting circles sigil adopted by John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin, can be seen on the man's right wrist. ==CertificationsReferencesExternal links== * Category:Arctic Monkeys songs Category:2006 songs Category:Domino Recording Company singles Category:Songs written by Jamie Cook Category:Songs written by Alex Turner (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Jim Abbiss ","title":"The View from the Afternoon"},{"id":"12380349","text":"NK Karlovac 1919 is a Croatian football club based in the town of Karlovac. Karlovac plays their home matches at Stadion Branko ƒåavloviƒá-ƒåavlek. ==History== Traditionally lower-level minnows, the club's most successful period in the Yugoslav football league system was in the 1970s when they competed in the Yugoslav Second League. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and the formation of the Croatian football league system in 1992 Karlovac spent most of the time playing in Druga HNL and Treƒáa HNL, second and third levels. Led by manager Igor Pamiƒá, Karlovac won consecutive promotions in the 2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09 seasons, which saw them join the top level for the first time in their history. After a sixth place finish in debut season in 1. HNL and equally good second season, financial troubles during 2011‚Äì12 season hit Karlovac hard. They faced relegation to second division but due to financial irregularities, Karlovac was suspended by Croatian Football Federation. In summer of 2012, NK Karlovac 1919 was founded as a successor club but the two clubs' track records and honors are kept separate by the Croatian Football Federation.

That Declaration dictates the Commonwealth's fundamental political values, and sets the core membership criteria of the organisation. Its remit to evaluate the Harare Declaration lapses every two years; the remit must be renewed and its membership reviewed by the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. CMAG was established in November 1995 at Millbrook Resort, in Queenstown, New Zealand, as a result of the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, to punish serious or persistent violations of the Harare Declaration. It is composed of the Foreign Ministers (or equivalent) of eight Commonwealth member states, which may be augmented by either one or two further representatives of a region or interest involved in a particular case. There have been twenty-seven ordinary meetings, two special meetings, and one extraordinary meeting, called unevenly over the past twelve years. For logistical reasons, 29 of the 30 meetings have been held in either London (headquarters of the Commonwealth) or New York City (headquarters of the United Nations). ==History== In its first meeting, CMAG decided that its initial focus would be upon the three (then-)military dictatorships of The Gambia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, and approved of the Commonwealth's suspension of Nigeria from the organisation earlier in the year. These three countries would form the mainstay of the work of CMAG, and form the whole of its reports, until the 1999 coup d'√©tat in Pakistan necessitated it to vote unanimously to suspend Pakistan from the Commonwealth. Nigeria's reintegration was deemed complete by 1999, when its suspension was lifted; indeed, it was chosen to be a member of CMAG prior to the thirteenth meeting. In 2000, the situations in Fiji and the Solomon Islands were put under permanent scrutiny, as was that in Zimbabwe in 2001. Gambia was taken off the group's formal agenda at the seventeenth meeting. Due to its acrimonious withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 2003, the issue of Zimbabwe, which had dominated the affairs of the Commonwealth since 2001, became moot and was not discussed from 2004 onwards, while Fiji was taken off the agenda due to encouraging progress in that country's political progress. At its twenty-fourth meeting, in September 2004, it was decided that (at least in principle) CMAG should meet once a year, and preferably in New York. An extraordinary meeting was called for the 8 December 2006 in light of the 2006 coup d'√©tat, at which it was decided to suspend Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth. On 12 November 2007, the Commonwealth gave Pakistan a 10-day deadline to restore its constitution and lift other emergency measures or face suspension. By 22 November 2007, the CMAG voted to suspend Pakistan from Commonwealth Membership. ==Membership== Since 2003, the group has included the eight members, plus a representative of the Commonwealth Chairperson-in-Office's country. These have been, successively, Nigeria, Malta, Uganda, and Trinidad and Tobago. {  width=100% ! width=10% Term ! width=10% I ! width=10% II ! width=10% III ! width=10% IV ! width=10% V ! width=10% VI ! width=10% VII ! width=10% VIII ! width=10% Ex officio - align=\\"center\\" ! 1995 - 1997   rowspan=3  rowspan=2  rowspan=3  rowspan=3   rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=4 V A C A N T - align=\\"center\\" ! 1997 - 1999  rowspan=2  rowspan=3 - align=\\"center\\" ! 1999 - 2002  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2 - align=\\"center\\" ! 2002 - 2003  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2 - align=\\"center\\" ! 2003 - 2005  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=3  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2005 - 2007  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2007 - 2009  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2009 - 2011  rowspan=2   rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2011 - 2013    rowspan=2  rowspan=2  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2013 - 2015  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  rowspan=2  - align=\\"center\\" ! 2015 - present    } ==FootnotesExternal links== * Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group official website Ministerial Action Group Category:Organizations established in 1995 ","title":"Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group"},{"id":"12380355","text":"The anterolateral central arteries (antero-lateral ganglionic branches or lenticulostriate arteries) are a group of small arteries arising from the anterior part of the circle of Willis and supply the basal ganglia. They arise at the commencement of the middle cerebral artery and are arranged in two sets: # Internal striate: passes upward through the inner segments of the lentiform nucleus and supplies the lentiform nucleus, caudate nucleus, and internal capsule; # External striate: ascends through the outer segment of the lentiform nucleus and supplies the caudate nucleus. More modern texts divide the anterolateral central arteries into lateral and medial striate arteries. The lenticulostriate arteries originate from the initial segment of middle cerebral artery (MCA). They are small perforating arteries, which enter the underside of the brain substance to supply blood to part of the basal ganglia and posterior limb of the internal capsule. The lenticulostriate perforators are end arteries. The name of these arteries is derived from some of the structures they supply, namely the lentiform nucleus and the striatum. Blockage of the lenticulostriate arteries causes lacunar infarcts. These infarcts are most often due to hyaline arteriosclerosis secondary to hypertension. This can lead to contralateral paresis (muscular weakness) and/or sensory loss of the face and body. ==References== Le, Tao and Bhushan, Vikas. First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2017 (p.484).

It was Portugal's national aerobatic flying team and flew two ex- German Air Force Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jets. ==History== In 1977, Asas de Portugal was created by order of the Air Force Chief of Staff (CEMFA), with the objective to represent the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) at the International Air Tattoo air festival. This was the third aerobatics team established by the PoAF, after two teams of the 1950s ‚Äî the Drag√µes (Dragons) and the S√£o Jorge (Saint George) teams. Asas de Portugal operated the Cessna T-37C for 13 years while integrated with the 102 Squadron Panchos. The single fatal accident in the team's history occurred on 9 December 1990, when one of its T-37Cs suffered a catastrophic wing structural failure during a practice session, killing team pilot Jos√© Magalh√£es da Costa. The accident prompted a fleet-wide inspection which revealed that all but five T-37 aircraft in the PoAF inventory suffered from fatigue induced micro-cracks in the wings' structure. Repairs to airworthy status were considered financially inadvisable. This conclusion, together with a restructure of the PoAF in the 1990s, led to the phase-out of the T-37 and an interruption of the team's activities. In 1997 the team was reactivated, being integrated with the 103 Squadron Carac√≥is and equipped with Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet aircraft, having a team of seven officer pilots and a maintenance team. The first public appearance with the Alpha Jet was on June 27, 1997, at the commemorations of the PoAF's 45th anniversary in Sintra. In 1998, the team was deactivated for logistics reasons. On the occasion of the PoAF's 50th anniversary in 2001, the responsibility to prepare an Alpha Jet flight demonstration for the commemorations was given to 103 Squadron. This resulted in the creation of a two-aircraft display team that represented Portugal with a 16-minute sequence of maneuvers in those commemorations, leading to the idea and plan of expanding the display. In 2005, the Asas de Portugal were definitively reactivated, being once again integrated with 103 Squadron, based at Beja Air Base. The team was deactivated again in 2010, before the start of the airshow season. ==Gallery== File:Cessna T-37C Tweety Bird (318C), Portugal - Air Force AN0716560.jpgT-37 aircraft File:Cessna T-37C Tweety Bird (318C), Portugal - Air Force AN1051305.jpgInternational Air Tattoo 1977, Greenham Common, England File:T-37C Portugal (26216625342).jpgInternational Air Tattoo 1983, Greenham Common, England File:Cessna T-37C Tweety Bird, Portugal - Air Force JP77819.jpgDisplay at Faro, 1987 File:Portugal Dassault- Breguet-Dornier Alpha Jet A JP8236794.jpgAlpha Jet aircraft File:Asas de Portugal - RIAT 2008 (3160555457).jpgRIAT 2008, Gloucestershire, England File:Asas de Portugal (3738366790).jpgVigo International Airshow 2009, Spain File:Alpha Jets dos Asas de Portugal no Porto Red Bull Air Race 2009.jpgRed Bull Air Race 2009, Porto ==See also== *Rotores de Portugal ==External links== *Asas de Portugal official website *Recodando os Asas de Portugal - I Parte (Remembering the Asas de Portugal - Part I), Mais Alto September/October 2002 issue *Recordando os Asas de Portugal - II Parte (Remembering the Asas de Portugal - Part II), Mais Alto November/December 2002 issue *Asas de Portugal - The return of the Alpha Jet Acrobatic Patrol, Nuno Martins, January 22, 2003 *Asas de Portugal - 30 Anos, photographic gallery of the Asas de Portugal 30th anniversary Category:Portuguese Air Force Category:Aerobatic teams Category:Military units and formations established in 1977 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1990 Category:Military units and formations established in 1997 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1998 Category:Military units and formations established in 2005 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2010 ","title":"Asas de Portugal"},{"id":"12380371","text":"Daniel Casper von Lohenstein im XLIX. Jahr Daniel Casper (25 January 1635 in Nimptsch, Niederschlesien ‚Äì 28 April 1683 in Breslau, Niederschlesien), also spelled Daniel Caspar, and referred to from 1670 as Daniel Casper von Lohenstein, was a Baroque Silesian playwright, lawyer, diplomat, poet, and chief representative of the . ==Family== The Casper and/or Caspar () family came from the Brieg principality, first well known as poet and diplomats. Daniel Casper was the son of the imperial customs-officer, Akzisef√§lle- Einnehmers and Biergef√§lle-Einnehmers named Johann (Hans) Casper (c.1600-after 1670), alderman and city constable of Nimptsch, and Susanna Schedel of Greiffenstein (1612‚Äì1652). His father Hans in 1642 received a Wappenbrief and was raised on 17 July 1670 to a hereditary imperial peerage, with the name of \\"von Lohenstein\\". ==Life== Youth Daniel Casper was born 1635 in the princely Schloss Nimptsch, to which his parents had withdrawn during the Thirty Years' War. After initial private instruction in Nimptsch, his father sent him to Breslau where Caspar from 1642 to 1651 attended the Magdalenen- School, that had been upgraded in 1643 into a secondary school (Maria- Magdalenen-Gymnasium). In the midpoint of his philological and rhetorical education there, he already as eleven-year-old student carried out disputations with antique examples over what qualified one to be a peer. At 15 he composed his first tragedy, \\"Ibrahim\\". Lohenstein was friendly with Heinrich M√ºhlpfort. After finishing secondary school, Casper had to leave Breslau because there was as yet no university in the town. At the University of Leipzig he studied under Benedikt Carpzov (1595‚Äì1666), the founder of the German criminal justice system, and at the University of T√ºbingen with Wolfgang Adam Lauterbach (1618‚Äì1678), where on 6 June 1655 he produced his Disputation (\\"Disputation Jurudica de Voluntate\\"). After finishing his studies, the (at that time usual) Grand Tour which he joined led him first of all to the sovereign courts of Germany, then to Switzerland, Leiden, Utrecht and Vienna (but not Italy, due to the plague then raging there). With Italy ruled out, he spent some time in Hungary, coming into contact with the Turkish-Oriental cultural circles there. Recalled by his father, he came home by ship, through a strong thunderstorm he remembered his whole life, in which he saw the sinking of 13 ships. After his homecoming, he established himself as a lawyer in Breslau and on 30 October 1657, at 22, in Breslau, he married Elisabeth Herrmann (died 1708 in Zettritz, Landkreis Landsberg (Warthe) ), Mark Brandenburg), the daughter of Caspar Herrmann, Amtmann for Breslau's state property (Landg√ºter des Rats). Patronage He had in 1665 produced his second poetic work, the tragedy \\"Aggrippina\\", dedicated to duchess Louise von Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau (born princess of Anhalt-Dessau). Louise's queen- regent Elisabeth Marie in 1668 founded a Regierungsrat at Oels. Caspar was, as a scholar, advising Louise and also helped in the design and construction of the Piasten-Gruft (tomb) in Liegnitz. Duke Christian strove to attract him to his court as a secret advisor, but Caspar declined before returning 1670 to Breslau, where a successful and promising career beckoned. Already as student, he had moved among the patrician circles of the Breslau city-state and beyond. Now the eldest advisor there, Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau (1616‚Äì1679) advocated Caspar as a poet and other works of his - like his famous funeral oration of 1679 addressed to Christian - were very admired. He came, on the abdication of the Obersyndikus Peter Muck von Muckendorff 1670, to receive the presidency of the Herzogtums Lauenburg, with the second Syndikus, Andreas von Assig, taking his place as Obersyndikus. Thus Caspar von Lohenstein became a Syndikus at Assig. Syndic and diplomat in Breslau Thus he arrived in one of the most important offices of the city. The elevation of his family into the peerage a few weeks later might have been meant more for him than for his father. In the year 1675, Assig had to abandon his office due to illness and Caspar took his place as Obersyndikus, holding that office for the eight years until his death. The governing of Schlesien after the Thirty Years' War was strongly marked by anti-reforming efforts. When an imperial edict commanded the dismissal of all Protestant schoolteachers, the danger of an occupation of Breslau by imperial troops under the leadership of the general Kop was so great that Caspar was dispatched to Vienna for negotiations. With the diplomatic skill of an educated man, he succeeded, moving the emperor so much that he gave up his demand. The city took advantage of his high diplomatic capabilities even more often, sending him as an ambassador, though he still achieved much as a lawyer as well as proving himself as a diplomat and politician. Daniel Casper von Lohenstein was the owner of several towns. He acquired in 1673 the Kittelau from duchess (Herzogin) Louise von Brieg and in the same year inherited Reisau and Roschkowitz from Tobias von Kleindienst. As an acknowledged poet, an ennobled Obersyndikus and landowner, Caspar was at his peak of life in the 1670s. Turning always more strongly towards the Habsburg position, he was appointed an imperial advisor in 1675. He died at the family Schloss at Breslau, Niederschlesien, of a stroke in 1683. ==Works== Casper's production as a poet, especially when considered together with his contemporaneous work as lawyer and diplomat, is astonishing. Extremely productive, he was above all known as an author of theatrical pieces marked by the well known French Classicism in drama and as - next to Andreas Gryphius - one of the most important dramatists of the baroque. In addition to this he was known as a poet and as a translator. His novel \\"Gro√üm√ºtiger Feldherr Arminius\\", comprising around 3000 pages, appeared between 1689‚Äì90 and was a highpoint of baroque romantic art, despite concerns over the often obscure and overwrought language. In it he put up for discussion the situation of the German empire after the Thirty Years' War and tries to take stock of contemporary knowledge. His lyric poetry was published in periodic periodicals. He used exaggeration and overdramatisation in his works to work out the contrast to the \\"better\\" reality, and they thus stand in the tradition of Senecan tragedy. Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein in many of his writings showed his views on statesmenship and the art of ruling, similar to \\"Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau\\" views.

The designation \\"2-inch\\" refers to the mortar barrel, into which only the 22-inch bomb shaft but not the bomb itself was inserted; the spherical bomb itself was actually 9 inches (230 mm) in diameter and weighed 42 lb (19 kg), hence this weapon is more comparable to a standard mortar of approximately 5-6 inch bore. ==Background and predecessors== As the Western Front in France and Belgium stagnated into trench warfare in late 1914, British forces found themselves with no means of replying to the German minenwerfers (trench mortars) which were lobbing both small and large (over 100 pound) high-explosive shells into their frontline trenches from short range. British commanders requested an accurate short-range weapon which was manually portable in the trenches, could be safely used to attack enemy trenches as close as 100 yards to the British trenches, was easily concealed and projected a reasonably large explosive charge capable of damaging protected enemy positions. The British Expeditionary Force had been expected to participate only in mobile warfare and was not equipped with any mortars. Various alternative designs for light and medium mortars were evaluated, prompted by the need to place at least some weapon into action without diverting manufacturing capacity from guns and howitzers, which weapons were given priority. Hence the emphasis was on designs for both mortar and ammunition that could be manufactured by small unsophisticated workshops unsuited to other war work: 4-inch mortar 4-inch mortar bomb at the Imperial War Museum *The 4-inch mortar was the only official type to enter service before the end of 1914 (12 units). It fired an 8¬Ω pound steel bomb with studs to engage rifling grooves in the mortar barrel, similar to the German minenwerfer. The barrel was improvised by boring out a 6-inch shell. Its range of 900 yards and its accuracy was considered acceptable, but the shell case was expensive and was slow to load. About 40 guns and several thousand rounds were issued by June 1915,Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 35, 36 with 168 of the total 300 manufactured eventually serving in France.Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 62 It was soon replaced by the 3-inch Stokes mortar in its \\"light mortar\\" class. 3.7-inch mortar *The 3.7-inch pipe gun was an early improvised mortar. Eighteen were initially made by the Indian Corps in France by December 1914. It was a smooth tube firing a 4¬Ω pound \\"tin-pot\\" filled with ammonal. The fuze was a length of Bickford fuse ignited by the burning of the propellant, which made it too dangerous for long term use. By the end of June 1915, another 100 had been manufactured and sent to France and 20 to Gallipoli. Vickers 1.57-inch mortar *The Vickers 1.57-inch trench mortar was first introduced to France in March 1915, 127 by the end of June, and about 275 were manufactured until it was withdrawn in January 1917, after being replaced by the 2-inch mortar. The 1.57-inch was similar to the eventual 2-inch model, but the particular Vickers design was complicated and expensive to manufacture. It fired either an 18 or 33 pound cast-iron bomb filled with Permite (perchlorate), but the smaller bomb was considered too light and the heavier had a range of only 200 yards.Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 35, 62, 130 ==The 2-inch medium mortar== This was designed and manufactured by the Royal Ordnance Factories in early 1915 and introduced along with the 1.57-inch mortar in March 1915. It incorporated what was known of the German prewar Krupp mortar.Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 37 This was the first design to meet all the requirements, after modifications to simplify manufacture; it fired a good-sized spherical cast-iron bomb of 42 pounds (total projectile weight 51 pounds with stick and fuze), considered the largest practical size for use from trenches, at ranges from 100 to 600 yards using a simple 2-inch tube as the mortar body. The mortar and ammunition could be cheaply manufactured by small unsophisticated \\"trade\\" workshops; the bomb was safely detonated by a standard No. 80 \\"time and percussion\\" artillery fuze. Drawbacks were that the steel tail was usually projected backwards towards the firer when the bomb detonated, resulting in occasional casualties and the No. 80 fuze was also required by the 18-pounder field guns which were given priority, limiting mortar ammunition supply to the front until early 1916 when a special cheap trench mortar fuze was developed.Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 37 - 39 The 2-inch mortar served in limited numbers in France in 1915 from March, with early mortars and ammunition made by the Royal Ordnance Factory, with the Vickers 1.57-inch model. Mass production began with an order in August 1915 for 800 mortars from several railway workshops and agricultural machinery makers, together with an order for 675,000 bombs from numerous small firms.Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 45, 48 Manufacture of the Vickers model which was twice as expensive was ended and it was withdrawn by January 1917. It fired a spherical cast-iron bomb \\"the size of a football\\"Pratt 1965 painted dirty white filled with amatol (identified by a painted green band) or ammonal (identified by a painted pink band) attached to the end of a pipe (\\"stick\\"), hence the nicknames \\"toffee apple\\" and \\"plum pudding\\". Weights of bombs as delivered without fuzes varied. Light bombs, from 39 lb 14 oz to below 40 lb 10 oz (18.09 to 18.43 kg), were marked with a stenciled L. Heavy bombs, above 41 lb 10 oz to 42 lb 6 oz (18.43 to 19.22 kg) were marked with a stenciled Hv.Handbook of the M.L. 2-Inch Trench Mortar, Mark I. 1917, page 13 Hence the total fuzed weight with stick of 51 lb is an average. The 2-inch designation refers to the mortar barrel's bore and the projectile stick inserted into it, not the much larger bomb itself which remained outside the barrel. It was comparable in explosive power if not range to other 4-inch mortars. The 2-inch mortar was itself superseded by the Newton 6-inch mortar from mid-1917 onwards. Some Australian units retained them for projecting smoke screens. ==Combat use== Mesopotamia 1917, with firing lanyard laid out. The bomb is fuzed. Deployment The weapon was initially operated by joint infantry and artillery detachments, eventually it became the responsibility of the Royal Field Artillery.Clarke 2004, page 16 A typical infantry division was equipped with three batteries designated X, Y, Z, each with four mortars. Use in action Its primary use was in cutting barbed wire defensesRuffell and attacking enemy front line trenches, such as in the July 1916 attack on the Somme. The spherical shape and relatively low velocity brought the benefit that the bomb did not penetrate the ground before exploding. The short range was a disadvantage as it could only be used if no man's land (between the British and enemy front line) was relatively narrow. It was used to fire some white star (50%-50% chlorine and phosgene) gas bombs during the Battle of the SommeJones 2007, page 27 until other specialised longer range projectors became available. Cordite charges appropriate to the required range were dropped into the barrel before the bomb was loaded. Charges and ranges: *1.5 ounces (40 g): 100‚Äì220 yards (90‚Äì200 m) (dangerous due to propensity for incomplete burn and hence to fall short) *2.5 ounces (70 g): 180‚Äì340 yards (160‚Äì310 m) *3.5 ounces (100 g): 300‚Äì500 yards (270‚Äì460 m) The original design for igniting the powder propellant charge involved the insertion of a standard artillery \\"T friction tube\\" into a hole near the base of the barrel. The Royal Artillery had a higher priority in receiving the already insufficient number of tubes so ignition was changed to use a Lee‚ÄìEnfield bolt mechanism and chamber screwed into a socket in the barrel near the base.Handbook of the M.L. 2-Inch Trench Mortar. Mark I. 1917, page 1Ministry of Munitions 1922, page 55 A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and fired via a lanyard from a sheltered position if possible due to the risk of bombs falling short. This ignited the propellant charge and launched the bomb. In early use it was situated in frontline trenches but this tended to attract enemy fire onto the troops manning them. Standard procedure became to locate the mortars separately from frontline trenches, in unoccupied trenches or in saps running off the frontline. This had the benefit of drawing enemy fire away from troops manning the front line. Estimated rounds required for various targets, with instantaneous percussion fuze 107:Artillery in Offensive Operations, January 1917 Fuze No. 107 *Cutting barbed wire: 1 round per 10 square yards (8 m2) *Cutting loose wire: 1 round per 6 square yards (5 m2) *Destroy trenches frontally: 5 rounds per yard *Destroy trenches in enfilade: 2.5 rounds per yard *Destroy a machine-gun emplacement with top cover not more than 3 feet of earth: 80 rounds Silencer Provision was made in mid-1916 for attachment of the \\"Temple silencer\\" at the muzzle, intended to reduce the flash and noise generated on firing, which at the short ranges the mortar operated at was quickly noticed by the enemy and invited artillery response. This required the use of bombs with a special piston attached to the tail which was retained in the barrel by the silencer on firing, and hence sealed the muzzle after the bomb tail left the barrel. This had the major disadvantage of causing the barrel to overheat during prolonged daylight firing, and the silencer was only used at night. Use as anti-tank mines British Mk V tank disabled by anti-tank mine, Ronssoy October 3, 1918. Unexploded bombs are visible In Spring 1918 many of these obsolescent bombs were buried on the Western Front under metal plates as anti-tank mines in expectation of attack by German tanks. This led to some later confusion as to whether unearthed bombs were unexploded mortar projectiles (\\"duds\\") or undetonated mines. These minefields were inadequately documented. This caused the British problems in the closing months of the war when they had to advance again over territory they had previously abandoned and also prevented full clearance of the minefields after the war. This led to some French farmers being blown up in the 1930s when they started using tractors e.g. around Gouzeaucourt. ==See also== *List of heavy mortars Weapons of comparable role, performance and era *Mortier de 58 mm type 2 French equivalent ==Image gallery== Image:2inchTrenchMortarDiagram.jpgDiagram showing loaded mortar Image:Bomb2InchTrenchMortarDiagram.jpgDiagram showing bomb dimensions Image:ToffeeAppleBombs1916.jpgRoyal Army Ordnance Corps men playing cards on bomb dump, Acheux, July 1916, Battle of the Somme.

Constructed in the middle of the nineteenth century, it was home to a succession of owners in its early years, and it has been named a historic site. After years of farming in Butler County, Daniel Rumple moved into the county seat of Hamilton during the middle of the 19th century and bought a 50% share in a community hardware store. Needing a residence, he commissioned the construction of the present house, which was completed in 1859 by a team under the leadership of carpenter/bricklayer P.H. Gilbert. Following Rumple's death five years later, the property was purchased by William and Rachel Anderson, another prosperous business owner. Anderson had entered Hamilton's commercial circles with a leatherworking business, although he switched into the field of milling in 1853. The \\"Shaffer\\" component of the house's name is derived from George K. Shaffer, who married one of William Anderson's daughters and became a partner in his milling company in the 1880s.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 77-78. Built of brick and covered with a slate roof, the Anderson‚ÄìShaffer House is surrounded by a decorative iron fence. A small iron porch shelters the main entrance, which is placed in the middle of the three-bay facade; windows are placed in the side bays of the first story and all three bays of the second. The side, narrower than the front, is divided into two bays with windows in each; it rises to a gable with a third- story window. Decorative corbelling lies under the edge of the roof, forming a cornice, while the roofline is punctuated by two chimneys. Besides the main entrance, one may leave the house through the middle of the three windows on the second story of the facade: it opens onto the roof of the porch, which is fenced with iron to prevent falls., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.

It was a single- engined monoplane with a crew of two. It entered service during World War II in 1942, and despite being obsolete, remained in front line use until the early 1950s, and as a target tug until 1987. ==Development and design== In 1935, the Swiss Air Force developed a requirement for a replacement for the Fokker C.V-E biplanes, which were used as reconnaissance aircraft, escort fighters and patrol aircraft. To meet this requirement, the Swiss Federal Constructions Works (EKW) proposed two designs, a modernised C.V, the EKW C-35 and an all new monoplane, the C-36.Gruenenfelder and Francillon 2001, p. 46. Orders for 80 C-35s were placed in 1936, but no decision was made about whether to order the C-36, with preference being given to the purchase of foreign twin-engined aircraft for the role, attempts been made to buy Messerschmitt Bf 110s from Germany or Potez 63s from France. These attempts failed, however, and in 1938 approval was given for EKW to complete detailed design of the C-36 and to build a prototype. The first prototype, the C-3601, carried out its maiden flight on 15 May 1939. It was a low-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction. It was powered by a single licence-built Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine driving a three-bladed variable-pitch propeller. A crew of two sat in tandem under a long, continuous canopy. The aircraft was fitted with a twin tail, and had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The C-3601 crashed on 20 August 1939 due to wing flutter, but a second prototype, the C-3602, which had a more powerful engine and a constant-speed propeller flew on 30 November that year. Testing was successful, and orders were placed in 1940 for an initial batch of 10 C-3603 with a retractable undercarriage.Gruenenfelder and Francillon 2001, pp. 47‚Äì48. ==Operational history== The C-3603s, along with EKW D-3801s, fought off trespassing aircraft to defend Swiss neutrality, but were soon relegated to training and target- towing duties. The last variant of the C-36 aircraft family, the turboprop powered C-3605, had its maiden flight in 1968 remaining in service with the Swiss Air Force until 1988. Thanks to its Black and yellow striped colouration, the C-3605 was called \\"Flying Zebra Crossing\\".C-36 - The Swiss WWII Warbird After retirement several aircraft were kept airworthy on the Civil aircraft register. ==Variants== ;C-3601 :First prototype with long-span wings, fixed undercarriage and powered by 641 kW (860 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12YCrs engine.Gruenenfelder and Francillon 2001, p. 47. ;C-3602: :Second prototype powered by 746 kW (1,000 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12 Y-51. ;C-3603 :Production version with retractable undercarriage, powered by Hispano-Suiza 12 Y-51.

With the help of this Japanese grant, a USD 8 Million facility was constructed within the Ministry of Health's Bureau of Research and Laboratories compound in Alabang, Muntinlupa. Malacanang palace then issued Executive Order (EO) 674 on March 25, 1981, formally authorizing the Philippine Ministry of Health to establish a research facility to implement a basic and applied research program for tropical medicine in the Philippines, pushing both for health advancement and for medical research.Manapat, Ricardo. (1991) Some Are Smarter Than Others. Aletheia Press. The facility, which included an 80-bed hospital with an Intensive Care Unit and operating rooms, was inaugurated on April 23, 1981.  Marcos era issues  Throughout the Marcos administration, the RITM was heavly dependent on Japanese government funding for its continued operations with JICA providing about USD 1 million (approx 18 million) from 1981 to 1984, and providing another 3.2 million in equipment in 1985, when the year RITM‚Äôs experimental animal laboratory was established. By contrast, the administration's budget allocated the RITM an average of about 7 million annually from 1981 to 1985, largely for basic operating expenses and personnel services. The institution was also renamed, having originally been proposed as the \\"Philippine Japan Research Institute for Tropical Diseases.\\" The institute's output was criticised in underground publications during the martial law regime because its research findings were not being released in the Philippines, and were instead only being submitted to JICA to satisfy grant requirements, given that the majority of the patients it served were research patients, while the Philippine health system had an overwhelming need to meet basic health services. The institute thus became associated with the administration's supposed \\"edifice complex\\" \\\\- propaganda projects designed to be impressive showcases of the administration's achivements but whose actual development impact at the time was questionable. Like many edifice complex projects, RITM was located only in Manila, limiting access to it by citizens from elsewhere on the Philippine archipelago.  Marukosu giwaku  Criticism of these and similar funding practices which helped prop up of the Marcos regime eventually became known as the Marukosu giwaku („Éû„É´„Ç≥„ÇπÁñëÊÉë), or \\"Marcos scandal\\", once the Marcoses were deposed in 1986. The investigation by the Japanese legislature's 1986 session and the resulting reforms eventually brought about the creation of JICA's first ODA Charter in 1992.  Post-EDSA reforms  The RITM was retained by the Aquino administration, and the various administrations after the 1986 EDSA revolution have continued to work with JICA to improve and expand RITM's services.  Research dissemination  By 1987, RITM had implemented reforms reflecting the new administration's focus on making sure research is disseminated ‚Äì launching a companion program to disseminate research results and creating the Office of Public Information Research Dissemination. It also launched a quarterly publication detailing its research findings and news items. Work towards the establishment of an International Training Center was also begun.  Increased Philippine government funding  After Marcos was deposed in February 1986, the new government began allotting larger budgets to the RITM, with a 4.9 million increase in 1986. In the first full budget year after the Marcos administration, the RITM was given 5 million more than it had been given in the 1985 budget.  Expansion   Additional research grants (1987)  Research grants from the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Science (BOSTID), the International Development Research Center, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, the Edna McConnel Clark Foundation, Sanofi, and the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development allowed RITM to expand its research beyond their previous focus on diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, and schistosomiasis, and allowed research programs in AIDS, leprosy, hepatitis, dengue, and malaria. A Technical Cooperation Program with JICA allowed RITM to expand the expertise of its staff.  Center for Training in Tropical Infectious Diseases (1989)  In 1989, the RITM Center for Training in Tropical Infectious Diseases was established.  NIH Tropical Medicine Research Center Program (1991)  In 1990 the US National Institutes of Health approved a 5-year grant to the RITM for the establishment of a NIH Tropical Medicine Research Center Program in the Philippines, starting in February 1991. This partnership allowed the RITM to collaborate with scientists in Australia and the US on research relating to malaria, leprosy, and schistosomiasis.  Merger with the DOH Biologicals Production Service (2000)  The Biologicals Production Service of the Department of Health, the vaccine laboratory of the Philippines, was absorbed by the RITM in November 2000  Biosafety Level 3 laboratory (2018)  The RITM received a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory from the Japanese government in 2018, improving its capacity to conduct research on higher-risk bacteria and viruses.  COVID-19 pandemic  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the RITM became a site for preliminary testing for suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the Philippines. In the early months of the pandemic in the Philippines, RITM was the only laboratory with the capacity to test COVID-19 cases. The pandemic has affected the RITM itself when forty of its employees tested positive for COVID-19 on April 20, 2020. ==Institute functions== The RITM is tasked by the Philippine Department of Health and the Philippine Government to supervise, plan, and successfully implement research programs to prevent and to control prevailing infectious and tropical diseases in the Philippines. This includes research involving the advancement of vaccines and medications used by medical professionals, such as physicians, nurses, and medical technologists, that they utilize whenever patients they handle are under the diagnosis and treatment of infectious and treatable and curable diseases. The institute also trains medical and health workers in order to be further educated in their fields in relation to the management of tropical infectious diseases. Formulation of plans and research projects involving biological products proposed and currently utilized by the Philippine Department of Health are also covered by the functions of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, including the manufacture of biologic products and vaccines. ==See also== *Infectious disease (medical specialty) *Medical microbiology *Tropical medicine *Tropical nursing *Rural health *List of hospitals in the Philippines ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Department of Health Philippines website *RITM Training Courses Category:Tropical medicine organizations Category:Health in Metro Manila Category:Research institutes in Metro Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Muntinlupa Category:Japan‚ÄìPhilippines relations Category:Hospitals in Metro Manila Category:Infectious disease organizations Category:Medical research institutes in the Philippines ","title":"Research Institute for Tropical Medicine"},{"id":"12380692","text":"NK Posavina Zagreb is a Croatian football club based in the city of Zagreb.

However, Levy soon changed careers and began working in French Polynesia's booming tourism industry. In January 1992 Levy took over the management as head of Tahiti Tourism Promotion Office, which was the French Polynesia's main tourism marketing and information agency. Levy helped transform the office into the present day GIE Tahiti Tourisme. Tahiti Tourism is based in Papeete and currently operates a worldwide promotional and advertising campaign called, Tahiti and Her Islands. Levy left Tahiti Tourisme in August 1998 to become the first CEO of Air Tahiti Nui. Levy helped found Air Tahiti Nui in 1996 as French Polynesia's international airline. The airline launched its first international flights in 1998, the same year that Levy became Air Tahiti Nui's first CEO. Levy helped to guide the international expansion of the airline while CEO and earned a reputation for his managerial efficiency. As CEO of Air Tahiti Nui, Levy was nominated in 2002 by Travel Agent Magazine for \\"Manager of the Year\\" in the Asia Pacific region. Levy was very well connected in the tourism industry, as well as in French Polynesian politics. Levy was a prominent supporter of the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party, a pro-French political party which opposes independence for French Polynesia from France. He was replaced as CEO of the airline when the coalition of pro- independence parties led by Oscar Temaru took power in a surprise election victory. However, Levy returned to the board of directors of Air Tahiti Nui following the 2005 presidential election win of French Polynesian President Gaston Tong Sang, a pro-French candidate from the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party. Sang asked Levy back to help revive the ailing airline, which was suffering from \\"recurrent\\" financial shortfalls and problems. (The Government of French Polynesia is a 61.7% shareholder in the airline.) Additionally, Levy also served as head of the local French Polynesian post and telecommunications company, OPT. Levy's last tourism venture was the June 1, 2007, launch of easyTahiti.com , a specialist travel web site for Tahiti and other French Polynesian islands. EasyTahiti.com has been described as \\"Tahiti's biggest virtual travel agency\\" in a press release from Air Tahiti Nui. ==Death== Nelson Levy died unexpectedly of a heart attack on June 3, 2007, at his home in Tahiti, just two days after the official launch of easyTahiti.com.

Constructed in the 1860s, this house has been named a historic site for its high-quality architecture. Once the home of prominent Hamilton residents, it has been converted into a museum. Constructed in 1862, the house was built for Hamilton lawyer Noah C. McFarland, who became a politician and public servant a few years later: he was the senator for the district encompassing Butler and Warren Counties from 1866 to 1868, and from 1881 to 1885 he was the commissioner of the federal General Land Office. He only resided in the house for twelve years before selling it to John Benninghofen in 1874. An immigrant from the German kingdom of Prussia, Benninghofen had established himself as a textile magnate in the 1850s, and by 1874 the firm of Benninghofen and Shuler had branched out into the paper-manufacturing business that later became a mainstay of the local economy.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Accessed 2013-12-22. the Benninghofen House is a high-quality Italianate structure. Among the clearest examples of the style are the windows and front porch: the windows (some paired and some single) feature rounded arches, while the porch features small columns with decorative elements both at top and bottom. Some of the windows (more on the side than on the front) are rectangular instead of rounded; some of these feature complicated lintel constructions instead of simple frames. Besides the \\"normal\\" porch surrounding the main entrance, the house includes a subsidiary second-story porch placed above the entrance to the main porch. The hip roof covering the house is supported on all sides by bracketing, which combines to form a decorative cornice. A metal fence with stone base separates the property from the sidewalk and street. No longer a residence, the Butler County Historical Society maintains the Benninghofen House as a historic house museum. Some of the interior is maintained at its nineteenth-century appearance, although with minor changes such as the relocation of a painting from a hallway to the formal parlor. Other parts have been converted for unrelated museum purposes, such as the basement, which holds a display depicting dentist's tools from the nineteenth century. Yet other parts hold artifacts such as the Civil War battle flag of the 35th Ohio Infantry, which belonged to Hamilton resident Ferdinand Van Derveer. The house has also attracted ghost hunters; a group visiting in early 2013 reported contacting John Benninghofen's wife and various other residents of early Hamilton, and locals frequently contact museum staff asking if it is haunted.Jones, Richard. \\"Spirits About at Benninghofen House\\", Hamilton Journal-News, 2013-03-03.

Gibbs. The courthouse is a registered historic building listed in the National Register on June 22, 1981. ==History== Butler County was established in 1803 from a section of Hamilton County. The county seat selected was Hamilton and the first courthouse was built 1806 and the second in 1817 on the site of the present structure. When the county realized that the courthouse was too small for the population, a new plan by D.W. Gibbs and was designed in the Second Empire style with features from the Italianate style. County officials laid the building's cornerstone on October 29, 1885. As county funds were insufficient for construction, contracts could not be let until enabling legislation for bond issuance had been passed by the Ohio General Assembly; the necessary legislation was sponsored by George F. Elliott, the senator from Butler County. When originally built, the courthouse centered on a four-part clock tower, which was replaced by a smaller tower with a dome after the original tower collapsed in a 1912 fire. The 1912 tower remains in place, minus the dome, which fell prey to lightning in the 1920s.Thrane, Susan W., County Courthouses of Ohio. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana UP, 2000, 122. ==Exterior== Detail of main entrance on north face of structure The main entrance is reached by stairs which enter into a covered porch. Above the porch is a high design arch supported by Ionic columns. This arch in turn holds a pediment capped with an urn. The mansard-roof gives way to a central tower. The original tower was once four-tiered, domed, and capped with a statue of Justice. This was destroyed in a fire in 1912 when the tower collapsed. It was replaced shortly thereafter with a massive tower and dome designed by local architect Frederick Mueller, but the dome was removed in 1926 after it was struck by lightning. The octagonal tower remains and contains a four-faced clock and is topped with eight spires around the top. When Butler County constructed the Government Services Center in 1999, architecture firm Lorenze and Williams replicated the green octagonal roof on top of the 11-story tower. ==Interior== The interior was restored to its original appearance and is a perfect balance of symmetry and design elements. The lobby serves as a reception area as well as a museum housing the old clerk of court's desk and an antique cabinet with the hand of the original statue of Justice. The lobby is illuminated by a skylight and contains a beautiful walnut double staircase. A balcony runs along the open hallway of the third floor with arched portals to the offices around the exterior of the building. ==NotesFurther reading== *Marzulli, Lawrence J., The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses, Gray Printing Company, Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair, Ohio's Court Houses, Ohio State Bar Association, Columbus, Ohio 1980 ==External links== *Butler County Court Website *Remarkable Ohio article Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Hamilton, Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1889 Category:Clock towers in Ohio ","title":"Butler County Courthouse (Ohio)"},{"id":"12380843","text":"Butler County Courthouse may refer to: *Butler County Courthouse (Alabama), Greenville, Alabama * Butler County Courthouse (Iowa), Allison, Iowa * Butler County Courthouse (Kansas), El Dorado, Kansas * Butler County Courthouse (Missouri), Poplar Bluff, Misosuri * Butler County Courthouse (Ohio), Hamilton, Ohio * Butler County Courthouse (Pennsylvania), Butler, Pennsylvania ","title":"Butler County Courthouse"},{"id":"12380844","text":"In enzymology, an alliin lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :an S-alkyl-L-cysteine S-oxide \\\\rightleftharpoons an alkyl sulfenate + 2-aminoacrylate Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, S-alkyl-L-cysteine S-oxide, and two products, alkyl sulfenate and 2-aminoacrylate. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-alkyl-L-cysteine S-oxide alkyl-sulfenate-lyase (2-aminoacrylate-forming). Other names in common use include alliinase, cysteine sulfoxide lyase, alkylcysteine sulfoxide lyase, S-alkylcysteine sulfoxide lyase, L-cysteine sulfoxide lyase, S-alkyl-L- cysteine sulfoxide lyase, and alliin alkyl-sulfenate-lyase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate. Many alliinases contain a novel N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF-like domain). == Occurrence == These enzymes are found in plants of the genus Allium, such as garlic and onions. Alliinase is responsible for catalyzing chemical reactions that produce the volatile chemicals that give these foods their flavors, odors, and tear- inducing properties. Alliinases are part of the plant's defense against herbivores. Alliinase is normally sequestered within a plant cell, but, when the plant is damaged by a feeding animal, the alliinase is released to catalyze the production of the pungent chemicals. This tends to have a deterrent effect on the animal. The same reaction occurs when onion or garlic is cut with a knife in the kitchen. == Chemistry == In garlic, an alliinase enzyme acts on the chemical alliin converting it into allicin. The process involves two stages: elimination of 2-propenesulfenic acid from the amino acid unit (with Œ±-aminoacrylic acid as a byproduct), and then condensation of two of the sulfenic acid molecules. Reaction scheme for the conversion: cysteine ‚Üí alliin ‚Üí allicin Alliin and related substrates found in nature are chiral at the sulfoxide position (usually having the S absolute configuration, and alliin itself was the first natural product found to have both carbon- and sulfur-centered stereochemistry. However, the sulfenic acid intermediate is not chiral, and the final product's stereochemistry is not controlled. There are a range of similar enzymes that can react with the cysteine-derived sulfoxides present in different species. In onions, an isomer of alliin, isoalliin, is converted to 1-propenesulfenic acid. A separate enzyme, the lachrymatory factor synthase or LFS, then converts this chemical to syn- propanethial-S-oxide, a potent lachrymator. The analogous butyl compound, syn- butanethial-S-oxide, is found in Allium siculum species. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, using X-ray crystallography.

It competes in the Croatian First Football League, the country's top division. Founded in 1914, the club's only period of success came in the late 1940s and the early 1950s before spending most of the following five decades as lower-level minnows. Between 2007 and 2009 they won three consecutive promotions to rise from the fourth level to the first level in the Croatian football league system. They hosted their home matches at Stadion Maksimir for a couple of years before moving to Stadion Kranjƒçeviƒáeva, as their own ground in the Novi Zagreb's Kajzerica neighbourhood is unsuitable for the top level football. ==History== NK Lokomotiva was founded as ≈Ω≈†K Victoria (≈Ωeljezniƒçarski ≈°portski klub \\"Victoria\\") in 1914. After World War I, the name of the club was changed to ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, under which they competed between the two wars. At that time, they were mostly in the shadow of the city's bigger clubs Graƒëanski, Concordia and HA≈†K. They played in the first level only in the 1940‚Äì41 season. In 1945, the club was renamed Lokomotiva and soon their most productive years followed. They continuously played for 8 seasons (1947‚Äì1955) in the Yugoslav First League with the best league result in 1952, when they finished third, behind Hajduk Split and Red Star Belgrade. Some of the players at that time were Vladimir ƒåonƒç, Vladimir Firm, Drago Hmelina, Franjo Beserdi and Oto Bobek, younger brother of legendary Stjepan Bobek. They won Yugoslav Second League in 1956, but were relegated again from the First League in the summer of 1957 and never returned to the Yugoslav top flight again. They played in the Yugoslav Second League until 1970 and then also in the Yugoslav Inter-Republic League in the last years before the dissolution of Yugoslavia. After Croatian independence and the formation of the Prva HNL in 1991, Lokomotiva played in the lower leagues of Croatian football, mostly spending their time in the Treƒáa HNL. In 2006, before relegation to the fourth division, Lokomotiva became the feeder team for Dinamo Zagreb. This sparked a story of one of the most incredible rises through the leagues in Croatian football. Lokomotiva gained promotion in each of the next three season, finishing first in the ƒåetvrta HNL in the 2006‚Äì07 season, second in the Treƒáa HNL in the 2007‚Äì08 season, and third in the Druga HNL in the 2008‚Äì09 season. The promotion from the second to the first division of Croatian football in 2009 meant that in the 2009‚Äì10 season, Lokomotiva would be back in the top flight for the first time after 52 years. The side recovered from a poor start in the league and finished in a respectable 8th position out of 16 teams, with notable victories 4‚Äì2 away against NK Zagreb, home 3‚Äì0 over Rijeka, and 2‚Äì1 over Hajduk Split. Their top scorer, Nino Bule, finished with 14 goals. Due to rules against second sides being in the same division, they legally split their connection to Dinamo Zagreb. To meet the criteria for the Prva HNL, they played their games at Stadion Maksimir before moving on to Stadion Kranjƒçeviƒáeva which is now the club's home. The club's base and youth teams area are located in Kajzerica neighborhood. The 2012‚Äì13 season was the best in recent history for Lokomotiva. They finished in second place ahead of clubs such as Rijeka, Hajduk Split and RNK Split. Young star Andrej Kramariƒá, on loan from Dinamo Zagreb, finished second in the scoring charts with 15 goals. With the second place finish, Lokomotiva qualified for the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round. In their first European encounter, the side faced FC Dinamo Minsk, unfortunately losing on the away goals rule after winning 2‚Äì1 away from home, but losing 3‚Äì2 at home. Lokomotiva established itself as a 1. HNL side, finishing between 4th and 6th place for the next six seasons. The club managed its first European aggregate victory over Airbus UK Broughton F.C. in the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League and navigating three stages of qualifying rounds in the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Europa League, before losing 4‚Äì2 to Belgian Pro League side K.R.C. Genk in the playoff round. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, which was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Lokomotiva had the best season in its history, finishing in second place in the league and finishing as runners-up in the Croatian Football Cup, losing 1‚Äì0 to Rijeka in the final. With Croatia's improved UEFA Ranking, this meant that Lokomotiva went into the 2020‚Äì21 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds for the first time in its history, where it drew SK Rapid Wien in the second qualifying round.

Deuscher House is a historic farmhouse in the countryside of the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located near the city of Trenton, it was originally home to one of the area's leading farmers, and it has been named a historic site. ==Henry P. Deuscher== Born in the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1830, Henry P. Deuscher emigrated to the United States in early childhood. Upon entering into man's estate, he worked as a butcher in Trenton, but at the age of twenty-seven he bought a farm of in Madison Township and soon moved to it.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 85. Deuscher's itineracy continued: he soon left the farming life and became a storekeeper in Trenton with a Mr. Wannenwetsch, left the store and returned to his farm, and left the farm to run a distillery. In 1874, he formed H.P. Deuscher & Company to operate a malting business, but the company later changed from brewing to manufacturing farm equipment, and later school desks and other cast iron machinery and parts. Amid all of these other employments, Deuscher found time to form and command a company of the 83rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War.Simmons, David. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Angerdale Farm. Ohio Historical Society, 1976-01-28. ==Architecture== Built of brick with sandstone elements on a stone foundation, the two-story Deuscher House features a central projecting bay containing the entrance and its fanlight; a small gable with oculus sits at the top of the projection. On the left side of the facade, as seen from the road, is a large bay window on the first floor with a single window on the second, while two windows are placed on each floor on the facade's right side. A hip roof covers the house, descending to form a cornice supported by paired brackets., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-01. A small widow's walk sits atop the roof, which is ringed by a railing and pierced by four chimneys, and three hood molded windows are placed in the bay. The farmstead includes three other buildings: a barn and shed dating from the farm's early years, and a much newer garage. These elements combine to make the 1870 residence a fine example of the Italianate style of architecture. ==Preservation== In 1984, the Deuscher House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because it was the home of a prominent local resident and because of its historically significant architecture. Numerous other farmhouses in the vicinity of Trenton are listed on the National Register, but the Deuscher House differs greatly from the residue: all others were built by a group of German Amish Mennonites connected with the family of Christian Augspurger, and their plain designs differ greatly from Deuscher's high-style architecture. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:Houses in Butler County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio ","title":"Henry P.

As per Sri Lankan military sources, the military operation launched to gain the area of Vakarai from LTTE was conducted in two phases. The first phase was to facilitate the movement of civilians into the area under the Sri Lankan army (SLA). The Deep Penetration Unit (DPU) of the SLA infiltrated the area under the LTTE, and launched surprise attacks on them. This tactic caused the LTTE to engage with the SLA instead of holding the civilians (hostages) from fleeing into the SLA control zone. The phase-II started on December 4, 2006 where the SLA troops advanced in three fronts from Trikonamadu(Thrikonamaduva), Kirimichchiya (Kirimaetiyaava), Kadjuwatte and cleared off 15 km into the Trikonamadu jungle.

In 1994 the SLA withdrew their military bases from this area. Comments about the battle The opposition leader of the Sri Lanka Parliament Ranil Wickremasinghe criticized the government for treating the capture of Thoppigala as a matter of national significance. He stated at a public gathering at Galle, the capital of southern Sri Lanka, that Thoppigala is a jungle area larger than the district of Colombo, with no other significance. However, in September 2007 the United National Party (UNP) led by Wickremasinghe announced a change of party policy, abandoning its federalist policy stand \\"in view of the LTTE defeat in the east.BBC news report This itself shows the far-reaching implications of the war in the Eastern theater. ==Commemoration of the victory in east== The government of Sri Lanka commemorated the military defeat of the LTTE, in Eastern province of the country in the morning of July 19, 2007, called \\"New Dawn to the East \\".

Part of its significance derives from its placement in its neighborhood: one of western Hamilton's most prominent houses, it anchors the neighborhood's built environment both because of its architecture and because of its wide grounds. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1865 Category:Buildings and structures in Hamilton, Ohio Category:Houses in Butler County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ","title":"Edgeton"},{"id":"12380915","text":" CCGS John A. MacdonaldCCGS stands for Canadian Coast Guard Ship was a Canadian Coast Guard heavy icebreaker. She was named after The Right Honourable, Sir John Alexander Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The ship was commissioned into the Canadian Department of Transport's Marine Service in 1960 using the prefix \\"Canadian Government Ship\\" (CGS). The vessel was transferred in 1962 into the newly created Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and served with distinction until being decommissioned in 1991, and replaced by the then-chartered (but later purchased) . ==Design and description== Considered one of the finest icebreakers ever constructed for the Canadian service, John A. Macdonald was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel had a fully loaded displacement of and had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 6,186 tons.Maginley and Collin, p. 151Moore, p. 86 The ship was propelled by three screws driven by a diesel-electric system creating . This gave the vessel a maximum speed of . The vessel could carry two helicopters. ==Service history== CCGS John A. Macdonald off Burnett Inlet The vessel was constructed by Davie Shipbuilding at their yard in Lauzon, Quebec with the yard number 620 and launched on 31 October 1959.The Miramar Ship Index and Jane's Fighting Ships disagree on the exact date, with Miramar claiming 31 October and Jane's, 3 October During construction, the vessel was visited by Soviet officials who took interest in her design. There was a distinct resemblance to John A. MacDonald in the five ships in the next class of Soviet icebreaker, though they were larger and more powerful.Maginley, p. 52 The vessel entered service as part of the government fleet in September 1960 as CGS John A. Macdonald. In 1962, John A. Macdonald transferred to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard and set a record by reaching Tanquary Fjord, the closest to the North Pole a Canadian vessel had ever been.Maginley, p. 120 In 1967, John A. Macdonald transited the Northwest Passage in order to aid the smaller icebreaker in the western Arctic. Following that, the icebreaker then travelled to assist after the United States Coast Guard vessel became trapped in heavy ice north of Point Barrow, Alaska. The vessel then returned to the East Coast via the Panama Canal, circumnavigating North America in the process. John A Macdonald was awarded the U.S. Coast Guard Unit Commendation \\"for extremely meritorious service in the support of United States Coast Guard operations during the period of 23 September 1967 to 08 October 1967\\", during the Arctic West Summer 1967 cruise by Admiral Willard J. Smith, Commandant, United States Coast Guard. U.S. Coast Guard COMDTINST M1650.25D, May 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security. United States Coast Guard Historian's Office. In 1969 John A. Macdonald assisted the then-new in rescuing during her transit of the Northwest Passage. John A. Macdonald made a double transit from the east to west and returned west to east. During the rescue, John A. Macdonald broke her starboard propeller in heavy ice; the propeller is on display by the Dartmouth Ferry Terminal, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. John A. Macdonald was assisted by the United States Coast Guard icebreakers Northwind and In 1974 the merchant vessel Atlantean I was damaged on Lake Ontario, received repairs at Montreal and Quebec City and failed to pay for them. An order of arrest was produced but the vessel sailed without authorization. In February 1975, the Gulf of St. Lawrence was filled with ice and John A. MacDonald was sent to intercept the ship, now renamed Answer. Stuck in ice and boarded by lawyers bearing the warrants, the captain of the merchant vessel refused to sail for Gasp√©, Quebec. On 28 February, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Coast Guard personnel were placed on board the merchant and the two ships sailed for Sept-√éles, Quebec. However, as soon as Answer was free of the heavy ice, the ship broke escort and fled for the Atlantic. After legal arguments were heard over the right of Canada to seize the vessel, the ship was boarded a third time, the crew taken off and Answer and John A. Macdonald arrived at Sept-√éles on 7 March.Maginley, pp. 192‚Äì93 Also in 1975, John A. Macdonald made a partial transit of the Northwest Passage, westward, through Lancaster Sound, Peel Sound and Victoria Strait, and sailed to aid CCGS Camsell again after the smaller Coast Guard ship was damaged in the Western Arctic. In 1977, the ship was chartered to Dome Petroleum.Maginley, p. 129 During 1978 John A. Macdonald made an east to west partial transit of the Northwest Passage, traveling on charter to Dome Petroleum, through Lancaster Sound, Prince of Wales Strait and the Beaufort Sea. During the winter of 1978‚Äì79, the vessel was laid up. In 1979, the vessel made another partial transit of the Northwest Passage, west to east, returning eastward from a charter operation.Maginley, p. 126 John A. Macdonald returned to Coast Guard service in 1980 and supported the search that confirmed the wreck of , which had been crushed by ice and sank in the Arctic Ocean in 1853. The following year, John A. Macdonald escorted a factory barge to Little Cornwallis Island where the barge was beached and incorporated into the island. During 1985 John A. Macdonald made a further partial transit of the Northwest Passage traveling westward, through Peel Sound, Victoria Strait, Amundsen Gulf and back. That year, the icebreaker was sent to escort through Canadian waters as far as Viscount Melville Sound during the American vessel's unauthorized transit through waters claimed by Canada.Maginley, p. 127 In 1987 she underwent an eight-month, $8-million (CAD) refit. In 1988 the ship made another partial transit of the Northwest Passage traveling westward, through Lancaster Sound, Peel Sound and Demarcation Point then back. In November‚ÄìDecember 1989, the Canadian Coast Guard went on strike and John A. Macdonald was the only Coast Guard vessel to remain at sea, escorting to Nanisivik.Maginley, p. 88 The ship was taken out of service in 1991. The vessel was replaced by , initially on charter to the Canadian Coast Guard, which was later purchased.Maginley and Collin, pp. 151, 158 The vessel was transferred to Crown Assets and was renamed 1201.

Previously serving as Scranton's 24th President from 2003-2011, Pilarz was announced as the successor of Kevin Quinn on March 21, 2017. Prior to returning to Scranton, Pilarz served as the President of the Marquette University and Georgetown Prep. As an academic, Pilarz is considered an expert on medieval and Renaissance literature as well as Jesuit education. ==Biography== Early life and education Scott Pilarz was raised by his parents, Joan and Joseph Pilarz, in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Camden and Philadelphia. Pilarz has a younger sister, Susan. Pilarz graduated from Camden Catholic High School in 1977. He received a bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown University in 1981, although he had initially enrolled at Georgetown with the intention of studying politics. Pilarz became interested in the priesthood as an undergraduate student at Georgetown and put together a plan to join the Jesuits during his Senior year. Pilarz elaborated on his interest in a 2010 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \\"I remember going into the library, sneaking into the stacks, looking at books about Jesuits. I wouldn't want all my friends to know I was thinking about this. It was kind of an impulse thing at the time...I thought I'd give this a shot and I did...And it felt right all the way along.\\" Pilarz told his family of his decision to join the Jesuits after dinner at their home in Voorhees, New Jersey. He first entered the Society of Jesus in August 1981 and was ordained a Catholic priest within the Jesuit order in 1992. Pilarz later obtained a master's degree in philosophy from Fordham University. He also attended Weston School of Theology, where he received two additional master's degrees in theology and divinity. Pilarz completed his doctorate in English from the City University of New York (CUNY). His doctoral dissertation, entitled Sacerdotal Self-Fashioning: Priesthood in the Poetry of Robert Southwell, S.J., and John Donne, earned Pilarz the CUNY Alumni Achievement Prize for Dissertation Excellence in 1997. Academics Pilarz is considered to be an expert on medieval and Renaissance literature. He taught philosophy at the Ss. Peter & Paul Seminary at the University of Ibadan in Ibadan, Nigeria while studying for his master's degrees at the Weston School. Pilarz was also appointed professor of English at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia in 1994. Georgetown University Pilarz began teaching at his alma mater, Georgetown University, as an assistant professor of English in 1996. The Georgetown University class of 1999 awarded Pilarz with the Edward B. Bunn, S.J., Award for Faculty Excellence for service and teaching. In 2002, he was appointed the interim university chaplain at Georgetown. The appointment of chaplain also gave Pilarz a seat in the cabinet of Georgetown President John J. DeGioia. During his tenure as a Georgetown faculty member, Father Pilarz became involved in a movement to revive the university's Jack the Bulldog live mascot called \\"Bring Back Jack.\\" In 1998, Pilarz collaborated with three students and co-founders of the Hoya Blue fan club ‚Äì Michael Boyle, Austin Martin, and Kathleen Long ‚Äì to bring back the bulldog mascot tradition at Georgetown. The Hoya Blue club and the senior class raised $1,500 to purchase Jack, Georgetown's first live mascot since the 1970s. Father Pilarz personally picked up the new Jack the Bulldog, who was named John P. Carroll then a nine- month-old puppy, upon his arrival at Washington Dulles International Airport on February 16, 1999. Father Pilarz became Jack's caretaker and roommate at Georgetown. He would walk Jack in the mornings and evenings while student volunteers walked the bulldog mascot during the day while Pilarz was in class or other university functions. In 2003, Father Pilarz was named the President of the University of Scranton. Pilarz brought \\"John P. Carroll\\" with him from Georgetown to Scranton when he became President of the University of Scranton in July 2003. \\"John P. Carroll\\" was retired in May 2003 so that he could accompany Father Pilarz to Scranton. Financial donations from Hoya Blue, the Hoya Hoop Club, the Office of the President and alumni allowed for the purchase of Jack's successor bulldog at Georgetown. Jack the Bulldog turned eleven years old in 2010 and lived with Father Pilarz at the University of Scranton until he became President of Marquette University during the summer of 2011. Father Pilarz was expected to move with \\"John P. Carroll\\" to Milwaukee when he became President of Marquette University in August 2011, but the dog died at the Pilarz's parents home in Voorhees, New Jersey, on September 16, 2011, at the age of 12. President of the University of Scranton Pilarz joined the University of Scranton's board of trustees in 2000. Then-president Joseph McShane notified members of the board in December 2002 that he would leave the University of Scranton to become president of Fordham University. Pilarz was approached by several members of the Scranton board who proposed that he submit his name as a candidate to succeed McShane. Pilarz submitted his name for inclusion in the presidential search after discussing the matter with his Provincial in Baltimore. The University of Scranton named Pilarz as its 24th president in an announcement on April 23, 2003. He assumed the presidency on July 1, 2003, succeeding outgoing president McShane. Pilarz's inauguration took place on September 26, 2003. One of the centerpieces of Pilarz's tenure at Scranton has been the development and implementation of a strategic plan called \\"Pride, Passion, Promise ‚Äì Shaping Our Jesuit Tradition\\". The plan has included a $125 million capital campaign overseen by Pilarz which intended to transform the campus through the construction of new facilities including a new campus center, two new dormitories and a science building. In January 2008, a $35 million campus center, Patrick and Margaret DeNaples Center, was completed. The new Loyola Science Center, an $83 million building which is the largest capital and construction project in the history of the University of Scranton, was expected to open during the fall 2011 semester. On September 14, 2010, the university blessed and broke ground for the two new $33 million dormitories, which will contain apartment-style dorms and a fitness center. The dorms, with a combined of space, will house 400 additional students on campus. In remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony, Pilarz noted that the new dormitories would \\"add a splendor to this gateway corridor to the city\\" of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Additionally, The Commons, the main walkway through the campus, has been expanded to include portions of Clay Avenue and Linden Street during Pilarz's tenure, effectively lengthening the campus. The entire $125 million capital campaign, including the Science Center and dormitories currently under construction, was expected to be completed in fall 2011. Pilarz oversaw launch of a $100 million fundraising campaign, beginning in April 2008. Pilarz has also been credited with boosting the university's student enrollment. Scranton had a total undergraduate and graduate student population of approximately 5,500 people, as of 2010. Scranton has also continued to excel academically under Pilarz. U.S. News & World Report ranked Scranton as number 10 out 165 universities and colleges in the Northeast United States in August 2010. In August 2010, Pilarz led a delegation of University of Scranton officials to Rwanda to seek potential partnerships between the university and the Rwandan government. Pilarz announced that the University of Scranton and the Rwandan Ministry of Education would sign a memorandum of understanding to promote faculty and student exchanges. In an interview with The New Times newspaper, Pilarz stated, \\"Due to the history of Rwanda and its tremendous improvement in human rights promotion and economic development, we are seeking to partner with the Government of Rwanda to integrate an examination of the country into the life of the university.\\" Pilarz initiated the creation of a support group for gays and lesbians at the University of Scranton called \\"Inclusion Initiative\\", explaining \\"There is no room for prejudice on a Catholic campus.\\" Throughout his tenure at Scranton, Pilarz had continued to teach at least one course each semester, focusing on a diverse range of subjects, including 16th- century British literature, Renaissance poetry and a course called \\"Playing God: Theatrical Expression of Divinity.\\" In 2010, author Ronald M. Shapiro profiled Pilarz as one of thirty-eight individuals included in his book, \\"Dare to Prepare: How to Win Before You Begin,\\" which became a New York Times bestseller. Shapiro cited Pilarz's work at the University of Scranton and his fundraising skills for his inclusion in the book. President of Marquette University Father Pilarz was elected to the board of trustees of Marquette University in Milwaukee in September 2009. In March 2010, Pilarz attended his first meeting as a board member. Coincidentally, Marquette President, Father Robert A. Wild, S.J., announced his intention to retire in 2011 after fifteen years as president of the university during the same month. A presidential selection committee, headed by Mary Ellen Stanek, began searching for Wild's successor. On Tuesday, August 31, 2010, the Marquette Board of Trustees unanimously selected Pilarz as Marquette University's 23rd President and successor to Wild. Pilarz served as the President of the University of Scranton until he was succeeded by Rev. Kevin P. Quinn, S.J. on July 1, 2011. He officially became president of Marquette University on August 1, 2011. Father Pilarz notified the Marquette University Board of Trustees on September 20, 2013 of his decision to resign as university president at the end of the fall semester 2013; the semester ended on December 14, 2013. After 10 years serving in the capacity of a university president, Father Pilarz planned to pursue new apostolic work as a Jesuit priest.http://www.twincities.com/education/ci_24143428/milwaukee-marquette- university-president-stepping-down?source=rss President of Georgetown Preparatory School Father Pilarz accepted his appointment to become President of Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda Maryland, starting effectively on July 1, 2014.

Built in 1825 (Elliott) and 1836 (Stoddard), they were designed in the Federal style and modeled after Connecticut Hall at Yale University. They continue to be used as dormitory buildings, making them the two oldest college dormitories still in use in Ohio. They were the original dormitories on the campus and were built to house students who attended classes at Miami's campus. They have both been through a number of renovations, most recently in 2011. The dorms are located in between the two academic quads located in the center of Miami's campus. They face another landmark on the campus, the Miami University seal. Over time they have become landmarks on the campus and are considered two of the most prestigious dorms to live in. They are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, they house students in the Scholar Leaders program. The buildings are named for early Miami professors Charles Elliott and Orange Nash Stoddard. Phi Delta Theta fraternity was founded in Elliott Hall in 1848. Phi Kappa Tau founders William H. Shideler and Clinton D. Boyd lived together in the same room in Elliott at the time of their fraternity's founding in 1906. Both buildings were rebuilt in 1937 with the assistance of the Public Works Administration. In 2011, Elliott and Stoddard Halls became the first dorms at Miami to convert to geothermal energy instead of using the coal and natural gas steam system. The new system reduced the two buildings' energy consumption by 61 percent. ==Elliott Hall== Room in Elliott Hall where Phi Delta Theta was founded in 1848 Originally known as North Dorm or \\"Old North,\\" construction on Elliott Hall was completed in 1825. The dorm was originally used for student housing and its purpose has remained the same since its opening. The building was originally constructed for a total cost of $7,000. The dorm housed 35 men. Each resident was given survival tools upon their arrival to ensure their comfort and safety in the dorm. These tools included; a bed, chairs, table, cook utensils, an ax to cut wood for the fireplaces in each room, and a warm cap. The first renovations were started on the building in 1899. The first renovation was the addition of multiple new technologies for the time, which were supposed to make the dorm a more modern building. These renovations included the addition of a steam heater, electrical lights and modern bathrooms. These first set of renovations were mainly mechanical ones in order for the building to keep up with the changing times. The next renovation on the building took place in 1912. With this renovation the central hall of the building was removed and was later replaced by two-side halls, which virtually cut the hall into two sections. Both the corridors were named for professors at the school. The two professors who the two corridors are named for are R.B.C. Johnson and Charles Elliott. The next renovations came to the building in 1937. With these renovations the building took on all the same features and characteristics that it has today. To get ready to bring the building into the New Miami look many things were done. The interior of the building was completely redone. This caused the special layout of the space to become a much more unified building. On the exterior of the building all the bricks were sandblasted in order to make it fit in with the other buildings on Miami's campus. Also a number of the original chimneys were removed. In 1848, the fraternity Phi Delta Theta was founded in room 202 of Elliott Hall. The two co-founders of the fraternity, Robert Morrison and John M. Wilson, were both roommates in this room when they decided to try and cultivate the fraternity. Today this room acts as a shrine to these two men. The room consists of two beds, a table, portraits of the men, and a stone plaque to help commemorate the founding of Phi Delta Theta. This room has seen little change since the founding of the fraternity. After the final set of renovations had been completed on the dorm it officially had its name changed from North Dorm to Elliott Hall in recognition of Charles Elliott who one of the corridors had been named after. Elliott was a professor at Miami University between 1849 and 1863. He was a professor of Logic and Greek Language and Literature. He received his education from a number of schools including; Lafayette College, Ohio University, Hanover College, and Princeton Theological Seminary. He later died in 1892 at the age of 77. ==Stoddard Hall== Originally known as Southeast Building, construction was completed in 1836. This was the third building completed on Miami's campus and was used as housing for junior and senior male students. The building was completed for a total cost of $9,000 and housed up to 29 students. In 1868, the Miami chapter of Delta Upsilon fraternity was founded in room 4, the room of one of the original members, William Eltzroth. Today, a plaque inside Stoddard describes to the founding of the chapter and is dedicated to the 12 members of the fraternity who died during World War II. Delta Upsilon was the sixth and final fraternity from the \\"Old Miami\\" era. For a short period of time the campus YMCA was housed in Stoddard Hall in 1869 and also housed classrooms while the main academic building, Old Main, was under renovations. In 1937 a large renovation project was started on ‚ÄúOld South‚Äù to try and bring the building into the New Miami era. The main objective of this renovation was to make ‚ÄúOld North‚Äù and ‚ÄúOld South‚Äù together and to make them fit with the rest of the architecture that was progressing on Miami's campus. The entire interior space of the building was gutted, and the old fireplaces and stove openings had to be removed. The circulation patterns of the building were also rerouted to make traveling throughout the building more user friendly and simple. After the renovation had been completed Miami decided to rename the building Stoddard Hall in honor of Professor Orange Nash Stoddard. Stoddard was a professor at Miami University between 1845 and 1870. During this time period he taught natural Science and acted as President in 1854. He received his education from Union College and Monmouth. Stoddard later died on February 10, 1892. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures of Miami University Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:University and college dormitories in the United States ","title":"Elliott and Stoddard Halls"},{"id":"12380949","text":"Fairfield Township Works I is a registered historic site near Hamilton, Ohio, listed in the National Register on 1971-11-05. == Historic uses == * Graves/Burials * Ceremonial Complex == Notes == Category:Mounds in Ohio Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio ","title":"Fairfield Township Works I"},{"id":"12380956","text":"Friday the 13th is an American horror franchise that consists of twelve slasher films, a television show, novels, and comic books.

He is met briefly as Chris Higgins nearly runs him over with her van as he is lying in the middle of the road. After thanking the teens for their compassion and kindness, Abel claims that \\"he\\" (Jason) had given him a token to warn off any who venture into the area. He reveals the gift as a disembodied eyeball, which suddenly frightens the teens who drive off and leave him behind as he continues to proclaim his warning. He is never seen again. Admiral Robertson Admiral Robertson was a character in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, played by Warren Munson.

He is the father of Sean Robertson (Scott Reeves), while in the ship's cabin he and Sean argue over the procedure of how to correctly set sail. During a violent storm Admiral Robertson briefly leaves the wheel, while he is gone Jason kills his first mate. Admiral Robertson returns to the cabin to find the first mate's dead body, Jason then appears from behind and slits his throat with a machete. Admiral Robertson's body is later found by Sean and Rennie. Alexis Peterson Alexis Peterson was a character in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. Alexis, Deborah, and Deborah's boyfriend Luke, hitchhiked to Crystal Lake to celebrate Jason's death. When Steven gave them a ride, Alexis flirted with Steven, unsuccessfully trying to persuade him to come with them. After skinny dipping, Alexis slept outside while Luke and Deborah had sex in her tent. While peeing, a Jason-possessed Phil slashed Alexis to death with a scalpel, and propped her corpse on a tree. Ali Ali is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by Nick Savage. Ali is the leader of a biker gang, consisting of himself, Fox, and Loco. After a tense confrontation with Shelly and Vera at a convenience store, Shelly destroys the gang's bikes in front of Ali. In retaliation, the gang sneaks into Higgins Haven and drains the gas from Chris's van. When Fox and Loco wander into the barn, Ali goes to check on them where he discovers their corpses. Jason then beats Ali unconscious with a pipe wrench. Ali later awakens when Chris is about to be killed by Jason and attacks him. Jason severs Ali's hand and slices him to pieces with his machete. An alternate ending saw Ali and Chris survive and contact the authorities only for Jason's body to be missing when they arrive. Alice Hardy Alice Hardy is the main hero of the film Friday the 13th, played by Adrienne King. She is one of the camp counselors hired by Steve Christy to reopen and work at Camp Crystal Lake. In the film, the counselors are murdered until she is eventually left alone as the only survivor, and is discovered by Pamela Voorhees. Mrs. Voorhees explains to Alice how her son Jason drowned at the camp several years ago, and reveals herself to be the killer. After a long chase and a brief struggle, Alice is finally able to decapitate Mrs. Voorhees with a machete before passing out in a canoe on the lake. There, she suffers a nightmare in which Jason's decayed corpse drags her underwater. The police arrive and take Alice to the hospital. When she tells them her story, they explain that they did not find a boy, to which she replies \\"Then he's still there...\\" Alice makes a brief reappearance in the opening scene of Friday the 13th Part 2, where she is stabbed in the temple in her apartment by an adult Jason Voorhees, who evidently survived his childhood drowning and had tracked her down. Later in the movie, Paul explains how Alice went missing and blood was found in her apartment. Her decomposed body is later seen in Jason's shack. Alice also appears in a flashback in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Alice's backstory is expanded upon in the novelization of Friday the 13th, which reveals she has a boyfriend named John in California and that her father was a neglectful workaholic who, due to stress, died of a heart attack while at his office. This backstory is contradicted in the novelization of the second film, which states Alice's father is still alive, also mentioning that Jason had tracked Alice down to her apartment by memorizing what her car looked like when she had made a visit to the camp. Alice also appears in the prologue of the Freddy vs. Jason novelization as a shade in Hell. In the novel Friday the 13th: The Jason Strain, Jason witnesses a holographic projection of Pamela being attacked by a soldier and suffers a hallucination which causes him to perceive the soldier as Alice, while the novel Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs adapts Alice's battle with Pamela as its prologue, and also features an appearance by her corpse which is found in Jason's shack by Glo and her friends and, later, the police. Alice makes a cameo appearance in the sixth and final issue of WildStorm's Friday the 13th comic series, in a flashback depicting Jason's attack on her from the first film. The second issue of the comic miniseries Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale by WildStorm also features a cameo appearance by Alice, depicting the scene from the first film when she first meets Mrs. Voorhees. Although always the heroine, Alice was originally scripted as a slightly less sympathetic character than seen in the final cut of the first film. In early drafts, she was having an affair with a married man on the West Coast, which was the reason her relationship with Steve Christy is deteriorating and she wants to leave Crystal Lake. Adrienne King claims she played the character as a traditional horror movie character, stating \\"I think that Alice is a great scream queen heroine. You got the feeling that Alice could handle anything which, in a way, she could\\". She also expresses regret that, due to the nature of horror movies, audiences never got to see more of Alice's relationship with Steve, or what could have happened between her and fellow counsellor, Bill. Rather than viewing the character as a victim, King describes the role as an \\"empowering position\\" due to her survival in the film. Steve Miner, director of Part 2, says \\"Alice was a very special character: she was the hero of the first film and indestructible in a way. It was important that she be killed off in a dramatic way because this is Jason's film and avenging the death of his mother is what motivates him.\\" Because the character displayed an artistic side in the first film, production designer Virginia Field included various sketches in her apartment in order to show that Alice was a \\"real person\\". She says, \\"It didn't seem like a big deal at the time we were filming, but I knew that Alice liked to draw and I wanted to show evidence of that.\\" Adrienne King felt that killing her character was somewhat unusual since she had survived so much in the original film. She claims Alice's death was done in such a way to leave the door open for a possible return, but does not know how she could have survived an icepick through the head.Grove, David, pg.71-73 Alice's decayed corpse appears as a part of the model of Jason's shrine to his mother NECA has released. Mezco Toyz has also released a screen grab statuette of Alice, which depicts the hallucination of Jason attacking her from the ending of Friday the 13th. Alice Hardy was Jason Voorhees's first murder victim, yet he murdered her in her house, not at the Crystal Lake Campground. Alice Jane Witney Alice Jane Witney is a character in the novel Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs. The daughter of George Arthur Witney, the owner of a traveling carnival called Doktor Geistmann's Carnival of Terror, Alice loathes her life, believing the carnival has ruined any chance she has for a better life. After the carnival is run out of Crystal Lake by the superstitious locals, Alice, while driving an RV drunk, runs over Jason Voorhees. Jason, weakened due to his battle with Freddy Krueger, is knocked out after being hit and is collected by Alice and the other carnival workers, who decide to use him as the newest sideshow attraction. While setting up the Jason display in a town, Alice learns from fellow carnival worker Kenton Freely that her mother had hated the carnival and that her father had lied to her‚ÄîAlice's mother did not die in a carnival accident, she had actually died when George stabbed her to death after finding her and Kenton together; Kenton had been blackmailing George with this information, so he could embezzle from the carnival and eventually take it over. Devastated by this news, Alice, becoming drunk, steals a laptop from one of the carnies and uses it to put Jason up for sale on an internet auction site called ZingBid. Passing out after putting Jason up for auction, Alice awakens to find Jason rampaging through the carnival, having woken after a teenage girl named Glo, who had been possessed by Pamela Voorhees, came in proximity to him. After he kills the Pamela-possessed Glo, Jason falls comatose again and is taken by Alice, who drives away from the ruined carnival. Despite losing her laptop and being attacked by FBI agents and Jason when he briefly revives, Alice manages to reach a computer and successfully sells Jason to a shock rocker named Ross Feratu for five million dollars. Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs ends with Alice relaxing in a resort in the Caribbean, enjoying her new wealth. Andy Beltrami Andy Beltrami is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by Jeffrey Rogers.

Several years later, he is mentioned along with Claudette by Enos, the truck driver, when a young girl named Annie Phillips hitches a ride halfway to Camp Crystal Lake. Little information is given about this character, but he is notable for being the first murder victim of the entire series. * Some fans strongly suspect that these two counselors, Barry and Claudette, were in some way the ones responsible for Jason's drowning, while others do not. This has resulted in a long-running debate among fans of the franchise. * Barry and Claudette are featured or mentioned in some of the Friday the 13th comics which attempt to fill in some of the blanks.

Using holographic technology developed by Dr. Cain, Butch and Alex manage to capture Jason by making him believe Alex is Pamela Voorhees and take him to Dr. Cain's compound, where a cure for the Jason Strain (which will not affect Jason, but will kill the infected and immunize the living) is being released into the air. Upon reaching the compound, Butch and Alex find Dr. Cain dying, having been shot repeatedly by soldiers working for Caleb Carson, who still believes he can salvage what is left of Extreme Elimination 2. Before being captured by Caleb's soldiers, Butch manages to obtain the dosage of the Jason Strain cure meant to rid Jason of his plague spreading abilities from Dr. Cain.

He ignores a deckhand's warning that Jason Voorhees is on board killing his students, stating that \\"Walking corpses don't exist\\" and he thinks the deckhand is responsible for the murders, until he discovers him dead from an axe to his back. McCulloch, along with Van Deusen, Rennie, Sean Robertson and Julius Gaw escape the Lazarus and find their way to New York. After arriving, Rennie remembers that McCulloch was responsible for her fear of the water, by forcing her into Camp Crystal Lake to learn how to swim.

She joins her friends for a fun filled weekend at Trent's summer home on Crystal Lake. After passing the time playing games and drinking, she and Nolan go down to the lake to do some wakeboarding. As Nolan drives the boat, Chelsea loses her balance and falls into the lake. As Nolan turns the boat around, he is shot in the head with an arrow, causing his body to fall onto the throttle, increasing the boats speed. Chelsea (who is oblivious to what just happened) watches as the boat comes towards her, realizing too late as the boat runs over her, suffering a head injury. As she comes to, her eyes find Jason standing on the banks of the lake, watching her. A terrified Chelsea gets under the dock at the shoreline, but Jason appears and walks out onto the dock. Jason is shown walking off the dock and out of Chelsea's sight. As she starts to relax, a machete bursts through the top of Chelsea's head, killing her. In a deleted scene, her body is shown lying on the shoreline when Clay and Jenna stumble across her. In an interview, the writers revealed that originally after spotting Jason on the shoreline, the character would end up treading water for hours and hours, afraid of heading to shore. She eventually would tire and drown, which was something that the writers had not seen in this genre. Ultimately they decided to make the death more quick and \\"visceral\\". Chewie Wong Chad \\"Chewie\\" Wong is a character in Friday the 13th (2009), played by Aaron Yoo. He joins his friends for a fun filled weekend at Trent's summer home on Crystal Lake. Chewie passes the time getting stoned and playing games. After breaking a chair, he is directed to the tool shed by Trent to get some tools.

Chili Jachson Chili Jachson is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by Rachel Howard. Chili and her boyfriend Chuck (David Katims) are hippy stoners. On the way to Higgins Haven, the police begin following Chris Higgins's van when Chuck and Chili are smoking marijuana in the back. They get their friends to eat the \\"evidence\\", but are annoyed when the police pass them. Later that evening, Chuck and Chili are making popcorn when the power goes out. Chili finds Shelly on the doorstep with his throat slit. She thinks it's another prank but soon realizes he's actually dead. As Chili runs through the house, Jason stabs her through the stomach with a hot fire poker. He carries her body away. Chili's bloody sweater is later found by Chris in the bathtub. Chris Higgins Christine \\"Chris\\" Higgins is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by Dana Kimmell. A teenage girl who lives in the Crystal Lake area, Chris returns to her home three years after a traumatic experience. It is later revealed through flashback that Chris survived an attack by a disfigured man who turns out to be Jason Voorhees. Jason, who is still living in the forest, attacks her again at her summer home and murders her friends. Chris manages to hit Jason in the head with an axe, before suffering a hallucination of Jason's mother dragging her into the lake, similar to the ending of the first Friday the 13th. She is then taken away by the police, severely traumatized. In the opening sequence of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (which takes place the day after Part III), a mother is seen consoling her daughter in a hospital waiting room. Since the daughter is only seen from behind, the probable implication is that she is Chris. In an alternate ending of Friday the 13th Part III, Chris's fate is changed; after hearing her boyfriend Rick's voice while canoeing to safety, Chris follows it to a cabin, only to be decapitated by an unmasked Jason, who is waiting inside. In the 1982 novelization of the film, Chris, instead of striking Jason with an axe, decapitates him with a sickle, later falling unconscious and awakening in her own bed, with it being implicated by an attending doctor and police officer that the events of the previous night were simply delusions. Sneaking out of her room and to her barn after being left alone, Chris discovers both the place completely cleaned up and the bodies of her friends and the trio of bikers Jason had killed. After discovering the bodies, Chris is killed by Jason. The scene then shifts to the police officer who was guarding Chris who, after waking from a nap, enters Chris's room and finds her sleeping peacefully; after checking in on Chris, the officer listens to a radio broadcast that mentions the shopkeepers Jason had murdered earlier in the book, but makes no reference to any events having transpired at Higgins Haven. Dana Kimmell has said that she only took the role of Chris due to the paycheck, stating she felt uncomfortable working on the movie, persuading executive producer Frank Mancuso to alter or remove several scenes involving gratuitous sexual or violent material.Fangoria #62 Her reason for taking the role is similar to that of Ted White taking the role of Jason in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Chuck Garth Chuck Garth is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by David Katims. Chuck and his girlfriend Chili (Rachel Howard) are hippy stoners, always high when given the chance. On the way to Higgins Haven Chuck, Chili, Andy, Shelly and Vera are forced to eat Chuck's marijuana as the police are behind them. Chuck is unhappy when he realizes the police weren't following them. Chuck and Chili make popcorn that night and Chuck goes outside when the power goes out. As he checks the fuse box, Jason appears behind him and throws him into the fuse box electrocuting him to death. Claudette Hayes Claudette Hayes (Debra S. Hayes) is a character in the original Friday the 13th film. She was a counselor working at Camp Crystal Lake during the summer of 1958 and was Barry's girlfriend. After having sung a camp fire song with the other counselors, she snuck away with her boyfriend to have sex privately in a cabin that was used for storage. Unbeknownst to them at the time, Pamela Voorhees was lurking and watching. She eventually interrupted the two teens and killed Barry first. Claudette was left alone, screaming and pleading for her life. Despite attempts to defend herself with a few items and run away from her assailant, she was ultimately cornered and killed off-screen by Pamela. Little else is known about her, except that she is the second murder victim of the entire series. * Shortly before their death Claudette had confronted and asked Barry, \\"Does Mary Anne kiss as good as I do?\\" But Barry denied having kissed Mary Anne (presumably another camp counselor) and sweet talked his way out of it. Claudette then gave in and agreed to have sex with him. * 9-1-1 was not established as a nationwide emergency telephone number in the United States until the year 1968. Prior to that year if there was an emergency, a person would have to get in touch with a telephone operator who would then connect them with the police etc. This would have been the case in the year 1958. * Her death was not shown on camera but the script reveals that she sustained a slit throat. However, there are production still photographs that have been circulated on the internet showing Claudette's throat being slit by a machete. * In the original film, several years later, a young teenage girl named Annie hitches a ride to the newly reopened Camp Crystal Lake. During the ride, Enos, the truck driver, briefly mentions the murders of Claudette and Barry, as well as a series of other follies that befell the former owners of the camp, in an ultimately futile effort to warn Annie of the possible dangers ahead. * According to the original Friday the 13th film, it is known that Pamela Voorhees swore revenge on the counselors of Camp Crystal Lake, whom she blames for her son's death. However, there is no information or evidence directly linking Claudette and Barry to Jason's drowning. But some fans of the film strongly suspect that these two counselors were in some way the ones responsible for Jason's death, while others do not. This has resulted in a long-running debate among fans of the films. * Claudette and Barry are featured or mentioned in the Friday the 13th novel (1987) and in some of the Friday the 13th comics, which attempt to provide some background information on these characters. * In the script, she was listed simply as GIRL. * In the script, Claudette was killed before the BOY. * It can be assumed that Claudette was born some time in the 1930s or very early 1940s which would have made her a teenager or place her in her early twenties at the time of her employment and death at Camp Crystal Lake in the year 1958. Clay Miller Clay Miller is the male protagonist in Friday the 13th (2009), played by Jared Padalecki. Clay comes to Crystal Lake searching for his missing sister, Whitney, who is attacked by Jason Voorhees early in the movie. The Crystal Lake locals have given up searching for Whitney, who has not been seen for six weeks, and advise Clay to look for her somewhere else. Undeterred, Clay eventually meets a group of college students vacationing in the woods, and befriends one of them, a girl named Jenna. Jenna decides to aid Clay in his investigation of Camp Crystal Lake, but while searching the camp grounds, they witness Jason Voorhees hauling a dead body. The pair escape to warn Jenna's friends, but Jason follows them and kills the other students. Clay and Jenna eventually wind up back at the camp, where they discover Whitney alive in Jason's underground lair. As the three make their way through the tunnels, Jason murders Jenna, leaving only Clay and his sister alive. The siblings take refuge in a barn, where Jason catches up with them. Whitney uses her resemblance to Jason's mother to distract the killer long enough to stab him with his own machete. She and Clay then dispose of his body in the lake, only to be attacked once more. Jared Padalecki describes his character as a real hero, because when his sister goes missing he sets out \\"to do the right thing\\", and tends to go about it as this \\"lone wolf\\" who wants to take on this responsibility of finding his sister himself. Crazy Ralph \\"Crazy\\" Ralph is a character from both Friday the 13th and Friday the 13th Part 2, played by Walt Gorney. A man who lives in the Crystal Lake area, Ralph rides around on his bicycle telling people to stay away from Camp Crystal Lake (which he refers to as Camp Blood) or they will be killed, claiming he was a messenger sent by God to warn people of the campground's \\"death curse\\", always saying \\"Doomed. You're all doomed!\\" Ralph is murdered in Friday the 13th Part 2 by Jason Voorhees, who strangles him with a length of barbed wire and stuffs his body in a pantry, where Ginny Field discovers him. Crazy Ralph appears in archive footage in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. The opening narration to Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood voiced by Gorney is likely intended to be Ralph due to it being an explanation of the legend of Jason Voorhees. Two other characters have had a Crazy Ralph-type role. In Friday the 13th Part III, the main characters encounter an old drifter named Abel (David Wiley) while travelling to Higgins Haven. Abel carries around an eyeball which he views as an \\"omen\\" and warns the group to \\"Go back from whence ye came!\\" In Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, an unnamed deck hand (Alex Diakun) of the Lazarus, having seen Jason climb aboard, attempts to warn the crew and passengers of the ship about him (stating \\"This voyage is doomed! Doomed!\\") but is dismissed as insane and later, when people aboard the ship are found dead, is accused of being the killer. The deck hand is later killed by Jason with a fire axe to the back. In the novel Jason X: Death Moon, a character named Tobe Cunningham is hired to portray Ralph on Moon Camp Americana, a job which entails warning new arrivals to the Moon Camp about Jason and telling them to stay away from the woods and lake. Tobe is murdered by Jason in a manner almost identical to Ralph's death, being strangled with barbed wire, which is later used to decapitate him. In the later novel Friday the 13th: Hate-Kill-Repeat a farmer named Jack Flanahan recalls an encounter he had with Ralph on a stormy night, nearly shooting him by accident when he found Ralph skulking about his property, ranting about how he \\"knew what was going on under the lake\\". Ralph also makes a cameo appearance in the two-issue comic series Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale by WildStorm, which features the scene, from the first film, of him warning Annie and Enos not to go Camp Crystal Lake. Victor Miller claims that \\"the function of Crazy Ralph is to set the tone for this horrible geographic area.\\" Miller also states that in the original screenplay for Friday the 13th, Ralph was known as \\"Ralphie the Rat Boy\\" and describes the character as \\"one of those crazies you see in Deliverance, a demented person who knows the truth, a character who gives you the sense that the world you're in is not what it seems, a soothsayer right out of Shakespeare. Most people think people like Ralphie are nuts, but they are closer to reality in some ways than the 'normies'.\\" Ralph is featured in the third installment of IGN's Obscure Character of the Day feature, which has him referred to as the \\"unsung hero of the slasher movie genre\\". Creighton Duke Creighton Duke is a character in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, played by Steven Williams. An antiheroic bounty hunter who styles himself like a cowboy, Creighton witnesses Jason Voorhees being blown apart by the FBI, but remains unconvinced that Jason is truly dead. After several murders are committed in a style similar to Jason's, Creighton is hired by talk show host Robert Campbell to hunt down and kill Jason. Before going to search for Jason, Creighton attempts to warn Jason's half-sister Diana that Jason will be searching for her, but is arrested by Diana's boyfriend, the sheriff, for harassing her. While in jail, Creighton meets Steven Freeman, the ex-boyfriend of Diana's daughter Jessica who has been blamed for Jason's murder of Diana. Creighton tells Steven that Jason will be looking for Jessica because; if he manages to possess her he can recreate his body. Creighton later escapes his jail cell when a Jason-possessed Robert Campbell goes on a rampage at the police station while looking for Jessica. Going to the diner where Diana worked, Creighton abducts Stephanie, Steven and Jessica's infant daughter, and brings her to Pamela Voorhees's old house, leaving a note for Steven and Jessica telling them to meet him there. When Jessica and Steven arrive, Creighton gives Jessica a dagger, which he claims can kill Jason if it is used against him by someone of Voorhees descent. When Jason (who has possessed a local deputy) arrives at the Voorhees house, he finds and possesses Diana's body, which had earlier been moved to the house by Robert Campbell. Attempting to fight the newly resurrected Jason, Creighton is incapacitated when Jason crushes his back in a bear hug. Adam Marcus, the director of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, has imagined a backstory for Duke and claims that he survived his encounter with Jason off-screen after the film's conclusion and has hopes of creating a spin-off featuring the character. Marcus has said that he believes Creighton to be, after Jason, the best character in the Friday the 13th series, also stating Creighton \\"is the flip side of the Jason coin. A sadistic psychotic who happens to be sort of a hero or at least an enemy of Jason\\". Creighton's original name was Anderson Duke. According to Marcus, Tony Todd was among those who auditioned for the role. Creighton makes a cameo appearance in the 2003 novelization of Freddy vs. Jason. While in Hell, Jason, after impaling a girl to a tree with his machete, watches as she shifts into several mocking former victims of his, Creighton among them. Colleen Van Dueson Colleen Van Dueson is a character in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, played by Barbara Bingham.

When the group arrive in New York, Colleen is forced to watch as Rennie is kidnapped by two thugs. Colleen dies in an explosion when the police car Rennie commandeered and drove at Jason crashes and blows up, killing her instantly. Colleen is the first Friday the 13th character to encounter Jason and not be killed by him.

Spooked, Cort decides to leave and starts driving the RV recklessly sending Nikki flying. She is pulled into the bathroom and killed by Jason via having her face forced into a mirror. Cort continues to drive while listening to Alice Cooper's \\"Teenage Frankenstein\\" on high volume; he spots Jason in the rear view mirror as Jason grabs his head and stabs him in the temple, killing him and causing the mobile home to crash. ==D== Davie Falkner Davie Falkner is a character in the two-issue comic miniseries Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation by WildStorm. A 13-year-old boy suffering from a disfiguring bone disorder called craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, Davie is sent to the Camp Crystal Lake-adjacent Camp Piney Woods by his mother, despite his objections, in an attempt to have him interact with other children. While at the camp, Davie is relentlessly bullied by the other children. One night, after telling him about Jason Voorhees, a group of these bullies throw Davie into the lake. As Davie struggles to swim, Jason appears and proceeds to kill the other children, before spotting Davie. Instead of attacking Davie, Jason simply stares at him, only reacting when Davie flees from him along with two of the camp counselors. As Jason chases Davie and the counselors, the group runs into the local sheriff, Elroy P. Tanneyhill. Sheriff Tanneyhill, in a deranged state due having just used meth, opens fire on Davie and the counselors, killing the two adults. As the sheriff approaches Davie, planning on killing him as well, Davie is grabbed by Jason, who leaves the scene and the sheriff. Unable to get away from Jason, Davie can only watch as he murders a group of police officers the two encounter before moving on, with Davie slung over Jason's shoulder. While held captive by Jason for nine days, Davie befriends him after realizing that Jason has not once tried to harm him and has, in fact, provided him with such things as food and shelter. Davie grows to admire Jason, relating to him due to their similar childhood and deformities. After following Jason into the woods and aiding him in killing a pair of soldiers sent to look for him, Davie is attacked by Sheriff Tanneyhill from a helicopter, the sheriff having tracked Davie down with the intent of killing him due to Davie being the only witness to the sheriff's murder of the two camp counselors. Davie and Jason escape the sheriff and hide in a cave after Jason causes Tanneyhill's helicopter to crash. Spending the night in the cave, Davie wakes up to find Jason leaving, and attempts to stop him, only to find himself ignored. When Jason exits the cave, Davie is grabbed by Sheriff Tanneyhill, who tries to slash Davie's throat with a switchblade. Davie manages to knock Tanneyhill backwards into a hole after stabbing the sheriff in the leg with a knife he had earlier taken from one of Jason's victims. Rushing outside the cave, Davie witnesses Jason being shot and seemingly killed by a group of soldiers. As Davie mourns for Jason, Sheriff Tanneyhill, having climbed out of the pit, grabs the boy and loudly declares his intent to kill him, an announcement clearly heard by all the soldiers present. As Sheriff Tanneyhill yells at the soldiers to drop their weapons, he is attacked by a recovered Jason. Despite Davie warning him to be careful, Jason falls off a cliff while fighting with Tanneyhill, taking the sheriff with him. With Sheriff Tanneyhill dead due to the fall and Jason having disappeared, Davie is taken back home by two soldiers. He tells himself that his time with Jason was exciting and taught him a lot, believing that all of the people Jason killed during their time together were \\"assholes\\" and deserved to die, rationalizing that Jason was merely defending both of them, and simply doing what he had to do in order to survive. Debbie Klein Debbie Klein is a character in Friday the 13th Part III, played by Tracie Savage. Debbie is Andy's girlfriend and a good friend of Chris Higgins. In the summer of 1984, she goes along with her friends to Higgins Haven with Andy's roommate Shelly and his blind date Vera Sanchez. At Higgins Haven, she watches Andy and Shelly have a juggling contest before walking over to Andy and telling him he can do better things with his hands. Later, she and Andy go upstairs to have sex. As she takes a shower, Andy walks in doing a handstand, asking her if she wants a beer. At first she says yes, but soon calls out to Andy to tell him she has changed her mind, but there is no answer. Debbie lays down on the hammock to read a Fangoria magazine and soon notices blood dripping down. She looks up and sees Andy's mutilated corpse wedged in the rafters above her.

Seeking shelter, the trio discovers an abandoned cabin located in Camp Crystal Lake and, breaking in, proceed to make themselves at home. While waiting out the blizzard, Diane and Jeremy have sex. While with Jeremy, Diane notices Jason Voorhees glaring in a window at her. Shocked by the sight of Jason, Diane accidentally wakes Phil up, who walks in on her and Jeremy together. Angered and hurt at the sight of Jeremy and Diane, the latter who he has a crush on, Phil storms off outside, dismissing Diane's sighting of someone out there as a trick of the snow. Worried that Phil could freeze to death in the blizzard, Diane convinces Jeremy to go look for him. While Diane waits for Jeremy to return, Phil enters the cabin, telling Diana to barricade the entrances, as he had just found Jeremy in the woods, decapitated. While Phil pushes a couch in front of the cabin door, he is killed when Jason forces a ski pole through the door and his head. Despite Diane's attempts to keep him out, Jason bursts into the cabin and knocks her to the floor. Before Jason can attack her, Diane, tearing the ski pole out of Phil's head, impales Jason with it before fleeing outside. While running from the cabin, Diane trips on a rock, allowing Jason to catch up with her. As Jason readies himself to kill her, Diane begins to beg for her life and ask why he is doing this, before falling into a rant about how she should not have come here and how it's \\"a bad place\\". As Diane mumbles this over and over again, Jason strikes her in the head with his machete, killing her instantly, and proceeds to drag her body to Crystal Lake.

After possessing a police officer named Josh, Jason goes to his sister's house interrupting a phone call with her daughter. Seeing Jason's reflection in a mirror, Diana realizes her half- brother has possessed Josh and grabs a handgun from a drawer, shooting him in the head. Believing she had killed him, she steps over Josh's body only for Jason to grab her and tries to transfer his soul into her.

During the ensuing struggle, Diana is killed and Jason escapes. Steven is blamed for her murder and arrested. Her daughter's current boyfriend, American Casefiles host Robert Campbell, later steals her body from the morgue and places it in the Voorhees house to have it found by the police to spice up his shows ratings, only for Jason to transfer his soul from Josh's body to Roberts. During the film's climax, after his latest host is killed, Jason escapes in the form of a demonic fetus. He eventually ends up inside the cellar where Diana's body ended up and uses her body to completely resurrect himself, as he only requires the body of a Voorhees to be resurrected. Doctor Armando Castillo Doctor Armando Castillo is a character in the novel Jason X: Death Moon. An infamous scientist, Dr. Castillo has little regard for human life, his experiments often resulting in the mutilation and death of his subjects; a necrophile, cyborg and sadomasochist, Dr. Castillo is a lifelong admirer of Dr. Wimmer (a minor character in Jason X). After Jason is captured by the government, he is in the custody of Dr. Castillo, who has the government convert one of their bases on the moon into a laboratory; to cover up the unexpected reopening of the Moon Base, the government rechristens it Moon Camp Americana, a camp for delinquent girls and the set for a reality TV show hosted by pornographic and exploitation filmmaker Roger Bordeaux. Wanting to replicate Jason, Dr. Castillo keeps him in suspended animation, as he begins to murder the campers in Moon Camp Americana to use as test subjects for his experiments. After Jason escapes and goes on a rampage, Dr. Castillo, after armed soldiers prove unable to defeat Jason, resorts to blasting Jason apart with a weapon referred to as The Berzerker. With Jason apparently dead, Dr. Castillo begins the process of rebuilding him. After Jason is reconstructed, he once more breaks free and goes on a rampage. Tracking down Dr. Castillo, who had just finished having a session with his robotic mistress, Jason murders him, stabbing his face with shards of a mirror before tearing him apart and stomping his head into the ground. Despite Dr. Castillo stating in Jason X: Death Moon that he does not have a family, the novel Jason X: To The Third Power (in which Dr. Castillo's name is changed from Armando Castillo to Arthur J Castillo) reveals he has a wife and three daughters‚ÄîLuna, Terra and Skye Fellows. Jason X: To The Third Power also states that after the events of Jason X: Death Moon almost all evidence of Dr. Castillo's existence was wiped out. Doctor Hyacinth Stein Doctor Hyacinth Stein is a character in the novel Jason X: The Experiment. A well-known scientist working for the government, Dr. Stein is strict and has little regard for human life, traits which have caused some of her employees to privately refer to her as \\"Dr. Bitchenstein\\". When Jason Voorhees is captured by the military after going on a rampage at the Three Mile Island Power Plant, he is placed in the custody of Dr. Stein, who makes plans to replicate Jason's abilities to create an army of supersoldiers. After having four staff members at her research facility killed for breaking into her office, Dr. Stein begins experimenting with their corpses, hoping to somehow imbue them with Jason's powers. After several failed experiments, Dr. Stein's attempts at replicating Jason bear fruit, as a clone of Jason, one formed when some of Jason's nano ants (which Dr. Stein had been keeping immobilized, thus paralyzing Jason) manage to migrate from Jason's body to the cadavers of three of the staff members she had killed. Shortly after her discovery of the clone, Dr. Stein is killed by it and Jason (who grows immune to the devices Dr. Stein had been keeping him captive with) when the two tear her arms off, though not before Dr. Stein has a chance to press the panic button in her lab, signaling the military to come and \\"sterilize\\" the research facility. The Jason clone, after Dr. Stein is disposed of, absorbs her body into itself, the clone being in a constant state of needing to absorb living tissue to survive. Later on the novel, when two interns named Lynne and Fredo encounter Jason's clone, they discover it now has Dr. Stein's mind and voice. Before the clone can attack, Lynne and Fredo blast it apart with laser weaponry, only to notice moments later, while leaving the scene, that it has begun to regenerate. The book ends with it being stated that the clone, as well another research facility member who was mutated by exposure to Jason's cells, have been captured by the government. Dr. Stein and her work with Jason are mentioned frequently by Professor Bardox in novel Jason X: Planet of the Beast; Bardox holds the opinion that Dr. Stein's (who for an unknown reason is referred to as being male) work was both \\"extremely brilliant, and primitive\\". Doug Bell Douglas \\"Doug\\" Bell is a character in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, played by Peter Barton. Doug is a very popular guy amongst the gang of friends that stay opposite the Jarvis house. He and his girlfriend Sara are a devoted couple and Sara has saved herself for him, that night she tells him she's ready, so they have sex in the shower. Sara then goes into the bedroom to blow dry her hair, leaving Doug singing in the shower. Jason then enters the bathroom, and Doug, seeing only a vague form through the shower's steamed-up door, mistakes him for his friend, Paul, before asking if Sara has returned. Jason smashes through the shower door and slams Doug's head against the tiled wall, crushing his skull. Doug's body is seen a short while later, when Trish finds him impaled to the wall through the back of the neck. Drayton Sawyer Drayton \\"Cook\\" Sawyer is a character in the comic book miniseries Jason vs. Leatherface.

As he backs away in horror against a tree a strap is thrown over his eyes and Roy Burns, masquerading as Jason, tightens it by twisting a branch attached to the strap eventually crushing Eddie's skull. Elias Voorhees Elias Voorhees (or simply Mr. Voorhees) is the husband of Pamela Voorhees, and the father of Jason Voorhees and Diana Kimble. Virtually nothing is known about the character, making him one of few mysteries surrounding Jason in the series. The nature of Elias is much debated among fans largely due to what little information is given in Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, which is the first installment to touch upon the character in any way. Though the scenes involving and mentioning Elias were edited out of the theatrical cut (but preserved in the novelization) it nevertheless is, to date, the most information given on the character. According to Tom McLoughlin's treatment, the red-haired Elias is depicted as being silent, but quite intimidating. The caretaker of Jason's grave makes sure not to touch Elias's hand when taking his payment and is careful not to look into his eyes. There is a general belief that Elias is quite aware of what Jason is. This evidence stems from the fact that Elias paid for burials of Jason and Pamela rather than a cremation, which would have prevented Jason's resurrection. Additionally, at the end of the film and novel, Elias is seemingly aware of the fact that Jason's body is no longer in his grave (in the deleted scene, he peers into the camera; in the novel, he looks in the direction of the lake where he was left defeated in the film). The reason for abandoning his family also remains unknown and left up to fan speculation, but the closest thing to an answer is given in and with the writer of the first film, Victor Miller. When he was asked about the background of the father, Miller says that there was no time allowed for a proper backstory when they made the film, including that of Jason's father. The only idea Miller had was that Mr. Voorhees simply ran off at least in part because he could not handle Mrs. Voorhees's slightly unbalanced obsession with their child. Miller's wording does not make it clear if it was due to how Jason came out, though it is of note that Miller did not envision Jason with deformities. However, as this is only Miller's admitted assumption, the issue of discrepancies is moot. Because the information regarding Elias does not derive from what made it to film, its canonicity is unknown. However, the ninth film Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday does briefly mention Elias as the father of Jason, securing the name, at least, as canon. Elias himself is present in an early screenplay of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday written by Dean Lorey, in which he is the main antagonist and Jason's brother, instead of his father. The film's director, Adam Marcus, has stated that the version of Elias present in this early screenplay is \\"far more evil than Jason\\". In the Jason vs. Leatherface comic miniseries by Topps Comics, Elias (never referred to by name and seen only in flashbacks caused by Jason witnessing Hitchhiker's abuse of his brother Leatherface) is depicted as stereotypical \\"white trash\\" and is highly abusive towards a young Jason, beating him and calling him a freak and monster; Elias is killed by his wife, Doris (a renamed Pamela) with a machete while trying to beat Jason once again. Elias is mentioned in the novel Jason X: Death Moon by Black Flame. Here, Elias is described as being little more than a hillbilly, whose great-great-great-grandfather Jebediah Voorhees was a warlock who lived in Salem, Massachusetts and possessed the Necronomicon. In the year 1667 on Samhain, the townsfolk living near Jebediah, believing him to be responsible for the disappearance of several local girls, burned his mansion to the ground with him inside, though after the fire no body was ever found. After Jebediah was supposedly killed the Necronomicon was passed down to Elias, who uncovered it one day while searching for kindling. After accidentally using the Necronomicon to summon a demon, which proceeded to possess the then unborn Jason, Elias attempted to use the book to become a warlock himself, with minimal success. The authenticity of this story remains in doubt, as the character who tells the story admits that \\"that's just one version of what happened\\". A version of Elias similar to the one presented in Jason vs. Leatherface, both in appearance and demeanor, appears in the two- issue comic miniseries Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale by WildStorm. Here, Elias is shown to be a worker in a mine and abusive towards Pamela. After a particularly brutal beating (and possible sexual assault) at Elias's hands, Pamela, driven by a voice she believes to be the unborn Jason, murders Elias with an axe blow to the head before entering a manic state and proceeding to hack his body to pieces. Afterwards, Pamela disposes of Elias's remains by dumping them in Crystal Lake, after blowing up the trailer the two of them lived in using gasoline. Eric Pope Eric Pope is a character in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, played by Dean Lorey. Pope is Phil's assistant. After he returns from getting snacks, Pope tells Phil, who had just been possessed by Jason, that they could say whatever they wanted about Jason. Pope began insulting Jason, and Phil promptly stabbed Pope with a surgical probe and mangling his face on a grater. * Eric is not named in the film or its credits, but his lab coat says his name. Enos Enos is a friendly gentleman encountered by teenager Annie Phillips in Friday the 13th. He agrees to drive her part of the way to Camp Crystal Lake and, during the drive, he informs Annie about the 1958 murders of camp counselors Barry and Claudette, as well as the mysterious fires and water contamination. Unfortunately, his warnings are dismissed by Annie. He is played the Rex Everhart. Ethan Ethan is a character in the two-issue comic miniseries Friday the 13th: Bad Land by WildStorm. A fur trapper living in the 19th century, Ethan, while hunting with fellow fur trappers Ben and Joseph, becomes stranded in a blizzard near Crystal Lake. While searching for shelter, the trio of fur trappers discover a hut belonging to a Native family and break in. While Ethan is content to simply wait out the storm and leave the occupants of the hut, a woman and her child, alone, Ben grows restless and, with help from Joseph, rapes the woman, threatening Ethan with violence if he interferes. After raping the woman, Joseph and Ben rest, while Ethan voices his disgust at what they have done. As Ethan talks, Joseph notices the woman reaching for something and, believing it to be a weapon, shoots her and her baby dead, only to learn to afterwards that what she was reaching for was a rattle. Enraged by what Joseph has done, Ethan begins to yell at him, only to be interrupted in his speech when the husband of the dead woman enters, having been out fishing. Seeing his family dead, the man lunges at Ethan, only to be shot in the face by Ben and sent running. Soon after the woman's husband is shot, Joseph begins acting erratic before fleeing from the hut, manically claiming that this is \\"a bad place\\". Believing Joseph could freeze to death outside; Ethan prepares to go after him, attempting to convince Ben to do so as well. When Ben refuses to go outside, not caring about what happens to Joseph; Ethan threatens him, but gives up on attempting to convince him to go searching and leaves, cursing Ben as he does so. While searching, Ethan, unaware that Ben has been killed by the Native from earlier, finds Joseph impaled on a tree, barely alive. With his last breaths, Joseph continues his rant to Ethan about how the surrounding land is cursed before dying. Convinced that Joseph is right, Ethan is about to run when he is attacked by the Native man with a tomahawk, getting an ear chopped off and being knocked to the ground. Attempting to fight back, Ethan tries to shoot the Native with his gun, but misses and hits a nearby tree, and resorts to clubbing the Native in the face with his gun. After doing this, Ethan tries to run away, only to be tripped by the Native. As the Native readies to kill him with a rock, Ethan mutters \\"I am so sorry...\\" before having his head crushed. Centuries later, in the year 2008, Diane Cavanaugh, while fleeing from Jason Voorhees, unknowingly passes the tree accidentally shot by Ethan, which still has the bullet lodged in it; she also trips on the very rock used to kill him. Eva Watanabe Eva Watanabe is a character in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, portrayed by Kelly Hu. Eva is a female student of Ms. Van Deusen, first seen with the New York-bound group aboard the SS Lazarus. She is shown to be friends with Tamara Mason, and tries her best to emulate Tamara in small ways. When the pair sneak off to do cocaine, they are chanced upon by fellow student, Rennie Wickham, who declines Tamara's offer of a 'hit'. After almost being caught moments later by chaperone Charles McCulloch, Tamara assumes that Rennie 'narced' on them, and, in revenge, intentionally knocks Rennie overboard. Disgusted at her friend's actions, Eva makes her excuses and leaves Tamara to her own devices. Later, after Jason's murderous activities endanger the ship, an announcement goes out for all students to gather on the bridge. Eva goes in search of Tamara, only to find her friend's mutilated body in her cabin. Horrified, Eva runs out of the room only to come face-to-face with Jason. After a brief chase, she finds herself on the ship's dance floor. Realizing that Jason has followed her, and already terrified, the strobe lighting and pounding music only serve to disorient her further as Jason appears to somehow be in several places at once. Suddenly, he appears right in front of her. He grabs her around the neck, hoists her into the air and throttles the life from her. == F == Freddy Krueger Frederick Charles \\"Freddy\\" Krueger is a horror icon and the main antagonist of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. Played by Robert Englund, he appears in several crossovers with the Friday the 13th series. In life, Freddy Krueger was a sadistic child murderer responsible for the deaths of some twenty children from the Elm Street area. Spared from prison due to a legal technicality, the enraged parents of the innocent children he butchered sought their own vengeance: they cornered him in the boiler room of the abandoned factory where Krueger had once worked, and where he would take his young victims, doused the place in gasoline, and set it ablaze, burning Krueger to death. In doing so, they unwittingly created a new reign of terror which their own children would be forced to suffer. Despite his fiery death, Krueger was somehow able to use the fear he induced to allow him to invade the dreams of his killers' children. In a nightmare world which he could seemingly manipulate at will, he used his supernatural powers to slaughter his teenage victims as they slept. His signature weapon, a home-made killing glove with four razor-sharp blades extending from each finger, made a cameo at the climax of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, and Freddy himself appeared fully in Freddy vs. Jason. In that film, Freddy has grown weak, unable to invade the dreams of potential victims as the people of Springwood, his home town, have managed to suppress their fear of him. Freddy, by impersonating Pamela Voorhees, manipulates Jason (Ken Kirzinger) into going to Springwood, knowing that Jason's brutal murders will be attributed to him, causing panic and fear. It does not take Jason long to accomplish Freddy's goals, but when he refuses to stop killing, a ferocious battle ensues between the two iconic mass murderers, spanning both the dream-world and the campgrounds of Crystal Lake. The ultimate victor is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs. References to Freddy and his battle with Jason are occasionally made in novels, such as Jason X: Death Moon, Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath and Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs. Freddy and Jason reunited in the comic book miniseries Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, which reveals that since his death in Freddy vs. Jason, Freddy has been trapped in Jason's mind for five years. After searching the bowels of Jason's mind, Freddy discovers the existence of the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and has Jason seek it out, having Pamela Voorhees tell him in dream that the book can be used to turn him into \\"a real boy\\". Despite the interference of Ash Williams and several local teenagers, Jason does gain the Necronomicon and brings it Freddy's severed head, which is in his shack. Reading the magic words in the Necronomcon, Freddy resurrects himself, gains reality warping powers and also increases Jason's intelligence as a reward for his aid. Despite his newfound abilities, Freddy is defeated when Jason turns on him and Ash, having taken the Necronomicon from Freddy, uses it send him to the Deadites' dimension. The comic miniseries ends with it being stated that the Necronomicon, having foreseen that Freddy would want to harness its powers, had manipulated events so that Ash came to Crystal Lake, with the book realizing that Freddy having access to all its secrets would end disastrously.

Jason Voorhees Jason Voorhees is the main antagonist in the Friday the 13th series. He first appeared in Friday the 13th (1980) as Mrs. Voorhees's son, portrayed by Ari Lehman. Created in combination by Victor Miller, Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham and Tom Savini, he was never intended to carry the series as the main villain. Jason Voorhees has also been represented in numerous novels, comic books, and a cross-over film with another horror legend, Freddy Krueger. The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by stalking and killing the characters, or acting as a psychological threat to the lead character, as is the case in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. Since Lehman's portrayal, the character has been represented by numerous actors and stuntmen, sometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal. In the fifth film, Jason is knocked off the edge of a barn loft and lands on a tractor harrow below, which impales him through the chest. The end of the film reveals that a character shown earlier as a paramedic, Roy, was using the hockey mask and boiler suit to imitate Jason in order to carry out his revenge-driven killing spree. This mask differs from those seen in the previous films, featuring two blue markings instead of three red markings. Kane Hodder is the most well known of the stuntmen to have portrayed Jason Voorhees, having played the character in four consecutive films. The character's physical appearance has gone through many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character's design, including makeup artist Stan Winston. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis for many of the later incarnations. The trademark hockey mask did not appear until Friday the 13th Part III. Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, albeit one whose motivation for killing has been cited as driven by the immoral actions of his victims. Jason Voorhees has been featured in many humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television shows, and been the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in popular culture. Jeff Dunsberry Jeff Dunsberry is a character in Friday the 13th Part 2, played by Bill Randolph.

Not much of Bardox's past is revealed, though it is stated he was raised by a strict and possibly abusive father, who pressured him into becoming a scientist. In the novel, Bardox, after discovering Jason Voorhees has crash-landed on Planet #666, which G7 monitors, ventures there with his assistant Emery to find Jason's body and take samples of his tissue, which Bardox plans to use to create his own superior offshoot of humanity. When the samples he takes from Jason's comatose body prove useless, Bardox and Emery hijack a space shuttle and travel back to Planet #666 to get more samples, unintentionally awakening Jason. After Emery is killed by Jason, Bardox signals for help from the G7 (his shuttle having been damaged while landing on Planet #666) and is rescued by G7 crew member Felicity, who he abandons on Planet #666, stealing her shuttle, which unknown to Bardox, Jason stows away on after killing Felicity.

After every member of the G7 crew except himself, London and an engineer named Bill are killed by Jason, Bardox, still believing he can control Jason, uses a combination of powerful tranquilizers to subdue him, making Jason calm and subservient. The effects of the tranquilizers prove only temporary though, as they soon wear off and Jason, after disposing of Bill, turns on Bardox, ripping off his arm and impaling him with his machete. As Jason begins to crush Bardox's head, the professor, having seen the error of all the deeds he had performed in his attempts at creating a new species and trying to control Jason, manages to rouse the nearby, unconscious London awake by yelling at her to abandon him and save herself.

As Wilson speaks with her, Sally lies semi-conscious and begins to have flashbacks. Two weeks previously, Sally, along with several other people, who include Alisha, Nate, Jerry, Brian, Sasha, Rico and Ryan, is hired by Camp Crystal Lake's newest owner, Trevor Gaines, to renovate the camp for its reopening as both a summer camp and a tourist attraction. The workers are to live in the camp for two weeks, working under the supervision of Mike Burns, a local who takes an instant attraction to Sally.

It is in this position that the real Jason finds her moments later and, instead of killing her, takes her away to a cabin, along with Brian's body. Waking up in the cabin, Sally runs from it in terror after finding Brian's and Sasha's corpses in it. Outside, Sally finds both Ryan and Trevor's bodies on the ground and sees Alisha and Rico running into the woods away from Jason, who approaches her. Handing Sally his machete, Jason gestures in the direction Rico and Alisha have fled, implicating he wants her to chase and kill the two. Hesitating for a moment, Sally attacks Jason with his machete and runs into the woods, as he goes after and kills Rico and Alisha. At this point, the flashbacks stop and Sheriff Wilson voices his opinion to the still semi- catatonic Sally that he believes she had murdered of her friends and bosses at the camp, not some non-existent zombie or death curse. As Wilson rants about how she will not escape justice, Sally is roused to full consciousness when a blood covered Jason bursts into the room, having just slaughtered his way through the hospital staff. Grabbing Wilson's keys as he fights with and is subsequently dismembered by Jason, Sally rushes outside and reaches Wilson's car.

Upon discovering that, as a Voorhees, she is destined to become a killer just like her great-uncle, Stephanie dons a similar hockey mask and, during the final showdown, impales Jason with a machete, which weakens him enough for Tommy Jarvis to finish him off.

Steven Freeman Steven Freeman first appears in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday and is played by John D. LeMay. Adam Marcus, director of the film, had originally intended for the character to be Tommy Jarvis, but New Line Cinema at that time lacked the legal rights to Tommy's character after buying the franchise from Paramount Pictures and the creative team had to write a new character and name for the film instead. Steven is Jessica Kimble's ex- boyfriend and the father of her baby Stephanie, with whom he has no contact. When Jessica's mother Diana is murdered by Jason Voorhees, Steven is blamed. In jail, he learns from bounty hunter Creighton Duke that Jason is attempting to be reborn through another Voorhees, and that Jessica and Stephanie are his only surviving blood relatives. Steven escapes from jail and tries to warn Jessica of the danger she and their daughter are in, but she does not believe his story. When Jason attacks Jessica in the body of her current boyfriend Robert Campbell, Steven guns him down and saves her. Steven and Jessica eventually travel to the Voorhees house to retrieve their baby from Duke, who reveals that Jessica is the only one capable of killing Jason permanently. When Jason is finally reborn through Diana's corpse, he and Steven engage in a fist fight until Jessica uses a mystical dagger to send Jason to Hell. Steven is almost dragged into Hell as well, but Jessica rescues him and the couple reconcile, walking off into the sunrise with their baby. Steven reappears in the comic miniseries Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors. His wife Jessica is now deceased, and the now-teenage Stephanie is having nightmares about her great-uncle Jason Voorhees. Having spent thousands of dollars getting psychiatric help for his daughter, Steven (spelled Stephen in the comic) eventually takes her to Doctor Maggie Burroughs, who is forming a group of people who have survived Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. However, Steven becomes frustrated when Maggie reveals her plan to combine their strengths to stop the killers permanently. During his rant, Jason Voorhees bursts into the house and crushes his head as Stephanie looks on in horror. The book Making Friday the 13th: The Legend of Camp Blood describes Steven as \\"a deadbeat who refuses to grow up and take responsibility for his actions, but who, nonetheless, eventually summons the courage to fight Jason\\".Grove, David, pg.200 Horror website Slasherama labels him \\"plucky, if rather geeky\\" and \\"one of the more quirky Friday heroes\\". The role was initially offered to Blair Underwood but he refused it for \\"personal reasons\\"; Making Friday the 13th asks whether having a \\"strong African-American presence\\" may have been beneficial for the series, but concludes that it is a moot point since Jason is \\"an equal opportunity killing machine\\". The part of Steven eventually went to John D. LeMay, who had previously appeared as lead character Ryan Dallion in Friday the 13th: The Series. LeMay was hesitant about returning to the Friday franchise, having left the television series to avoid being typecast. He states \\"It's hard to say, looking back, if it was a good move or a bad move, career-wise\\"; he ultimately accepted the role because \\"it was a lead role and I liked the character and, with New Line involved, it seemed like the series was going in a whole other direction.\\" However, he also admits \\"I was broke at the time so it was a beautiful lifesaver. I needed it to pay the rent!\\" Nevertheless, he says \\"I had a blast making Jason Goes to Hell. You had to have a sense of humour while fighting Jason at three in the morning, trying to find ways to hit him with a shovel and stuff like that [laughs]. As if that would do any good!\\". Summer Stone Summer Stone is a character in the novel Friday the 13th: Road Trip. A cheerleader for the Carville High Hornets football team, Summer, while traveling via van back to Carville from a football game alongside several football players, fellow cheerleaders and the team coach and mascot, is involved in accident near Crystal Lake.

Fleeing from the campgrounds with her boyfriend Slick and the football team lineman Russ Johnson, Summer and Russ are found by Teddy and knocked unconscious, while Slick is swarmed upon and eaten by bats. Taken to a cave in Crystal Hill by Teddy, who plans to cut out her heart on a demonic altar located in the cave, Summer is saved by Russ, who had awoken and tracked Teddy down. Together, Summer and Russ kill Teddy, lighting him on fire and tearing Jason's mask, along with his face, off. With Teddy dead, Summer and Russ manage to travel back the main road and find help. Suzi Donaldson Suzannah Elizabeth \\"Suzi\\" Donaldson is a character in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan. While on her boyfriend Jim's boat, she learns of Jason and how he drowned in Camp Crystal Lake in 1957. After hearing the story she is terrified, and has sex with Jim.

She spurns Wayne and lets him out of her cabin before going to take a shower, when she emerges she discovers Jason has entered her cabin and tries to hide quietly in the bathroom. Jason punches through her bathroom door, grabs her by the hair and hurls her into her mirror. She collapses and sobs as Jason smashes her mirror, begging him to let her go. Instead, Jason grabs a large shard of the mirror and kills her with it. After an emergency is called on the ship, Eva goes to find Tamara and finds her body still in her cabin's bathroom. Teddy Bateman Teddy \\"Buzzy\\" Bateman is a character in the novel Friday the 13th: Road Trip. The bullied mascot of the Carville High Hornets football team, Buzzy was raised by his accountant father, after his mother died of lung cancer when he was a child. While traveling back to Carville after a football game with several football players, cheerleaders and the team coach, the van the group are traveling in is involved in an accident, crashing into a tree near Crystal Lake. While the coach goes to seek aid, Teddy is left alone with the van when his companions go off to explore the area. As Teddy tries to change a flat tire on the van, the vehicle starts itself and proceeds to ram itself into a tree, the inside of which, Teddy finds the hockey mask of Jason Voorhees. Putting on Jason's mask, Teddy is possessed by it and proceeds to track down and begin murdering several of the football players and cheerleaders, eventually finding and knocking out both Russ Johnson and Summer Stone. Taking the unconscious Summer to an altar in a cave in nearby Crystal Hill, Teddy prepares to cut her heart out with an X-Acto knife, before being attacked by an awakened Russ, who had followed him to the cave.

Ted Bowen Theodore \\"Ted\\" Bowen is a character in Friday the 13th Part 2, played by Stuart Charno. Ted is good friends with counselors-in-training Jeff Dunsberry and Sandra Dier, showing it after playing a prank on them in which he has their car towed a couple of blocks. He is also the second-in-charge of the team; a practical joker, he aids Paul in telling a story of Jason Voorhees by scaring the other counselors wielding a spear and a mask. His spear is later used by Jason ironically to kill Jeff and Sandra. When he leaves with Ginny, Paul and most of the others from the cabin, he drinks heavily but promises to have someone else drive back to the camp. Ted is one of the only main counselors in the entire series to not be killed by Jason as he is never seen again when Paul and Ginny leave him at the bar. Reports were rife that in the original script Ted returned to the camp only to be killed by Jason but this idea was dropped due to time constraints. Ted Cooper Theodore \\"Ted\\" Cooper is a character in The Final Chapter, played by Lawrence Monoson. Ted is a know-it-all who is always on his best friend Jimmy \\"Jimbo\\" for his sexual failures and inserting the information into an imaginary \\"computer\\" concludes that Jimbo is a \\"dead fuck\\".

First to Tina, then to Terri at a party he asks them if they \\"Want to give the \\"teddy bear\\" a kiss. After he is spurned by both girls, he turns to smoking pot and watching vintage stag films. After the reel is cut, he stands in front of the white screen looking for Jimmy and is suddenly stabbed in the back of the head through the screen. Terry McCarthy  Terry McCarthy is a character in Friday the 13th Part 2. Terry is one of the counselor trainees, bringing her pet dog Muffin to the camp. Muffin later goes missing (initially it appears that Muffin was killed by Jason, but it is later revealed Muffin had simply gotten lost in the woods) and Terri remains at the camp in case Muffin returns. While skinny dipping, Scott steals her clothes and runs off. However, Scott is caught with a snare that leaves him hanging in the air, and Terry takes her clothes back before going to get a knife to cut him down. When she returns, Scott has been killed by Jason, who then proceeds to kill Terry and place her corpse in his shrine to Pamela at his shed. Terry's corpse appears in a flashback in Friday the 13th Part III and appears in archive footage in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Terry's corpse later appears in Friday the 13th: Hate-Kill-Repeat, still in Jason's shack. Tina & Terri Moore Tina & Terri Moore are two twins in The Final Chapter, played by Camilla More and Carey More who live locally in Crystal Lake where they meet six teens who have rented a cabin for the weekend. They spend the day skinny dipping with their new friends and at a party that night, Terri decides to leave the more promiscuous Tina and return home alone. She is impaled through the back by Jason and killed before she can gather her bike and leave. After Tina and Jimmy have sex, Jimmy goes downstairs and is murdered. While waiting for him to return, Tina notices Terri's bicycle out in the rain before Jason suddenly bursts through the window and hurls her from the second floor. She falls onto the teens' parked car below and hits it with enough force to blow out all the windows in the vehicle and falls into the darkness. Her body is later discovered by Trish. Tillamook The Tillamook are an extinct group of Native American flatheads once indigenous to Crystal Lake who appear in the Friday the 13th comic books by WildStorm. The first mentioning of the Tillamook is in the sixth and final issue of WildStorm's Friday the 13th comic series, where they are the subject of an extended flashback sequence. The flashback reveals that in the 19th century the Tillamook were in the midst of being wiped out by a group of fur traders. The fur traders, knowing that the shaman of the Tillamook was responsible for giving his people the hope they needed to fight back, invade the tribe's main village to abduct him, killing anyone in their way. Before they can escape with the shaman, the fur traders are surrounded by Tillamook warriors. Trapped, the fur traders attempt to force the shaman to call his warriors off, but the shaman refuses, telling his warriors to attack. Before the warriors close in on him and his allies, the fur trader's leader slits the shaman's throat. The shaman, in his death throes, manages to crawl to the shore of Crystal Lake while his warriors and the fur traders wipe each other out, and proceeds to bleed out into the lake's water, his \\"seemingly neverending flow of blood adding another quarter mile to the circumference of Crystal Lake.\\" For years afterwards, the spirits of the Tillamook, bound to Crystal Lake and the surrounding woods, begin to search for \\"a vessel\\" to use to spread their hatred, killing many who enter Crystal Lake in their search, those they kill becoming trapped in the lake and woods as well. Eventually, the Tillamook find a worthy vessel in the form Jason Voorhees, who they imbue with superhuman abilities so that he may destroy anyone who enters the wilderness surrounding Crystal Lake. In Friday the 13th: Bad Land, a two-issue comic miniseries released by WildStorm with two stories in it, one taking place two-hundred and fifty years in the past and the other in the present, a Tillamook family consisting of a mother, father and infant son appear in the story set in the past. During a blizzard, the husband leaves to fish, leaving his wife and son at home in their hut. While in the midst of feeding her child, the woman is found by a trio of fur trappers, who break into her house seeking shelter from the blizzard. At first content to simply wait out the blizzard, two of the fur trappers grow restless and, despite their companion's pleas not to, rape the woman; afterwards, one of the rapists kills the woman and her child when he believes her to be reaching for a concealed weapon, in actuality, a rattle for her child. Directly after doing this, the fur trappers are found by the woman's husband who, seeing his wife and son dead, tries to attack them, only to be shot in the face. Injured, the man flees from his home and the fur trappers, who believe he will die. The man, seeking vengeance, attacks one of the fur trappers when he runs from the hut and into the nearby woods, panicking and rambling about how this is \\"a bad place\\". Impaling the fur trapper on a large tree branch and leaving him to die, the man returns to his hut and kills another fur trapper, the man whose idea it was to rape his wife, with a tomahawk before seeking out the remaining fur trapper, who is in search of his runaway associate. Getting into a fight with the fur trapper, the man manages to knock him to ground and, picking up a large rock, crushes his head with it, right after the fur trapper gives a whispered apology for everything his two companions have done. With the fur trappers dead, the Tillamook, procuring his wife and son's bodies, proceeds to throw them in Crystal Lake before drowning himself. Tina McCarthy Tina McCarthy is a character in Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning, played by Debi Sue Voorhees. Tina is a promiscuous teenager who is always with her boyfriend Eddie, often getting in trouble with the police and having to be returned to Pinehurst Halfway House. Tina and Eddie sneak into the woods. They have sex and after Eddie goes to freshen up Tina lays on the blanket, opening her eyes she screams as Roy Burns masquerading as Jason kills her by stabbing her with garden shears. Tina Shepard Tina Shepard is a character in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, played as an adult by Lar Park Lincoln and as a child by Jennifer Banko. Possessing telekinetic/psychokinetic powers, Tina accidentally killed her abusive father as a child when she destroyed the pier he was standing on, causing him to drown in Crystal Lake. As a teenager, Tina is being treated by psychiatrist Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser), who secretly plans to exploit her psychic powers for his own personal gain. Returning to Crystal Lake to deal with the trauma, Tina attempts to resurrect her father with her powers, but instead succeeds in releasing Jason from his watery prison. As Jason wanders the forest killing anybody in his way, Tina experiences psychic visions of the people he kills. When Jason murders Tina's mother (Susan Blu), her doctor, and friends, she is forced to use her powers to defend herself and fellow survivor Nick (Kevin Blair). Tina eventually summons a manifestation of her father to drag Jason back underwater. Tina is mentioned in the novel Friday the 13th: Hate-Kill-Repeat, which is set shortly after the events of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood; the book states that, due to the outlandish nature of her story and the lack of evidence supporting it, Tina and Nick were arrested by the authorities, who suspected they were the ones who murdered the people they claimed Jason had. The epilogue of the book mentions that due to the revelation that Jason actually does exist, Tina and Nick were both released from custody. In the Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors comic miniseries, Tina appears under the care of doctors Maggie Burroughs and Neil Gordon, one of the first recruited to their group of those who have survived Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. A New Blood was initially conceived as Freddy vs. Jason; when studios failed to agree over rights to the respective franchises, the concept became Jason vs. Carrie instead, with Tina created to fill in for Stephen King's telekinetic character Carrie White.Grove, David, pg.151-160 Screenwriter Daryl Haney believed giving the character telekinetic abilities would add a new twist to the commonly seen final girl in the films. Director John Carl Buechler sees similarities between Tina and Alice Johnson, the protagonist of A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. He says, \\"Both films are about heroines who take on special powers which they use to fight the monster. In The New Blood, Tina's able to fully harness her telekinetic powers by the end of the film and she uses the powers to defeat Jason which is what happened, more or less, in The Dream Master.\\" Buechler was disappointed that the film did not explore Tina's powers more, \\"I wanted to really get into the clairvoyant stuff and have Tina experience all of these surreal nightmares because I'd really done a lot of homework about the paranormal and the way that clairvoyants use their powers. The producers did not like the idea.\\" One of Beuchler's plans involved Tina seeing her mother holding Pamela Voorhees's head, which would have cried, \\"Help me, help me.\\" The idea was vetoed by Barbara Sachs for being too \\"out there\\". Composer Fred Mollin came up with theme music for Tina \\"because she was a psychic and I felt like she'd project a certain aura since there had never been character like her before in a Friday the 13th film. When developing the comic miniseries, The Nightmare Warriors, the creators felt that Neil Gordon from A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors would be a natural replacement for Dr. Crews as Tina's doctor. Actress Lar Park Lincoln was intrigued by the role of Tina and her telekinetic powers, saying, \\"It was a complex story and it would allow me to play something other than a drug addict or a prostitute. So I said sure.\\" Lincoln was already a Friday the 13th fan, and was proud to have seen every one of the films. She claimed, \\"I don't think anybody really set out to change the world with these movies. Nobody will ever be accused of trying to make a social statement or great art. What these films are is entertainment.\\" Serious about doing the movie justice, Lincoln took it upon herself to study with real life psychics. She explains, \\"I knew how important Tina's telekinetic powers were to the character so I went out and met with real psychics and learned about psychic visions and the way that psychics can relate their visions because it's one thing to have a vision and another to be able to explain it.\\" Lincoln admits she does not know how genuine the psychics she met were, but claims it was an interesting experience. Another area of Tina's characterization the actress took interest in was her guilt over her father's death; \\"It gets worse by the end of the story because so many people die, including her mother, and it's really her fault because she brought Jason back.\\" Tommy Jarvis Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Jarvis is one of the series' most frequently recurring characters, and is Jason's nemesis. He appeared in three films played by three different actors. Tommy (Corey Feldman) made his first appearance in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter as a young boy with an affinity for making his own masks and make-up effects. When Jason arrives at the Jarvis cabin, Tommy is forced to fight for his life along with his sister Trish. In order to trick Jason, Tommy shaves his head to make himself appear as Jason did when he was young. As Jason is distracted by his appearance, Jarvis attacks with a machete, leaving him apparently dead. While embracing Trish, Tommy notices Jason beginning to stir and proceeds to go into a maniacal state, brutally attacking Jason with his machete while screaming \\"Die! Die! Die!\\" and ignoring Trish's desperate protests for him to stop. The film ends with Tommy visiting Trish at a hospital an unspecified time later. While hugging her, he stares emotionlessly at the camera. Tommy (John Shepherd) returns in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning as a teenager/adult, now living in a halfway house, having spent the last five years in a mental institution. When Roy Burns begins committing murders in the style of Jason Voorhees, Tommy's sanity begins to slip away again and he starts suffering hallucinations and nightmares of Jason. Tommy is later forced to kill Burns in self-defense, and this seems to push him over the edge; the final scene of the film has a hockey-masked Tommy preparing to stab the halfway house's assistant director, Pam. Original Tommy actor Corey Feldman resumes the role for a cameo appearance in a dream sequence at the beginning of the film. In Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, a more stable Tommy (Thom Mathews) decides to confront his demons by cremating Jason's body. Digging up Jason's body, Tommy's memories of his encounter with Jason rise to the surface, and he ends up repeatedly impaling Jason's corpse with a piece of cemetery fence. Unfortunately, this attracts a bolt of lightning, which both resurrects Jason and grants him numerous superhuman abilities. Trying to make amends for his mistake, Tommy warns Sheriff Garris that Jason has returned to Crystal Lake (renamed \\"Forest Green\\"), but the sheriff assumes he has had another psychotic break and ignores him; the pile of bodies Jason racks up only convinces the sheriff that the killer is in fact Tommy. Tommy eventually teams up with Garris's daughter Megan, a counselor at Camp Forest Green, to defeat Jason himself. Researching occult books, he decides to return Jason to the lake where he originally drowned as a child. Tommy succeeds in chaining Jason to the bottom of the lake, but almost drowns in the process. After regaining consciousness thanks to Megan (who killed Jason by using boat propeller) swimming him ashore and performing CPR on him, Tommy grimly notes that it is finally over, and Jason is at last home. The novelization of Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives reveals that what happened between Tommy and Pam at the end of Friday the 13th: A New Beginning; the book explains that Pam had managed to return Tommy to his senses and, when Tommy was put back in a mental institution, she helped him recover. The novel Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs references Tommy, revealing he has written at least six books about Jason and Crystal Lake, with the title of one them being mentioned as My Life of Hell: One Man's Fight Against Jason Voorhees, which is described as a \\"whiny piece of garbage\\" by a character. In the mockumentary called \\"The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited\\" (included on the 2009 DVD extra) it is mentioned that Tommy was thought to be the killer in Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives by the local town folk. It also talks about Tommy's stay at the state mental hospital, and how due to overcrowding was sent to Pinehurst. Tommy faces Jason again in the comic miniseries Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: Nightmare Warriors. When Jason attacks Dr. Maggie Borrough's group for those who have survived Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, Tommy intervenes and reveals his intent to finish Jason off, ultimately decapitating him with the help of Jason's great-niece, Stephanie. After both Freddy and Jason are defeated, Tommy is appointed leader of the Nightmare Warriors by Ash Williams. It was Joseph Zito's original intention to have Tommy become the antagonist and \\"new Jason\\" in any subsequent Friday the 13th films created after the fourth. The ending of Friday the 13th: A New Beginning leads up to this, although due to the negative reaction to that film, the idea was dropped. The producers of the 2009 Friday the 13th reboot considered using the Tommy character, but decided not to because they wanted to create their own mythology. Mezco Toyz has released a statuette of both Tommy and Jason, depicting the scene of the two grappling with each other underwater from Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives. Trey Leblanc Trey Leblanc is a character in the novel Friday the 13th: Hell Lake. A student at Forest Green University, Trey and his friends, after several murders are committed by Jason Voorhees and a group of criminals who have escaped from Hell, are placed under suspicion by the authorities, who believe they committed the murders. After several more people are killed despite the security at Forest Green University being tightened and a curfew being in place, Trey leads an illegal walkout of students. After Trey and his fellow students encounter Jason and a group of criminals, they are arrested by the authorities and placed in the Cunningham County Prison. When Jason and the criminals attack the prison, Trey and several others manage to flee. Along with his girlfriend Shawna Black, Trey finds their friend Gretchen (who appears to be channeling the spirit of Pamela Voorhees) and together, the trio joins a group refugees who have been driven from their home by the invading criminals from Hell. While Trey is with the refugees, their camp is attacked by Jason, who kills several refugees and Shawna. Escaping Jason by hijacking an RV, Trey and Gretchen travel to Crystal Lake. Using Gretchen's connection with Jason, Trey has her summon him and, after Jason teleports to the lake and enters it, Trey kills him and himself by jumping into the water while holding several cables attached to the RV. Trish Jarvis Patricia \\"Trish\\" Jarvis is a character in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, played by Kimberly Beck. A local of the Crystal Lake area, she lives with her mother and younger brother, Tommy. Trish and Tommy meet a man named Rob Dier in the woods, who claims to be hunting bears but is actually searching for Jason Voorhees, the man who killed his sister, Sandra (a character in Friday the 13th Part 2). Trish and Rob discover that Jason has murdered a group of teenagers vacationing next to the Jarvis house. When Rob and her mother are killed, Trish is forced to protect herself and her brother from Jason, fighting him off with a machete while Tommy distracts him. She is last seen being visited in the hospital by Tommy after he kills Jason. Trish can be seen briefly in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning along with her mother in a photo belonging to Tommy. In the mockumentary called \\"The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited\\", (included in the extras of the 2009 DVDs) it is mentioned that Trish was the one who had Tommy institutionalized after he was having difficulty adjusting to life after Jason killed their mother.

Vera began to warm up to him after an encounter with members of a biker gang, led by Ali. Vera had told Shelly the reason she was not attracted to him was because of his behavior. After he leaves, she gets up and drops his wallet in Crystal Lake and goes to retrieve it. She then spots Jason, but thinks it's Shelly until when the killer shoots an arrow at her which lands in her eye.

While working at Camp Tomorrow, Violet notices that she and several of her co-workers all have similar backgrounds, as they are all orphans. When several of the others working at the camp go missing, Violet and Rich go looking for them, finding that they have been killed by Jason Voorhees. Chased by Jason back to Camp Tomorrow, Violet and Rich warn the others about Jason, and are attacked by Kevin with a shotgun while trying to flee the camp, after finding the only vehicle has been sabotaged. As two of their co-workers are chased into the woods by Kevin, Violet and Rich are captured by a group of soldiers working for Kevin, who is revealed to be actually named McClintock. Violet and Rich are subsequently taken to McClintock, whose soldiers have captured Jason with liquid nitrogen and who explains that they and the other camp workers were all a part of his plan to capture Jason; they would be the bait used to lure him out into the open, as they lacked families and no one would miss them if they disappeared.

While driving away from Crystal Lake in McClintock's car, Violet and Rich are ambushed by a group of soldiers, who cause Violet to crash. After pronouncing Rich dead, the soldiers take Violet to the Trent Organization's headquarters, planning to use her as bait to lure Jason to the facility, realizing he will be searching for her. Feigning needing to go the washroom, Violet manages to escape her guard, seducing and disarming him. Shortly afterwards, Violet, after encountering Jason on the base, barricades herself and the Trent Organization's board of directors in an office, while Jason begins killing security guards while trying to reach them.

They are among many LucasArts adventure alumni, including artists, designers, sound engineers and composers, that comprise the game's team. The LucasArts legacy is evident in Insecticide's detective missions, which are designed as miniature graphic adventures complete with inventory puzzles and dialog trees. Much of the writing and design for these segments of the game are credited to Josh Mandel, veteran of Sierra Entertainment who worked on the King's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry series among others. The PC version was to be released as two downloadable episodes with a retail version following soon afterward, but the second episode never materialized due to Gamecock being acquired by SouthPeak Games in 2008 and the latter deciding to cancel the inherited title. Part 1 had by this time been released by Gamecock through digital distribution channels like Steam, Gametap and Direct2Drive, with Part 2 in production. Southpeak itself published a retail version of the first episode as part of their \\"PC Classics\\" budget line in early 2010 without any explanation about the story's unfinished state. Ahern revealed in a 2012 interview that Part 2 was cancelled due to \\"a whole host of complicated financial, technical, and marketing issues,\\" and the fact the game did not sell well. By comparison to the heavily scaled down Nintendo DS port, the Windows version features full in-game voice acting and all of the full motion video cinematics, some of which had to be transformed into a captioned \\"slide show\\" format or removed altogether for the handheld counterpart. In order to complete the story for Windows gamers, Crackpot expressed a desire to upload the cinematics for Part 2 (as well as Part 1) on their official YouTube page, an effort that at length came to fruition. In 2012, Levine posted the entire Insecticide cinematics on his personal YouTube account. Both Ahern and Levine currently own the rights to Insecticide. Prior to the game's troubled release, Crackpot stated that they were interested in developing a sequel and even expanding the Insecticide franchise to another medium. An animated series was considered, with Levine and Ahern putting together a series bible and shopping it to various networks without success. In 2012, Mike Levine publicly solicited fans for feedback on the possibility of a follow-up to Insecticide, one potentially designed as a pure graphic adventure game in the traditional style, and speculated on the possibility of raising money for the project via Kickstarter. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:2008 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Peter McConnell Category:Windows games ","title":"Insecticide (video game)"},{"id":"12381026","text":"Betty Fabila Betty Fabila (born 28 May 1929) is a retired Mexican soprano opera singer and biologist.

A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights. Paul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy ‚Äì Weiss himself was a violinist ‚Äì but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916. After the end of the First World War, having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, (now Vienna University of Technology). He then shifted his focus to biology with a minor in physics. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Bovari and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under Hans Leo Przibram, then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity. After completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka. His studies of limb regeneration in newts showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \\"natural experiment\\" ‚Äì the quest for suggestive examples from nature ‚Äì and this became a favourite teaching device. In 1930 a prospective post at the University of Frankfurt was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with Ross Granville Harrison at Yale. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his Principles of Development the same year.P.A. Weiss, Principles of Development, Henry Holt and Company, 1939 From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the University of Chicago. In his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \\"retrain\\" reflexes. During World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new Rockefeller University in New York, where he remained for fifteen years. Paul Weiss was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. He died at White Plains, New York, on September 8, 1989, at the age of 91.Jane Overton, Paul Alfred Weiss, Biographical Memoirs, National Academy of Sciences. ==See also== *Organicism *Morphogenetic fields ==Bibliography== * 1973: The Science of Life.

He is best known for his participation in the Irish Confederate Wars on behalf of the Irish Confederate Catholics. ==Family== His sister, Helen Butler, married her second cousin, Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond. Later, he was to clash politically with his grand-nephew James, the 12th Earl. His first wife was Margaret, eldest daughter of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who was the most powerful Roman Catholic noble in the country at the time. He specially distinguished himself by his defence of the castles of Ballyragget and Cullihill. His estates were nevertheless confirmed to him on the death of his father in 1605, and he sat in the parliaments of 1613, 1615, and 1634. His younger brother was John Butler. ==Marriage and Children== By his first wife, Margaret, eldest daughter of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, he had three sons and six daughters, of whom * Edmund Butler, 4th Viscount Mountgarret * Margaret married another member of the Butler line, Sir Walter Butler, 1st Baronet Polestown. The Viscount was again twice married: to Thomasine (afterwards named Elizabeth), daughter of Sir William Andrews of Newport, and to Margaret, daughter of Richard Branthwaite, serjeant-at-law, and widow of Sir Thomas Spencer of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, but he no issue by either of these marriages. ==Rebellion== In 1641 he placed himself in opposition to his powerful Anglican cousin - James, Earl (later the Duke) of Ormonde. At the commencement of hostilities in the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he appeared inclined to espouse the Government side, and was appointed joint Governor of Kilkenny with the earl. Fearing, however, that the rights and liberties of his Catholic brethren would be still further interfered with, he wrote an explanatory letter to the Earl and took possession of Kilkenny in the name of the Confederates. He endeavoured to protect the lives and property of the Protestants, without relaxing his efforts for the side he had espoused. He then detached parties to secure other adjacent towns, which was done with such success that in the space of a week all the fortresses in the counties of Kilkenny, Waterford, and Tipperary were in their power.Webb: \\"A COMPENDIUM OF IRISH BIOGRAPHY\\" 1878 After this he was chosen general of the Catholic Confederation which the rebels had formed to coordinate their war effort; but the county of Cork having insisted on choosing a general of its own. Thus were lost the advantages of undivided and vigorous control of the Confederate armies. The Viscount's forces were thereby considerably weakened, and he was defeated by the Earl of Ormonde at the Battle of Kilrush, near Athy, on 10 April 1642. Returning to Kilkenny, he was chosen president of the Supreme Council (the Confederate Government) formed there in the following summer.Irishmen, Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished, Rev. James Wills, D.D. 6 vols. or 12 parts. Dublin, 1840-'7. In 1643 he was at the Battle of New Ross, fought by General Preston against the Marquis of Ormonde. He was also at the capture, with his son Edmund (Roe), of the Castle of Borris, in Queen's County (Laois) in 1643. He was with the Lords Netterville, Ikerrin, Upper Ossory, and Castlehaven at the siege of Ballinakill, which surrendered on 5 May.Lodge, John: The Peerage of Ireland or, A Genealogical History Of The Present Nobility Of That Kingdom, 1789, Vol IV, pg 65. ==Outlawry 1652 and restoration in 1662== Mountgarret was outlawed by Cromwell, and excepted from pardon for life or estate.

James Clark School of Engineering is the engineering college of the University of Maryland, College Park. The school consists of fourteen buildings on the College Park campus that cover over . The school is in close proximity to Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, as well as a number of technology-driven institutions. The Clark School hosts eight different departments including Aerospace engineering, Bioengineering, Chemical and Biomolecular engineering, Civil and Environmental engineering, Electrical and Computer engineering, Fire protection engineering, Materials Science and engineering, and Mechanical engineering. The Clark School also offers graduate programs where students can pursue Master of Science, Master of Engineering, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. The Clark School has over 4,000 undergraduate students, 2,000 graduate students, and nearly 200 faculty members. The school also hosts diversity initiatives such as a Women in Engineering Program as well as a Center for Minorities in Science and Engineering. ==History== The Clark School was founded in 1894 under the name The College of Engineering at what was then known as the Maryland Agricultural College. In 1949, the school was renamed the Glenn L. Martin College of Engineering and Aeronautical Sciences. The name was changed for a second time in 1955 to the Glenn L. Martin Institute of Technology. In 1994, the college took its current name, the A. James Clark School of Engineering. A. James Clark was a 1950 engineering graduate of the university who was chairman and chief executive officer of Clark Enterprises, Inc. Clark's financial gifts to the university were honored, in return, with the name of the Engineering School. Early History Civil engineering students of the Maryland Agricultural College, circa 1890s. Although no formal engineering program existed at the Maryland Agricultural College, early curriculum included courses in surveying, construction, mechanics, and electricity. During the early years of the University, much of the coursework centered around preparing students for a career in agriculture. A formal program in engineering was introduced in 1894 when the president of the University, Richard W. Silvester, requested that the secretary of the Navy detail Lieutenant John D. Ford of the U.S. Navy Engineering Corps to organize the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The first faculty member appointed to teach in the department was Harry Gwinner, and John Hanson Mitchell was the first student awarded a B.S. in mechanical engineering in 1898. The Department of Mechanical Engineering was housed in what is now Taliaferro Hall. In 1908, the college created the Department of Civil Engineering, followed closely by the creation of the Department of Electrical Engineering. In 1915, the three departments were organized into the Engineering Division. Dr. T.H. Taliaferro was appointed dean of the Engineering Division upon its creation. 1915-1944 In 1917, the University reorganized, creating the College of Engineering and Mechanic Arts. In 1921, the college changed its name to the College of Engineering and appointed Arthur N. Johnson as dean. In 1926, the college developed its first master's program in the electrical engineering department. The remaining departments established master's programs shortly thereafter. In 1936, the College of Engineering appointed S. Sidney Steinberg as dean. The first Ph.D. was granted in 1939 by the Department of Chemical Engineering. In 1932, Evelyn B. Harrison became the first woman to graduate from the College of Engineering. She graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering. When the United States joined World War II in 1941, the College of Engineering faced many changes. To aid the war effort, the College of Engineering instituted several specialized training programs. In 1943, an Army Specialized Training Program was created to provide students with language and advanced engineering skills. The Civil Aeronautics Pilot Training Program was also instituted, training students to be pilots for the Military Air Transport Service. The College of Engineering also shortened the duration of its academic programs in order to accelerate training for technical branches of the Army. Enrollment dropped significantly during World War II, but accelerated quickly following the war as students returned to the University of Maryland on the G.I. Bill. During the war, the College of Engineering moved from its original home in Taliaferro Hall to what is now H.J. Patterson Hall. 1944-1975 In 1944, aeronautical entrepreneur Glenn L. Martin, president of the Glenn L. Martin Company, donated funds to the College of Engineering for the purpose of constructing new engineering buildings. Martin's gift to the college resulted in the construction of four new engineering buildings, including the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel. Martin also donated funds designated for aeronautical research. Named for Martin's mother, the Minta Martin Fund for Aeronautical Research was created in 1954. To recognize Martin's gifts, the College of Engineering was renamed the Glenn L. Martin College of Engineering and Aeronautical Sciences in 1949. Also in 1949, the Department of Aerospace Engineering was established. The Department of Fire Protection Engineering was established in 1956. Following World War II, the College of Engineering developed into a strong research institution, with more emphasis placed on research by both students and faculty. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, each department established a Ph.D. program, further strengthening the college's growing reputation as a research institution. In 1956, Frederick T. Mavis was appointed dean of the College of Engineering. In 1965, Robert Beckman was appointed dean of the College of Engineering. The College of Engineering grew during the 1960s and 70s as the United States placed more emphasis on technology and development during the Cold War. Throughout the 1970s, the college devoted more attention to recruiting women and minority students to engineering, creating programs for local high school students and hiring staff members to mentor women and minority students. In 1970, the college instituted a Cooperative Engineering Education Program to help students incorporate employment and career development into their field of academic study. In 1975, the Instructional Television System (ITV) was created to provide graduate-level education to working engineers in the area through television. 1975-1995 In 1977, George Dieter was appointed dean. Student enrollment in the College of Engineering expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s in response to the Very Large Scale Integration revolution. In 1981, the college implemented regulations to restrict undergraduate admission to the College of Engineering based on test scores and academic standing. At the same time they also created the College Honors Program. Graduate programs in the College of Engineering experienced growth during this time period. With the growth of graduate programs came growth in research funding and opportunities. During the 1980s and 1990s, the College of Engineering developed several research institutes and secured research funding from a variety of scientific grants and foundations. In 1990, the College of Engineering became a member of the Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Engineering and Leadership. The main goals of this program were to integrate design into undergraduate engineering curriculum. This led to the development of a hands- on freshman design course in the College of Engineering. In the 1980s and 1990s, students of the College of Engineering became heavily involved in national design competitions. Some of the most prominent competitions during these years included Baja racing, solar car design, concrete canoe design and racing, and walking robot contests. In 1994, as the college celebrated its 100th anniversary, alumnus A. James Clark created the A. James Clark Centennial Endowment Fund to support undergraduate engineering education. In recognition of this gift, the Board of Regents renamed the college the A. James Clark School of Engineering. In 1994, William W. Destler was appointed dean of the Clark School. This same year the Clark School also established the Office of Advanced Engineering Education (OAEE). OAEE provides flexible engineering education options to working engineers so that they may earn a Master of Engineering or Graduate Certificate in Engineering. 1995-Present In 1997, the Department of Computer Engineering was established, and in 1999 it combined with the Department of Electrical Engineering to form the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 1999, Herbert Rabin was named Interim Dean of the Clark School. Also in 1999, the Department of Civil Engineering was renamed the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering to better reflect changes in the field. Nariman Farvardin was appointed dean of the Clark School in 2000. In 2002, the Department of Materials and Nuclear Engineering split, establishing the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Nuclear and Reliability Engineering programs were transferred to the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In 2004, the Department of Chemical Engineering changed its name to the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. In 2005, Robert E. Fischell donated to the Clark School with the intention of creating the Fischell Department of Bioengineering, which was officially established in 2006. In 2007, Herbert Rabin once again became the Interim Dean. In 2009, Darryll Pines was appointed Dean of the Clark School of Engineering. Under his guidance, the Clark School has continued to build a reputation in research, teaching, and student engagement. ==Facilities== AIM Lab Dedicated to the characterization of the structure and composition of a broad spectrum of hard and soft materials and biological systems with nanometer resolution.

The circumstances of their kidnapping and death remain controversial; the Armed Islamic Group (Groupe Islamique Arm√©, GIA) claimed responsibility for both, but in 2009, retired General Fran√ßois Buchwalter reported that the monks were killed by the Algerian army. ==Circumstances== At approximately 1:15 AM on 27 March 1996, about twenty armed members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) arrived at the monastery of Tibhirine and kidnapped seven monks. Two others, Father Jean-Pierre and Father Am√©d√©e, were in separate rooms and escaped the kidnappers' notice. After the kidnappers left, the remaining monks attempted to contact the police, but found that the telephone lines had been cut. As there was a curfew in force, they had to wait until morning to drive to the police station in M√©d√©a. On 18 April, the GIA's communiqu√© no. 43 announced that they would release the monks in exchange for Abdelhak Layada, a former GIA leader who had been arrested three years earlier. On 30 April, a tape with the voices of the kidnapped monks, recorded on 20 April, was delivered to the French Embassy in Algiers. On 23 May, the GIA's communiqu√© no. 44 reported that they had executed the monks on 21 May. The Algerian government announced that their heads had been discovered on May 31; the whereabouts of their bodies is unknown. The funeral Mass for the monks was celebrated in the Catholic Cathedral of Notre-Dame d'Afrique (Our Lady of Africa) in Algiers on Sunday, 2 June 1996. Their remains were buried in the cemetery of the monastery at Tibhirine two days later. The surviving two monks of Tibhirine left Algeria and traveled to a Trappist monastery near Midelt in Morocco.Notre Dame de l'Atlas The monks All of the murdered monks were French. They were: Dom Christian de Cherg√©, Brother Luc (born Paul Dochier), Father Christophe (Lebreton), Brother Michel (Fleury), Father Bruno (born Christian Lemarchand), Father C√©lestin (Ringeard), and Brother Paul (Favre-Miville). ==Accusations against Algerian army== In 2008, La Stampa reported that an anonymous high-ranking Western government official, based in Algeria at the time of the murders, had told them that the kidnapping was orchestrated by a DRS-infiltrated GIA group, but that the monks had been killed accidentally by an Algerian military helicopter which attacked the camp where they were being held captive. In July 2009, the retired French general Fran√ßois Buchwalter, who was military attach√© in Algeria at the time, testified to a judge that the monks had been accidentally killed by an Algerian government helicopter during an attack on a guerrilla position, then beheaded after their death to make it appear as though the GIA had killed them. The day after Buchwalter's statement, former GIA leader Abdelhak Layada ‚Äî who was in prison when the monks were killed ‚Äî responded by reiterating the claim that the GIA had beheaded the monks after a breakdown of negotiations with the French secret service. == Martyrs of Algeria == The 7 monks of the Our Lady of the Atlas, who were kidnapped and later beheaded, were beatified with 12 other martyrs of Algeria on December 8, 2018. The celebration occurred in Oran, Algeria. ==See also== * Of Gods and Men, a 2010 film based on these events ==ReferencesExternal links== * \\"Atlas Martyrs\\".

Die Arbeiterin was published by the Social Democrat Emma Ihrer in Velten for more than a year from 1890‚Äì91 with little success. In January 1892, with the magazine facing financial ruin, editorial direction was placed in the hands of Clara Zetkin (1857‚Äì1933) by Heinrich Dietz, the magazine's Social democrat- backing publisher. Zetkin renamed the paper Die Gleichheit when she took over. ==History== Zetkin edited Gleichheit until 1917. At the First International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart, 1907 it was reported that the magazine had a distribution of 70,000 copies. The editorial board of Die Gleichheit was elected as the central organ of the international movement of socialist women until the next international congress. By 1910 Die Gleichheit, the central socialist organ for women workers, had a circulation on 80,000. At the Second International Women's Conference in Copenhagen in 1910 Die Gleichheit was once again recognized as the official organ of the international women's socialist movement. From 1919 to 1922 the paper was edited by Clara Bohm-Schuch.

He was also a sports historian and author. He was considered by many to have been the godfather of sports talk radio.Hinckley, David, \\"Sports radio pioneer Art Rust dies at 82\\", New York Daily News, Thursday, January 14th 2010 == Career ==  Broadcaster  After he graduated from Long Island University, he was hired by WWRL Radio in Woodside, Queens in September 1954 . He began in their merchandising department, but within two months he got on the air. At WWRL, Rust hosted the Schaefer Circle of Sports for 14 years, becoming one of the first African American sportcasters. At WWRL, Rust interviewed sports icons such as Hank Aaron and Sonny Liston. A music lover, Rust mixed up shows with interviews with artists like James Brown and Miles Davis, who was also a close friend. In 1967, Rust landed a position as a sports announcer for NBC-TV. After some six years with NBC, Rust decided to return to the radio. He went on to work as sports director for WMCA, and as a sportscaster and commentator for WINS radio. In 1981, he signed on with WABC for his \\"Sportstalk\\" show. He interviewed everyone from Joe DiMaggio to Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson and one of his idols, sportscaster Red Barber.  Writer  Rust had been a columnist for The New York Amsterdam News and the Daily News; he was also an author. His first book, the controversially titled Get that Nigger off the Field, published in 1976, explores the rocky beginnings of blacks in baseball. Other books include Joe Louis, My Life (1978), a collaboration with the Brown Bomber; Recollections of a Baseball Junkie (1985) in which Rust waxes poetically about his life; Art Rust's Illustrated History of the Black Athlete which celebrates greats such as Jessie Owens and Althea Gibson; and Darryl with Darryl Strawberry (1992).Goldstein, Richard, \\"Art Rust Jr., Pioneer in Sports Talk Radio, Dies at 82\\", The New York Times, January 13, 2010 He collaborated with his wife Edna on several of these books prior to her death in 1986.

The Union demanded equal political, particularly voting, rights to women. The Union had main centers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg and a number of local chapters in various cities of the Empire. At its peak in 1906, the Union had 8,000 members and 78 branches in 65 cities. The Union published monthly magazine Women's Union (–°–æ—é–∑ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω) in 1907‚Äì09. The Union disintegrated soon after the end of the revolution. Despite lack of tangible feminist achievements, the Union succeeded in raising awareness and political consciousness of many women in the Russian Empire. ==Formation and goals== The Union was formed by 30 liberal women a month after the Bloody Sunday (22 January 1905). The founding members included Zinaida Mirovich, Anna Kalmanovich, Liubov Gurevich, and Maria Chekhova. They felt that liberal organizations, like the Union of Liberation, were indifferent about women's rights. On 10 April, the Union called the first meeting for women in Moscow. About 1,000 attendees laid the groundwork for the first congress of the Union on 7‚Äì10 May. The congress, chaired by Anna Miliukova (wife of Pavel Milyukov), was attended by some 300 official delegates, including 70 delegates sent from 26 local chapters, who adopted a far-reaching program that underscored that liberation of women was inseparable from liberation of the society as a whole. The Union did not focus solely on women's issues and joined the wider liberal movement, consciously using the term \\"women's liberation\\" and not \\"feminist\\". The program demanded a constituent assembly elected by equal, direct, secret, and universal voting (without regard to sex, nationality or religion), national autonomy for ethnic minorities, and abolition of the death penalty in addition to more women- oriented demands of equality before law, equal rights in any land reform, law protection and welfare guarantees for women workers, and co-education at every level. The issue of national autonomy was divisive: the Russian women were surprised by the importance of the autonomy for Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, Jewish, and Belarusian women. The next congress was held on 8‚Äì12 October 1905. The third congress was held on 21‚Äì24 May 1906. ==Activities== The Union petitioned City Dumas and zemstva to grant women voting rights. In May 1905, along with thirteen other unions, the Union became a founding member of the Union of Unions, an umbrella organization for trade and professional unions. It also joined the International Woman Suffrage Alliance and sent delegates to its congresses in Copenhagen (August 1906) and Amsterdam (June 1908). In various cities women organized meetings, wrote petitions, collected signatures, and presented them to various political institutions, including the State Duma. They lobbied various organizations to add women's suffrage to their agenda, but reception among male organizations was lukewarm as many supported women's rights in principle, but argued that in practice it was an inopportune moment to raise the issue. At the request of some sympathetic Duma delegates, the Union prepared specific recommendation on amending the legal code to incorporate women's rights, but the Duma was dissolved before further action could be taken. During the height of the revolution, including the Moscow Uprising of 1905, members of the Union actively supported the revolutionaries by fundraising, organizing first aid stations and canteens, marching in demonstrations and maintaining the barricades. Women also worked with other organizations, such as Red Cross, Union of Unions, and Unemployment Commission. The Union's budget for 1905‚Äì06 was 3,800 rubles, of which 1,000 rubles designated to support other organizations and strikers. In Fall 1906, the Saint Petersburg branch organized an agitation lecture tour; most popular lectures attracted audiences of up to 800. In 1907, the Union distributed 10,000 pamphlets and books in the countryside. Since not all women were literate, joint readings were organized. ==Disintegration== While the Union's program reflected attempts to include issues relevant to both working class (welfare guarantees) and peasant women (equality in land reform), it had difficulty in attracting their participation and retaining their loyalty. The class solidarity was more important than gender unity. Internal disagreements and introduction of reactionary repressions by the Tsarist authorities led to quick dwindling of the Union. The Union was never officially registered as an organization. The journal Women's Union was discontinued in December 1909. It its mission, the Union was succeeded by the League for Women‚Äôs Equality. ==References== Category:Feminist organizations in Russia Category:1905 Russian Revolution Category:Organizations based in the Russian Empire Category:Organizations established in 1905 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1909 Category:1905 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:1909 disestablishments in the Russian Empire Category:Voter rights and suffrage organizations ","title":"Union for Women's Equality"},{"id":"12381321","text":"The alpine stream salamander (Batrachuperus tibetanus) is a species of salamander in the family Hynobiidae endemic to central China.

The trunk is stocky, and the limbs are relatively short. There are 11‚Äì13 costal grooves. The tail is thick at the base and laterally compressed towards the tip. Dorsal colouration is reddish brown to dark brown. There are small pale spots on the flanks and the limbs. During the breeding season, the tail becomes very high and compressed in males. Their s also swell, making the head to appear somewhat triangular. ==Reproduction== Reproduction starts in November‚ÄìDecember, at the time of the snowfall. Females lay paired egg sacs containing 26 to 109 in total. The egg sacs are laid under leaves at the bottom of breeding ponds. Larval development is slow in winter but accelerates after the snow melt. Metamorphosis occurs typically in June‚ÄìJuly, but some individuals may metamorphose later and even overwinter as larvae. ==Habitat and conservation== Abe's salamander occurs in secondary broad-leaved evergreen and deciduous forests and in bamboo forests. Breeding takes place in pools, ditches, and springs in shaded parts of forests.

It is blackish-brown to reddish-brown dorsally and somewhat lighter brown or grey-brown ventrally. ==Distribution and habitat== A study of H. arisanensis in the Alishan Range found the adults had home ranges of up to 500 m2 (mean 65 m2). Adult and juvenile survival was high, 0.996 and 0.977, respectively. With the estimated population growth ratio of 1.077, the population appeared stable or slightly increasing. It is found in coniferous and broadleaf woodland near streams where it occurs at altitudes greater than and is considered rare. It probably breeds in the streams with the larvae developing in the water. ==Status== In its Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN lists Hynobius arisanensis as being \\"vulnerable\\". This is because it is restricted to the Alishan, Yushan and Pei Ta Wu Shan mountain ranges in Taiwan where its range is fragmented. Its total area of occupancy is less than and its habitat is being degraded, particularly from the infrastructure development being undertaken in an attempt to increase tourism in the region.

Named after Oita Prefecture, its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and irrigated land in western Japan. It is threatened by habitat loss, due to the increasing construction of homes within its habitat. The Oita Salamander is considered to be endangered by the (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species with a declining population. Across Japan the Oita salamander genetically differs based on their location. The DNA diversity was most apparent when comparing both the Northern and Southern species across Japan. == Description == The Oita Salamander tends to be greenish-grey in color, some even being brown. On their dorsal, they typically have black dots with a lot of the salamanders lacking dots. The ones with dots will fade as they enter adulthood. Unlike the dorsal surface, the ventricle surface tends to be a blueish-grey that becomes lighter at the salamanders throat. Young Oita salamanders have a blue iridescent highlight to them, until they eventually fade with adulthood. In wetter environments the blue iridescent color is more pronounced than those in dryer/less humid locations. This salamander unlike most animals have only 11 coastal grooves, compared to the normal 12. Those with 11 grooves are documented. Their (SVL) snout to vent length 6‚Äì8 cm with a maximum of 10‚Äì16 cm, there bodies tend to be around this range also. == Habitat == Like prefaced before, its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and irrigated land in western Japan. This species can be found exclusively in the Japanese Island groups of Shikoku and Kyushu. The live in secondary forests and bamboo woods. Outside of the mating season they can be found under stones and leaves. == Feeding == The Oita salamander enjoys eating insects, i.e., earthworms, miniature mealworms, fly maggots, spiders, mosquito larvae, woodlice, millipedes, etc. However this salamander does not eat slugs, compared to the other types of salamanders. They eat quite a lot during the winter, and don't use much energy. They end up looking chubbier. == Breeding == There is no distinct appearance separating male and female Oita salamanders except for during the mating season (December - May). Male Oita salamanders heads grow much broader, their throats become lighter in color, and their tail fin grows taller. The female salamanders tails become yellow, and their weight increases due to ovulation and there egg sacs absorbing water. Very little happens to their appearance in the mating season. During this period males will be the first to enter the water, a trend shown with many salamanders, they will stay in the water until either April or May (this is called the aquatic phase). The preferable breeding habitat is strewn about with twigs and branches. The salamanders tend to be more attracted to thicker branches since it can hold more of them. Males will go out and find grounds for breeding, females who approach those breeding grounds are followed by males. When the females start to swim, males will bite and poke at each other.https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/hsj1972/14/4/14_4_184/_pdf The females need to deliver their eggs and will gesture when they need to deliver them. A notable gesture could be restlessness, which will make males go closer to her. In every egg sac there is 80 to 140 eggs. (in slow moving water). Females lay in pairs, when the egg pair is delivered a male typically the first male to engage the female will get onto the sac, and to compete, more males will hope onto the sac, trying to fertilize it, inevitably creating a mating ball. This behavior is usually called the scramble competition. The Breeding can be broken down into 4 phases.  Male Breeding Phases   Phase 1  The wandering phase, the males walk at the bottom of the river/pond/tank (if in captivity) searching for branches that can hold the weight of at least several Oita Salamanders.  Phase 2  The climbing phase, after they have found an adequate branch, the males board (climb) them. Sometimes the salamander -while grasping the twig- will stiffen their body which is associated with sexual excitement. This can be seen even after the salamander has deposited their sperm.  Phase 3  The attraction/attention phase, tail fanning/swinging begins and their throats enlarge. This phase attracts females, which in turn attracts males. Tail swinging isn't found in any other species besides the Oita salamanders.  Phase 4  The marking phase, the male marks their territory but rubbing their cloaca in the area they are tail fanning. ==ReferencesSources== * *Sugawara, Hirotaka, et al. ‚ÄúLocal Genetic Differentiation and Diversity of the Oita Salamander ( Hynobius Dunni) in Kyushu Revealed by Mitochondrial and Microsatellite DNA Analyses.‚Äù Current Herpetology, vol. 34, no. 1, Feb. 2015, pp. 1‚Äì11.

He started his military career in 1830 as Junker of the 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade and he was eventually promoted to major. In 1856 he was appointed to the cadets school in Potsdam, and in 1860 he became battalion commander. In the Austro- Prussian War of 1866, Pape was a Colonel commanding the 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade, which he had led since 1863. On December 31, 1866, he was promoted to Colonel-General. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, he was given the 1st Guards Infantry Division which took St.-Privat-la-Montagne on August 18, then successfully fought in the Battle of Sedan, leading to the siege of Paris and the final victory. On March 22, 1872, he was awarded the prized Oakleaves to the Prussian Pour le Merite Order for his military services most especially for action at the battles at St. Privat on August 18, 1870, and at Sedan on September 1, 1870. His initial Pour le Merite Order award was on September 17, 1866.[1] In 1880 Pape was promoted to infantry general of the V. Armeekorps, in 1881 of the III. Armeekorps, and finally in 1884 he was appointed to the lead of the Guards Corps. In September 1888, Pape was relieved of this position and promoted to the special rank of Generalfeldmarschall. He held the position of Governor of Berlin and was placed in charge of the military within the Province of Brandenburg. By 1885 he was a member of the Landesverteidigungskommission. Pape retired in January 1895. He died shortly thereafter on May 7 in his hometown of Berlin. Pape was highly respected to that by Emperor William, who called him \\"The role model of a traditional Prussian military leader\\". The street \\"General-Pape-Stra√üe\\" in Tempelhof was named in honor of Pape by a decree of the emperor. A train station of the Berlin S-Bahn was named \\"Station Papestra√üe\\" until May 27, 2006, when it was renamed Berlin S√ºdkreuz to match with similar names like Ostkreuz and Westkreuz. == References == * Kurt von Priesdorff: Soldatisches F√ºhrertum.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests and rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Physical characteristics== As its name suggests, the external appearance is that of semitransparent blackish brown ground color, blotched with bright amber. Its ventral surface is lighter and without blotches. The amber salamander has a snout-to-vent length of 76‚Äì85 mm and a total length of 137‚Äì155 mm. However, individuals have been reported to have been nearly 200 mm in length. The head appears to be oval when viewed from above and the eyes are prominent, and a gular fold is present. It has a robust and cylindrical body with 13 to 14 costal grooves. It is similar to Hynobius kimurae in color, but has only four toes, a longer series of vomerine teeth, and a longer body. ==Taxonomy== According to a recent study led by Matsui, Nishikawa and Tominaga, Hynobius stejnegeri and Hynobius yatsui are identical. The name H. yatsui is therefore relegated to a subjective junior synonym of H. stejnegeri. According to the same study, a population of Hynobius stejnegeri from Kyushu should be treated as a new species Hynobius ikioi. ==Habitat and ecology== This species of salamander is found only in Kyushu, Japan, and is distributed among the mountainous areas of the prefectures of Kumamoto, Miyazaki, and Northern Kagoshima. The various regional populations of the amber salamanders are separated by a number of geographic barriers, including the Gokase River and the Aso Volcano, the Kirishima Volcano, and the Yatsushiro Sea. It can be found in both terrestrial (land) and freshwater ecosystems. Its land habitat is located in temperate forests which consist of mountainous areas of broad- leaved, evergreen forests, as well as mixed forests. The freshwater habitat is located in wetlands of permanent rivers, streams, and creeks, including waterfalls. Habitats have been discovered in and around mountainous streams at altitudes ranging from 500‚Äì1500 m. They return to upstream areas to breed, and this is also where the larvae develop. Their diets are made up of insects, spiders, worms, aquatic insect larvae, and crustaceans, and they have been known to resort to cannibalism. The unique possible cryptic coloration is hypothesized to act as a camouflage among fallen leaves. If the color pattern is an effective deterrent from predators, then this characteristic is likely due to strong selection. A genetic variance of 4% was found to be due to phenological circumstances in the populations of amber salamander between two regions separated by geographic isolation. ==Behavior== The egg sacs produced by the males are quite long, ranging from 17 to 30 cm and differ from other species of the same genus, Hynobius boulengeri, by not having the prominent whip-like formation on the free end. Each clutch ranges from 21‚Äì57 eggs, and the female remains close to her clutch until the eggs have hatched. The hatched larvae are a yellowish color and the fingers and toes sport black claws. These larvae undergo a metamorphosis while living in the stream, and emerge in September and October of the same year they are laid, but many wintering larvae remain in the stream until spring or summer of the following year when they emerge. ==Threats== The amber salamander is harmed by hunting and trapping, logging, and wood harvesting. Major threats also include the construction of roads, deforestation, erosion, and pollution. The amber salamander is also used for medicine and food. H. stejnegeri is also used in the medical field of comparative hepatology. In an experiment, when the mother was removed, the eggs vanished, presumably eaten by freshwater crabs or some other predator. This suggests survival of the larvae is contingent on the mother's protection. ==Conservation== The extent of occurrence is less than 20,000 km2, the species are fragmented in distribution, regionally only in Japan, with a continuing decline in the extent and quality of their habitat. The amber salamander was considered near threatened by the Environment Agency of Japan in 2000. It was determined least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2019. Now, the amber salamander is on the Earth's Endangered Creatures List. It is designated a natural monument by Kumamoto Prefecture. There is a need to ensure the capture of this species from the wild is managed in a sustainable way. ==References== Category:Hynobius Category:Amphibians of Japan Category:Endemic fauna of Japan Category:Amphibians described in 1923 Category:Taxa named by Emmett Reid Dunn Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Amber-colored salamander"},{"id":"12381465","text":"The Hokuriku salamander (Hynobius takedai) is a species of salamander in the family Hynobiidae, endemic to Japan.

The area belongs to the Hengduan Mountains that form the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Puxiong salamander is a relatively small salamander with a slender body form. ==History of discovery and taxonomic position== The Puxiong salamander was first described in 2000 as Protohynobius puxiongensis, based on a single specimen collected in 1965. Because of a characteristic interpreted as primitive (internasal bone), a new monotypic genus, Protohynobius, in its own subfamily, Protohynobiinae, was established. However, field effort in 2007‚Äì2009 revealed new animals that allowed a more detailed analysis. These suggested the holotype from 1965 was slightly unusual, as later specimens did not have an internasal bone while being in other respects very similar to the holotype. Furthermore, the Puxiong salamander is morphologically similar to Pseudohynobius species, and genetic analyses place it as a sister group of Pseudohynobius. Because the genetic distance to Pseudohynobius was small, it was concluded that Puxiong salamander should be placed in genus Pseudohynobius. This position is adopted in the \\"Amphibian Species of the World\\". ==Habitat== The holotype was collected from an abandoned potato cellar, but later field work revealed a more typical habitat for a hynobiid, i.e., high-mountain terrestrial (altitude 2,900 m), with breeding in cold-water streams. ==References== Category:Pseudohynobius Category:Amphibians of China Category:Endemic fauna of Sichuan Category:Amphibians described in 2000 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Puxiong salamander"},{"id":"12381518","text":"The yellow-spotted salamander (Pseudohynobius flavomaculatus) is a species of salamander in the family Hynobiidae, endemic to China, where it is known from Nanchuan in Chongqing (formerly Sichuan), Suiyang in Guizhou, Lichuan in Hubei, and Sangzhi in Hunan Province.

It appears to be mute. The egg clutches are attached to the walls or ceiling of the cavity, and hatch into larvae after about 11 to 14 days. The duration of the larval period is relatively long, at least three months. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitat is primary and secondary lowland wet evergreen forest and moist semi-deciduous forest. It uses very large tree holes for breeding, a factor that may restrict its distribution. It is an uncommon species threatened by deforestation caused by agricultural development, timber extraction and human settlement. It occurs in a number of protected areas, including the Ta√Ø National Park and the Ankasa Conservation Area. ==References== sonjae Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 2003 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Acanthixalus sonjae"},{"id":"12381566","text":"Acanthixalus, commonly known as the African wart frogs, is a small genus of frogs in the family Hyperoliidae.

The only significant morphological difference between then is the wider relative head width in males of A. sonjae compared to A. spinosus. Average adult size is about in snout‚Äìvent length, with largest individuals nearly SVL. Males and females are similar in size, but males have a pair of elongate gular glands, larger discs on toes and fingers, and a large number of tarsal spines. ==Ecology and behaviour== Acanthixalus live in water-filled cavities of living trees and on tree trunks, from near the ground level to about 5 m above the ground. Acanthixalus have been found in a variety of wooded habitats: secondary and primary forests, both dry and swampy, as well as from a cacao plantation; the main habitat requirement is the presence of large, water-filled cavities. The tadpoles develop in the cavities. The development time is relatively long, three months or more. While A. spinosus tadpoles are detritivores, those of A. sonjae seem to thrive better with arthropod diet; cannibalism has not been observed. Both species appear to be mute. It has been speculated that they use olfactory orientation for finding mates instead. ==References== Category:Hyperoliidae Category:Amphibians of Sub-Saharan Africa Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxa named by Raymond Laurent Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Acanthixalus"},{"id":"12381571","text":"Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service (QARNNS) is the nursing branch of the British Royal Navy. The Service unit works alongside the Royal Navy Medical Branch. As of 1 January 2006, according to former Ministry of Defence junior minister Don Touhig, the QARNNS had a total strength of 90 Nursing Officers and 200 Naval Nurses (ratings) out of a requirement of 330. The Navy List (2006) listed 92 QARNNS Officers, of whom two were captains (including one DNNS/Matron-in-Chief), seven commanders, 19 lieutenant-commanders, 60 lieutenants and four sub-lieutenants. The Navy List (1981) listed 146 QARNNS Officers, of whom one held the rank of Matron-in-Chief, two were Principal Matrons, four Matrons, 32 Superintending Sisters, 89 Senior Nursing Sisters and 13 Nursing Sisters; five of the 145 QARNNS Officers were non-nursing officers: two Senior Clerical and Quarters Officers and three Clerical and Quarters Officers. ==History== In 1883, a committee determined that improvements were needed in medical and nursing care in the Royal Navy. As such, in 1884, a uniformed Naval Nursing Service was introduced, staffed by trained nurses. These nurses served on shore, initially at Haslar and Plymouth. In 1902, Alexandra of Denmark, the queen consort of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, became President of the Nursing Staff; in her honour, the Naval Nursing service was renamed Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service. Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service Reserve was established on 13 October 1910. In 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, QARNNS was significantly expanded, with many volunteers from the British Red Cross and civilian hospitals; similarly, during the Second World War, many volunteer QARNNS nurses were deployed overseas. In 1949 a nursing branch of the Women's Royal Naval Service was formed; however, in 1960 these nurses were integrated into QARNNS, creating a single nursing service. In 1982 an integrated service was formed, allowing men to serve as nurses in QARNNS. The first man to join was Senior Nursing Officer Rajendrasen Purusrum, who was commissioned on 1 March 1983. Although fully affiliated to the Royal Navy from 1977, QARNNS was technically a separate service until 31 March 2000, when it officially became part of the Royal Navy. Queen Alexandra was President until her death in 1925. The following year she was succeeded by Queen Mary. Princess Alexandra became Patron in 1955. == Ranks == Initially there were only two ranks: Nursing Sister and Head Sister. In 1911 the intermediate rank of Superintending Sister was introduced. There was no overall head of the service until the introduction of the rank of Head Sister-in-Chief on 1 August 1927. By 1937 Head Sister and Head Sister-in-Chief had been renamed Matron and Matron-in- Chief. The ranking system changed during the Second World War. {  - ! QARNNS rank ! Equivalent RN rank -  Nursing Sister  Lieutenant -  Senior Nursing Sister  Lieutenant -  Superintending Sister  Lieutenant-Commander -  Matron  Lieutenant-Commander/Commander -  Principal Matron  Commander/Captain -  Matron-in-Chief  Commodore } Ratings, known as Naval Nurses, were introduced in 1960, with the integration of the WRNS nurses. Their ranking system was similar to that of Royal Navy ratings. In 1982, in preparation for the introduction of male officers, the Nursing Officers' ranking system was changed. {  - !QARNNS rank !Equivalent RN rank -  Nursing Officer  Sub-Lieutenant -  Senior Nursing Officer  Lieutenant -  Superintending Nursing Officer  Lieutenant-Commander -  Chief Nursing Officer  Commander -  Principal Nursing Officer  Captain -  Matron-in-Chief  Commodore } In 1995 the QARNNS adopted Royal Navy ranks, although the head of the Nursing Service was no longer a one-star equivalent, the senior Captain of the QARNNS was appointed Director Naval Nursing Service (DNNS) and styled with the historic post of Matron-in-Chief. ==List of Head Sisters-in-Chief/Matrons-in- Chief/Directors of Naval Nursing Services QARNNS== Head Sister-in-Chief, Naval Nursing Service * Margaret Keenan, 1927‚Äì1929 * Mildred Hughes, 1929‚Äì1934 * Catherine Renwick, 1934‚Äì1937 Matron-in-Chief, Naval Nursing Service * B.

It is also presumed to occur in the intervening/adjacent countries of Angola (in the Cabinda enclave), Equatorial Guinea, and the Central African Republic. Common name African wart frog has been coined for this species. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is warty, black or brownish to olive in color, and bears an hourglass pattern consisting of very irregular transverse bands on dorsum and limbs. Males have no vocal sac or vocal sac openings and are believed to be mute. Males also have strong spines on the tarsus, and they have larger digital discs than females. The tadpoles grow to in total length. Newly metamorphosed juveniles are brightly colored: they are dorsally orange, with the top of the head and bars across the middle of the back and in the lumbar region deep maroon. ==Habitat and conservation== This frog lives in lowland rainforest. It is mostly aquatic, living in water- filled holes in trees. Apparently, they leave the tree holes only during night to forage. The eggs are deposited a few centimeters above the water surface. Upon hatching, the tadpoles fall into the water. The development takes approximately three months. They are detritivores. Because this species depends on large trees with holes that collect rainwater, it is vulnerable to ongoing forest loss. ==Ecological interactions== This frog is host to the commensal protists Opalina proteus and Cepedea couillardi. ==References== Spinosus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Fauna of Nigeria Category:Amphibians of the Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians described in 1875 Category:Taxa named by Reinhold Wilhelm Buchholz Category:Taxa named by Wilhelm Peters Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Acanthixalus spinosus"},{"id":"12381581","text":"The golden banana frog, golden dwarf reed frog, golden spiny reed frog, or golden leaf-folding frog (Afrixalus aureus) is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is endemic to South Africa. ==Habitat== Its natural habitats are temperate forests, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, water storage areas, and ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss. The Knysna banana frog is a species known from around 7 locations at low altitude (< 250 m asl) on the south coast of South Africa on either side of the border between the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. To the extent of scientists knowledge we know that the occurrence rate is 1,756 km¬≤. The area of occupancy has not been formally calculated but is known to be declining as some sites (like Covie) are presumed lost as no adults or tadpoles have been found there for at least three years. Although some sites are pristine, others are threatened by alien vegetation. Banana frogs are native to South Africa (Eastern Cape Province, Western Cape Province). They live in coastal mosaic of vegetation types, including mountain fynbos heathland, and forest. The frogs breed in small dams and shallow semi-permanent water with much emergent vegetation and even in well vegetated ornamental garden ponds; it is suspected that this species requires high water quality for breeding. Habitat is declining due to encroachment by urban development, alien invasive vegetation and chemical pollution. Species in this genus deposit between 20 and 50 eggs on vegetation above the water. Tadpoles emerge, drop into the water and remain there until metamorphosis. ==Identification== The Knysna banana frog has a creamy and yellow color with lateral brown stripes. Females have a smoother texture than males. ==Population== Population trends are unknown: since there has been a rapid decline in population it is hard to tell if urban development, alien invasive vegetation, chemical pollution, or a combination of these have been the sole reason of the decline and therefore affect the population trend. The distribution of the species tends to be severely fragmented as no one site holds more than 50% of the individuals and the distances between subpopulations are too great for dispersal within one generation. When scientists visited a site at Covie they found that the frogs have not produced any individuals (adults or tadpoles) for three years. It seems likely that this subpopulation has become extinct, but further visits are required to substantiate this; just because this area seems to be extinct does not mean the entire species is extinct. The cause for this disappearance is as yet unknown, but change in water quality is suspected as a possible reason. This is most likely due to urbanization. The main threat is habitat loss due to urban and recreational development, afforestation, invasive vegetation, agricultural expansion and chemical pollution. These threats are likely to act locally on breeding sites. Droughts may cause additional stresses for this species. ==Diet== The species diet is chiefly insects. ==Conservation Actions== There are many important questions that are still unanswered; however attention must be paid to the effects water quality changes cause to the species. Less urban development, alien invasive vegetation and chemical pollution will help the frog population thrive but may not reverse the decreasing trend of this population. ==Sources== * Bergmann, Travis; Zimkus, Breda; Gale Rosen, Daniel. 2012.

It is endemic to Cameroon and known from a few mountains in the western part of the country; specifically, it has been recorded from Mount Manengouba (its type locality), Mount Nlonaka, and the southern Bamileke Highlands (Mount Bana, Foto, and Batie). Common name Cameroon banana frog has been coined for it. Prior to its description, it was confused with Afrixalus lindholmi. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is stocky. The fingers are about one-third webbed and the toes are half webbed; both finger and toe tips bear large discs. The colouration varies by the time of the day: during the daytime, the dorsum is almost completely milky white, with few brown chromatophores, whereas at night, there are numerous brown chromatophores and the dorsum may be completely brown. The canthus rostralis is always brown. The thighs, hands, and feet are lemon yellow. The male advertisement call is a rather quiet, high-pitched buzzing. ==Habitat and conservation== Afrixalus lacteus is found in montane forests (including secondary forest and forest edges) and in Raffia palm swamps at elevations of above sea level. Males call from the canopy of trees close to streams where breeding takes place. Afrixalus lacteus is an uncommon species known from only few localities. It is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation associated with agricultural encroachment and collection of wood. On Mount Manengouba a specific threat is deforestation caused by unsustainable harvesting of Prunus africana. Afrixalus lacteus is not known from any protected area. ==References== lacteus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Endemic fauna of Cameroon Category:Amphibians described in 1976 Category:Taxa named by Jean-Luc Perret Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Afrixalus lacteus"},{"id":"12381661","text":"Afrixalus laevis is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

She was the first wife and empress of Emperor Gaozong and became empress shortly after he became emperor in 649. She, however, did not bear any sons for him and was not favored. Therefore, in apprehension that one of his concubines, Consort Xiao, who was both favored and had a son, might seek to displace her, she recommended a former concubine of Emperor Gaozong's father Emperor Taizong, Consort Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), to be Emperor Gaozong's concubine as well, hoping to divert favor from Consort Xiao. Soon, however, Consort Wu became dominant in the palace and overwhelmed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, eventually accusing them of using witchcraft against Emperor Gaozong. Emperor Gaozong reduced both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao to commoner rank and put them under arrest in 655, replacing Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Soon, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were very cruelly and inhuman executed on the new Empress Wu's orders. ==Background== It is not known when the future Empress Wang was born, although it is known that she was from Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Her father Wang Renyou (Áéã‰ªÅ‰Ωë) was a son of Wang Sizheng (ÁéãÊÄùÊîø), a major general for Western Wei, and during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Wang Renyou served as magistrate of Luoshan County (ÁæÖÂ±±, in modern Xinyang, Henan). Emperor Taizong's aunt Princess Tong'an had married Wang Renyou's uncle Wang Yu (ÁéãË£ï) and had heard that Wang Renyou's daughter was both beautiful and gentle. She thus recommended to Emperor Taizong that he make her one of his daughters-in-law, and Emperor Taizong agreed, taking her to be the wife and princess of his ninth son Li Zhi the Prince of Jin. In 643, after Li Zhi became crown prince, replacing his older brother Li Chengqian (who was deposed for plotting to overthrow Emperor Taizong), Princess Wang became crown princess. Her father Wang Renyou was promoted to the post of prefect of Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, roughly modern Zhoukou, Henan). ==As empress== In 649, Emperor Taizong died, and Li Zhi took the throne as Emperor Gaozong. He created Crown Princess Wang empress in spring 650. He also created her father Wang Renyou the Duke of Wei and her mother Lady Liu the Lady of Wei. Wang Renyou soon died thereafter, and was posthumously given the honor of being Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫), one of the Three Excellencies. Her uncle Liu Shi became one of the chancellors. Despite the length of the marriage that Empress Wang had with Emperor Gaozong, she did not bear him a son, and by the time that she became empress, he had already had four sons with his concubines‚Äîand the mother of the fourth son Li Sujie, Consort Xiao, who had also given birth to two daughters (the later Princesses Yiyang and Gao'an), was particularly favored. Liu Shi suggested to Empress Wang that she suggest that Emperor Gaozong's oldest son Li Zhong, whose mother Consort Liu was of low birth, be made crown prince, so that she could be endeared to him. Empress Wang was able to persuade Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji the support the plan, and in 652, Li Zhong was created crown prince. By this point, however, Empress Wang was facing a major threat from a different romantic rival. When Emperor Gaozong was crown prince, he had been attracted by the beauty of one of Emperor Taizong's concubines, Consort Wu. After Emperor Taizong's death, all of his concubines who did not bear children were housed at Ganye Temple (ÊÑüÊ•≠ÂØ∫) to be Buddhist nuns. In either 650 or 651,The modern historian Bo Yang, based on the fact that Empress Wu's oldest son Li Hong was born in 652, fixed the date of this incident as 650, but 651 is also a possibility. See Bo Yang Edition of Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 47. when Emperor Gaozong was visiting Ganye Temple to offer incense to Buddha, when he saw Consort Wu. Both of them wept. When Empress Wang heard this, she, wanting to divert Emperor Gaozong's favor from Consort Xiao, secretly instructed Consort Wu to grow her hair back, while suggesting to Emperor Gaozong that he take her as a concubine. Consort Wu was intelligent and full of machinations, and therefore, when she first returned to the palace, she acted humbly and flattered Empress Wang, who trusted her greatly and recommended her to Emperor Gaozong. Soon, Emperor Gaozong became enamored with Consort Wu. Both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao lost favor, and soon, they realized the seriousness of the situation and joined forces to try to alienate Consort Wu from Emperor Gaozong, but were unsuccessful. In particular, Empress Wang was described as being unable or unwilling to make friends among Emperor Gaozong's other concubines, ladies in waiting, and servants, a situation aggravated by the fact that her mother Lady Liu and uncle Liu Shi were disrespectful to the other concubines. By contrast, Consort Wu cultivated relationships with other concubines, ladies in waiting, and servants, particularly those that Empress Wang had offended, and she further distributed the rewards she received with them. However, the situation came to a head in 654. Consort Wu had given birth to a daughter, and after birth, Empress Wang visited her. Shortly thereafter, the child was found dead and the Empress Wang accused of murdering the girl (Historians believe that Banu Wu's immense demands are that he killed his daughter to kidnap Empress Wang in order to empress herself). In summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and Lady Liu of using witchcraft to try to gain favor back for Empress Wang, and in response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and exiled Liu Shi. Despite this, he did not immediately depose Empress Wang. In fall 655, he summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, Chu Suiliang, Li Ji, and Yu Zhining to the palace to discuss the matter‚Äîa meeting that Li Ji declined to attend. Chu fervently opposed deposing Empress Wang and pointed out that Consort Wu was previously Emperor Taizong's concubine and, therefore, taking her was considered incest. Two other chancellors not invited to the meeting, Han Yuan and Lai Ji, also submitted opposition. However, after Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji for his opinion, Li Ji responded, \\"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\\" Emperor Gaozong thus became resolved to depose Empress Wang, and in winter 655‚ÄîNovember 27ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ‚Äîboth Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were deposed and reduced to commoner rank. Their mothers and brothers were exiled to the modern Guangdong region, while Empress Wang's father Wang Renyou's posthumous honors were stripped. ==After removal== Six days after Empress Wang's removal, Consort Wu was created empress. Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were put under arrest inside the palace, at a building that had its doors and windows tightly sealed, with only a hole on the wall to deliver food. One day, Emperor Gaozong thought of them and decided to visit them, and when he saw the conditions they were in, he was saddened, calling out, \\"Empress, Shufei [Consort Xiao's title], where are you?\\" Empress Wang wept and responded, \\"We have been found guilty and reduced to be maidservants. How can we still be referred to by honored titles?\\" She also begged, \\"If Your Imperial Majesty considered our past relationships and will allow us to again see the light of day, please rename this place 'Huixin Courtyard' [(ÂõûÂøÉÈô¢, meaning \\"the courtyard of a returned heart\\")].\\" Emperor Gaozong was initially receptive, responding, \\"I will do so right away.\\" However, when Empress Wu heard this, she was enraged, and she by her own royal decree sent people to cane Empress Wang and Consort Xiao 100 times each and cut off their hands and feet. She then had them put into large wine jars, saying, \\"Let these two witches be drunk to their bones!\\"This account is per the New Book of Tang, which the Zizhi Tongjian accepted, but the Old Book of Tang indicated that they were strangled. Compare New Book of Tang, vol. 76 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 200 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 51 . When Empress Wang was informed the orders, she bowed and stated, \\"May His Imperial Majesty live forever, and may Zhaoyi [(Êò≠ÂÑÄ, Empress Wu's title as a concubine, implicitly refusing to acknowledge her as empress)] be favored forever. Dying is within my responsibility.\\" However, Consort Xiao cursed Empress Wu, \\"Wu is a treacherous monster! May it be that I be reincarnated as a cat and she be reincarnated as a mouse, so that I can, for ever and ever, grab her throat.\\" Empress Wang and Consort Xiao suffered for several days inside the wine jars before dying, and Empress Wu had their bodies taken out of the jars and beheaded. (When Empress Wu heard of Consort Xiao's curse, she forbade the palace personnel from keeping cats as pets, but thereafter often dreamed of Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, with scattered hair and bleeding limbs, seeking to kill her. She thereafter initially moved to Penglai Palace (Ëì¨ËêäÂÆÆ), but continued to dream of them, and therefore eventually spent most of her time in the eastern capital Luoyang and not in the capital Chang'an, where these events occurred.) Soon after Empress Wang's and Consort Xiao's deaths, at Empress Wu's urging, Emperor Gaozong also had Empress Wang's and her clan's surname changed to Mang (Ëüí, meaning \\"boa constrictor\\") and Consort Xiao's and her clan's surname changed to Xiao (Ê¢ü, meaning \\"owl\\"). Only after Empress Wu's own death in 705 were their clans' proper surnames restored. However, it is controversial that Empress Wang was able to suffer the torture for few days to death. Another assumption is that Empress Wang was hanged to death upon emperor's approval. ==Modern depictions== * Portrayed by Chang Chung Wen in the 1963 Hong-Kong movie Empress Wu Tse-Tien. * Portrayed by Ban Ban in the 1984 Hong-Kong TV series Empress Wu. * Portrayed by Chen Pei-ling in the 1985 Taiwanese TV series The Empress of the Dynasty. * Portrayed by Zheng Shuang in the 1995 Chinese TV series Wu Zetian. * Portrayed by Zhang Tong in the 2003 Chinese TV series Lady Wu: The First Empress. * Portrayed by Yan Bingyan in the 2006 Chinese TV series Wu Zi Bei Ge. * Portrayed by Jun Hyun-ah in 2006-2007 SBS TV series Yeon Gaesomun. * Portrayed by Ni Hong Jie in the 2011 Chinese TV series Meng Hui Tang Chao. * Portrayed by Zhou Mu Yin in the 2011 Chinese TV series Beauty World. * Portrayed by Jiang Lin Jing in the 2011 TV series Secret History of Empress Wu. * Portrayed by Lan Yan in the 2012 Chinese TV series Secret History of Princess Taiping. * Portrayed by Shi Shi in the 2014 Chinese TV series The Empress of China. * Portrayed by Hu Sang in the 2014 Chinese TV series Young Sherlock. * Portrayed by Theresa Fu in the 2017 Chinese TV series Legendary Di Renjie. ==Notes and references== * Old Book of Tang, vol. 51. * New Book of Tang, vol. 76. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 199, 200.

Coining money, the family Anduze reigned as the supreme house of the Cevennes. The lords of the House Anduze were the titled Marquis of Gothia and Prince of Anduze and were allied to the counts of Toulouse and participated in the crusade against the Albigensians in 1266, it was related to the crown of France. It counted among its branches of the houses of Sauve, Roquefeuil (still existing), Sommieres, and Cayla Thoiras. Anduze was the cradle of French sericulture from late 13th century. The city then became the regional center of trading in silk and wool. It had up to 7,000 people at its peak. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Anduze was an important center of Protestantism. The walled city, which had 6000 inhabitants in 1570, became the headquarters of the Protestant forces of the South. In 1573, the city had the birth of what Janine Garrison called the United Provinces of the South, including an attempted independent Huguenot state, based on local autonomy.Au d√©but du XXIe si√®cle, les modalit√©s de recensement ont √©t√© modifi√©es par la loi no 2002-276 du 27 f√©vrier 2002 [archive], dite ¬´ loi de d√©mocratie de proximit√© ¬ª relative √† la d√©mocratie de proximit√© et notamment le titre V ¬´ des op√©rations de recensement ¬ª, afin de permettre, apr√®s une p√©riode transitoire courant de 2004 √† 2008, la publication annuelle de la population l√©gale des diff√©rentes circonscriptions administratives fran√ßaises.

In the 19th century, with the industrial revolution, new economic development in silk mills, hosiery, and headgear took place, before being hit by recession. Anduze was also site of the Cevennes Coal Mines, prime contractors of the French coal industry. The city is known for its zinc smelting, pottery, and castle dating from the 16th century. Currently, tourism plays an important role in the economy of the area; the station is used by the tourist railway steam train of the Cevennes. ==PopulationSights== * Bambouseraie de Prafrance * The Clock Tower dates from 1320, it has three levels and is reminiscent of the architecture of the tower of Constance Aigues-Mortes.

In 1988 placed it in its own genus, which he named Chlorolius in view of its \\"chlorophyll color\\". He cited both its breeding habits (low, chirping male call and breeding in pure, well-oxygenated waters) and morphology (e.g., numerous black spines on flanks, underside of limbs and feet of breeding males) as diagnostic characteristics for the new genus. However, molecular data clearly show that this species is embedded within Hyperolius. ==Description== Hyperolius koehleri measure in snout‚Äìvent length, with the range indicated for adult males. The head is rather flat. The dorsum is grass green with diffuse red-brown spots and a chrome yellow dorsolateral stripe. Legs are somewhat lighter and more yellowish. Underside of limbs is pale green; feet and hands are yellow. Throat is turquoise, breast white, and abdomen translucent green. The eye is golden green or, in juveniles, reddish, and has horizontal pupil. Males have numerous black spines on flanks, underside of limbs and feet when in breeding condition.

Common names Balfour's reed frog and Ethiopia reed frog have been coined for this species, with the latter name referring to the now-synonymized Hyperolius zavattarii. Populations from the western part of the range may be referred to the subspecies Hyperolius balfouri viridistriatus. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is yellow to brown with thin, dark dorsolateral stripes. In the eastern populations these are shorter, extending 2/3 down the body, whereas in the western populations the lines are green and better developed; often a dark middorsal line, sometimes split into spots, is present. The venter and throat are white to orange. Males possess a large, flat, somewhat shagreened gular flap and small asperities on the dorsum. Females have smooth skin. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius balfouri occurs in savannas at elevations below . In southwestern Ethiopia it can occur in tropical deciduous forests, and it can also occur formerly forested areas in Cameroon. Breeding takes place in small pools. It is an abundant species that is unlikely to face significant threats, except perhaps in the Ethiopian part of its range where deforestation could be a threat.

However, the two have differences in morphology (larger gular flap in H. baumanni) and the advertisement call. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius baumanni occurs in secondary forest, forest edge, and heavily degraded former forest (farm bush). Breeding is unknown but is assumed to involve attaching eggs to leaves above shallow, densely vegetated temporary ponds. The species is extremely abundant in its small range. No significant threats to this adaptable species are known. It occurs in the Kyabobo National Park in Ghana and in a number of smaller forest reserves.

It is found in the highlands of western Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda as well as eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Common names of this species include Ahl's reed frog, brown reed frog, and montane reed frog. The status of the putative subspecies Hyperolius castaneus rhodogaster is unclear, and it may actually be a distinct species. Also Hyperolius constellatus, now a distinct species, was formerly recognized as a subspecies of H. castaneus. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The color pattern is highly variable. The dorsum in adult males is consistently tan to brown. There are varying levels of yellow or brown spots, or yellow blotches that may cover most of the dorsum. The yellow spots might have dark brown centers or edging. Most specimens have a brown or dark brown canthal stripe that runs from the nostril through the eye to at least the forelimb insertion, sometimes further to the inguinal region of the hind limb. The throat is canary yellow. The belly is grayish blue or white. The limbs are salmon red to red, with the concealed parts of the thighs being bright orangish red. In adult females, the dorsal ground color varies from orangish brown to mustard yellow. The canthal region is dark brown in most individuals, and that coloration may extend from the posterior of the orbit to the forelimb insertion. The dorsum may be completely without patterns, or the patterns can resemble the males ones, or may include large brown blotches with neon yellowish green borders. The abdomen is white with a light pink to grayish blue throat; the limbs have similar color. The hands and feet may be salmon red. In both males and females, the flanks and dorsum may have a lighter brown coloration than the remainder of the dorsum, or range from light gray to salmon red. Juveniles and subadults have coloring that transitions from a lime green dorsum (often with a white dorsolateral line) to the adult coloration described above. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius castaneus occurs in swamps in montane grassland and forest at elevations of above sea level. ==Conservation== First assessed as \\"vulnerable\\" in 2004, this species is now listed as \\"least concern\\" due to the discovery that it occurs more widely than previously thought (now a 73,498 km¬≤ estimated extent of occurrence) and because, despite ongoing habitat loss, there is currently an abundance of suitable habitats within its range. It is considered to be an abundant species.

A large number of species described in later years have been brought into synonymy with it. One subspecies, Hyperolius concolor ibadanensis Schi√∏tz, 1967 from Nigeria and Cameroon, is recognized, in addition to the nominotypical subspecies and one unnamed subspecies, the latter also from Nigeria and Cameroon. ==Description== Hyperolius concolor is a medium to large-sized member of its genus, with males measuring and females about in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is long and pointed. The pupil is horizontal. There are two colour phases. All juveniles and many mature males display phase \\"J\\", which is normally brownish to green in colour and shows paired light dorsolateral lines or an hourglass pattern. All females, and some males, develop into phase \\"F\\" prior to the first breeding season. This phase is often colourful and variable, with uniformly green dorsum, yellow ventrum, and no dark lateral pigmentation. Also intermediate forms are found. Male advertisement call is a succession of brief, hard and non-melodic \\"clicks\\". ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius concolor occurs in forest clearings and degraded forest, and in cultivated land, secondary brush, and gallery forests in savanna; it avoids closed forest habitats. Breeding takes place in small (even putrid) pools and marshes. The eggs are laid on folded leaves above water; the tadpoles fall into the water and continue their development there. It is an abundant species that is probably increasing because its habitat is increasing, even though it could locally suffer from habitat loss. It is sometimes found in the international pet trade, but not at levels that would pose a threat. It occurs in many protected areas. ==References== concolor Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1844 Category:Taxa named by Edward Hallowell (herpetologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius concolor"},{"id":"12381973","text":"Hyperolius cystocandicans is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is endemic to Cameroon and found in the montane southwestern part of the country. Specifically, it has been recorded from the Bakossi Mountains, including the Edib Hills (its type locality) and Mount Kupe. The specific name, dintelmanni, honors Mr. Horst Dintelmann from Germany in recognition of \\"his support of taxonomic research and forthcoming conservation projects in Cameroon\\". ==Taxonomy and systematics== Hyperolius dintelmanni belongs to the so-called Hyperolius tuberculatus complex, which includes Hyperolius hutsebauti as the third species. Distinctness of H. dintelmanni from H. tuberculatus has been questioned, but molecular data now clearly supports recognizing H. dintelmanni as a distinct species. ==Description== Adult males in the type series measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length (SVL); Portik and colleagues report a larger size range for females, SVL, including specimens from the type locality as well as from Mount Kupe. The body is slender. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is visible in most specimens even though the tympanic membrane is covered by thick skin. The fingers and the toes have broad tips and are webbed, the toes more so than the fingers. The phase J males are dorsally olive green to translucent dark green on extremities with light green patterns that turns yellowish towards the periphery. The venter varies from yellowish to greyish in the gular region. Phase F individuals are dorsally dark brown to black and have greenish spotting and bright red areas on upper legs, feet, and hands. The lower legs and feet and hands are almost entirely bright red. The ventrum is yellowish. However, Portik and colleagues describe phase F individuals as having a smaller number of reddish-pink points on the dorsum, whereas the ventral colouration is bright reddish-pink; they suggest that the females in the original species description are misidentified. The iris is bronze. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius dintelmanni is known from a few localities at elevations of above sea level. The Edib Hills specimens were found on the outer margins of patches of primary forest. The breeding habitat consisted of a small crater lake. Specimens were found sitting low (<1 m above the ground) at night in grassy vegetation in areas with ferns, or further inland along the forest trails. Breeding individuals were found on floating mats of vegetation the pond edge. Mount Kupe specimens were found calling from emergent vegetation of a fish pond adjacent to a large stream; some specimens were found at a pond located in semi-disturbed habitat consisting of primary forest and cocoa plantation. This species appears to tolerate some habitat disturbance, but densities were much higher at the undisturbed site (the Edib Hills crater lake) than in the modified habitats. The species is unlikely to persist in areas where extensive forest clearance for smallholder farming is taking place. ==References== dintelmanni Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Endemic fauna of Cameroon Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius dintelmanni"},{"id":"12381991","text":"Hyperolius discodactylus is a species of frogs in the family Hyperoliidae.

It became a town in 1027, and was soon the principal place in the Duchy of Swabia. Although burned down by Henry the Lion, the town soon recovered, becoming a Free Imperial City in 1155. Towards the close of the Middle Ages it played a leading part several times at the head of Swabian Leagues of the 14th century and 15th century. Its trade and commerce prospered, peaking in the 15th century, ruling over a district about . It became a Free Imperial City with extensive territorial authority, and having a population of about 60,000.

Gatto Trocchi, Magia ed esoterismo in Italia, Milano: Mondadori, 1990, p. 142-145. # Physiological and Psychosomatic Ascesis, for the physical well being and the maximum balance and performability of the body, its energies, to the purpose of making it a temple of the spirit: a necessary basis for preparing a good karma (destiny) in view of the resurrection of the body, healthy and beautiful. # Social Ascesis that is the effort, exercise, methodical and progressive action to become a perfect citizen and to make oneself a spokesman of a new society resting on the pillars of charity, non-violence, reciprocal economic, cultural and spiritual assistance. # Mystical Ascesis, through an intense devotional life of dialogue with the Divinity; a process of inner transmutation leading to active ecstasy, to the vision of the Light. It is the Alchemist's Opus in White, the entrance into the Waters of Life, the sojourn of the Saints: prelude to a new state of superior ascent towards the Kingdom of God. # Theurgical Ascesis, or progressing with the rites which attract the friendship and help of God, of the Christ, of the Mother, of the helpful Angelic Spirits, Archangelic and of the Universal Communion of the Adepts and the Saints. # Magical Ascesis, effort and action to dominate the forces of Nature. Read the definition of Magic we have given in our Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archeosophy (40th Booklet - first part). # Cosmic Ascesis, action and advance towards a syntony or cosmicization with the whole: stars, elements, skies, etc. # Sapiential and Initiatic Ascesis, or the spiritual elevation of oneself through the Knowledge and particular practices leading to an inner transmutation and to the qualitative leap. It is the way to come out of the Waters of the phenomenic world, the going beyond the mystical state, it is the christic walking above the Waters. It is the perennial wakefulness and the Alchemist's Opus in Red, that is the royal state of who has finally exited from the game of creation. All these forms of ascesis are explained as doctrine and as practice in special booklets called \\"Archeosophy Booklets\\". ==Archeosophy Booklets== Subjects of Archeosophy are developed in special booklets called Archeosophy Booklets. There are about 50 Booklets which investigate various subjects as esoteric Christianity, Reincarnation, Out of Body Experience, Meditation, Clairvoyance, Esotericism, Alchemy, Symbolism, Mysticism, Pranotherapy, and so on.A complete list of the booklets can be found on the Archeosophical Society site == Some bibliography from Archeosofica == * Tommaso Palamidessi, The Archaic Tradition and Foundation of Archeosophical Initiation * Il Corso degli astri e le malattie nell'uomo: trattato teorico-pratico di cosmopatogenesi con 22 figure, Milan: F.lli Bocca, 1940 (2nd ed.

There might also be some diffuse, dark spots, and the dorsolateral line might be bordered with black. * All females, and some males, develop into phase \\"F\\" prior to the first breeding season. The dorsum is dark brown to reddish and has round or oblong orange spots; the ventrum is greyish white. There is variation within this phase; sometimes the light spots are large, sometimes they are very small and numerous.In some Cameroonian specimens the dorsum is uniform brown to reddish and there are black dots on the sides and ventrum. Male advertisement call is a rapid succession of pure, low-pitched notes that have a soft tonal quality. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius guttulatus lives in and around large swamps in secondary habitats in the forest belt; in West Africa it typically occurs in the forest-savanna transition forest. It is not found in undisturbed forest. Breeding takes place very large, mostly permanent ponds. Males call from bushes several metres above the ground. The distribution of this species is very patchy, but it can be locally very abundant. It is threatened by habitat loss, especially when affecting its breeding sites. It occurs in a number of protected areas, including the Ankasa Conservation Area and Kakum National Park in Ghana. ==References== guttulatus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Arne Schi√∏tz Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius guttulatus"},{"id":"12382048","text":"The arum frog, Horstock's arum-frog, arum lily frog, or Horstock's reed frog (Hyperolius horstockii) is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae. It is endemic to South Africa. ==Identification== Adults grow to 40 mm in length. They have bright orange feet and can change their colour to camouflage themselves. The top of the body is cream to brown, sometimes with small black spots. A distinctive, pale, dorsolateral line runs from the snout along the flanks, with a dark-brown lateral band underneath. A fine, dark line usually separates the pale line from the brown band. The concealed surfaces of limbs, webbing, and discs are orange to red. Underneath, the frog is creamy white and slightly granular. The gular flap in males is bright ochre. their pupils are horizontal. Tadpoles reach 40 mm. They are brown with longitudinal, darker bands on their tails. ==Distribution and habitat== The arum frog is found in the southern coastal plain of South Africa from Cape Town in the Western Cape to Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. Its natural habitats are Mediterranean- type shrubby vegetation, rivers, swamps, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and ponds. It is frequently found lying at the bottom of arum lilies (Zantedeschia aethiopica), trying to catch pollinating insects. It is assessed as least concern but some populations are threatened by habitat loss through the invasion of alien vegetation and fire. Contrary to popular belief it is not threatened by the collection and sale of arum lilies. ==Behaviour== These frogs are sometimes found in arum lily flowers where they can change colour to perfectly match their surroundings. This makes them virtually invisible to predators, as well as to their insect prey. Their pale colour camouflages them in the white flowers, helped by hiding their bright orange feet and legs under their bodies during the day. Contrary to popular belief they do not use the pollen of the flowers to camouflage themselves. The breeding habitat of the arum frog includes large or small pans, dams, vleis and slow-flowing, quiet streams where there is sufficient emergent vegetation. Males usually call at night from elevated positions above water, normally in the emergent vegetation such as sedges, reeds, shrubs and grasses, although they may sometimes call from the pads of water lilies. The usually start calling just after sunset, but will call sporadically in the late afternoon on cloudy, rainy days. The arum frog occurs mostly in a winter rainfall region; however, its breeding season occurs over the spring and summer, in September‚ÄìJanuary. After mating the female lays clutches of 10‚Äì30 eggs which are attached to the submerged roots and stems of plants. ==References== Category:Hyperolius Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Taxa named by Hermann Schlegel Category:Amphibians described in 1837 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Arum frog"},{"id":"12382053","text":"Hyperolius houyi is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

She played for the UCLA Bruins from 1982-1985 (where she was a three-time National Champion) and the United States' national softball team just prior to the major boom in the sport's popularity both in America and worldwide. She was the singularly most dominant pitcher in softball during her career and was remarkable for her exceptional fastball and her unusual height (6' 5\\"). She owns numerous records for the Bruins and in the NCAA Division I. ==University of California, Los Angeles== UCLA recruited Doom out of Tempe, Arizona, where she played high school softball. She opened her career by breaking and setting school season records for strikeouts and strikeout ratio, the latter of which led the NCAA. On April 20, 1982, Doom set the single-game strikeout record (now third best) in NCAA history when she fanned 25 batters against the Cal State Fullerton Titans. The total remains the Freshman Class single game record for the NCAA. She would match it twice in her career before Michele Granger surpassed her in 1993. On May 15, Doom threw her first perfect game vs. the Wyoming Cowgirls. The Bruins made the inaugural NCAA Women's College World Series softball tournament and Doom opened her series with a 13-inning victory over the Oklahoma State Cowgirls on May 27. Doom set the tournament record for single- game strikeouts with 20. On May 29, she won back-to-back games vs. the Western Michigan Broncos (in relief and combining for a perfect game) and the Arizona State Sun Devils (striking out 11 in 7-innings, a WCWS record). Doom marched forward with a 10-inning shutout over the Cal State Fullerton Titans in the semifinals to reach the championship game as a freshman. She allowed only two hits in 8-innings as her Bruins downed the Fresno State Bulldogs 2‚Äì0 on May 31, thanks to a throwing error and sacrifice fly in the eighth inning. Doom was named to the All-Tournament Team for her 5 wins, 62 strikeouts, 41.2 innings pitched efforts. For her sophomore campaign, Doom was named a National Fastpitch Coaches Association First Team All-American and won honors from the now defunct WCAA. She broke her own strikeouts record and again led the NCAA in strikeout ratio. Doom pitched an 11-inning no-hitter on March 7 vs. the Creighton Bluejays. The UCLA Bruins made it back to the WCWS to defend their title and Doom started off by breaking her own record with 15 strikeouts in regulation over the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters on May 26. The next game, she suffered her first loss to the Cal State Fullerton Titans, who tagged her for 6 earned runs. She responded by besting the South Carolina Gamecocks in 17-innings on May 28. Doom and the Bruins were eliminated by the eventual champions, the Texas A&M; Aggies, after 14-innings on May 29. Doom had a banner year in 1984, being named First Team All-American and winning the Honda Sports Award for softball. She broke her own season records with career bests in strikeouts, WHIP, ERA (NCAA Junior Class record) and shutouts totals, the two latter categories being second best for an NCAA season and still remaining top-10 all-time; along with her wins, she also earned a conference pitching Triple Crown for the WCAA. Doom also had a no-hitter and a perfect game to her credit. From February 25 to April 6, Doom achieved a 102-scoreless-inning streak, which remained tops until Danielle Henderson posted a new record in 1999. Making their third consecutive bid for a national title, Doom gave her team a shutout performance to open that year's WCWS vs. the Utah State Aggies. They suffered an extra-inning loss to the Texas A&M; Aggies in their next game. Doom won in relief against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on May 28 and the next day returned the shutout against the Aggies in the semifinals. Doom faced the Aggies for a third time in the finale that lasted 13-innings with the Bruins celebrating a second national championship on May 29. Doom again made the All-Tournament Team. Doom received final Second Team All-American and All- WCAA accolades. She posted a top-10 shutout total to accompany three perfect games for the Bruins. The perfect game total was a new NCAA season record and remains top-5; Doom along with Beth Hawkins of the Bradley Braves, were the first pitchers to reach the total in a season. For a final time with Doom on the mound, the Bruins made the 1985 World Series, though Doom lost her first match with the Cal State Fullerton Titans on May 24. The game was notable as Doom surrendered her only career home run to Robin Goodin. Doom rebounded with a shutout over the Nebraska Cornhuskers the next day. With help from Tracy Compton, Doom was able to pitch her third national championship game, a 9-inning win over the Cornhuskers on May 26. She was named to the All- Tournament Team for final time. At the end of her World Series career, Doom remains the only pitcher to win three NCAA Division I WCWS softball championships. The 1984 championship saw Doom set the ultimate strikeout record for a title game at 15; UCLA Bruin Anjelica Selden would set the record for the three-game format in 2005 with 13; no one has beaten Doom's tally. Overall, she went 13‚Äì4 with 178 strikeouts, 7 shutouts and allowing 12 earned runs in 146.1 innings for an 0.57 ERA. Doom left UCLA atop the lists for career wins, strikeouts, shutouts and innings pitched. She was second in ERA. Currently, she ranks top-10 in all the same categories. In the NCAA Division I, Doom set and is now tied third in perfect games (5), ERA (which was second) is now third best and her shutouts were the record and now sit inside the top-15 all-time for a career. ==After UCLA== Recognizing her dominance, the NCAA placed Doom on its All-Decade Team in 1991 and its 25th Anniversary NCAA Division I Women's Softball All-Star Team in 2006. UCLA inducted Doom into its Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. In 1997 at age 34, Doom pitched for the Orlando Wahoos (now the Akron Racers) in Women's Pro Fastpitch (now National Pro Fastpitch). She led the league in ERA (0.42) and opponents' batting average (.153), while also placing in the league's top-5 in four other pitching categories. She went 3‚Äì0 in the championship series against the Virginia Roadsters and was named series MVP. Doom was a consistent member of Team USA and among her highlights was pitching two consecutive perfect games at the 1991 Pan American Games, an unmatched feat. On February 15, 2014, UCLA retired her jersey (#17). She was also included in the Arizona Softball Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Career statistics== UCLA Bruins {  - align=center  YEAR  W  L  GP  GS  CG  SHO  SV  IP  H  R  ER  BB  SO  ERA  WHIP - align=center  1982  11  2  15  13  12  9  0  134.1  63  6  6  25  193  0.31  0.65 - align=center  1983  18  6  25  25  24  16  0  196.0  82  20  14  33  245  0.50  0.58 - align=center  1984  24  3  28  27  27  24  0  215.1  77  5  3  29  282  0.10  0.49 - align=center  1985  20  5  25  25  25  17  0  180.0  81  14  7  20  232  0.27  0.56 - align=center  TOTALS  73  16  93  90  88  66  0  725.2  303  45  30  107  952  0.29  0.56 } ==See also== *NCAA Division I softball career -1.00 ERAs list ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Softball players from Arizona Category:UCLA Bruins softball players Category:Sportspeople from Tempe, Arizona Category:People from El Monte, California Category:Softball players from California ","title":"Debbie Doom"},{"id":"12382063","text":"Hyperolius igbettensis is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

Some plants are naturally adapted to dry conditions, surviving with protection mechanisms such as desiccation tolerance, detoxification, or repair of xylem embolism. Other plants, specifically crops like corn, wheat, and rice, have become increasingly tolerant to drought with new varieties created via genetic engineering. The mechanisms behind drought tolerance are complex and involve many pathways which allows plants to respond to specific sets of conditions at any given time. Some of these interactions include stomatal conductance, carotenoid degradation and anthocyanin accumulation, the intervention of osmoprotectants (such as sucrose, glycine, and proline), ROS-scavenging enzymes. The molecular control of drought tolerance is also very complex and is influenced other factors such as environment and the developmental stage of the plant. This control consists mainly of transcriptional factors, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding factor (AREB), and NAM (no apical meristem). == Physiology of drought tolerance == The terms 'Drought' and 'Water Deficit' are erroneously used interchangeably. It has been proposed that the term 'drought' should be used more for environmental and agronomic situations and ‚Äòwater deficit‚Äô be the preferred term used when referring to irrigation limitation and experimental treatments simulating drought. Plants can be subjected to slowly developing water shortages (ie, taking days, weeks, or months), or they may face short-term water deficits (ie, hours to days). In these situations, plants adapt by responding accordingly, minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Plants are more susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive stages of growth, flowering and seed development. Therefore, the combination of short-term plus long-term responses allow for plants to produce a few viable seeds. Some examples of short-term and long-term physiological responses include:  Short-term responses *In the leaf: root-signal recognition, stomatal closure, decreased carbon assimilation *In the stem: inhibition of growth, hydraulic changes, signal transport, assimilation of transport *In the root: cell-drought signalling, osmotic adjustment  Long-term responses *In the above-ground portion of the plant: inhibition of shoot growth, reduced transpiration area, grain abortion, senescence, metabolic acclimation, osmotic adjustment, anthocyanin accumulation, carotenoid degradation, intervention of osmoprotectants, ROS- scavenging enzymes *In the below-ground portion of the plant: turgor maintenance, sustained root growth, increased root/shoot, increased absorption area == Regulatory network of drought tolerance == 420x420px In response to drought conditions, there is an alteration of gene expression, induced by or activated by transcription factors (TFs). These TFs bind to specific cis- elements to induce the expression of targeted stress-inducible genes, allowing for products to be transcribed that help with stress response and tolerance. Some of these include dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), ABA-responsive element-binding factor (AREB), no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activation factor (ATAF), and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC). Much of the molecular work to understand the regulation of drought tolerance has been done in Arabidopsis, helping elucidate the basic processes below.  DREB TFs   DREB1/CBF TFs  DREB1A, DREB 1B, and DREB 1C are plant specific TFs which bind to drought responsive elements (DREs) in promoters responsive to drought, high salinity and low temperature in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of these genes enhance the tolerance of drought, high salinity, and low temperature in transgenic lines from Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco.  DREB2 TFs  DREB proteins are involved in a variety of functions related to drought tolerance. For example, DREB proteins including DREB2A cooperate with AREB/ABF proteins in gene expression, specifically in the DREB2A gene under osmotic stress conditions. DREB2 also induces the expression of heat-related genes, such as heat shock protein. Overexpression of DREB2Aca enhances drought and heat stress tolerance levels in Arabidopsis.  AREB/ABF TFs  AREB/ABFs are ABA-responsive bZIP-type TFs which bind to ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in stress-responsive promoters and activate gene expression. AREB1, AREB2, ABF3, and ABF1 have important roles in ABA signalling in the vegetative stage, as ABA controls the expression of genes associated with drought response and tolerance. The native form of AREB1 cannot target drought stress genes like RD29B in Arabidopsis, so modification is necessary for transcriptional activation. AREB/ABFs are positively regulated by SnRK2s, controlling the activity of target proteins via phosphorylation. This regulation also functions in the control of drought tolerance in the vegetative stage as well as the seed maturation and germination.  Other TFs  TFs such as NAC (composed of NAM, ATAF, and CUC), are also related to drought response in Arabidopsis and rice. Overexpression in the aforementioned plants improves stress and drought tolerance. They also may be related to root growth and senescence, two physiological traits related to drought tolerance. ==Natural drought tolerance adaptations== The scarlet globe mallow (391x391px Plants in naturally arid conditions retain large amounts of biomass due to drought tolerance and can be classified into 4 categories of adaptation: #Drought-escaping plants: annuals that germinate and grow only during times of sufficient times of moisture to complete their life cycle. #Drought-evading plants: non-succulent perennials which restrict their growth only to periods of moisture availability. #Drought-enduring plants: also known as xerophytes, these evergreen shrubs have extensive root systems along with morphological and physiological adaptations which enable them to maintain growth even in times of extreme drought conditions. #Drought-resisting plants: also known as succulent perennials, they have water stored in their leaves and stems for sparing uses.  Structural adaptations  Many adaptations for dry conditions are structural, including the following: * Adaptations of the stomata to reduce water loss, such as reduced numbers, sunken pits, waxy surfaces. * Reduced number of leaves and their surface area. * Water storage in succulent above- ground parts or water-filled tubers. *Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM metabolism) allows plants to get carbon dioxide at night and store malic acid during the day, allowing photosynthesis to take place with minimized water loss. * Adaptations in the root system to increase water absorption. * Trichomes (small hairs) on the leaves to absorb atmospheric water. ==Importance for agriculture== 397x397px With the frequency and severity of droughts increasing in recent years, damage to crops has become more serious, lowering the overall yield. However, research into the molecular pathways involving stress tolerance have revealed that overexpression of such genes can enhance drought tolerance, leading to projects focused on the development of transgenic crop varieties.  Collaborations to improve drought tolerance in crop-variety plants  International research projects to improve drought tolerance have been introduced, such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). One such project from CGIAR involves introducing genes such as DREB1 into lowland rice, upland rice, and wheat to evaluate drought tolerance in fields. This project aims to select at least 10 lines for agricultural use. Another similar project in collaboration with CGIAR, Embrapa, RIKEN, and the University of Tokyo have introduced AREB and DREB stress-tolerant genes into soybeans, finding several transgenic soybean lines with drought tolerance. Both projects have found improved grain yield and will be used to help develop future varieties that can be used commercially. Other examples of collaborations to improve drought tolerance in crop-variety plants include the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Aleppo, Syria; the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Andhra Pradesh, India; the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Ba√±os, Philippines.; and the Heat and Drought Wheat Improvement Consortium (HeDWIC), a network that facilitates global coordination of wheat research to adapt to a future with more severe weather extremes.  Examples of current commercial drought tolerant plants  Performance Plants, a Canadian plant biotechnology company, is developing technology called Yield Protection Technology (YPT). YPT protects plants against seed yield losses under suboptimal water levels by downregulating Œ± or Œ≤ subunits of protein farnesyl transferase, which is involved in the ABA signaling pathway, enhancing drought tolerance. In field trials, canola with YPT had 26% more seed yield with moderate drought stress than control canola. YPT has been demonstrated in corn and petunia, and is currently being developed in soybean, rice, sorghum, cotton and turf grass.  Impediments to the agricultural commercialization of drought tolerant plants  The development of genetically modified crops includes multiple patents for genes and promoters, such as the marker genes in a vector, as well as transformation techniques. Therefore, freedom-to-operate (FTO) surveys should be implemented in collaborations for developing drought tolerant crops. Large amounts of money are also needed for the development of genetically modified groups. To bring a new genetically modified crop into the commercial market, it has been estimated to cost USD 136 million over 13 years. This poses a problem for development, as only a small number of companies can afford to develop drought-tolerant crops, and it is difficult for research institutions to sustain funding for this period of time. Therefore, a multinational framework with more collaboration among multiple disciples is needed to sustain projects of this size. ==Importance in horticulture== Plant transformation has been used to develop multiple drought resistant crop varieties, but only limited varieties of ornamental plants. This significant lag in development is due to the fact that more transgenic ornamental plants are being developed for other reasons than drought tolerance. However, abiotic stress resistance is being explored in ornamental plants by Ornamental Biosciences. Transgenic Petunias, Poinsettias, New Guinea Impatiens, and Geraniums are being evaluated for frost, drought, and disease resistance. This will allow for a wider range of environments in which these plants can grow. ==See also== * Climate change mitigation * Adaptation to global warming * Breeding for drought stress tolerance * Abscisic acid ==References== Category:Agricultural economics Category:Plant physiology Category:Water conservation ","title":"Drought tolerance"},{"id":"12382104","text":"Hyperolius lateralis is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

However, the general introduction of the report in which the species was described makes many remarks to Mr. B. L. Mitchell, a naturalist from the Nyasaland Game and Tsetse Department. Mitchell had made significant collections in Nyasaland, the focal area of that report. Loveridge specifically thanks Mr. Mitchell for \\"furnishing [him] with local information regarding the amphibians\\". In the same report, Loveridge also named Mitchell's flat lizard (Platysaurus mitchelli) after Mitchell. ==Description== The female holotype measures in snout‚Äìvent length and the male paratype . Typically, males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. There are two distinct colour phases, \\"J\\" and \\"F\\". Juveniles and many mature males have phase J whereas mature females and some mature males have phase F. Phase J has a brownish dorsum with diffuse darker spots. Phase F has a darker dorsum, or lighter brown with diffuse darker spots, and broad, black-edged silverish canthal and dorsolateral lines. Ventrum is yellow to orange for both phases. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius mitchelli inhabit dry forest, farm bush, and low- intensity farmland.

It is found on the West African savannas between Guinea and Mali in the west and Nigeria and Cameroon in the east. Common name plain reed frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Hyperolius nitidulus are medium-sized reed frogs with a rather blunt snout. Males vary is size between and on average weight about one gram. Females are larger and heavier than males, their body size can vary between with an average weight of about two grams before laying eggs. This species has a large choana, which is not hidden beneath edge of mandible like in most Hyperolius species. They have a relatively large tongue which is broad and shaped like a heart. Their dorsal view is roundish and sometimes a bit pointy. From a lateral view their body is flattened but some have a round truncate. The position of the naris is slightly close to snout tip than to the eye. Skin is laterally smooth and with small warts. Body is slender and half cylindrical with thin limbs. They have extra skin folds that are used to hide their feet while aestivating during dry conditions. Fingers and toes have circummarginal discs. Males have a median subgular vocal sac which is used for calling. During their juvenile stage their color is beige with a darker lightly flanked stripe at the side from snout to vent. As an adult they exhibit metachrosis (change in color), this color change is based on many factors such temperature, humidity. During the night the uniformly color is beige and during the day the color can vary between yellow and orange with spots. During the dry season the juveniles become white as they aestivate the skin in the inside of their limbs becomes red due to the underlying capillary network. ==Diet== Adults are insectivores, usually consuming taxa such as Drosophila, Musca, Phormia, Lucilia, and Calliphora. ==Reproduction== Breeding normally occurs during wet season, that is May‚ÄìOctober. During mating season males will migrate to temporary ponds and at times stay there and wander between ponds. Males on average stay for several days or even weeks, while females only visit the ponds only for oviposition. While in the ponds males begin calling between dusk and midnight. Males have two distinct calls; one call is used for mating to attract females, and the second call is used as a territorial call. Mating call is fairly short metallic that can last from 0.16‚Äì0.24 seconds with an average frequency of 2.04‚Äì3.43 Kilohertz; the frequency varies depending on the size of the frog. Territorial call sounds like a ‚Äúcroak‚Äù; it is deeper than the mating call and lasts for a longer period of time. On average each calls can last from 0.28‚Äì0.36 seconds with a frequency of 0.98‚Äì2.0 Kilohertz. Males tend to become aggressive when defending their small calling territories. The female deposits her eggs in the water, attaching the clutch underwater where there is vegetation at the bottom of the pond. Females have the ability to lay 94‚Äì800 eggs per clutch. Females are able to produce several clutches during one mating season. Nonetheless, clutch size will decrease when multiple clutches are laid. There is no parental care. Eggs are white with a dark brown animal pole. Two to fives days after the egg were laid the embryos start to hatch as are free-swimming tadpoles. The tadpole development may take longer because it is dependent on water temperature. Free-living larvae stay in the vegetation areas at the edge of the pond and feed of algae. During this period the larvae are at high risk of many predators such as dragonfly and beetle larvae, turtles, and most fish. The tadpole stage lasts six to eight weeks, before the tadpoles metamorphose. For the frog to mature completely it requires about two months. ==Habitat== Hyperolius nitidulus inhabit margins of swamps, rivers and lakes in savanna, grassland and bushland habitats. It is a very adaptable species that also occurs in many human-modified areas, such as cultivated land, towns, and gardens. ==Survival during dry season== Hyperolius nitidulus live in an environment with a wet season that can be cold and humid, and an extremely hot and dry season. During the hot and dry season the frog is dependent on water therefore it has special adaptations to survive the extreme climate. Hyperolius nitidulus is known for its unique aestivation behavior during the hot and dry season. During dry season Hyperolius nitidulus do not seek shelter or hide, instead, they fully expose themselves to the sun by sitting on dry plants to reduce rapid water loss and can remain in this sitting position for months without food or water. The juveniles only move when they are in serious danger. They sit with their legs held tightly to the body and feet hidden under their skin folds. During this period, since there is no food or water intake, the juvenile frog does not urinate or defecate. The body stores all nitrogenous waste as urea in body fluids and purines. As the hot weather increases the dorsal skin of the frog becomes white due to the presence iridophores that can reflect light like a mirror since they are filled with purines crystals. Juveniles are the only ones that survive a dry season because most adults cannot adapt to the changes in living condition and die. Juveniles born in the first 2/3 of the wet season have enough time to mature and reproduce in the same season. These juveniles must mature quickly and use all their energy for growth and reproduction, which prevents them from preparing for the dry season that lies ahead; they will die when dry season begins due to the lack of energy. Juveniles that are born in the last third of the wet season take their time maturing and prepare themselves for the dry season. These last juveniles do not reproduce, instead, they allocate all their resources to energy storage to be able to survive the dry season and hope to reproduce the following wet season. ==References== nitidulus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of the Central African Republic Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1875 Category:Taxa named by Wilhelm Peters Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius nitidulus"},{"id":"12382204","text":"Hyperolius obscurus is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is endemic to south-central Tanzania and occurs in the Udzungwa Mountains and south to Njombe in the Southern Highlands. Male Hyperolius pseudargus greatly resemble Hyperolius argus but have less webbing between the toes and the male advertisement call is different. The vernacular name refers to Mette Westergaard, Danish biologist who collected the holotype and is the junior describer of this species. ==Description== Males measure in snout‚Äìvent length. The body and head are broad and flat. The eyes are not very protruding. Webbing between the toes is reduced. The dorsum is green with narrow yellow canthal and dorsolateral stripes, although these may sometimes be indistinct; small yellow dots are usually present. The upper eyelid is yellow or slightly reddish. The ventrum is yellow. The toes and fingers are yellow-green. Males have a large vocal sac that is bluish when calling, yellow green otherwise. The male advertisement call is a fast series of very loud, harsh clicks, emitted in a somewhat accelerating rhythm. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius pseudargus inhabits open farmland, heavily degraded former forests (farm bush), and montane grasslands at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place in small pools and males call from sedges near water and from floating vegetation. This species is common. Although its range is small, it is adaptable and is not facing significant threats.

It is found throughout diverse environments in eastern and southern Africa. It is a very common frog. Its natural habitats are open savanna, bush land and grassland. Breeding takes place in shallow pans, vleis, open swamps, and dams with floating vegetation such as water lilies. Hyperolius pusillus can resemble members of the larger Hyperolius argus species, which is also native to eastern and southern Africa. ==Distribution and populations== Hyperolius pusillus is found in both eastern and southern Africa. Key populations are found in southern Kenya, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. There are also populations in northern Malawi and Botswana. The species may also extend into the far west of Kenya and portions of Uganda. Hyperolius pusillus is also found in Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Tanzania. Different populations display different coloration. ==Coloration== The different populations vary in color. They are generally green, with darker specks covering their bodies, and different populations display patterns such as an hourglass shape (found in Kenya). Sexual dimorphism is found in the color of the throat, which is in males is white and in females green. Eyes of both the male and female are gold in color. ==Reproduction== Hyperolius pusillus males call from floating vegetation which is in contrast to Hyperolius viridis which calls from wet grassland. The female lays batches of between 20 and 120 eggs at a time amongst floating plants. Eggs of H. pusillus are light green. Tadpoles are initially green, but become green-brown with black tails as they age. ==Status== Hyperolius pusillus has a wide range and is a common and sometimes abundant species. The population trend is unknown but this frog faces no particular threats and seems an adaptable species, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being of \\"least concern\\". ==Gallery== thumb Image:Waterlily_Reed_Frog_on_hand_26_08_2010.JPGAdult frog on human hand Image:Waterlily_Reed_Frog_plants_Ilanda_26_08_2010.JPGAmongst vegetation Image:Water-lilly_Reedfrog2_top_27_11_2010.JPGOn a tree leaf ==References== pusillus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Botswana Category:Amphibians of Eswatini Category:Amphibians of Kenya Category:Amphibians of Malawi Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Somalia Category:Amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Amphibians described in 1862 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius pusillus"},{"id":"12382294","text":"Hyperolius pustulifer is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is found in the Mulanje Massif in southern Malawi and the Namuli Massif in adjacent Mozambique. Records from Tanzania refers to other species. Males of this species have characteristic small spines during the breeding season. Its common names are spiny-throated reed frog, spiny reed frog, and Mulanje reed frog. ==Taxonomy== Hyperolius spinigularis was described in 1971 based on the type series collected in Malawi, although it was already then noted that \\"a rather similar frog\\" had been collected in Tanzania. Subsequent research established a broad distribution in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique, although there were doubts whether all populations represented just a single species. Molecular genetic analyses published in 2015 confirmed that the Tanzanian populations represented species different from H. spinigularis and resulted in restricting this species to Malawi and Mozambique. The new species, previously confused with H. spinigularis, are Hyperolius burgessi, Hyperolius davenporti, and Hyperolius ukwiva. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. In addition to sexual dimorphism in size, males can be distinguished during the breeding season by the presence of prominent black asperities (spines) that cover the throat, mentum, abdomen, and undersurfaces of the hind limbs. The head is broad and has protruding eyes; the pupil is horizontally elliptic. All females and most males are pale apple-green and dorsally covered with minute brown chromatophores that under certain light conditions can almost mask the ground colouration. The ventrum is a pale translucent blue- green, becoming silvery white over the abdomen and an opaque blue-green on the gular disc. The hands and feet are pale yellow. However, a small fraction of males have red-brown ground coloration on both the dorsum and ventrum, with the extremities of the limbs being pale red. Also the pale cream or white dorsal patterning is variable but unrelated to sex. A white cantho-dorso- lateral band is the most common type, while some individuals have only an irregular and often broken dorso-lateral band, as well as a sub-triangular frontal patch. Newly metamorphosed froglets measure SVL. ==Ecology and behaviour== The breeding season is short, from late December to mid March, during the last rains. Males appear on the breeding sites before females. Vocalization were not observed in the natural habitat, even though captive males were occasionally observed to vocalize. The eggs are deposited on leaves above water. One female was observed to return to her eggs and to eject watery fluid over the egg mass from her vent. Hibernation has been observed in captive specimens. Prior to hibernation, frogs lose interest on food and become less active, before finally concealing themselves among the roots of grasses near the waterline. They position themselves head uppermost, often with the hind parts touching the water or even partly submerged. This behaviour has not been observed in the field, but its timing in captive specimens coincides with the disappearance of frogs from their breeding sites in the wild. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius spinigularis occurs in forest and dambo habitats at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place in seasonal and permanent pools. The species is relatively common in Malawi; its abundance in Mozambique is unknown. It is affected by large-scale habitat loss caused by deforestation and agricultural expansion, including the use of fire for habitat conversion. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as \\"Vulnerable\\". ==References== spinigularis Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Malawi Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians described in 1971 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius spinigularis"},{"id":"12382370","text":"Hyperolius steindachneri is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is found in the southern portion of the eastern Zimbabwe uplands and adjacent Mozambique. It is also known as the Swynnerton's reed frog, with the subspecies \\"broadleyi\\" (if recognized) as the Broadley's tree frog or Broadley's forest treefrog. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Hyperolius swynnertoni was described by Vivian Frederick Maynard FitzSimons in 1941, based on material collected from Chirinda Forest near Mount Selinda, Zimbabwe. The forest was largely on farm of Mr C. M. F. Swynnerton, after which the species is named. Hyperolius swynnertoni is part of the Hyperolius viridiflavus superspecies, and it might better be treated as a subspecies rather than a full species. ==Description== Adult males reach and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length; it is among the larger Hyperolius species. The dorsal colour pattern in the type series consists of dark vermiculations on a pale background, or sometimes pale stippling on a dark background. Hyperolius marmoratus broadleyi, which may or may not be synonymous with this species, has a light mid-dorsal band running the whole length of the animal, and a pair of dorso-lateral light bands running from edge of upper eyelid and upper half of eye to base of leg. The latter are laterally bordered by a dark band. The light bands have usually a red line in the centre and are separated by a broad dark band running from canthus rostralis over upper eyelid almost to vent. These patterns are variable even within populations, including the bands curving or breaking into discontinuous lines or spots. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius swynnertoni is associated with emergent vegetation at the margins of swamps, rivers and lakes in savannas, grasslands and forest edges, as well as many human-modified habitats such as cultivated land and gardens. Breeding takes in a variety of aquatic habitats, both temporary and permanent, ranging from very small to very large ponds. The eggs are laid directly into the water. Hyperolius swynnertoni is an extremely abundant and adaptable species that spreads rapidly into recently created waterbodies; there are no significant threats. It presumably occurs in the Gungunyana Forest Reserve. ==References== swynnertoni Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Taxa named by Vivian Frederick Maynard FitzSimons Category:Amphibians described in 1941 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius swynnertoni"},{"id":"12382385","text":"Sylvester and Tweety in Cagey Capers is a 2D platform video game featuring the Looney Tunes characters Sylvester and Tweety. It was released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console in 1994 and was the first video game to star Sylvester and Tweety. == Gameplay == Sylvester has finally caught Tweety; thus ending the first level. Players play as Sylvester the cat and chase after Tweety in each of the levels. Tweety usually stands in one spot, moving only to the next spot when Sylvester draws near, eventually reaching the last possible spot where he is caught. Sylvester has a \\"Tweety scope\\" which moves the camera to Tweety's current location, and Sylvester Jr. will occasionally appear, pointing towards Tweety's location. Enemies such as Granny, Hector the Bulldog and Hippety Hopper will chase after Sylvester, attacking him when near. Sylvester can pick up things such as boxing gloves and bones to defend himself against certain enemies, though they can only be temporarily disabled, not defeated. He can also stack boxes and use pogo sticks to reach platforms that are too high to jump on, as well as an umbrella with which he can use to fall slowly, thus preventing fall damage. Sylvester can also hide from his enemies behind lamps or in barrels. How far the player can get in the game depends on the difficulty setting. If the player puts the difficulty at 11%, he can only do one level. The game needs to be set at 81% difficulty or higher to play all the levels. The player can also gain points by knocking things off the shelves or from bags of catnip, as well as striking at Tweety as he escapes. Sylvester can gain a life for 100,000 points. If Sylvester lose his last life, he has two continues to resume the game. The player also has a set time limit to finish the current level which can be increased by collecting clocks. ==Development== Producer TecMagik was originally going to publish the game themselves, but just before its announced release date of June 1994, they sold the game to Time Warner Interactive. Time Warner then made several adjustments to the game, chiefly to make it easier, and released it in August. ==Reception== Italian magazine Computer+Videogiochi gave the game 77.https://archive.org/details/computer-videogiochi-42/page/n103 == See also == * List of Looney Tunes video games ==References External links == * Category:1994 video games Category:Platform games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:Cancelled Game Gear games Category:Cancelled Master System games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games based on Looney Tunes Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Sylvester and Tweety in Cagey Capers"},{"id":"12382391","text":"Hyperolius sylvaticus is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae. It is found in southern Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and western Cameroon, with a (perhaps apparent) gap in Benin. It is also likely to occur in Liberia. Common name Bobiri reed frog has been coined for this species (this name could also refer to Hyperolius bobirensis). ==Taxonomy== Hyperolius sylvaticus was described by Danish herpetologist in 1967, using material from the Bobiri Forest Reserve (Ghana) as the types. He also described two subspecies, Hyperolius sylvaticus ivorensis from Ivory Coast and Hyperolius sylvaticus nigeriensis from Nigeria and Cameroon, in addition to the nominotypical subspecies. ==Description== Hyperolius sylvaticus is a small-sized member of its genus, with males measuring and females in snout‚Äìvent length. Males have a tiny, round gular flap. The pupil is horizontal. There are two colour phases. All juveniles and many mature males display phase \\"J\\", which is typically brownish to green and has a dorsal hourglass pattern. All females, and some males, develop into phase \\"F\\" prior to the first breeding season. This phase is often colorful and variable. Body size and dorsal patterning differs between the subspecies. The nominotypical subspecies has coherent dorsal hourglass pattern (phase J) and undelimited, light dorsolateral stripe (phase F). In Hyperolius s. ivorensis and Hyperolius s. nigeriensis the hourglass pattern is broken mid-dorsally. In addition, Hyperolius s. nigeriensis are larger and have a dark, well delimited area behind eye (phase J) and a broad, dark-delimited dorsolateral stripe (phase F). Male advertisement call is a series of brief metallic \\"clicks\\"; it is not known whether there are differences among the subspecies. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius sylvaticus occurs in lowland moist forests as well as in degraded forests and bush land. Breeding takes place in temporary forest ponds. The eggs are placed on leaves above water; the tadpoles fall into the water after hatching. Hyperolius sylvaticus is an abundant species. It is somewhat adaptable, but does not tolerate complete opening up of its habitat. This makes is vulnerable to habitat change from agricultural expansion and increasing human settlements. It occurs in the Bobiri Forest Reserve and Kakum National Park in Ghana, Ta√Ø National Park in Ivory Coast, and Korup National Park in Cameroon, presumably in other protected areas too. ==References== sylvaticus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Arne Schi√∏tz Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius sylvaticus"},{"id":"12382393","text":"Hyperolius tanneri is a species of frogs in the family Hyperoliidae. It is endemic to the West Usambara Mountains in northeastern Tanzania. Common name Tanner's reed frog has been coined for this species. ==Etymology== The specific name tanneri honours John and Lucie Tanner, owners of a tea estate in Mazumbai (the type locality) and noted for welcoming visiting zoologist. In this case, the plural form tannerorum would have been technically correct, and in his later work , the scientist who described the species in 1982, amended the spelling accordingly. However, this is considered \\"unjustified emendation\\", and the correct name of the species follows the original spelling. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. In addition to sexual size dimorphism, males differ from females by having rather large, smooth gular flap. The dorsum is green and has light canthal and dorsolateral stripes. The fingers and toes are yellow, and the throat and ventrum are blue-green. Hyperolius tanneri resembles Hyperolius spinigularis, but lacks the black spines on the throat and ventrum of the latter. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are undisturbed montane forests. It is only known from two sites, one near the Mazumbai Forest Reserve at above sea level, and the other one in the Shume-Magambo Forest Reserve at asl. The only known breeding site is a small forest swamp that is bordering a small stream in Mazumbai (suitable swamp also exists in Shume-Magambo). This species is believed to be decreasing because of habitat loss, caused by agricultural expansion, logging and expanding human settlements. While it occurs in or near protected areas, additional habitat protection would be needed. Because the species is only known from two sites in one location suffering from habitat loss, it has been assessed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ==References== tanneri Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Endemic fauna of Tanzania Category:Amphibians described in 1982 Category:Taxa named by Arne Schi√∏tz Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyperolius tanneri"},{"id":"12382400","text":"Hyperolius thomensis is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae. It is endemic to the island of S√£o Tom√© in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Common name Sao Tome giant treefrog has been coined for it. It is the largest Hyperolius species. ==Taxonomy and systematics== The species was named by Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1886. It is the type species of the genus Nesionixalus Perret, 1976. Its sister taxon Hyperolius molleri has also been placed in Nesionixalus. Together, these two species form a clade, but its recognition as a genus would render rest of Hyperolius paraphyletic. The two species can form hybrids. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is uniform brown or green to blue-green. The venter is marbled in white, orange and black. The ventral surfaces of the limbs are richly marbled in orange and black. Males have their dorsum densely beset with small spines. The pupil is horizontal. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius thomensis inhabits primary rainforests at altitudes above . Previous reports from towns are considered questionable. Breeding takes place in tree holes where their tadpoles develop, and the same hole can be utilized by many individuals. The threats to this species are poorly known, but it is probably impacted by habitat loss caused by agriculture, livestock, wood extraction, and human settlements.

Its range is an area where forests are severely degraded, but it does not occur outside forests. It is closely associated with very fast-flowing streams and waterfalls. Specifically, it has been encountered on or near vertical cliffs in forest, in gullies in open forest, and in trees and on vegetation close to streams. Breeding takes place in streams. The eggs are deposited on leaves above water. Hyperolius torrentis is uncommon and only known from few locations; Hillers and colleagues, however, reported it as abundant at some Ghanaian sites, but could not find it in Togo.

It is only known from its type locality, Cu√≠lo, along the Luita River in northern Angola, although it is likely to occur in adjacent Democratic Republic of the Congo. Additional specimens from the Cangandala National Park have been provisionally assigned to this species. The specific name vilhenai honours Ernesto Jardim de Vilhena, a Portuguese naval officer, politician, and businessman. Common names Luita River reed frog and Vilhena's reed frog have been proposed for this frog. ==Description== The holotype, an adult male, measures in snout‚Äìvent length. It has a squat body and a large, broad head. The snout is rounded. Colouration is pale green. A dark band runs from tip of snout to upper eyelid. The specimen has neither gular flap not gular sac. It is the only specimen assigned to this species with confidence. ==Habitat and conservation== Hyperolius vilhenai was apparently found in gallery forest in the humid savanna zone.

Some evidence suggests that west African frogs may change sex from female to male after having successfully bred. Animals that switch sex as adults are known as sequential hermaphrodites because they have the gonads of either sex but at different periods of their lives. This contrasts with animals which are \\"simultaneous hermaphrodites\\" which have both gonads at the same point. However, this sequential hermaphrodotism in reed frogs has only been noted once and in a captive colony; it is not generally accepted by scientists that this process occurs in amphibians.

It is so similar to Hyperolius fusciventris that it has likely been overlooked elsewhere in West Africa. Common name Wermuth's reed frog has been coined for this species. ==Taxonomy== Taxonomic status of this species described by Belgian herpetologist Raymond Laurent in 1961 is unsettled. The Amphibian Species of the World treats Hyperolius wermuthi as a valid species but notes that Hyperolius soror is likely its synonym. The AmphibiaWeb, however, considers Hyperolius soror a nomen dubium, even though it acknowledges that Hyperolius soror might be the correct name Hyperolius wermuthi. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. There are two distinct colour phases, \\"J\\" and \\"F\\", although also intermediate forms exist. Juveniles and many mature males have phase J whereas mature females and some mature males have phase F. Phase J individuals are brownish to green with paired light dorsolateral lines or an hourglass pattern. Phase F is often colorful and variable and show a red canthal stripe that is characteristic to this species. The ventrum is transparent bluish green. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are primary forests at elevations up to above sea level.

First announced by Valdez in a guest appearance on The Buzz, the series was promoted as \\"the most controversial and boldest TV series.\\" It aired on ABS-CBN's Primetime Bida slot at 6 PM. Margarita is a story of young woman who, in her desire to give her family the best life she can imagine, ends up working as a showgirl. She gets paid by giving entertainment and enticing the fantasies of many men. But deep inside, Margarita dreams of a better life and longs for happiness and true love. The series ended with an incomplete storyline on September 21, 2007, having lasted less than two months on the air. The series is streaming online on YouTube. ==Plot== Margarita (Wendy Valdez) is a tough woman who, at a young age, experienced several difficulties in life. She was just a little girl when her father (Dick Israel) left their mother (Rio Locsin) for another woman (Elizabeth Oropesa). As the eldest in the family, Margarita shouldered the responsibility of being the breadwinner. She only has her childhood friend, Rodrigo (Bruce Quebral) by her side as she struggles through life's difficulties. Along the way, Margarita will meet Bernard (Diether Ocampo), a rich and influential man who will eventually fall in love with her. Margarita will later find herself torn not only between these two men, but also between her dream of happiness and her desire of revenge. ==Cast== Main cast *Wendy Valdez as Margarita Trinidad - a loving daughter and a kind older sister.

It might occur more broadly, and presumably occurs in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Nigeria, and Mauritania. ==Description== Kassina cassinoides, measuring in snout‚Äìvent length, is a large member of the genus Kassina. The dorsum is silver-gray to yellow and has six longitudinal stripes, of which the two median ones are close together, often coming together. The toes are slightly webbed and have small disks. The fingers have no webbing Kassina cassinoides is not easy to tell apart from Kassina senegalensis. The male advertisement call is similar to other Kassina, but it differs from the calls of the sympatric K. senegalensis and K. fusca by being deeper (it has the lowest- pitched call of its genus) and more sonorous. The tadpoles are slender and measure upon hatching and about at the time of metamorphosis. ==Habitat and conservation== Kassina cassinoides inhabit dry and wooded savannas and gallery forests. Breeding occurs in the rainy season and takes place in temporary water, preferably in large, well-vegetated pools. Males call from the ground or from elevated sites in the vegetation. The species is nocturnal. Kassina cassinoides is difficult to find, so it might be more common than it appears to be. It is reasonably common in the Como√© National Park (Ivory Coast).

It is found in southern Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, western Ivory Coast (the Mount Nimba area, possibly wider), and at least tentatively, southern Ghana. Kassina arboricola was for a period treated as a subspecies Kassina cochranae arboricola, but it is now considered a valid species. ==Etymology== The specific name cochranae honours Doris Mable Cochran, an American herpetologist. ==Description== Kassina cochranae are medium-sized, sturdy frogs. The legs and arms are short. There are 35‚Äì77 large spots on flanks and dorsum. The belly is white to brown and sometimes has scattered, small punctuations (but never with large spots). There are zero to two occipital spots. Males typically have dark throat that sometimes has black spots. ==Habitat and conservation== Kassina cochranae is an arboreal, forest- dwelling species, including secondary forests. There are also records from moist and montane savanna as well as montane grassland. It seems to be able persist in habitat fragments and gallery forests. Reproduction is presumed to take place in temporary and permanent bodies of water, preferably large, well- vegetated pools, as with other Kassina species. The males call from branches of bushes and trees 2‚Äì4 metres above the ground. Although typically a forest species, they often call on more exposed sites at the edges of ponds or beside roads. Kassina cochranae is locally abundant. It is locally threatened by habitat loss (severe deforestation). ==References== cochranae Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1941 Category:Taxa named by Arthur Loveridge Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Kassina cochranae"},{"id":"12382487","text":"Kassina fusca is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae. Its common name is brown running frog or pale running frog. It is found in the West African savanna zone in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, and Nigeria. It probably occurs in Guinea-Bissau, although there are no records from there. ==Description== Kassina fusca is a terrestrial frogs that moves by walking rather than jumping. They are small frogs measuring in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is brown with scattered small darker spots (sometimes indistinct) and a larger, irregular, X-shaped spot in the shoulder region. There are small discs on the fingers. ==Association with ants== Kassina fusca have been found in nests of pomerine ants Paltothyreus tarsatus and Megaponera analis. These ants are large (up to 18 and 25 mm in body length, respectively) and have powerful mandibles, poison glands, and stings, and would be able to kill the frog. Yet experiments showed that they were never seriously attacked by Paltothyreus tarsatus. This is possible because of chemical components of the frogs' skin, offering the frog a degree of \\"chemical camouflage\\". The benefit of this association is that the ant nests provide Kassina fusca hiding places that remain moist during the dry season; such places are in short supply in the savanna and tend to be occupied by ants. Another species showing a similar association is Phrynomantis microps. ==Habitat and conservation== Kassina fusca occurs in dry savanna and savanna woodlands. Breeding takes in temporary water, preferably large, well- vegetated, shallow pools. It is very common where it has been found, but the known distribution is patchy; it is often overlooked. It is believed to be an adaptable species that is not facing significant threats. It occurs in some protected areas, including the Como√© National Park. ==References== Category:Kassina Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Arne Schi√∏tz Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Kassina fusca"},{"id":"12382492","text":"Kassina kuvangensis is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

The dorsum is dark with indistinct darker spots, or uniformly dark. The ventrum is light, sometimes having indications of dark reticulation. The concealed parts of legs are marbled in red and grey. The gular disc is round rather than strap-like. The finger and the toe tips are not dilated. The males call in very large numbers from flooded grasslands.

They are silvery greyish-brown with dark brown to black spots, and derive their name from bright red coloring on the ventral side of their hind legs. Adult body length is typically 6 to 7.5 centimeters. These frogs have vertical pupils. Common names include red-legged running frog, brown-spotted tree frog, red-legged Kassina, red-legged pan frog, spotted running frog, tiger leg running frog, and vlei frog. ==Habitat== Phlyctimantis maculatus is endemic to the tropical and sub-tropical areas of Africa's east coast (Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Swaziland).

It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Behavior== Red-legged running frogs are nocturnal, and therefore somewhat elusive to humans‚Äîpreferring to burrow under loose soil or hide in dense vegetation during the day. At night they take to climbing trees and tall shrubs to feed mainly on a diet of insects and insect larvae. They are characterized by preferring a distinctive \\"walking\\" with the back legs instead of the more traditional frog-hopping. ==As pets== Because they are nocturnal and do require a significantly moist environment (80% relative humidity is recommended), they are not as common a pet as some other species of frog. However, being rather hardy and robust, they do survive well under appropriate basic conditions. A source of UV light is not required, and ambient temperature of 72 to 77 ¬∞F (22 to 25 ¬∞C) is sufficient. Both a thermometer and hygrometer should be present. Moss or coconut fiber should be used as substrate for burrowing, with both wet and dry ground areas within the enclosure. A basin or bowl of clean, fresh water is necessary. Misting of fresh water should occur twice a day at the wet end of the tank. Plants (real or artificial) should be present for climbing. A diet of live crickets, mealworms, or flies is appropriate, and size of food should be limited to the width of the space between the frog's eyes. ==References== Category:Kassina Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Kenya Category:Amphibians of Malawi Category:Amphibians of South Africa Category:Vertebrates of Eswatini Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Taxa named by Auguste Dum√©ril Category:Amphibians described in 1853 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Phlyctimantis maculatus"},{"id":"12382506","text":"Kassina maculifer is a species of frog in the family Hyperoliidae.

It is endemic to Angola. It is closely related to the West Cameroon forest tree frog (Leptopelis nordequatorialis, formerly Leptopelis anchietae nordequatorialis) and the Garamba forest tree frog (Leptopelis oryi). ==Description== Anchieta's tree frog has a brown back and legs. The legs are spotted with white spots, and the sides of its head and body are a darker brown. Male members of the species have pectoral glands; the West Cameroon forest tree frog and other members of the genus Leptopelis share this characteristic. The function of the pectoral glands is unknown, but they are made of glandules like the glandules in nuptial pads that appear on many species of amphibians. Thus, scientists speculate that the pectoral glands play a role in the frogs' mating process. ==Etymology== The frog was named after Jos√© Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta, a nineteenth-century Portuguese naturalist who collected many biological specimens in Angola and Mozambique, by Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage, a Portuguese zoologist who corresponded with Anchieta. Anchieta's original specimen of the frog was destroyed in a 1978 fire. ==Ecology== There are few records of the population range or behaviors of Anchieta's tree frog. Scientists believe that the frog is most prevalent at medium elevations of about 1000 m. Other species of Leptopelis bury their eggs in mud nests near water, so scientists suspect Anchieta's tree frog may do so as well. ==References== anchietae Category:Endemic fauna of Angola Category:Amphibians of Angola Category:Amphibians described in 1873 Category:Taxa named by Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Anchieta's tree frog"},{"id":"12382546","text":"Leptopelis argenteus, also known as the silvery tree frog or triad tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in coastal Kenya and Tanzania and south to northern Mozambique, southern Malawi, and eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. ==Taxonomy== This species was described by Georg Johann Pfeffer in 1893 based on a specimen collected south of Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Current accounts differ in its delimitation and distribution; the synonyms and distribution in this article follow the Amphibian Species of the World (ASW). However, the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group (2016) only reports it from Tanzania, possibly extending into Mozambique. The AmphibiaWeb gives a distribution similar to that in ASW, but recognizes Leptopelis broadleyi as a valid species. Furthermore, Leptopelis concolor is perhaps subspecies of Leptopelis argenteus. ==Description== Depending on source, males measure in snout‚Äìvent length (SVL), or males and females can be as large as SVL, respectively. It resembles Leptopelis concolor morphologically but differs has two dark dorsolateral stripes and a more diffuse canthal and lateral line. Webbing in the feet is reduced. There is usually a dark triangle between the eyes. ==Habitat and conservation== According to the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, this species inhabits savanna woodland with many trees and bushes. It can survive in altered habitats, provided that good vegetation cover remains. Males call high up in bushes and grasses, also quite far from water. The eggs are laid in a nest buried in mud near water. Leptopelis argenteus is a common and adaptable species that is not facing any significant threats.

However, acoustic (male calls) and genetic data support their treatment as separate species. In fact, the large variation of call characteristics in L. aubryi could indicate that the current delimitation of this species might hide a complex of cryptic species. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is brown and has an occipital triangle and rounded lateral spots. There are small, dark points present on the flanks, especially in the groin, and often small, white spots on the back and limbs. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis aubryi is an arboreal species living in a range of habitats: secondary forests, swamp forests, and also degraded habitats (farm bush) outside forests. The eggs are laid in a nest, buried in mud near swamps and pools where the tadpoles later develop. Leptopelis aubryi is an adaptable and reasonably common species.

The Z1000A1 was an upgraded model to replace the 1976 Kawasaki KZ900 (Z900), which in turn replaced the Z1 launched in 1972 in the Z series. It has an inline-four cylinder engine and a 5-speed transmission, in a 'one down and four up' configuration. Producing about 90 hp, it was one of the fastest production motorcycles of the era. The police model continued in production until 2005. == Model differences == Some of the significant differences between the KZ900 and the KZ1000 include that the 1000 has a heavier crankshaft for less engine vibration, smoother acceleration and a larger displacement as a result of increasing the cylinder bore from 66mm to 70mm. The 1000 received a rear disc brake. There were various configurations of specifications and assembly, such as having the choice between chain-drive and shaft-drive. The cruiser version LTD was assembled in Nebraska and sold in the United States and Canada. Kawasaki swapped the traditional 4-4 exhaust (available on Z1 and KZ900) for the 4-2 Jardine exhaust (which came standard on the KZ900B) on the LTD and quiet and restrictive muffler on the 1000 A1 and A2 as shown in the top photo in this article. The KZ1000 came with either a chain drive or shaft drive in 1979 and 1980 named ST and SHAFT, KZ1000E1 and E2. The frame on the KZ1000 was a conventional featherbed (duplex cradle) design, but was not significantly changed in over 30 years of production in terms of basic geometry. There were changes to frame construction with the use of thicker frame tubes in the MkII models (1979/80) to improve frame rigidity. The 1980 Kawasaki Z1000H was the first mass-produced fuel-injected motorcycle in the world an also Kawasaki's first fuel injected motorcycle. It was based on the KZ1000A3/A4 Mk.II frame and body work, with a unique black/gold/white colour scheme and gold mag wheels . There were only 1000 examples of the Z1000H made for the global market. The Z1000H was manufactured for 3 months only, during March/April/May of 1980 and was a test-bed for the incoming new 1981 fuel-injected model, the GPz1100B1. In the US market, the Z1000G \\"Z-1 Classic\\", based on the LTD frame and body work, also featured the same fuel injection system used on the Z1000H. The 1981 Kawasaki Z1000J debuted with Kawasaki's new \\"J\\" motor with displacement down to the drop in displacement from 1015cc to 998cc was in order to comply with the new rule for superbike racing-which stipulated a maximum of 1000cc.. For the 1982 model year, Kawasaki introduced the KZ1000R1 Eddie Lawson Replica (ELR); based on the KZ1000J2. The 1983 model was designated KZ1000R2 with cams and a cylinder head from the 1982 GPz1100B2, boosted power from 102 to 104 at 8500 rpm. The bike had a limited run of 750, and was named after the Eddie Lawson 1981-1982 Superbike. It had a claimed rear wheel HP @ 8,500rpm and dry. Aside from the 1982-2005 KZ1000P Police motorcycle, the model was discontinued in 1984, in favor of Kawasaki's liquid- cooled bike, the Ninja GPZ900R. == Wheels and tyres == The Kz1000P (police) has 18 inch cast wheels with Dunlop run-flat tires. The front tire is size MN90-18, and the back tire is size MR90-18. == Accessories == The KZ1000 had optional dealer installed Windjammer brand fairing, saddle bags, sissy bar and highway bars. Highway bars were also used for comfort on long trips and sometimes held additional lighting. == Z1000 Z1-R == The Kawasaki Z1000 Z1-R is a Japanese motorcycle from Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Styling characteristics are the front fairing, black engine finish, the 4-into-1 factory exhaust system and cast wheels.  History  Following the success of the original Z1000, Kawasaki developed the \\"Z1-R\\" as a new top model that would set standards in design and performance. This emphasized motorcycle with a fixed half-shell fairing was only available with a metallic silver-blue paint. Although the design was well received from the potential buyers, sales remained unsatisfactory after tests in motorcycle magazines. They criticized the poor engine performance and the small fuel tank. Readers of the German Motorrad magazine selected the Z1-R as their Motorcycle of the Year for 1977.  Z1R-TC  The Z1-R was introduced for the 1978 model year, the same year as the Yamaha XS11, the Suzuki GS1000, and the Honda CBX. Magazine tests showed all three competing bikes to be quicker in the [quarter mile] performance test. In response, the company quickly introduced the semi- production, turbocharged Z1R-TC. == Police use == The KZ1000C and KZ1000P were police sub-models. The KZ1000C was based on the 1977-1980 KZ1000 (KZ1000 C1-C4 from 1978-1981) while the KZ1000P (KZ1000P1-P24 from 1982-2005) was based on the \\"J\\" model. They had a number of technical problems, including electromagnetic interference between some radios that caused problems for the ignition system. In addition, the combined set of equipment mounted at the rear (and particularly the placement of the radio on the rear rack) caused high-speed handling difficulties.. That said, with a relatively light weight, comfortable seat, good cornering clearance and powerful engine, it remained so popular for the police market that it remained in production until 2005. ==Motorsport== Moriwaki Kawasaki Z1000 ridden by Wayne Gardner in the 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race The Z1000 was successfully raced in European, Australian, American and British Superbike racing. A KZ1000 ridden by Reg Pridmore won the AMA Superbike Championship in 1977 and 1978. Pops Yoshimura first began to make his reputation in the mid-1970s by fielding fast, reliable Kawasaki KZ1000s in the AMA Superbike championships. Kawasaki Z1000s tuned by Mamoru Moriwaki were successfully raced in the Australian Superbike championships in the late 1970s by New Zealander Graeme Crosby. John Cowie riding a Z1000 for the Pecket & McNab team, won the 1978 British ACU Formula One championship for production bikes. Freddie Spencer rode a KZ1000 during the 1979 AMA Superbike Championship, winning two races and finishing third in the final championship points standings. Wayne Gardner and co-rider John Pace qualified their Moriwaki-Kawasaki Z1000 on pole position at the prestigious 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams. Also in 1981, Eddie Lawson won the AMA Superbike Championship for Kawasaki on a factory-backed KZ1000S1. == Film and TV appearances == The KZ1000C was ridden by California Highway Patrol officers Ponch and Jon of the 1977‚Äì1984 TV show CHiPs. It was also in the anime television series Great Teacher Onizuka, and ridden by Keanu Reeves in the film Chain Reaction. Fourteen of the motorcycles in Mad Max (1979) were Z1000s. The bikes were donated by a local Kawasaki dealer and modified in appearance by Melbourne business La Parisienne; one as a police bike ridden by 'The Goose', and thirteen for members of the Toecutter's gang, played by a real motorcycle club called the Vigilantes. The KZ1000P appeared in the 1991 movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. ==NotesReferences== * KZ1000 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1976 ","title":"Kawasaki Kz1000"},{"id":"12382577","text":"Leptopelis broadleyi (Broadley's forest tree frog) is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae of uncertain status. The Amphibian Species of the World, the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, and the African Amphibians do not recognize it, but instead consider it synonym with Leptopelis argenteus. (ASW expresses some hesitation though.) However, the AmphibiaWeb recognizes it as a valid species. ==Distribution== Leptopelis broadleyi is found in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. ==Habitat and conservation== This species occurs in forest-savanna mosaic and along forested streams through savanna. Leptopelis broadleyi was assessed in 2004 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of \\"Least Concern\\"; in the 2016 assessment, it was brought into synonymy with Leptopelis argenteus. ==References== broadleyi Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Malawi Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Amphibians described in 1985 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Broadley's forest tree frog"},{"id":"12382581","text":"The savannah forest tree frog or ground tree frog, Leptopelis bufonides, is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It occurs in West and Middle Africa. The relationship of this species with Leptopelis bocagei is not fully settled. ==Distribution== Leptopelis bufonides is known from Senegal, the Gambia, Burkina Faso, northern Ghana, Togo, northern Benin, northern Nigeria, northern Cameroon, and southern Chad. Its range may extend to several other African countries (e.g., Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory Coast and Niger), although specimens have not been confirmed elsewhere. ==Description== Leptopelis bufonides is a small, toad-like frog, with males measuring and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is brown and shows a darker, backward-pointing, triangle-like pattern on the head, and an 'n' shaped pattern combined with a few mid-dorsal spots. Skin is warty. The legs are short, and the toes have only rudiments of webbing. The male advertisement call is a \\"clack\\" that is deeper and more atonal than the calls of other West African Leptopelis. ==Habitat and conservation== This species lives in dry open savanna and grassland. It is probably fossorial, spending large parts of the year underground. Reproduction takes place in flooded meadows. Males call from the ground, concealed in low grass or shallow water. The eggs are laid in a burrow in loamy soil. Leptopelis bufonides appears to be a very uncommon species that is known only from few records across its vast mapped range. It is not known to what degree this is because of the paucity of herpetological surveys in the area, its secretive habits, or genuinely patchy distribution. It is unlikely to face any major threats. ==References== Bufonides Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Vertebrates of Chad Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Arne Schi√∏tz Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Savannah forest tree frog"},{"id":"12382583","text":"Leptopelis calcaratus is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in southeastern Nigeria, Cameroon, the southwestern Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea (including the island of Bioko), Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Common name Efulen forest treefrog has been coined for it (part of the type series originated from Efulan). ==Taxonomy== Leptopelis calcaratus was described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1906 based on a specimen collected from \\"Efulen\\" in Cameroon (holotype), with additional specimens from \\"Cape St. John and the Rio Benito District\\" in Equatorial Guinea; he had previously identified the latter as Leptopelis rufus. Subspecies Leptopelis calcaratus meridionalis from south of the Congo River was described by Raymond Laurent in 1973. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. This species has a characteristic white spur on the heel. The dorsum is greyish with a dark, backward-pointing triangle on the head, and a broad dark dorsal band that is often split up into bars or lateral spots. There is also often a white spot under the eye. The canthus rostralis is angular. Webbing in the feet is extensive. L. c. meridionalis differs from the nominate subspecies by the spur on the heel being less developed, by having more extensive webbing, and by other small morphological differences. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis calcaratus is an arboreal frog found in lowland and montane rainforests at elevations from near sea level to above sea level, possibly higher. It does not survive in secondary habitats. If similar to other species of Leptopelis, it would lay eggs in a nest on the ground near water. It is a common species but its habitat is affected by habitat loss caused by agricultural expansion, logging, and human settlements. It occurs in a number of protected areas, including the Korup National Park (Cameroon), Monte Al√©n National Park (Equatorial Guinea), and Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (Central African Republic). ==References== calcaratus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of the Central African Republic Category:Amphibians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians of Equatorial Guinea Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Fauna of Nigeria Category:Amphibians of the Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians described in 1906 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptopelis calcaratus"},{"id":"12382586","text":"The 1965‚Äì66 Honduran Liga Nacional season was the inaugural edition of the Honduran Liga Nacional.

It is endemic to Gabon and only known from the area its type locality near the Barrage de Tchimb√©l√© in the central Monts de Cristal (Crystal Mountains). Only one specimen was known until five specimens were captured in the Crystal Mountains National Park in 2009. It is probable that this species is endemic to the Monts de Cristal and that its range extends into Equatorial Guinea. ==Description== The only known specimen (holotype) is an adult female measuring in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is robust. The snout is truncate in dorsal view and rounded laterally. No tympanum is present. Skin is granular throughout. All fingers and toes bear discs, have lateral fringes, and are webbed (toes have more webbing than fingers). Colouration is brilliantly green dorsally and creamy white ventrally. There are few diffused tan‚Äìdark brown markings on the back, outer extremities, and around the cloacal region. The outer parts of the limbs are whitish. The flanks have white spots in the lower parts. The iris is bronze and has a black ring around it. ==Habitat and conservation== The holotype was collected in an altered but good standing forest at above sea level, away from open water sources. The specimen was active during the night at above the ground. The type locality falls within the Crystal Mountains National Park. There are no known threats to this species. Two of the five specimens captured in 2009 tested positive for the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the pathogen causing chytridiomycosis. ==References== crystallinoron Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Endemic fauna of Gabon Category:Amphibians described in 2005 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptopelis crystallinoron"},{"id":"12382600","text":"The Angola forest tree frog, Leptopelis cynnamomeus, is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae found in an area from southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northwestern Zambia to central Angola.

It is known from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania, on both sides of Lake Tanganyika, and it is likely to occur in Burundi, in between the two know areas of distribution. ==Distribution and taxonomy== Leptopelis fiziensis was first described as a subspecies of Leptopelis modestus, based on specimens from the Fizi Territory in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later on it has also been recorded in western Tanzania. However, recent molecular work suggests that its closest relative is Leptopelis karissimbensis rather than Leptopelis modestus. Moreover, some of the Tanzanian records might refer to another species. ==Description== Adult males measure and females, based on a single specimen, in snout‚Äìvent length. The tympanum is small. Digital discs are large. The dorsum is red-brown to brown, with darker patterning and tiny light specks. The ventrum is greyish while the femurs are reddish. The iris is golden. Males have a greyish throat. The male advertisement call is a series of two or three clacks/pulses sounding like \\"quack-quack\\". ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis fiziensis have been found in transitional forest in the forest-savanna mosaic, near a stream at the edge of montane forest, and dense low bush at the edge of a clearing in dry forest. There is also a record from riverine forest within pristine miombo woodland, but this might refer to another species. They are typically found on shrubs and trees some above the ground. The altitudinal range is above sea level. Threats to this species are unknown. It occurs in the Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. ==References== fiziensis Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Amphibians described in 1973 Category:Taxa named by Raymond Laurent Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptopelis fiziensis"},{"id":"12382612","text":"Leptopelis flavomaculatus is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in the lowlands eastern and southern Africa, from Mozambique north of the Save River and Zimbabwe to Malawi, eastern Tanzania (including the island of Zanzibar), and coastal Kenya. Its common names are yellow-spotted tree frog, brown-backed tree frog, brown forest treefrog, and Johnston's treefrog. ==Taxonomy== Leptopelis flavomaculatus was described by Albert G√ºnther in 1864, based on a specimen that he identified as an adult female Hyperolius, but which actually is a juvenile Leptopelis. Its closest relative is Leptopelis christyi. Leptopelis lebeaui might be conspecific with L. flavomaculatus. Leptopelis barbouri The type of Leptopelis barbouri Ahl, 1929 (common name: Barbour's forest treefrog) was in 2014 shown to be conspecific with Leptopelis flavomaculatus, bringing the former into synonymy with the latter. Arthur Loveridge had considered Leptopelis barbouri to be synonym of Leptopelis aubreyi, but in 1975 resurrected it as a valid species. However, in literature between 1975 and 2014, name Leptopelis barbouri has been used for altogether different species that is now known as Leptopelis grandiceps, and which until 2014 was considered a synonym of Leptopelis uluguruensis. In other words, even though Leptopelis barbouri is synonym of Leptopelis flavomaculatus, pre-2014 literature on Leptopelis barbouri actually refers to Leptopelis grandiceps. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is either uniform green with white heels, or brown with a darker, forward-pointing triangle with a blunt apex. There is a dark bar between the eyes and a dark canthal line. Young, green specimens often have yellow spots. Leptopelis flavomaculatus is similar to Leptopelis vermiculatus but lacks the latter's vermiculated dorsum. It is also similar L. christyi but is larger and its dorsal triangle has a more blunt apex. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are lowland and montane evergreen forests, and especially dry forests, at elevations to above sea level. It occurs in both pristine and secondary habitats, often along streams, but does not survive in open habitats outside forest. Males can either call from leaves or branches, often at 3‚Äì4 m above the ground, or from the mouth of burrows in the ground. Assuming that it is similar to other frogs in its genus, the eggs are laid in a nest near water. Leptopelis flavomaculatus is often common in suitable habitats. Habitat loss caused by agricultural expansion, logging, and increasing human settlements is, however, a threat. It occurs in several protected areas. ==References== flavomaculatus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Kenya Category:Amphibians of Malawi Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Amphibians described in 1864 Category:Taxa named by Albert G√ºnther Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptopelis flavomaculatus"},{"id":"12382618","text":"Leptopelis gramineus is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae.

Common names Badditu forest treefrog and Ethiopian burrowing tree frog have been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length; size varies considerably among populations. The dorsal colour is almost always green. Darker markings may be present but only very rarely form a triangle. There is a lateral series of large, dark brown blotches. Skin of the dorsum is rather coarsely granular, sometimes warty. Males have pectoral glands. The tadpoles are eel-shaped, heavily pigmented, and can grow to in length. The male advertisement call is a single, deep \\"clack\\", sometimes preceded by a creaking sound. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis gramineus typically inhabits montane grasslands, sometimes Afro-alpine moorland or even forest margins and montane forests. It can also occur in rural gardens and human settlements. It occurs at elevations between above sea level. It is a fossorial species. Reproduction takes place in pools and small streams, both permanent and temporary. This species is common to abundant at suitable sites. Because of its adaptability, it is not considered being significantly threatened by environmental degradation caused by human settlement and small to large-scale agriculture. Chytrid fungus is common in the area, but its impact on this species is unknown.

Double clacks are also possible. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis kivuensis is associated with forests at elevations of above sea level. It occurs in montane wetlands and forest ecotones. Breeding takes place in seasonally flooded swamp forests. The eggs are buried in nests in the ground. The onset of heavy rains causes the eggs to hatch, and the flooding washes the tadpoles into water.

It is found in the rainforests of Sierra Leone, southern Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast, and southern Ghana. Notice that similar common name \\"big-eyed tree frog\\" is sometimes used for Leptopelis vermiculatus from Tanzania and for Litoria exophthalmia from New Guinea. ==Description== Leptopelis macrotis is a large Leptopelis species: females measure in snout‚Äìvent length, while males are more modest at SVL. The dorsum is smooth and transversely-striped in shades of brown. The tympanum is large. The feet are fully webbed. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are primary rainforests at elevations of above sea level. It lives arboreally along streams; males can often be heard calling from branches near streams some 5‚Äì10 m above the ground. Leptopelis macrotis is a relatively common species. However, because it relies on good (i.e., non-degraded) rainforest, habitat degradation caused by agricultural expansion, logging, and human settlements is a major threat. Mining and river pollution are also potential threats. It occurs in a number of protected areas, including the Gola Forest Reserve (its type locality), Ta√Ø National Park, Kambui Hills Forest Reserve, and Bobiri Forest Reserve.

It is found in southeastern Nigeria, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Common name Niger forest treefrog has been coined for it, perhaps referring to the mouth of the Niger River, its type locality. ==Etymology== The specific name millsoni refers to Mr. Alvan Millson, assistant colonial secretary in Lagos and the collector the two female syntypes. ==Taxonomy== Leptopelis millsoni was described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1895 based on the syntypes from the Niger Delta. Based on call characteristics and morphology, it has been suggested that the West African species Leptopelis macrotis is the same species (synonym) as L. millsoni, or its subspecies. A genetic comparisons between the eastern and the western species revealed clear differences, and also their calls differ in detail, strongly suggesting that they are distinct species. However, as these comparisons did not involve materials from the type locality of L. millsoni (the Niger delta), the question whether this name applies to the West African species (L. macrotis as currently defined) is not resolved. If this were the case, name Leptopelis guineensis would be available for the Central African species (L. millsoni as currently defined). It also remains possible that the Niger Delta species is distinct from both the eastern and the western species. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is brown, with darker transverse bars, or green. The tibia has 4‚Äì5 bars, and the feet are fully webbed. The iris is rusty red. The tympanum is rather large. The male advertisement call consists of single calls and has a \\"peculiar\\" acoustic quality. The call is similar to the call of Leptopelis notatus, and very similar to that of Leptopelis macrotis. However, the similarity of calls was refuted by R√∂del and colleagues. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis millsoni is an arboreal frog found in primary and secondary lowland rainforest, secondary growth, and palm plantations. It is typically found near large, slow-flowing watercourses; the males call from branches close to such streams. It does not survive in open, degraded habitats. If similar to other species of Leptopelis, it would lay eggs in a nest on the ground near water. It is a common species but its habitat is affected by habitat loss caused by agricultural expansion, logging, and human settlements.

Its common names are modest forest treefrog and plain tree frog. ==Distribution and taxonomy== Leptopelis modestus was described in 1898 by Franz Werner, an Austrian zoologist and explorer, based on specimens (syntypes) collected from Cameroon. The reported distribution varies by source, partly depending on whether the stated distribution accounts for recently described species (e.g., Leptopelis mtoewaate, Leptopelis mackayi). According to the Amphibian Species of the World, Leptopelis modestus is only found in southeastern Nigeria and Cameroon. The IUCN Red List (2008) also mentions the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea) and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, but remarks that the latter likely refers to a (then) undescribed species. Leptopelis fiziensis from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and western Tanzania was originally included in this species as a subspecies. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is greyish brown with an indistinct, darker hour-glass pattern. Some populations show a conspicuous white spot below the eye. Throat in calling males is green or blue, a characteristic that differentiates this species from Leptopelis hyloides and Leptopelis aubryi, along with its larger digital discs and different voice. The male advertisement call is a deep, unmelodious, drawn-out clack, sometimes repeated twice. Sometimes also a brief clack is emitted. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis modestus occurs in montane forests and secondary brush where it lives around streams in thick vegetation.

It is morphologically similar to Leptopelis nordequatorialis from Cameroon, and has also been considered its synonym, but is currently treated as a distinct species. The specific name oryi honours Albert Ory, warden in the Garamba National Park, the type locality of this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is stout. The head is as wide as the body or narrower. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The tips of the digits are dilated into distinct discs. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have reduced webbing. Males do not have pectoral glands (present in L. nordequatorialis). The dorsum is pale brown with three narrow darker dorsal and one dark lateral stripe. Males have pale vocal sac. The eyes are golden brown. The male advertisement call is a single, loud, low-pitched clack. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis oryi occurs in dense, humid savanna with tall grass and scattered bushes. In the dry season, these frogs are found buried in soil and under rocks, while during the wet season, males can be found perched high up in grass or on branches. They presumably lay eggs in a nest on the ground near water. Leptopelis oryi is a poorly known species known from few collections, but it appears to be reasonably abundant where it has been encountered.

The tympanum is large and the feet are fully webbed. The colouring varies, but the dorsum is typically dark green to black, sometimes with many light spots giving the frog a marbled appearance. The ventrum is dark and has a granular surface. Compared to the red tree frog, this species has larger choanae (the apertures where the nasal passages join the throat), larger tympani and differences in skin texture. ==Habitat and conservation== The natural habitats of palm forest tree frog are wet forests along the edges of creeks and streams to above sea level, possibly to 1000 m. It also occurs in forest remnants and possibly in towns. It is believed that eggs are buried close to water; when they hatch, the tadpoles move into pools or streams where they complete their development. It is a reasonably common species throughout the island, although habitat loss through development is a potential future threat.

The upper parts are brown, with a darker brown patch on the back extending as far as the head, or a dark M or N shaped mark on the back. Juvenile frogs are green, and have a white-tipped snout with a narrow black line running along the side.

It is named after Dr. Vincenzo Ragazzi (1856‚Äì1929), from the Modena Natural History Society, who explored and collected in Ethiopia. ==Description== Adult males of L. ragazzii measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. There are two colour phases. In phase A, the dorsum is pale greenish-yellow, bright green, or dark olive, and typically there are no darker markings. In phase B, the dorsum is cream, pale grey, or greenish to dark red-brown. There is a feeble to very pronounced pattern of grey or green to dark brown or black blotches, spots and freckling. These markings form a more or less discernible triangle or rectangle. A series of irregular blotches is usually present in the sacral region. Limbs have transverse bars that may or may not be well-defined. Few to numerous cream to bright yellow spots may be irregularly scattered over dorsum. There is almost always a distinct pale line above vent and heel. The venter is white or cream and usually has a pattern that range from light, pale grey mottling to being heavily blotched or even completely suffused with dark purplish-brown. The male advertisement call is a rather sharp \\"click\\", sometimes preceded by a low scream or creaking sound. ==Habitat and conservation== L. ragazzii lives in montane forest at elevations of above sea level. It is an arboreal species. It has also been found near human settlements, and it seems to be able to survive in isolated forest remnants and moderately degraded habitats. ==Reproduction== The males of L. ragazzii call from low vegetation near streams, although not necessarily particularly close to water, typically perched some above the ground. The eggs are laid in nests on land, near water, and the tadpoles develop in pools and small streams, both permanent and temporary. ==Conservation== Habitat loss, caused by forest clearance, human settlement, and encroachment by subsistence agriculture, is a threat to L. ragazzii. It occurs in the Bale Mountains National Park, although this offers limited protection only. Chytrid fungus has been detected in this species, although its impact remains unknown. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Boulenger GA (1896). \\"A List of the Reptiles and Batrachians collected by Dr. Ragazzi in Shoa and Eritrea\\".

Further, it is expected to occur Mali, Chad, the Central African Republic, Sudan, and South Sudan. ==Taxonomy== Leptopelis viridis was described in 1869 by Albert G√ºnther, a German-born British zoologist, ichthyologist, and herpetologist. In 2007 it was shown that the holotype specimen of Leptopelis hyloides, described by George Albert Boulenger in 1906 as Hylambates hyloides, was a synonym of Leptopelis viridis. However, the species name Leptopelis hyloides (or Hylambates hyloides) had often been applied to a forest species (common name: Gbanga forest treefrog) distinct from L. viridis.

Also a green specimen without a dark lateral stripe has been photographed. This suggests that a green phase may be present in this species. Indeed, the specific name viridis suggests that the type specimen had been green in life. Males have dark, almost uniform black throats. There is no webbing on hands and the webbing in feet is reduced. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis viridis lives in dry and humid savanna woodland, shrubland, and grassland; it tolerates habitat alteration. Breeding takes place in temporary savanna ponds; the eggs, however, are not deposited in water but in burrows on the ground, near the water. Leptopelis viridis is a very common species that occurs in many protected areas. It is adaptable, and there are no significant threats to it. ==References== viridis Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1869 Category:Taxa named by Albert G√ºnther Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptopelis viridis"},{"id":"12382731","text":"Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, the district of Saint-Maurice was established.

In statistics, the Anscombe transform, named after Francis Anscombe, is a variance-stabilizing transformation that transforms a random variable with a Poisson distribution into one with an approximately standard Gaussian distribution. The Anscombe transform is widely used in photon-limited imaging (astronomy, X-ray) where images naturally follow the Poisson law. The Anscombe transform is usually used to pre-process the data in order to make the standard deviation approximately constant. Then denoising algorithms designed for the framework of additive white Gaussian noise are used; the final estimate is then obtained by applying an inverse Anscombe transformation to the denoised data. ==Definition== For the Poisson distribution the mean m and variance v are not independent: m = v. The Anscombe transform : A:x \\\\mapsto 2 \\\\sqrt{x + \\\\tfrac{3}{8}} \\\\, aims at transforming the data so that the variance is set approximately 1 for large enough mean; for mean zero, the variance is still zero. It transforms Poissonian data x (with mean m) to approximately Gaussian data of mean 2\\\\sqrt{m + \\\\tfrac{3}{8}} - \\\\tfrac{1}{4 \\\\, m^{1/2}} + O\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{m^{3/2}}\\\\right) and standard deviation 1 + O\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{m^2}\\\\right). This approximation is good provided that m is larger than 4. For a transformed variable of the form 2 \\\\sqrt{x + c}, the expression for the variance has an additional term \\\\frac{\\\\tfrac{3}{8} -c}{m}; it is reduced to zero at c = \\\\tfrac{3}{8}, which is exactly the reason why this value was picked. ==Inversion== When the Anscombe transform is used in denoising (i.e. when the goal is to obtain from x an estimate of m), its inverse transform is also needed in order to return the variance-stabilized and denoised data y to the original range. Applying the algebraic inverse : A^{-1}:y \\\\mapsto \\\\left( \\\\frac{y}{2} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{3}{8} usually introduces undesired bias to the estimate of the mean m, because the forward square-root transform is not linear. Sometimes using the asymptotically unbiased inverse : y \\\\mapsto \\\\left( \\\\frac{y}{2} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{1}{8} mitigates the issue of bias, but this is not the case in photon-limited imaging, for which the exact unbiased inverse given by the implicit mapping : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ 2\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\tfrac{3}{8}} \\\\mid m \\\\right] = 2 \\\\sum_{x=0}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{x+\\\\tfrac{3}{8}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{m^x e^{-m}}{x!} \\\\right) \\\\mapsto m should be used. A closed-form approximation of this exact unbiased inverse is : y \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{4} y^2 - \\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{2}} y^{-1} - \\\\frac{11}{8} y^{-2} + \\\\frac{5}{8} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{2}} y^{-3}. ==Alternatives== There are many other possible variance-stabilizing transformations for the Poisson distribution. Bar-Lev and Enis report a family of such transformations which includes the Anscombe transform. Another member of the family is the Freeman-Tukey transformation : A:x \\\\mapsto \\\\sqrt{x+1}+\\\\sqrt{x}. \\\\, A simplified transformation, obtained as the primitive of the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the data, is : A:x \\\\mapsto 2\\\\sqrt{x} \\\\, which, while it is not quite so good at stabilizing the variance, has the advantage of being more easily understood. Indeed, from the delta method, V[2\\\\sqrt{x}] \\\\approx \\\\left(\\\\frac{d (2\\\\sqrt{m})}{d m} \\\\right)^2 V[x] = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{m}} \\\\right)^2 m = 1 . ==Generalization== While the Anscombe transform is appropriate for pure Poisson data, in many applications the data presents also an additive Gaussian component. These cases are treated by a Generalized Anscombe transform and its asymptotically unbiased or exact unbiased inverses. ==See also== *Variance-stabilizing transformation *Box‚ÄìCox transformation ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Poisson distribution Category:Normal distribution Category:Statistical data transformation ","title":"Anscombe transform"},{"id":"12382741","text":"Leptopelis yaldeni is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is endemic to Ethiopia and occurs in the montane highlands in Gojjam. Its range might be limited by the deep gorges of the Blue Nile. It is named in honour of Derek Yalden, a British zoologist who collected some of the types. Common names Yalden's tree frog and grassland forest treefrog have been coined for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The habitus is relatively slender. The snout is moderate, slightly pointed in profile. The tympanum is round and fairly conspicuous. Digital discs are of moderate size. The webbing between the toes and the two outermost fingers is moderate. This species has two colour morphs. One form is dorsally brown (ranging from pale cream or golden, sometimes greenish, through shades of grey-brown or red-brown to dark purplish-brown), typically with darker markings with that may be prominent; the pattern includes an often incomplete interorbital bar and a triangular dorsal mark. The other morph is bright green (bright blue-green or yellow green, rarely silver-green or pale to dark olive); dorsal markings are usually absent. The green form dominates at the upper end of the altitude range of this species where the habitats are more open, whereas the brown morph is only present at lower altitudes where the habitat has more cover. The male advertisement call is a series of screams followed by a click. The tadpole have a short, deep body and relatively long tail. The largest specimen, with budding hindlimbs, measures in total length. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptopelis yaldeni occurs in montane grasslands and moderately degraded habitats such as rural settlements at elevations of above sea level. Breeding typically takes place close to the banks of small streams. Males call from exposed positions; if tall vegetation is available, they will often choose to call from elevated positions, but they may also call from on the ground if the pool margin is bare earth. The eggs are deposited in nests on land near the water, and the tadpoles develop in the water. Leptopelis yaldeni is common and even abundant at many sites. Although it tolerates some habitat modification, it is likely that intensification of urbanization and agriculture will negatively impact this species. It is not known to occur in any protected areas. ==References== yaldeni Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Ethiopia Category:Endemic fauna of Ethiopia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1977 ","title":"Leptopelis yaldeni"},{"id":"12382749","text":"Leptopelis zebra is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae.

Although its founding had occurred in Wyoming, many of the congregations were located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan , especially around Calumet, as well as the Iron Range of northeastern Minnesota. The NELC was the smallest of three Finnish-American Lutheran churches in the United States. Several years earlier, in 1890, the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (also known as the Suomi Synod) had been founded in Calumet. The group that formed the NELC had either left the Suomi Synod or had never joined it due to differences in doctrine and issues of congregational freedom and autonomy. The other Finnish-American body was the Apostolic Lutheran Church of America, founded in 1872, also in Calumet, as the Solomon Korteniemi Lutheran Society. Due to financial issues soon after 1900, the NELC sought a possible merger with the Suomi Synod. Because that synod would not accept the lay-trained pastors of the NELC, the latter opened a seminary of in Ironwood, Michigan. Overtures to the Suomi Synod subsequently ceased, and the NELC instead established fellowship with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) in 1923. By 1931 the NELC had closed its seminary and was using the Missouri Synod's Concordia Theological Seminary, located at that time in Springfield, Illinois, for its pastoral training. In 1938 a member of the NELC was appointed professor and head of the Finnish department at the seminary. The denomination changed its name to the National Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1946.

Reggiane was founded during 1904 by its parent company Caproni, which was in turn owned by the aeronautical engineer Giovanni Battista Caproni. Throughout the company's existence, it was involved in numerous industrial activities, such as railways, agriculture, aeronautics, and processing machinery. During the first half of the Twentieth Century, Reggiane became well known for the design and production of aircraft. Through the development of the Re.2000, an all-metal monoplane, Reggiane gained a reputation for producing relatively agile single- seat fighter aircraft. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the majority of Reggiane's fighter production was taken over by the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force). However, the company continued to manufacture and deliver fighters for various other neutral and Axis-aligned nations around this period, such as for the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany, the Hungarian Air Force and the Swedish Air Force. Following the end of the war, the company turned its back on aircraft production, instead focusing upon the civil sector. Throughout the second half of the century, Reggiane came to specialise in the supply of cranes and other dockside equipment. ==History== The company established its main facilities in Reggio Emilia, a city of what today is the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. At its height, Reggiane's factory in the city was the fourth largest in Italy, its footprint covering an area as large as the center of Reggio Emilia, employing as many as 11,000 employees at a time. It was primarily through this plant that Reggiane performed its various industrial activities, becoming involved in the nations's railways, manufacturing a number of locomotives, as well as the agricultural sector, producing a range of food processing equipment. A Piaggio P.32 During the 1930s, the company branched out into aircraft production; the first aircraft to be produced by the firm was the Piaggio P.32bis, a medium bomber, which had been developed from the Caproni Ca.405C Procellaria. However, Reggiane's management were keen to branch out into developing their own aircraft designs, rather than solely producing other company's aircraft under license. During 1938, work commenced at Reggiane on a new fighter design; the company's design team, which was headed by Roberto Longhi and Antonio Alessio, set about designing an aircraft that would be offered to the Italian Air Ministry that would not only meet but exceed the requirements of its Programme R.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 214. Having little development time available, Reggiane considered various options, including the potential for manufacturing an American-developed fighter aircraft under license instead; however, under the influence of aeronautical engineer Giovanni Battista Caproni, a completely original design was rapidly prepared. The design team took inspiration from the contemporary American fighter Seversky P-35; their resulting design, the Reggiane Re.2000, bore a superficial resemblance to the P-35.Cattaneo 1967, p. 3.Cappone, Max C.A. \\"Reggiane RE 2000 Falco (Hawk): The Regia Aeronautica: American\\". Planes and Pilots of World War Two, Retrieved: 23 June 2011. It was the first aircraft to be designed by Reggiane to employ aluminum stressed skin construction, as opposed to the wooden or mixed wood and metal structures that had been traditionally used in contemporary Italian aircraft such as the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, another aircraft which had also been produced by Reggiane under license.Cattaneo 1967, p. 4. On 24 May 1939, the prototype Re.2000 conducted its maiden flight at Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, flown by Mario De Bernardi.Green and Swanborough 1990, p. 57. According to Cattaneo, early flights had quickly demonstrated the type's favourable flying attitude, including good speed and high manoeuvrability. Only minor modifications were required after the successful completion of the initial factory flight test programme; these including changes to the exhaust, the lengthening of the carburetor air intake, and the replacement of the round windshield with a framed counterpart. During testing, the Re 2000 demonstrated the ability to perform better than other existing fighters then in production. In mock dogfights, it could successfully fight not only the slower Fiat CR.42 biplane,'L'aviazione', De Agostini, Novara 1986, vol 12. p. 156. but even the more modern Macchi C 200 and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters. However, the Re.2000 was afflicted by a major handicap in the form of the unavailability of reliable in-line engines of sufficient power; as such, the RE.2000 was able to represent only a limited advance over the rival Macchi C.200. Throughout the Second World War, the company would develop numerous improved variants of the Re.2000, including the Re.2001, Re.2002, Re.2003, Re.2004, Re.2005, and Re.2006, some of which never progressed beyond the stages of prototyping or limited production. It has been alleged that the Reggiane had been working on developing their own wartime jet-propelled fighter, the Re.2007; however, some figures have cast doubts over the authenticity of the documentation produced. Postwar activities Following the conclusion of the conflict, Reggiane's factory was occupied by a large contingent of its work force, during which time its works were converted for to produce goods orientated towards the civilian market instead. This industrial action followed a pattern similar to the nationwide wave of factory occupations of the years 1920‚Äì1921. The company, which is currently still active (though with a name and a location different from the original, due to the changes of ownership and name), specializes in the production of cranes and trolleys for lifting containers. The company was taken over first by the group Fantuzzi (Fantuzzi Reggiane) and then recently acquired by American company Terex Corporation.

Small populations are scattered throughout the Mississippi-Great Lakes basin extending to Colorado, New Mexico, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc., though some of these areas are not native to the species. This small fish inhabits clear, cool streams and lakes. They eat small invertebrates, algae, insect larvae, and occasionally their own eggs. They are also preyed upon by smallmouth bass and northern pike. Feeding time is usually dawn and sunset. The brook stickleback does have active competition mostly from minnows, but feeding times are different, along with diet.Stewart, D.B. 2007.

Most of the year the colouring is grayish or olive green with a varying amount of indistinct mottling, but during the spawning season, males are nearly black and females have darker and lighter patches. This species grows to a maximum length of . ==Geographic distributions of species== A brook stickleback in an aquarium. Culaea inconstans, commonly known as the brook stickleback, is a small fish (<87 mm) that occurs throughout the southern half of Canada and the northern part of the eastern United States. It is one of the smallest fishes in the region. Brackish water populations are uncommon but certainly exist. It extends down to the southern reaches of the Mississippi River ‚Äì Great Lakes drainage basins. Populations also exist in Colorado and Nebraska to the west, and in Alberta, Manitoba, and Northwest Territory to the north. Though these are typically the native ranges of the brook stickleback, the species has been introduced to Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, northwestern Colorado, northeastern Utah and California, and even in parts of South Dakota and Washington State. Certain geographical distribution studies have found that certain populations may have been native in New Mexico and still exist today. Nebraska does have brook stickleback populations, but they are generally found in small streams in the northern portion of the state. The fish have been found in Nebraska since the early part of the nineteen hundreds. River drainages that sustain brook stickleback populations are the Loup, Middle Platt, Niobrara, and smaller distributions in the Lower Platte, Missouri River tributaries, North Platte, and South Platte. Though the species appears to have an abundant distribution across North America, the Nature Conservancy has declared the species to be a S3 (vulnerable) level. Reasons for the level of vulnerability could be due to increased dam construction, especially in the eastern United States. This can lead to a destruction of habitat, increase in silted waterways, alteration of stream nutrient transport, and damaged breeding grounds. Alteration of stream dynamics could also lead to a change in predator frequency, thus exposing the brook stickleback to unforeseen predators. ==Ecology== As with a large geographical distribution, this species also lives in a wide range of flowing water habitats. Waterways such as rivers, streams, floodwater streams and drainages, lakes, ponds, potholes, hot springs, sinkholes, and seasonal melt water or spring fed ponds are all viable brook stickleback territories. Though the species can thrive in these habitats, primary spawning, breeding, and rearing grounds are located in shallow (< 1.5m) near shore environments with high vegetation cover and low velocity water. The species has a wide elevation range with specimens identified from sea level to ~ 2,400m. Diet The brook stickleback is an omnivore, with primary feeding tendencies toward aquatic insect larvae, adult terrestrial insects, crustaceans, fish eggs and larvae, snails, oligochaetes, nematodes, rotifers, and mites. However, brook stickleback feed on vascular plant material, as well as algae. Newly hatched stickleback larvae and planktonic crustaceans from both streams and ponds. Juveniles eat small organisms due to mouth size restrictions, and adults eat both large and small organisms. Predators Certain large invertebrates, birds, mammals, and fish all prey on the brook stickleback. With its small size, this species of stickleback has evolved piercing spines and protective plates to hinder predators. With this protection, as well as advanced anti-predator behavior, the brook stickleback is only a minor prey item. In a lab study, adult water bugs (Lethocerus americanus) and dragonfly nymphs (Aeschna spp.) both successfully preyed on the stickleback, but only in a night setting. Fish have been observed to be the most successful predator of the brook stickleback. Examples of these fish predators include: yellow perch (Perca flavescens), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), burbot (Lota lota), central mudminnow (Umbra limi), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), northern pike (Esox lucius), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Brook stickleback eggs can be cannibalized, as well as consumed by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Competition among the ninespine stickleback exists. However, ninespine stickleback habitat exists in the pelagic zone, while the brook stickleback occupies the littoral zone. In the presence of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), the brook stickleback has a more diverse diet since the fathead is a more generalist feeder. ==Life history== For this particular species, spawning occurs in mid-summer. Brook sticklebacks migrate annually up affluent streams and creeks of rivers and lakes during the spring to spawn in weedy areas. Spawning occurs as males secure a protected territory and construct a nest. These nests are constructed using algae, roots, and aquatic vegetation. There is one entrance with no exit. When the female enters, she deposits her eggs by shaking violently. Each shake allows more eggs to be deposited. Once all the eggs have been placed, the female must push her way through the wall of the nest to exit. During this process, studies have shown that the female makes acoustic noises, which is thought to advertise to sneaker males, as this can increase the proportion of eggs fertilized.Kilgour, R. J., et al. 2010. The role of acoustic cues in the breeding repertoire of the brook stickleback. Journal of Ethology 28: 175-178. After spawning, the male assumes protection of the eggs which hatch in 7‚Äì11 days.Moodie, G. 1986. The Populations of Culaea inconstans, The Brook Stickleback, in a small prairie lake. Canadian Journal of Zoology 64: 1709-1717. New hatched stickleback can wander from the nest, but the male gathers them into his mouth to deposit them back in the protective nest. Spawning usually ends around mid-July due to swift temperature changes in the water. The newly fertilized eggs are vulnerable to slight temperature changes. These fish grow rapidly during their first summer and typically reach sexual maturity by spring of the next year. Most adults die within the spawning season or shortly after causing them to be deemed an annual species. ==Current management== The Nature Conservancy has listed the brook stickleback as level S3 (vulnerable). Though the numbers of this species aren't threatened, there is a potential for a decrease in population. However, no specific management practices are in place to protect the brook stickleback. This species does occur across the majority of the United States and Canada, which means it could be susceptible to increase pollution in the waterways. The brook stickleback lives in habitats of all sizes from lakes to streams to sinkholes. This diverse range of environments allows the species to cope with a variety of conditions. With such high plasticity of environmental stress, it can withstand certain levels of pollution, heavy metal density, and water turbidity. However, this does not mean the brook stickleback is immune from human induced changes to the ecosystem dynamic. The spawning season for this species is relatively short with high sensitivity to temperature changes. Global temperature changes are at an unprecedented rise, which could eventually lead to a global shift in water temperature. This could highly affect the spawning season for the brook stickleback species. Protection of this species should be on high priority because this species has led scientist in significant breakthroughs in sympatric and allopathic speciation.McLennan, D.A. 2008. Conservation and variation in the agonistic repertoire of the brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans. Environmental Biology of Fishes 82: 377-384. ==Management recommendations== This biggest strength of this species success in its natural environment is the amount of successful colonized location after the last ice age with the northern retreat of the glacial caps. The brook stickleback can be found from the northern parts of the Canadian interior all the way down to southern reaches of the United States. Protecting such diversity of locations is key to local ecosystem, as well as the integrity of the species. Current management practices for endangered species of fish should continue their progress because they could be having indirect effects on protecting the brook stickleback. Keeping certain invasive species out of lakes occupied by the brook stickleback could ensure a protect environment from predators. With its armored plates and spines, the brook stickleback has well adapted itself to the current predators it encounters. However, invasive species with better-adapted predatory behavior and shell crushing mouth construction could decimate certain brook stickleback populations. With such successful habitat colonization, this species should be managed using gill nets to track the number of individuals or populations across specific regions. Yearly samples would be most beneficial since the brook stickleback is an annual species. Tracking their progress in increasing or declining numbers would help conservationists categorize specific threats for that region. ==References== * Category:Gasterosteidae Category:Fauna of the Plains-Midwest (United States) Category:Fish of North America Category:Fish of the Great Lakes Category:Monotypic fish genera Category:Fish described in 1840 Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Brook stickleback"},{"id":"12382961","text":"Behind the Curtain is the second book in the Echo Falls mystery series by best-selling crime novelist Peter Abrahams. ==Plot summary== Ingrid lives in a small community called Echo Falls. She's in the school soccer team and is in the drama club. Everything is normal until one day she sees what her dad has been looking at on his computer. On the Jobs.com site. He suddenly starts getting temperamental. Throughout the next few days, Ingrid notices other weird things occurring like her brother starts getting more buff but has strange pimples on his back, and her soccer coach getting switched with another very odd coach, Julia LeCaine. Ingrid starts to try to find out what is happening and in the midst of it, on a random day when she is outside going to the MathFest, she gets kidnapped. She finds herself in the trunk of a car and escapes. But she doesn‚Äôt know who tried to kidnap her and if they would try again. Throughout the book Ingrid has to face many mysterious and scary situations to find out what is happening! Guided by her hero, Sherlock Holmes, it's not going to be easy for this 13-year-old! She soon realizes that the new coach, Julia LeCaine, was the one who kidnapped her for money. After she escapes the kidnapping, which happened on the MathFest, a day she was told to show up for she was one of the contestants, barely anyone believes her, and if they did, they had doubts. Luckily, Chief Strade, father of Joey Strade (who is Ingrid's friend/romantic interest) believes her, but cannot act upon it too much, for there are too many holes in her story. During all this, Ingrid's brother, Ty, starts taking steroids, an illegal drug sold by the Krackens (her not-so-friend, Chloe's servants). though she's quite sure of this, she doesn't want her brother to get in trouble, so she has to prove the crime herself by pretending to be a buyer. She brings a tape recorder along with her, with hopes of recording their conversation and showing it to Chief Strade. She writes a note on Carl Kraken Jr's janitor desk to meet them at the tree house she and Ty used to hang out in. She only meets Carl Senior, the oldest living Kraken, and nearly buys the steroids but is foiled when her recorder gave her away. After a quick chase in the woods, the three Krakens catch her, but Chief Strade and some other cops rescue her and arrest the Krakens. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"In a literature notoriously light on solid mysteries, Abrahams‚Äôs second outing for kids stands out as a deliciously plotted, highly satisfying adventure.\\" while Publishers Weekly, in reviewing the audio version, stated \\"youngsters who have never read a Sherlock Holmes story will be won over by the perilous adventure so expertly presented.\\" ==References== Category:2006 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"Behind the Curtain"},{"id":"12382965","text":"Dƒôbowiec is a village in Jas≈Ço County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south- eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Dƒôbowiec. It lies approximately south of Jas≈Ço and south-west of the regional capital Rzesz√≥w. The village has an approximate population of 2,000. Debowiec has a long and rich history. For centuries it was a town, located in southeastern corner of the historic province of Lesser Poland. Until the Partitions of Poland, Debowiec belonged to Biecz County of Krakow Voivodeship. In the early Middle Ages, Debowiec was a gord, located in sparsely inhabited areas of Carpathian foothills. In the 11th century, Benedictine monks from Tyniec encouraged settlers to come to this corner of Lesser Poland. Debowiec was a village, destroyed in 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland. Asiatic hordes returned in 1259‚Äì1260 and 1287‚Äì1288, bringing further destruction. On August 15, 1349, King Kazimierz Wielki granted Magdeburg rights to Debowiec. By that time, Debowiec had already been a local center of administration, as first mention of a Roman Catholic parish of St. Bartholomew existing here dates back to 1328. According to some sources, Debowiec had been granted town charter as early as 13th century, and in 1349, Kazimierz Wielki changed the charter from Polish to German (Magdeburg rights). First known vogt of Debowiec was Mikolaj of Bakow. On May 13, 1365, Kazimierz Wielki visited Debowiec. By early 15th century, Debowiec had a number of artisans, and among its most famous owners was knight Marcin of Wrocimowice, who resided here in 1433‚Äì1442. His son, Marcin of Debowiec was captured by Turks during the Battle of Varna, and spent 20 years in Turkish captivity. In 1471, Debowiec burned in a great fire, and three years later the town was raided by Hungarian troops under Thomas Tarczay, which burned all local villages, together with Debowiec and its church (January 1474). In 1494, Debowiec was flooded, and in 1496‚Äì1497, the town was affected by a plague. Furthermore, in 1498 Debowiec was raided by Crimean Tatars and Wallachians, who burned all towns and villages of Carpathian foothills. Debowiec prospered in the period known as Polish Golden Age. Even though the town and its castle burned in 1512, it was quickly rebuilt, and became a local trade center, with a brewery, wine cellars, tax office, watermill and other businesses. In 1528, Debowiec was named seat of a starosta, and in 1535, royal privilege was issued, granting the right for Monday fairs. In 1571 Jadwiga Tarlo, future wife of Jerzy Mniszech, was named the starosta of Debowiec. She married Mniszech in 1586, and the couple settled at the Debowiec Castle. In 1605, the Mniszechs hosted envoys of False Dmitriy I, who asked for the hand of their daughter Marina. On May 8, 1606, Marina Mniszech married Dmitriy in Moscow. In 1624, Debowiec was once again raided by Crimean Tatars, and on April 1, 1626, almost whole town burned in a great fire, after which only parish church and seven houses stood. The Tatars returned in 1629 and 1654, while in 1655, Debowiec was looted by Swedes, during the Deluge (history). On March 19, 1657, Debowiec was burned and its residents murdered by Transilvanians of George II Rakoczi. After the wars of the mid-17th century, Debowiec never recovered and declined in importance. In 1769, a battle of the Bar Confederation took place here, and three years later, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire. Debowiec remained in Austrian Galicia until 1918. In 1806, the army of Mikhail Kutuzov marched through the town after the Battle of Austerlitz. Local peasants actively participated in the so-called Galician slaughter (1846), while 26 patriots from Debowiec fought in the January Uprising. Due to widespread poverty, a number of local residents left Debowiec and adjacent villages in the late 19th and early 20th century, emigrating either to the United States or Brazil. In September 1914, Debowiec was seized by Russian army, which retreated after two days. In 1934, Debowiec was affected by the 1934 flood in Poland, and on July 26 of the same year, it lost its town charter. In 1937, local peasants took part in the 1937 peasant strike in Poland. ==References== Category:Villages in Jas≈Ço County Category:Krak√≥w Voivodeship (14th century ‚Äì 1795) Category:Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Krak√≥w Voivodeship (1919‚Äì1939) ","title":"Dƒôbowiec, Podkarpackie Voivodeship"},{"id":"12382969","text":"Gorantla Venkanna (1871‚Äì1947) was a well-known philanthropist, lover and patron of Sanskrit language. == Introduction == He was born in 1871 in a small village Timmasamudram in Prakasam district of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.

He established a high school and Oriental school (GVS High School) in Ongole and a Sanskrit school in Timmasamudram. All the students of these schools receive free accommodation and boarding facilities. The well-known library in Vetapalem known as \\"Saraswata Niketanam\\" received substantial contributions from him. Venkanna also donated of land to a trust meant for the encouragement of Sanskrit teaching and preparation of Ayurveda products. Venkanna was an ardent follower of Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu, the freedom fighter and first Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh. Mahatma Gandhi was impressed by the selfless service, generosity and philanthropy of Mr Venkanna and visited Timmasamudram twice. Large donation of lands was made to Harijans in the presence of Gandhi. Thousands of homeless people affected by the cyclone of 1936 were fed and liberally helped to make new homes.

He is determined to save the galaxy from the evil, even from the cute Zooligans. He has a huge set of ears that he can use for sonar (for figuring out where to go in a level), to fly for a short period of time, or to hit enemies with his signature spin move. In the game, he uses Mini Bros. to help him. They all have special abilities that vary. Some can be used for lighting dark areas, some can heal Blender's life, and some do other things. == Gameplay == Blender performs most of his attacks using his ears, generally using the B button depending on context. Pressing down in midair, or pressing A to jump from the crouch position, will cause Blender to flip upside-down and perform a high jump. Pressing B while doing a high jump causes Blender to perform a \\"downward attack\\" resembling a drill. Blender can also charge his B spin, to perform a \\"spin wave\\". The spin wave is Blender's longest range attack, not including the extra attack range given by equipping Nuckle (the default Bro that you start the game with). The levels are nonlinear, and focus on puzzle-solving and dexterity rather than speed (though the levels are timed, and you can track your times for each level). One unique aspect of the levels is the ability to interact with the background. Most levels consist of two layers - a front area and a back area - that you can periodically move between. When you are in the front area, enemies and switches can be seen in the back area, forewarning you about the next part of the level. If you have access to a cosmo ball (a red ball that Blender can throw to kill enemies or hit switches), you can throw it upward to hit objects in the back area, allowing you to eliminate enemies before having to cross paths with them. The total game consists of seven worlds - Oasis, Diva, Earth, Shelltarl, Cosmo Heaven, Fo9, and Millitar. With the exception of Shelltarl, which is a single long level, each world is divided into three main stages, followed by a boss. Craig, Harris. \\"IGN: Blender Bros. Review\\". April 29, 2002. IGN. Oasis is the only world unlocked at first. You also have access to Cosmo Heaven, but only as a hub at first. After beating Oasis, you unlock Diva and Shelltarl. After beating those, Earth and Fo9 are unlocked. Beating these unlocks Millitar. Upon completing Millitar, Cosmo Heaven is invaded by the Zooligans, turning it into the final world of the game. Throughout the game, you can collect different Bros. Bros are familiars that give you particular abilities. Nuckle, the Bro you start out with, gives you extra range for your primary attack. Some Bros can also be evolved when you play the right music for them. The records to play this music are available in the shop for ten bones apiece (bones being the currency of the game). == Reception == Blender Bros. has received mixed reviews, averaging a score of 73/100 on Metacritic based on 10 critics' reviews. Tim Tracy of GameSpot gave this a 7.4 and wrote, \\"If you enjoy good 2D platform games, you can't go wrong with this one.\\"Tracy, Tim. \\"Blender Bros. for Game Boy Advance Review\\". GameSpot.
