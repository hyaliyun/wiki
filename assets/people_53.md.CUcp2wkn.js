To the east, Low Row merges with the settlement of Feetham. A working farm, Hazel Brow Farm, is open to visitors and 'The Punch Bowl', a stone inn dated 1638, is by the main road. ==History== The name Low Row comes from the Norse \\"The Wra\\" (a nook). The surname \\"Raw\\" is associated with the village. The village was raided by Jacobites in 1745, and bodies probably from that raid are buried at the church in Low Row. On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village. ==Smarber Chapel and Low Row United Reformed Church== The remains of Smarber Chapel in 2009, looking east.

It was to connect the Eastside to the city centre core, a major retail area. == History  Pre-1960s development === It is known that the Augustinian Priory of St Thomas of Canterbury was located on the site in the 13th century. The entrance to the hospital was on what is now Bull Street, then Chapel Street, and ran along Steelhouse Lane, then Priory Congree. In 1536, the Priory was dissolved and the structures on site were demolished in 1547. The site remained as ruins for 150 years until it was purchased by John Pemberton in 1700. John Pemberton developed the site around Old Square and created a residential district on the site. In the 18th century, the Barley Market moved from the Bullring area to the junction of Bull Street and Dale End. In 1763, Sampson Lloyd and John Taylor established a private banking business known as Taylors & Lloyds on the site which would develop into Lloyds Bank. The construction of Corporation Street linked New Street to Old Square and the area fast became a major area of the city centre. It became a tram terminus and new entertainment businesses were established in the area such as the Grand Theatre. The site became a conglomerate of buildings accessed via back alleys. There were two hotels and five public houses by 1890 as well as a chemical works on the Lower Priory. Dalton Street cut through the site however this street was removed during the 1960s development. On the eastern side of Dale End were houses and a school. === Development of the 1960s === Carling Academy with Priory Square to the right and Dale House and the adjoining multi-storey car park to the left. Both of these buildings will be demolished as part of the development and the road will be removed. Dale House and the adjacent multi-storey car park. The construction of the Priory Queensway and Masshouse Circus prompted a new wave of development in the area during the 1960s and 1970s with such buildings as The McLaren Building and Londonderry House behind it. The construction of the Priory Queensway resulted in the demolition of the Grand Theatre and many other old derelict Victorian properties. In the 1960s, the buildings between Corporation Street and Dale End were purchased and demolished. A new two storey shopping precinct of concrete Brutalist architecture, designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd, began construction there in 1963 and opened in 1966. It was constructed in phases. At the junction of Dale End and Bull Street, a ramp, known as Priory Close, was constructed giving access to a market area on the site of the Barley Market. A walkway was constructed from this market area through to the newly constructed Priory Queensway with shops either side. The complex consists of three buildings containing shops and department stores, all surrounding a pedestrian precinct. Below ground level was a ballroom, which has since been converted into the Oasis Market. Within the square itself, which was called Corporation Square, was an advertising tower located directly above the public staircase to the car park, an octagonal shaped seating arrangement and a kiosk. The building still remains and businesses located within the block are Argos. The major use for the block was the O2 Academy Birmingham before it moved to Bristol Street in 2009. This was formerly known as the \\"Hummingbird\\" and was located on what was the Rank Ballroom. Below this in an underground setting is the Oasis Market, a fashion market composed of small businesses. The block was named Priory Square, to reflect the history of the site, in the 1990s when it underwent a renovation which also saw the addition of a small clock tower which chimes at the hour. Also part of the renovation was the installation of a glass roof above the walkway from the markets to Priory Queensway. Priory Square lost business in the early 21st century as the Bull Ring Shopping Centre and Martineau Place were completed. On the opposite side of Dale End, which occupies the site set for renovation, is a red brick 1970s midrise office block known as either Dale House or Century House, a multi-storey car park and ground floor, with a mezzanine level, retail space. The ground floor was occupied by a Toys 'R' Us store however this was closed in Summer 2006. This part of the site is also bounded by The Priory Queensway and Moor Street Queensway. == Redevelopment of the site  Planning history === An outline planning application for the development was submitted on 6 December 2005 by Drivers Jonas. It was given an application number of C/07564/05/OUT by Birmingham City Council's Planning Department. The proposal summary was: > Outline planning application, including the approval of access, for the > construction of a major mixed use development of up to 266,000 square metres > gross internal area, comprising retail, food and drink, offices, leisure, > residential, hotel, cultural facility, casino, associated car parking, > highway works, service areas, public spaces, and infrastructure [Including > Use Classes A1 (Retail), A2 (Financial and Professional Services), A3 > (Restaurants & Cafes), A4 (Drinking Establishments), B1 (Business), C1 > (Hotels), C3 (Residential), D1 (Non-Residential Institutions), Casino (as > amended by SI 220/06 and SI 221/06), D2 (Assembly & Leisure), of the Use > Classes Order (England), April 2005] The masterplan was designed by RTKL-UK Ltd. Engineers WSP Group produced the means of access plan in the planning application. A cheque of £9,345 made payable to Birmingham City Council was submitted with application to cover the planning fees. A notice was placed in 5 December 2005 edition of the Birmingham Post by the agents, Drivers Jonas, to make the public aware of the proposals. The scheme was granted outline planning consent on 21 December 2006. Demolition of the present buildings was to commence in 2007. Construction was expected to take three years as it is being constructed as a single phase therefore making the completion date either 2010 or 2011. The Toys 'R' Us store on Dale End has already found a new location and the office block is being emptied. The Argos store is also beginning to empty yet is still in operation until demolition begins. The Carling Academy is set to move to the former Dome nightclub premises on Bristol Street in 2009. Oasis Market will be forced to shut down or relocate as well as the small businesses on the street level. The rooftop market is slowly shutting down however it is unknown whether this is due to pressure by the developers or natural deterioration. A Virgin Megastore on the corner with Bull Street and Corporation Street shut down in 2005 however the retail space was put up for let soon after. Virgin Megastore relocated to new premises next to the Pavilions Shopping Centre on High Street and the retail space became Omega Sektor which closed in 2008. Interest was raised in the environmental surveying of the site by the developers who discovered that six species of birds which are listed in the RSPB's species of particular interest had established a habitat on the site. However, after further research, it was noted that these species of birds were common in city centres. === The proposals === The design contains residential and office blocks as well as an open area surrounded by shops. There are also five rooftop gardens. There is also a block with two towers protruding one of which is estimated to be 110 metres in height with 29 floors and a sloped roof with two rooftop gardens either side of these. The other is shorter however also has the sloped roof. It is proposed that there are eight buildings in total on site. The shortest building will front Moor Street Queensway and has been temporarily named Moor Street Gallery as it is intended for cultural or retail use. All office buildings will have retail space on the ground floor and will be located on Corporation Street. The other large buildings, excluding the 110 metre residential tower, will have optional hotel space as well as residential space. The road which separates Priory Square from the multi storey car park is removed so therefore it will stop at the bridge at the entrance to The McLaren Building. The development will witness the realignment of streets and creation of pedestrianised streets on the site and the developers suggested a numbe of public squares and roads in the outline planning application. There are also proposals for highway works which brings the total area of the site to . As the development includes the demolition of a regularly used car park, a replacement car park with a maximum of 2,550 spaces has also been proposed. The estimated cost of the development is £550 million and 6000 jobs are expected to be created. The development is being worked on by Advantage West Midlands and the Birmingham Alliance. Developments nearby include the large Masshouse development on the opposite side of The Priory Queensway and City Park Gate opposite on the Moor Street Queensway. Cannon House on the opposite side of Old Square recently underwent a major refurbishment into office space. The site covers 274,605m² and it is expected that 4,700 permanent jobs will be created as a result of the development. If a hotel is included in the development then the number may increase to 6,000. An average of 750 to 800 jobs were expected to be created during construction work. == See also == *Redevelopment of Birmingham == References == *Online Planning Application - Number C/07564/05/OUT, Birmingham Alliance.

Its first monarch was George I, the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark. ==Creation== The personal standard of the Kings of Greece. After the overthrow in 1862 of the first king of the independent Greek state, Otto of Bavaria, a plebiscite in Greece was initiated on 19 November 1862,1 December in the New Style with the results announced in February the following year,March in the New Style in support of adopting Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom, later Duke of Edinburgh, to reign as king of the country. The candidacy of Prince Alfred was rejected by the Great Powers. The London Conference of 1832 had prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown of Greece, while Queen Victoria was opposed to such a prospect. A search for other candidates ensued, and eventually, Prince William of Denmark, of the House of Glücksburg, the second son of King Christian IX and younger brother of the new Princess of Wales, was appointed king. The Greek Parliament unanimously approved on 18 March 186330 March in the New Style the ascension to the Greek throne of the prince, then aged 17, as King of the Hellenes under the regnal name of George I. George arrived in Greece in October 1863. ==History== George I married Grand Duchess Olga Constaninovna of Russia, and they had seven surviving children. After a reign of almost fifty years, George I was succeeded by his eldest son, Constantine I, who had married, in 1913, Princess Sophia of Prussia, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II. In turn, all three of Constantine's sons, George II, Alexander and Paul, would occupy the throne. The dynasty reigned in Greece during the Balkan Wars, World War I, World War II (during which Greece experienced occupation by the Axis), the Greek Civil War, and the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. Following the National Schism during World War I and the subsequent Asia Minor Disaster, the monarchy was deposed in March 1924 and replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic. Between 1924 and 1935 there were in Greece twenty-three changes of government, a dictatorship, and thirteen coups d'etat. In October 1935, General Georgios Kondylis, a former Venizelist, overthrew the government and arranged for a plebiscite to end the republic. On 3 November 1935, the official tally showed that 98% of the votes supported the restoration of the monarchy. The balloting was not secret, and participation was compulsory. As Time described it at the time, \\"As a voter, one could drop into the ballot box a blue vote for George II, or one could cast a red ballot for the Republic.\\" \\"By the Grace of God\\", TIME, 18 November 1935 George II returned to the Greek throne on 25 November 1935. On 4 August 1936, the King endorsed the establishment of a Government led by veteran army officer Ioannis Metaxas.\\"Italy Tried to Invade Greece in World War II: It Was a Disaster\\", The National Interest, 28 July 2017 George II followed the Greek government in exile after the German invasion of Greece in 1941 and returned to the throne in 1946, after a referendum that resulted in the restoration of constitutional monarchy. He died in 1947 and was succeeded by his brother Paul. The new King reigned from the time of Greek civil war until his death in 1964, and was succeeded by his son, Constantine II. ==Downfall== On 21 April 1967, the elected government of Greece was overthrown by a group of middle- ranking army officers led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, and a military dictatorship was established. The military junta formed a new government that was sworn in by Constantine II. On 13 December 1967, the King launched a counter-coup that failed and he, together with his family, fled to Rome and soon after to London. The dictatorship nominally retained the monarchy but on 1 June 1973, Constantine II was declared \\"deposed\\" and Papadopoulos appointed himself \\"President of the Republic.\\" Some two months later, on 29 July 1973, the military regime held a referendum whose official result confirmed, according to the junta, the abolition of the monarchy. After July 1974, the dictatorship fell. The military handed power over to Konstantinos Karamanlis, a conservativeSee: People's Party; National Radical Union politician who had been prime minister in the 1950s and early 60s. Karamanlis formed a \\"government of national unity\\" and held a constitutional referendum on 8 December 1974. The voters confirmed the abolition of the monarchy by a vote of 69% to 31% and the establishment of a parliamentary democracy in Greece. ==Current status== In 2013, after being declared personae non gratae in the 1980s, having the palaces of the family and other estates expropriated in 1994, and then their passports annulled, Constantine and his wife Anne-Marie were once again living in Greece.\\"Greece's former king goes home after 46-year exile\\" by Helena Smith, The Guardian, 15 December 2013 ==Royal coat of arms== Greater royal arms since 1936 The royal coat of arms still used by the royal family is a blue shield with the white cross of Greece with the greater coat of arms of Denmark of 1819-1903 in the centre. This was consequently also the arms of Denmark when the Danish prince William accepted the Greek throne as King George I. As such this includes the three lions of the arms of Denmark proper, the two lions of Schleswig, the three crowns of the former Kalmar Union, the stockfish of Iceland, the ram of Faroe Islands, the polar bear of Greenland, the lion and hearts of the King of the Goths, the wyvern of the King of the Wends, the nettle leaf of Holstein, the swan with a crown of Stormarn, the knight on horseback of Dithmarschen, the horse head of Lauenburg, the two red bars of the House of Oldenburg and the yellow cross of Delmenhorst.

Although the government instituted two investigations, no one was ever charged. ==Background information== During the British colonial period, approximately 60% of the civil service jobs were held by the minority Sri Lankan Tamils, who constituted approximately 15% of the population prior to 1948. This was partly due to the availability of Western- style education provided by the Protestant American Ceylon Mission, Hindu revivalists, and local Catholic missions in the Tamil-dominated Jaffna peninsula. After gaining independence from Britain in 1948, Sinhalese politicians made the over-representation a political issue. They initiated measures aimed at correcting the over-representation by establishing ethnic quotas for university entrants. These measures, and a series of riots and pogroms starting from 1958 that targeted Sri Lankan Tamils and the resultant mass murder, displacements and refugees, led to the formation of rebel groups advocating independence for Sri Lankan Tamils. After the 1983 Black July pogrom, full-scale civil war erupted between the government and the rebel groups. During the course of the civil war there were a number of massacres of civilians, war rapes, torture and enforced disappearances attributed to both the government and allied groups as well as the various rebel formations. ==The massacre== The village of Sathurukondan lies just beyond Iruthayapuram, the northern suburb of Batticaloa. At 5:30 p.m. on September 9, 1990, armed men in uniform and in civilian clothes came into the area and ordered everyone to come on to the road. They were then marched to the army camp in the vicinity after being told that they would be questioned and released. Most of those who were left in the village that day were elderly, women and the very young. According to the only survivor, Kanthasamy Krishnakumar (21), in a recording made before leading citizens in Batticaloa: Krishnakumar who was injured, managed to roll out of sight in the semi-darkness, crept away to a house and asked for water. He then went to his village and stayed in an empty house, and later found his way to his cousin's in Batticaloa town. The list of victims totaled 184 (38 Sathurukondan, 47 Kokuvil, 37 Panniachchiady and 62 Pillayarady). Of this number, there were 47 children below the age of 10 and several women. ==Government investigation== Retired judge K. Palakidnar of the Special Presidential Commission of inquiry appointed by the People's Alliance government described the massacre in detail in his final report. According to the report of the commission of inquiry, 5 infants, 42 children under ten, 85 women and 28 old persons were among the 184 villagers who were murdered. The judge also identified three captains of the Sri Lankan Army: Warnakulasooriya, Herath and Wijenaike as the responsible parties.

Its primary business is providing business forms, management software and professional services to car dealerships. Its software is used to manage sales logistics at dealerships. It also produces forms used in medicine and insurance. Reynolds and Reynolds was founded in 1866 as a printer of standardized business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This was followed by a major downsizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of the Big Three automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies. ==HistoryEarly history=== Reynolds and Reynolds was founded by Lucius Reynolds and his brother-in-law, James Gardner, in June 1866 in Dayton, Ohio. It was a small printing shop founded with $500 in capital and originally named Reynolds and Gardner. It made standardized business documents using carbon copy paper. A year after Reynolds was founded, James sold his interest in the company to co-founder Lucius' father, Ira Reynolds, and the company was renamed to its current namesake, Reynolds and Reynolds. Co-owners Ira and Lucius died in 1880 and 1913 respectively. The youngest of the Reynolds family, Edwin Stanton Reynolds, took over. In 1927, Reynolds and Reynolds won a contract to provide all of the business forms for Chevrolet dealerships. The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices by the end of the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the Reynolds family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. Reynolds became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, Reynolds expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive business unit of Windsor Office Supply, forming Reynolds and Reynolds (Canada) Ltd. By the end of the decade it had about $50 million in revenues. ===Establishment of software business=== Reynolds and Reynolds first entered into the electronic accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came at a cost of more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues. After Holmes retired, he was replaced by former IBM executive Lloyd G. \\"Buzz\\" Waterhouse, who created an eBusiness department to focus on internet technologies. In 2000, Reynolds also acquired the HAC Group, a learning, customer relationship management and web services company for retailers and manufacturers. The following year CarsDirect.com and Reynolds and Reynolds introduced a car shopping website called CarsDirect Connect. In November 2002, it acquired Networkcar Inc. (now Verizon Networkfleet) and further developed its telematics device, CAReader. This product communicates a car's mechanical status to a dealer. Reynolds sold Networkcar to Hughes Telematics for $17.7 million in 2006. ===Acquisitions and growth=== In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed agreements with the rest of the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million. On August 8, 2006, Reynolds and Reynolds announced it was becoming a private company through a $2.8 billion acquisition by Houston-based Universal Computer Systems (UCS). The combined organization had a 40 percent market- share in the dealer management systems sector. According to Automotive News, there was a \\"major culture clash\\" between the two companies. For example, the new CEO would not hire smokers and required annual physicals to maintain health insurance. ===Recent history=== After the merger with UCS, Bob Brockman became CEO of the combined entity. He introduced more discipline to the company's software development, resulting in more modern software products and a greater breadth of features. A series of legal disputes between Reynolds and General Motors (GM) began in 2007. Through a GM program called the Integrated Dealership Management System (GMIDMS), Reynolds provided software to GM dealerships through GM. When Reynolds would not make changes to its software requested by GM, GM alleged it was a breach of contract. A settlement was reached in 2008, which ended Reynolds' participation in GM's program. In 2008, Reynolds acquired DiversiForm, a Beaverton, Oregon-based printer of forms and business documents for car dealerships. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In August 2013, it acquired the newsletter company IMN. This was followed by an acquisition that November of the customer retention software vendor XtreamService, also for a non-disclosed sum. It acquired AddOnAuto in May 2014, which was the company's fifth acquisition in a little over twelve months. AddOnAuto develops software for shopping for car accessories. In 2017, Reynolds acquired Xpressdocs, a Fort Worth, Texas-based marketing solutions provider for franchise organizations. ==Current software and services== Reynolds and Reynolds is a software and document printing company that primarily serves the automotive industry. It develops and markets the ERA and POWER suites of dealer management systems. Its software is used for inventory, accounting, contract documents and other business logistics. For example, one Reynolds application called AddOnAuto can visualize what a car will look like with accessories, while docuPAD adds a touch-screen on top of a desk that customers use to go through vehicle sales paperwork and interact with options. Reynolds also provides paper business forms, consulting and training. It provides some software and services to other industries, like medical and insurance. Its customer service has been recognized with awards like the STAR (Software Technical Assistance Recognition) Award from The Help Desk Institute. It is one of the three largest vendors in the dealership management software segment. ===Product history=== Reynolds and Reynolds started as a printer of standardized business forms on carbon paper. By the 1940s, Reynolds' business was divided into four main areas: automotive, medical, custom forms and Post-Rite Peg Boards. Reynolds' first electronic accounting service was introduced in 1963. Its parts inventory software product, called Electronic Parts Inventory Control (EPIC), was released in beta in 1966. It was renamed upon full release the following year as RAPIC. This was followed by the accounting and management software called LEASe and an accounts receivable product. At first clients sent hole-punched accounting records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is sent back to the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships. By 1986, the VIM-based dealer management computer systems had helped Reynolds acquire a 45 percent market- share and was on its fifth generation with 9,000 installations. In 1987 Reynolds moved to a software model with its first release of the ERA dealer management software, which was a complete rewrite of its prior programming. ERA allows users to manage logistics for sales, finance, service and parts across departments. That same year Reynolds developed a digital, graphical parts catalog program for selecting and ordering automotive parts. This was followed by the Vehicle Locators and Marketing Network sales toolsets. By 1997, Reynolds and Reynolds had more than 30 applications for various functions of a car dealership. In February 2000, Reynolds formed a joint venture with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and CCC Information Services, Inc. to create a web-based dealer-to-dealer parts network called ChoiceParts. In January 2002, Reynolds and Reynolds announced it was switching from a Unix to a Windows-based system for its core software. This caused \\"a flurry of discussion in the automobile market.\\" According to Automotive News, the Unix- based system could support more users, but the Microsoft software was compatible with more of the newer applications being used by dealerships. Reynolds also developed the Reynolds Generations Series Suite in collaboration with Microsoft, but the product was not successful in the marketplace. It was discontinued in 2005. In 2011 Reynolds and Reynolds introduced the current version of its dealer management software, called ERA-IGNITE, which reduced the number of screens needed to perform tasks by two-thirds. Reynolds and Reynolds offers Dealer Management Solutions, Document Services, Consulting and Training, and Data Management. ==ReferencesNotes * Official website * Category:Business services companies established in 1866 Category:1866 establishments in Ohio Category:Companies based in Dayton, Ohio Category:Service companies of the United States Category:Software companies based in Ohio Category:Software companies of the United States ","title":"Reynolds and Reynolds"},{"id":"6212361","text":"\\"Tripping on Your Love\\" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama. It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's fourth single in the UK and the first single in the United States. The track was co-written and produced by Youth. This is the last single released featuring member Jacquie O'Sullivan, and the group as a trio. The single is considered by Bananarama to be their biggest commercial flop in the UK, just missing the top 75 of the UK singles chart. It was originally intended to be the album's second single (following \\"Only Your Love\\") but was delayed as two different songs were released as singles. By the time \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" was issued, O'Sullivan had announced her departure from the group, and Bananarama's long-time manager Hillary Shaw also quit . In addition, group member Sara Dallin was pregnant with her first child, which made promotion nearly impossible. The song is a fusion of acid house, South Asian, rap, and Caribbean music. The album version was remixed by Robin Hancock before it was released as a single. It was not included on the original version of The Very Best of Bananarama, but a remix was included on a special edition bonus CD of the compilation. The single's biggest success came in U.S. dance clubs, climbing to number 14 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in December 1991. It would be Bananarama's last appearance on that chart until 2006 when \\"Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)\\" peaked at number two. The song boasts the most commissioned remixes of any Bananarama single (20 mixes by nine different remixers, including George Michael). In 2007, band-member Keren said she considered the song to be one of the band's best.True Confessions Over Lunch ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as a \\"percolating dance ditty\\" in his review and noted its \\"impressive remixes\\" by George Michael and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley. He added that \\"it's a winner\\". Kenny Thomas reviewed the song for Smash Hits, commenting, \\"I like the Indian sitar sound at the beginning and the reggae toasting bit. That was quite innovative and then it went straight into Bananarama.\\" ==Music video== The music video was directed by Eric Watson (photographer) and features the girls filmed in slow-moving cinematography on a beach dune, in front of a house, and in a car. As Sara Dallin was pregnant at the time, she was shot only from the shoulder upwards. ==Remixes== ; UK CD single # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Single Mix) - (3:15) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Euro Trance Mix) - (7:21) #: Remixed by Robin Hancock # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (The Loveable Love Dove Caper) - (6:26) ; CD promo single # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Euro Trance Mix) - (7:21) #: Remixed by Robin Hancock # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Indika Dub Mix) # \\"Only Your Love\\" (Hardcore Instrumental) ; Promo remixes 1 # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Silky Soul 70's Mix) - (6:24) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Silky Dub) - (5:17) #: Remixed by Steve 'Silk' Hurley # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (E-Smoove Chant Mix) - (7:06) #: Remixed by E-Smoove # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Maurice Wicked Mix) - (6:20) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Maurice Dub Mix) - (8:12) #: Remixed by Maurice Joshua # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Sturm Mix) - (3:59) #: Remixed by Larry Sturm ; Promo remixes 2 # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Silky Soul 70's Mix) - (6:24) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Silky Dub) - (5:17) #: Remixed by Steve 'Silk' Hurley # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (E-Smoove Chant Mix) - (7:06) #: Remixed by E-Smoove # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Maurice Wicked Mix) - (6:20) #: Remixed by E-Smoove # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Euro Trance Mix) - (7:21) #: Remixed by Robin Hancock # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (George Michael Metropolis Mix) - (3:37) #: Remixed by George Michael ; UK CD promo single NANXDJ 22 # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Euro Trance Mix) - (7:21) #: Remixed by Robin Hancock # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Indika Dub Mix) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Instrumental) ; Other versions # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Album Version) - (3:21) # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Sweet Exorcist Mix) #: Remixed by Sweet Exorcist # \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" (Sweet Exorcist Dub) #: Remixed by Sweet Exorcist ==Personnel== Bananarama * Sara Dallin - Vocals * Jacquie O'Sullivan - Vocals * Keren Woodward - Vocals == Charts == {  !align=\\"left\\"Chart (1991) !align=\\"left\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company) align=\\"center\\"76 - align=\\"left\\"US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play align=\\"center\\"14 - } ==References * Category:1991 singles Category:Bananarama songs Category:London Records singles Category:Songs written by Sara Dallin Category:Songs written by Martin Glover ","title":"Tripping on Your Love"},{"id":"6212365","text":"A data steward is a role within an organization responsible for utilizing an organization's data governance processes to ensure fitness of data elements - both the content and metadata. Data stewards have a specialist role that incorporates processes, policies, guidelines and responsibilities for administering organizations' entire data in compliance with policy and/or regulatory obligations. A data steward may share some responsibilities with a data custodian. The overall objective of a data steward is data quality, in regard to the key/critical data elements existing within a specific enterprise operating structure, of the elements in their respective domains. This includes documenting metainformation for their elements, such as definitions, related rules/governance, physical manifestation, and related data models. With most of these properties being specific to an attribute/concept relationship), identifying owners/custodians/various responsibilities, relations insight pertaining to attribute quality, aiding with project requirement data facilitation and documentation of capture rules. Data stewards begin the stewarding process with the identification of the elements which they will steward, with the ultimate result being standards, controls and data entry. The steward works closely with business glossary standards analysts (for standards), with data architect/modelers (for standards), with DQ analysts (for controls) and with operations team members (good-quality data going in per business rules) while entering data. Data stewardship roles are common when organizations attempt to exchange data precisely and consistently between computer systems and to reuse data-related resources. Master data management often makes references to the need for data stewardship for its implementation to succeed. Data stewardship must have precise purpose, fit for purpose or fitness. ==Data steward responsibilities== A data steward ensures that each assigned data element: # Has clear and unambiguous data element definition # Does not conflict with other data elements in the metadata registry (removes duplicates, overlap etc.) # Has clear enumerated value definitions if it is of type Code # Is still being used (remove unused data elements) # Is being used consistently in various computer systems # Is being used, fit for purpose = Data Fitness # Has adequate documentation on appropriate usage and notes # Documents the origin and sources of authority on each metadata element # Is protected against unauthorised access or change Responsibilities of data stewards vary between different organisations and institutions. For example, at Delft University of Technology, data stewards are perceived as the first contact point for any questions related to research data. They also have subject-specific background allowing them to easily connect with researchers and to contextualise data management problems to take into account disciplinary practices. ==Types of data stewards== Depending on the set of data stewardship responsibilities assigned to an individual, there are 4 types of data stewards typically found within an organization: # Data object data steward - responsible for managing reference data and attributes of one business data entity # Business data steward - responsible for managing critical data, both reference and transactional, created or used by one business function # Process data steward - responsible for managing data across one business process # System data steward - responsible for managing data for at least one IT system ==Benefits of data stewardship== Systematic data stewardship can foster fitness through: # Consistent use of data management resources # Easy mapping of data between computer systems and exchange documents # Lower costs associated with migration to (for example) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Assignment of each data element to a person sometimes seems like an unimportant process. But many groups have found that users have greater trust and usage rates in systems where they can contact a person with questions on each data element. == Examples == Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) offers an example of data stewardship implementation at a research institution. In 2017 the Data Stewardship Project was initiated at TU Delft to address research data management needs in a disciplinary manner across the whole campus. Dedicated data stewards with subject-specific background were appointed at every TU Delft faculty to support researchers with data management questions and to act as a linking point with the other institutional support services. The project is coordinated centrally by TU Delft Library, and it has its own website, blog and a YouTube channel. The EPA metadata registry furnishes an example of data stewardship. Note that each data element therein has a \\"POC\\" (point of contact). == Data stewardship applications == A new market for data governance applications is emerging, one in which both technical and business staff — stewards — manage policies. These new applications, like previous generations, deliver a strong business glossary capability, but they do not stop there. Vendors are introducing additional features addressing the roles of business in addition to technical stewards' concerns. Information stewardship applications are business solutions used by business users acting in the role of information steward (interpreting and enforcing information governance policy, for example). These developing solutions represent, for the most part, an amalgam of a number of disparate, previously IT-centric tools already on the market, but are organized and presented in such a way that information stewards (a business role) can support the work of information policy enforcement as part of their normal, business-centric, day-to-day work in a range of use cases. The initial push for the formation of this new category of packaged software came from operational use cases — that is, use of business data in and between transactional and operational business applications. This is where most of the master data management efforts are undertaken in organizations. However, there is also now a faster-growing interest in the new data lake arena for more analytical use cases. Some of the vendors in Metadata Management, like Alation, have started highlighting the importance of Data Stewards to employees interested in using data to make business decisions. ==See also== * Metadata * Metadata registry * Data curation * Data element * Data element definition * Representation term * ISO/IEC 11179 ==References== * Universal Meta Data Models, by David Marco and Michael Jennings, Wiley, 2004, page 93-94 *Metadata Solution by Adrinne Tannenbaum, Addison Wesley, 2002, page 412 * Building and Managing the Meta Data Repository, by David Marco, Wiley, 2000, pages 61–62 * The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, by Ralph Kimball et. el., Wiley, 1998, also briefly mentions the role of data steward in the context of data warehouse project management on page 70. * Developing Geospatial Intelligence Stewardship for Multinational Operations, by Jeff Thomas, US Army Command General Staff College, 2010, www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a524227.pdf. ==Notes== Category:Data management Category:Information technology governance Category:Knowledge representation Category:Library occupations Category:Metadata Category:Technical communication ","title":"Data steward"},{"id":"6212383","text":"In-Fisherman Bass Hunter 64 (known as Bass Hunter 64 outside North America) is a single-player fishing video game for the Nintendo 64 developed by GearHead Entertainment and published by Take-Two Interactive.

A Game Boy adaptation of the game, simply titled In-Fisherman Bass Hunter, was announced to be in development at Tarantula Studios on June 1, 1998, but ultimately stayed unreleased. ==Gameplay== A screenshot of In- Fisherman Bass Hunter 64 gameplay. Bass Hunter 64 is mainly a fishing tournament game with an optional \\"Fish for Fun\\" mode. The player can only play one portion of the first lake, and can choose whether they will have a male or female character to fish with. They begin with four lures, two line weights, reel, rod, and a boat, the remaining items in the game must be purchased by winning points in the tournament mode. Once each tournament is beaten another area will be unlocked for the player to use in either Tournament or Fun mode. Before a tournament begins the player can choose to shop and use their points to buy new lures, reels, and boats. There are 6 areas that can be unlocked: *Lake Arthur in Pennsylvania Hidden River, Dutch Hollow, Shannon Run *Butler Chain Lakes in Florida Lake Palmer, Lake Butler, Lake Chase When beginning to fish, the player is given a boat and can drive around in any of the areas that they have unlocked, and then can choose their reel, lure, and even the type of casting they will perform as they send the line out into the water. Once the line goes below the water a split screen view appears showing the area directly surrounding the lure. A depth finder and map are provided telling the depths of the various portions of that area, which can be accessed from the menu, that also has an option of allowing the weather to be changed. Outside of the water can be seen various man made items such as buildings, docks, bridges, while in the water are weeds, lily pads, logs, brush, and tree stumps. \\"Nintendo World\\", a Future Publishing magazine, described it as \\"about as much fun as getting a hook in the eye\\", adding \\"ultimately it's a one-paced and pretty unimaginative fishin' sim.\\" This game has three internal memory save slots and supports the Nintendo 64's Rumble Pak which can be used to feel when there is a bite at the line or the player is dragging their line along the bottom, by vibration feedback. ==Game licensees== The game has many 3D items that are representations of fully licensed products, such as lures and other such things from such manufactures as Heddon, Rapala, and Ranger Boats.

See picture of the Beckett Gravestone at http://www.samuel- beckett.net/samgrave.jpgSuzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil at findagrave.com was the lover and later wife of Samuel Beckett. In the 1930s, Beckett chose Déchevaux- Dumesnil as his lover over the heiress Peggy Guggenheim. Six years older than Beckett, Déchevaux-Dumesnil was an austere woman known for avant-garde tastes and left-wing politics. She was a pianist. During the Second World War, Beckett joined the French Resistance. For over two years, he and Déchevaux- Dumesnil hid from the Germans in a village in the South of France.Context of Happy Days at sparknotes.com Beckett's Waiting for Godot has been called \\"a metaphor for the long walk into Roussillon, when Beckett and Suzanne slept in haystacks... during the day and walked by night...\\"Bair, Deirdre, Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), pp 409, 410 During the relationship between Beckett and Déchevaux-Dumesnil, which lasted more than 50 years, she maintained a private circle of friends and is credited with having influenced Beckett to produce more work. During the late 1950s, Beckett often stayed in London, where he met Barbara Bray, a BBC script-editor, a widow in her 30s. James Knowlson writes of them: \\"Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted to her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.\\"Knowlson, James, Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), pp. 458, 459 Soon, their association became \\"a very intimate and personal one\\".Cronin, Anthony, Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 495 In a visit to Paris in January 1961, Bray told Beckett she had decided to move there.Knowlson, op. cit, p. 480 His response was unusual. In March 1961, he married Déchevaux-Dumesnil in a civil ceremony in Folkestone. On the face of it, this was to make sure that, if he died before her, Déchevaux-Dumesnil would inherit the rights to his work because there was no common-law marriage under French law. He may also have wanted to affirm his loyalty to her.

It is the intended replacement for Microsoft DirectShow, Windows Media SDK, DirectX Media Objects (DMOs) and all other so- called \\"legacy\\" multimedia APIs such as Audio Compression Manager (ACM) and Video for Windows (VfW). The existing DirectShow technology is intended to be replaced by Media Foundation step-by-step, starting with a few features. For some time there will be a co-existence of Media Foundation and DirectShow. Media Foundation will not be available for previous Windows versions, including Windows XP. The first release, present in Windows Vista, focuses on audio and video playback quality, high-definition content (i.e. HDTV), content protection and a more unified approach for digital data access control for digital rights management (DRM) and its interoperability. It integrates DXVA 2.0 for offloading more of the video processing pipeline to hardware, for better performance. Videos are processed in the colorspace they were encoded in, and are handed off to the hardware, which composes the image in its native colorspace. This prevents intermediate colorspace conversions to improve performance. MF includes a new video renderer, called Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR), which is the next iteration of VMR 7 and 9. EVR has better support for playback timing and synchronization. It uses the Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS), a new service that prioritizes real time multimedia processing, to reserve the resources required for the playback, without any tearing or glitches. The second release included in Windows 7 introduces expanded media format support and DXVA HD for acceleration of HD content if WDDM 1.1 drivers are used.DXVA-HD ==Architecture== Media Foundation Architecture The MF architecture is divided into the Control layer, Core Layer and the Platform layer. The core layer encapsulates most of the functionality of Media Foundation. It consists of the media foundation pipeline, which has three components: Media Source, Media Sink and Media Foundation Transforms (MFT). A media source is an object that acts as the source of multimedia data, either compressed or uncompressed. It can encapsulate various data sources, like a file, or a network server or even a camcorder, with source specific functionality abstracted by a common interface. A source object can use a source resolver object which creates a media source from an URI, file or bytestream. Support for non-standard protocols can be added by creating a source resolver for them. A source object can also use a sequencer object to use a sequence of sources (a playlist) or to coalesce multiple sources into single logical source. A media sink is the recipient of processed multimedia data. A media sink can either be a renderer sink, which renders the content on an output device, or an archive sink, which saves the content onto a persistent storage system such as a file. A renderer sink takes uncompressed data as input whereas an archive sink can take either compressed or uncompressed data, depending on the output type. The data from media sources to sinks are acted upon by MFTs; MFTs are certain functions which transform the data into another form. MFTs can include multiplexers and demultiplexers, codecs or DSP effects like reverb. The core layer uses services like file access and networking and clock synchronization to time the multimedia rendering. These are part of the Platform layer, which provides services necessary for accessing the source and sink byte streams, presentation clocks and an object model that lets the core layer components function asynchronously, and is generally implemented as OS services. Pausing, stopping, fast forward, reverse or time-compression can be achieved by controlling the presentation clock. However, the media pipeline components are not connected; rather they are just presented as discrete components. An application running in the Control layer has to choose which source types, transforms and sinks are needed for the particular video processing task at hand, and set up the \\"connections\\" between the components (a topology) to complete the data flow pipeline. For example, to play back a compressed audio/video file, the pipeline will consist of a file source object, a demultiplexer for the specific file container format to split the audio and video streams, codecs to decompress the audio and video streams, DSP processors for audio and video effects and finally the EVR renderer, in sequence. Or for a video capture application, the camcorder will act as video and audio sources, on which codec MFTs will work to compress the data and feed to a multiplexer that coalesces the streams into a container; and finally a file sink or a network sink will write it to a file or stream over a network. The application also has to co-ordinate the flow of data between the pipeline components. The control layer has to \\"pull\\" (request) samples from one pipeline component and pass it onto the next component in order to achieve data flow within the pipeline. This is in contrast to DirectShow's \\"push\\" model where a pipeline component pushes data to the next component. Media Foundation allows content protection by hosting the pipeline within a protected execution environment, called the Protected Media Path. The control layer components are required to propagate the data through the pipeline at a rate that the rendering synchronizes with the presentation clock. The rate (or time) of rendering is embedded as a part of the multimedia stream as metadata. The source objects extract the metadata and pass it over. Metadata is of two types: coded metadata, which is information about bit rate and presentation timings, and descriptive metadata, like title and author names. Coded metadata is handed over to the object that controls the pipeline session, and descriptive metadata is exposed for the application to use if it chooses to. Media Foundation provides a Media Session object that can be used to set up the topologies, and facilitate a data flow, without the application doing it explicitly. It exists in the control layer, and exposes a Topology loader object. The application specifies the required pipeline topology to the loader, which then creates the necessary connections between the components. The media session object manages the job of synchronizing with the presentation clock. It creates the presentation clock object, and passes a reference to it to the sink. It then uses the timer events from the clock to propagate data along the pipeline. It also changes the state of the clock to handle pause, stop or resume requests from the application. ===Practical MF Architectures=== Theoretically there is only one Media Foundation architecture and this is the Media Session, Pipeline, Media Source, Transform and Media Sink model. However this architecture can be complex to set up and there is considerable scope for lightweight, relatively easy to configure MF components designed to handle the processing of media data for simple point solutions. Thus practical considerations necessitated the implementation of variations on the fundamental Pipeline design and components such as the Source Reader and Sink Writer which operate outside the Pipeline model were developed. Some sources Example Source split the Media Foundation architecture into three general classes. * The Pipeline Architecture * The Reader-Writer Architecture * Hybrids between the Pipeline and Reader-Writer Architectures The Pipeline Architecture is distinguished by the use of a distinct Media Session object and Pipeline. The media data flows from one or more Media Sources to one or more Media Sinks and, optionally, through zero or more Media Transforms. It is the Media Session that manages the flow of the media data through the Pipeline and that Pipeline can have multiple forks and branches. An MF application can get access to the media data as it traverses from a Media Source to a Media Sink by implementing a custom Media Transform component and inserting it in an appropriate location in the Pipeline. The Reader-Writer Architecture uses a component called a Source Reader to provide the media data and a Sink Writer component to consume it. The Source Reader does contain a type of internal pipeline but this is not accessible to the application. A Source Reader is not a Media Source and a Sink Writer is not a Media Sink and neither can be directly included in a Pipeline or managed by a Media Session. In general, the media data flows from the Source Reader to the Sink Writer by the actions of the application. The application will either take the packets of media data (called Media Samples) from the Source Reader and give them directly them to the Sink Writer or it will set up a callback function on the Source Reader which performs the same operation. In effect, as it manages the data transport, the application itself performs a similar role to that of the Media Session in a Pipeline Architecture application. Since the MF application manages the transmission of the Media Samples between the Source Reader and Sink Writer it will always have access to the raw media data. The Source Reader and Sink Writer components do have a limited ability to automatically load Media Transforms to assist with the conversion of the format of the media data, however, this is done internally and the application has little control over it. The Source Reader and Sink Writer provide ease of use and the Pipeline Architecture offers extremely sophisticated control over the flow of the media data. However, many of the components available to a Pipeline (such as the Enhanced Video Renderer) are simply not readily usable in a Reader- Writer architecture application. Since the structure of a Media Sample produced by a Source Reader is identical to that output by a Media Source it is possible to set up a Pipeline Architecture in which the Media Samples are intercepted as they pass through the Pipeline and a copy is given to a Media Sink. This is known as a Hybrid Architecture and it makes it possible to have an application which takes advantage of the sophisticated processing abilities of the Media Session and Pipeline while utilizing the ease of use of a Sink Writer. The Sink Writer is not part of the Pipeline and it does not interact with the Media Session. In effect, the media data is processed by a special Media Sink called a Sample Grabber Sink which consumes the media data and hands a copy off to the Sink Writer as it does so. It is also possible to implement a Hybrid Architecture with a custom Media Transform which copies the Media Samples and passes them to a Sink Writer as they pass through the Pipeline. In both cases a special component in the Pipeline effectively acts like a simple Reader-Writer application and feeds a Sink Writer. In general, Hybrid Architectures use a Pipeline and a Sink Writer. Theoretically, it is possible to implement a mechanism in which a Source Reader could somehow inject Media Samples into a Pipeline but, unlike the Sample Grabber Sink, no such standard component exists. ===Media Foundation Transform=== Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs) represent a generic model for processing media data. They are used in Media Foundation primarily to implement decoders, encoders, mixers and digital signal processors (DSPs) – between media sources and media sinks. Media Foundation Transforms are an evolution of the transform model first introduced with DirectX Media Objects (DMOs). Their behaviors are more clearly specified. Hybrid DMO/MFT Objects can also be created. Applications can use MFTs inside the Media Foundation pipeline, or use them directly as stand-alone objects. MFTs can be any of the following type: * Audio and video codecs * Audio and video effects * Multiplexers and demultiplexers * Tees * Color-space converters * Sample-rate converters * Video scalers Microsoft recommends developers to write a Media Foundation Transform instead of a DirectShow filter, for Windows Vista, Windows 7 & Windows 8. For video editing and video capture, Microsoft recommends using DirectShow as they are not the primary focus of Media Foundation in Windows Vista. Starting with Windows 7, MFTs also support hardware-accelerated video processing, encoding and decoding for AVStream-based media devices.Getting Started with Hardware Codec Support in AVStream ===Enhanced Video Renderer=== Media Foundation uses the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) for rendering video content, which acts as a mixer as well. It can mix up to 16 simultaneous streams, with the first stream being a reference stream. All but the reference stream can have per-pixel transparency information, as well as any specified z-order. The reference stream cannot have transparent pixels, and has a fixed z-order position, at the back of all streams. The final image is composited onto a single surface by coloring each pixel according to the color and transparency of the corresponding pixel in all streams. Internally, the EVR uses a mixer object for mixing the streams. It can also deinterlace the output and apply color correction, if required. The composited frame is handed off to a presenter object, which schedules them for rendering onto a Direct3D device, which it shares with the DWM and other applications using the device. The frame rate of the output video is synchronized with the frame rate of the reference stream. If any of the other streams (called substreams) have a different frame rate, EVR discards the extra frames (if the substream has a higher frame rate), or uses the same frame more than once (if it has a lower frame rate). ===Supported media formats=== Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video are the only default supported formats for encoding through Media Foundation in Windows Vista. For decoding, an MP3 file source is available in Windows Vista to read MP3 streams but an MP3 file sink to output MP3 is only available in Windows 7.Supported Media Formats in Media Foundation Format support is extensible however; developers can add support for other formats by writing encoder/decoder MFTs and/or custom media sources/media sinks. Windows 7 expands upon the codec support available in Windows Vista. It includes AVI, WAV, AAC/ADTS file sources to read the respective formats, an MPEG-4 file source to read MP4, M4A, M4V, MP4V, MOV and 3GP container formats MPEG-4 File Source and an MPEG-4 file sink to output to MP4 format.MPEG-4 File Sink Similar to Windows Vista, transcoding (encoding) support is not exposed through any built-in Windows application but several codecs are included as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). In addition to Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video encoders and decoders, and ASF file sink and file source introduced in Windows Vista, Windows 7 includes an H.264 encoder with Baseline profile level 3 and Main profile support H.264 Video Encoder and an AAC Low Complexity (AAC-LC) profile encoder AAC Encoder For playback of various media formats, Windows 7 also introduces an H.264 decoder with Baseline, Main, and High-profile support, up to level 5.1,H.264 Video Decoder AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1 (SBR) multichannel, HE-AAC v2 (PS) stereo decoders,AAC Decoder MPEG-4 Part 2 Simple Profile and Advanced Simple Profile decoders MPEG4 Part 2 Video Decoder which includes decoding popular codec implementations such as DivX, Xvid and Nero Digital as well as MJPEG and DV DV Video Decoder MFT decoders for AVI. Windows Media Player 12 uses the built-in Media Foundation codecs to play these formats by default. MIDI playback is also not yet supported using Media Foundation. ==Application support== Applications that support Media Foundation include: * Windows Media Player in Windows Vista and later * Windows Media Center in Windows Vista and later * Firefox v24 and later on Windows 7 and later (only for H.264 playback) * GoldWave 5.60 and later relies on Media Foundation for importing and exporting audio. For export, AAC and Apple Lossless formats can be saved via Media Foundation Any application that uses Protected Media Path in Windows also uses Media Foundation. ==References * Microsoft Media Foundation SDK * Media Foundation Development Forum *Media Foundation Team Blog (with samples) *Media Source Metadata *Media Foundation Pipeline *Media Foundation Architecture *About the Media Session *About the Media Foundation SDK *Enhanced Video Renderer *Windows Media Foundation: Getting Started in C# Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology Category:Microsoft application programming interfaces Category:Multimedia frameworks Category:Windows Vista ","title":"Media Foundation"},{"id":"6212429","text":"Skelton is a small hamlet in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England.

Gribble, Alcibiades and Athens, 32-33 Aristophanes mentions Alcibiades several times in his satirical plays, for instance making fun of his manner of speech and his lisp. According to Aristophanes the Athenian people \\"yearns for him, and hates him too, but wants him back\\".Aristophanes, Frogs, 1425 Aeschylus in Aristophanes' Frogs illustrates Alcibiades' ambivalent personality saying:Aristophanes, Frogs, 1432-1433 Aeschylus sees Alcibiades as a powerful creation arousing admiration, but also as a \\"savage figure\\" unacceptable and dangerous when released in the city.D. Gribble, Alcibiades and Athens, 1 ==Socratic dialogues== Pietro Testa (1611-1650): The Drunken Alcibiades Interrupting the Symposium (1648) Alcibiades also appears in several Socratic dialogues: * Plato's Symposium where he appears to be in love with Socrates. * There are two dialogues from antiquity titled \\"Alcibiades\\", ascribed to Plato, that feature Socrates in conversation with Alcibiades: First Alcibiades (or Alcibiades I) and Second Alcibiades (or Alcibiades II). Some scholars, however, consider them spurious. According to Plato, Alcibiades is an extraordinary soul, an embodiment of the pursuit of worldly power. What is extraordinary for the philosopher, however, is not the deeds that result but the soul itself, especially that selfish passion for what is best for himself beyond the conventional offices and honors. For Plato, Alcibiades embodies the culmination of politics, but that culmination that seeks a grand and almost god-like superiority that transcends politics. Plato presents Alcibiades as a youthful student and lover of Socrates who would, in time to come, be the ruin of Athens through his change of allegiance in war.[6] Because of the high level of esteem for the community in ancient Greece, Alcibiades’ betrayal of his fellow soldiers ensures that he is looked down upon in all of Plato’s writings. He is indirectly ridiculed, often portrayed as intoxicated, boisterous, and seeking pleasure. According to Habinek, his appearance in Plato's Symposium conforms to the pattern of Alcibiades literature: Alcibiades is always just what is wanted.[7] Good looking, eloquent, witty, and easy to look down upon. In his trial, Socrates must rebut the attempt to hold him guilty for the crimes of his former students, including Alcibiades, Critias and Charmides.G.A. Scott, Plato's Socrates as Educator, 19 Hence, he declares in Apology: \\"I have never been anyone's teacher\\", responding to quite concrete circumstances and recent events (mutilation of the hermai, betrayal of Athens by Alcibiades in the middle of the Peloponnesian War, regime of the Thirty Tyrants).Plato, Apology, 33a ==Literature== In medieval and Renaissance works such as the Canterbury Tales, Erasmus's adage The Sileni of Alcibiades, Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, Montaigne's Essays, Shakespeare's Timon of Athens, and Thomas Otway's tragedy Alcibiades, Alcibiades is presented as a military commander and student of Socratic teaching.N.

Afterword\\", http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alcibiades_the_Schoolboy Alcibiades constituted also a source of inspiration for certain modern novelists, especially those writing historical novels. In On the Knees of the Gods (1908), Anna Bowman Dodd covers Alcibiades' expedition against Sicily.J. Nield, A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales, 4 The Jealous Gods (1928) of Gertrude Atherton is another novel about Alcibiades and ancient Athens. In Steven Pressfield's Tides of War, it was the character of Alcibiades who loomed most large over the narrative, just as he had the greatest impact on the Peloponnesian War. Undefeated during his career as a general and admiral, Alcibiades’ life played itself out like an epic tragedy with the tensions between his genius and the hubris that was his ultimate downfall. In Daniel Chavarría's novel, The Eye Of Cybele, a novel that fictionally recreates the behind-the-scenes scandals and political intrigues that occupied the Athenian home front at the height of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades is the central character and he is depicted as one of the Athens' most powerful generals and as a leading competitor for the favor of both Pericles and the masses. Alcibiades also appears in the satirical novel Picture This by Joseph Heller. Other modern works featuring Alcibiades as a main character include: *Machado de Assis' short story \\"Uma Visita de Alcebíades\\" (1875) is about Alcibiades showing up to a police officer in 19th century Brazil. *Erik Satie's Socrate (1918), a work for voice and small orchestra (or piano) (The text is composed of excerpts of Victor Cousin's translation of works by Plato, all of the chosen texts referring to Socrates.) *Peter Green's Achilles His Armour (1955),T.

In the game, Alcibiades gives the protagonist several quests, and is also an optional romance option for sexual encounters. True to his historic nature, many of his quests have hidden motivations that assist him in gaining financial and political power, however he is depicted positively, siding with the main characters against the game's antagonists. Alcibiades appears in the first season of the webcomic Everywhere & Nowhere in a main capacity.

It is located only 2 km south of the border with Germany. ==History== Baldingen is first mentioned in 1317 as Baldingen, although the area had already been settled by the Alamanni for centuries. During the Middle Ages it was the seat of a minor noble family. Until 1415 it was under the high court of the Habsburgs. After the conquest of the Aargau, it was part of the County of Baden. The court and justice rights were held by a large number of private owners. Aerial view from 2000 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1923) It was part of the parish of Zurzach until 1883 when it joined with Böbikon to form their own parish. The parish church of St. Agatha, a Catholic neo-Gothic structure with Art Nouveau elements, was built in 1898 by Charles Moser. Baldingen's economy was, until very recently, based strongly on agriculture. In 1970 about 54% of the jobs were in agriculture, and by 1990 about one- fourth (23%) of the jobs were still in agriculture. The remaining workforce is almost exclusively commuters, as there are no industrial and commercial enterprises in the village. The population significantly increased after the 1980s, when new single-family houses filled in the gap between the two parts of the village. ==Geography== Baldingen village and church Baldingen has an area, , of .

They usually inhabit deepwater rocky habitats, though they are occasionally encountered in shallow water, and have been known to return to the same location year after year. This rare species is often mistaken for the much more common grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus), from which it can be distinguished by its first dorsal fin, which is larger than the second and placed further forward. It grows to at least 4.1 m (13.5 ft) in length. Very little is known of the biology and behavior of the smalltooth sand tiger. It is an active predator of benthic bony fishes, invertebrates, and cartilaginous fishes. This species is thought to be ovoviviparous with oophagous embryos like other mackerel sharks. In contrast to its formidable size and appearance, this shark is harmless, having never been known to behave aggressively towards humans. Concern exists that its numbers are declining due to human activities in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, though existing data are inadequate for a full assessment of its conservation status. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== The smalltooth sand tiger was originally described as Squalus ferox by Italian-French naturalist Antoine Risso in 1810, based on a specimen from Nice, France. In 1950, Gilbert Percy Whitley described O. herbsti from Australian specimens, separating them from O. ferox on the basis of dentition and the absence of spots. Leonard Compagno synonymized the two species in 1984, as subsequently discovered Pacific specimens had blurred Whitley's distinguishing characters. The specific epithet ferox is Latin for \\"fierce\\". Other common names for this shark include blue nurse shark, fierce shark, Herbst's nurse shark, and sand tiger shark. A phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, performed by Naylor et al. in 1997, suggests that the smalltooth sand tiger and its relative, the bigeye sand tiger (O. noronhai), are more closely related to the thresher sharks than to the grey nurse shark, to which it bears a strong resemblance. If true, this would indicate that the similarities between this species and the grey nurse shark arose as the result of convergent evolution. Fossil teeth belonging to the smalltooth sand tiger have been found from Lower Pliocene from 5.3 to 3.6 million years ago (Mya) in deposits in Italy and Venezuela. ==Description== The smalltooth sand tiger has a bulky body with a long, bulbous, slightly flattened snout. The eyes are medium-sized, with large, round pupils (as opposed to slit-like in the grey nurse shark), and lack nictitating membranes. The mouth is large and filled with projecting teeth. Each tooth has a narrow, tall central cusp flanked by two or three pairs of lateral cusplets. Some 48-56 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 36-46 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the front large teeth in the upper jaw are separated from the lateral teeth by two to five intermediate teeth. The fins are broad-based and angular in shape. The first dorsal fin is larger than the second and placed closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is strongly asymmetrical with the upper lobe much longer than the lower. The coloration is gray to gray-brown above and lighter below. Juveniles are uniform in color with darker fin margins, while adults often exhibit dark spots or blotches that vary widely in pattern, size, and density. Coloration also appears to vary by region, with some individuals from the Mediterranean displaying a patchy, \\"piebald\\" pattern. The smalltooth sand tiger attains a maximum length of 4.1 m (13.5 ft) and a maximum weight of 289 kg (637 lbs). There are unconfirmed reports of much larger individuals from Malpelo Island off Colombia. File:Odontaspis ferox 4.jpgThe smalltooth sand tiger has unequal- sized dorsal fins.

In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Bay of Biscay south to Morocco, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. In the western Atlantic, it has been reported from off North Carolina and Florida (USA), the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), and Fernando de Noronha (Brazil). It occurs throughout the Indian Ocean, from South Africa, Madagascar, and Tanzania in the west to the Maldives and the Southwest Indian Ridge in the east. In the northern Pacific, it is known from off Japan, Hawaii, California, and Colombia, and in the southern Pacific it is known from New Caledonia, eastern Australia, and New Zealand. In New Zealand, this species can be found off the coasts of the Bay of Plenty, New Plymouth, and Hawkes Bay. It has also been filmed near Raoul Island. Typically regarded as a deepwater species, smalltooth sand tigers have been caught down to 880 m (2,900 ft). They are usually found near the bottom in rocky, boulder-strewn regions on continental shelves and the upper continental slope, as well as around submarine ridges and mountains. The species has been reported near the drop-offs of rocky or coral reefs and in the upper layers of the open ocean. In the Mediterranean, smalltooth sand tigers occur at depths less than 250 m (820 ft), including at depths accessible to divers. They have been seen swimming over sandy flats at Cocos Island and Fernando de Noronha. The temperature range favored by this species is 6-20 °C (43-63 °F); in hot climates, they are found below the thermocline in cooler water. ==Biology and ecology== Smalltooth sand tiger at the Northampton Seamount: In the open ocean, this species is strongly associated with submarine ridges and seamounts. The smalltooth sand tiger is a strong-swimming shark that may be encountered singly or in aggregations of up to five individuals. Catch records suggest this species may cover long distances in oceanic waters along underwater ridges or \\"hopping\\" between seamounts. It has a very large, oily liver, which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with minimal effort. At a location called \\"Shark Point\\" off Beirut, Lebanon, small groups of smalltooth sand tigers appear every summer on rocky reefs at a depth of 30-45 m (100-150 ft). The same individuals have been documented returning to this site year after year. Their purpose there is unknown, being speculated to relate to mating. When confronted, these sharks have been observed to stall, gape their mouths, turn around, and shake their tails towards the perceived threat. Adult smalltooth sand tigers have no known predators, though they are bitten by cookiecutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). A known parasite is the tapeworm Lithobothrium gracile, which infests the shark's spiral valve intestine. The carcass of a 3.7-m-long (12.1 ft) female found off Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands contained a number of snubnosed eels (Simenchelys parasitica) inside her heart, body cavity, and back muscles. Whether the eels contributed to the shark's death is unknown. ===Feeding=== A smalltooth sand tiger at a hydrothermal vent on the Kasuga-2 submarine volcano: Smaller individuals such as this tend to remain in deeper water. Compared to the grey nurse shark, the dentition of the smalltooth sand tiger is less robust and lacks specialized cutting and crushing teeth, suggesting that it tends to tackle smaller prey. The diet of the smalltooth sand tiger consists of bottom-dwelling bony fishes such as rockfish (Sebastes spp.), invertebrates such as squid, shrimp, and possibly marine isopods, and cartilaginous fishes including rays and chimaeras. The largest known prey item taken by this species was a 1.3-m-long (4.3 ft) kitefin shark (Dalatias licha), found inside the stomach of a 2.9-m-long (9.5 ft) male from New Caledonia. ===Life history=== No pregnant smalltooth sand tigers have ever been found; this species is presumed to be ovoviviparous as in other mackerel sharks. Villaviencio-Garayzar (1996) described a 3.6-m (11.8 ft) female from the Gulf of California that contained \\"hundreds of ova\\" in her right ovary, which would support the embryos being oophagous. Whether the embryos also cannibalize each other as in the grey nurse shark is unknown. The size at birth is estimated to be 1.0-1.1 m (3.3-3.6 ft). With a few recorded exceptions, juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m (660 ft); this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large, shallow-water predators such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Males mature at a length of 2.0-2.5 m (6.6-8.2 ft) and females at a length of 3.0-3.5 m (9.4-11.5 ft). Faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship. ==Human interactions== Encounters with divers have shown that, despite their size, smalltooth sand tigers are docile and do not react aggressively even when closely approached. This species is taken as bycatch in gillnets and bottom trawls, and on longlines; most captures occur in the Mediterranean and off Japan. It is usually discarded when caught, except in Japan, where the meat is consumed (though considered very inferior to the grey nurse shark) and the liver oil is used. The fins, jaws, and cartilage are also of value. Discoveries, beginning in the 1970s, of smalltooth sand tigers in shallow water have raised urgent conservation concerns, as this species is apparently more vulnerable to human activity than previously believed. At present, data are insufficient for the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess the worldwide conservation status of this species. It has been assessed as vulnerable in Australian waters, due to a decline over 50% in catches off New South Wales since the 1970s. In June 2018, the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the smalltooth sand tiger as \\"At Risk – Naturally Uncommon\\" with the qualifier \\"Threatened Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Populations of this species in the Mediterranean are also believed to have declined, due to a combination of habitat degradation, overfishing, pollution, and human disturbance. The smalltooth sand tiger has been protected by the Australian government since 1984; this came about concurrently with protection for the grey nurse shark, which had been decimated in Australian waters, so as to prevent any claims of confusing one species for the other. However, these regulations have proven difficult to enforce. ==References * Shark-References.com: \\"Species description of Odontaspis ferox\\" * ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research: \\"Biology of the Ragged-Tooth Shark\\" (Odontaspis ferox) smalltooth sand tiger Category:Fish of the Adriatic Sea Category:Fish of New Zealand Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish of Oceania Category:Natural history of the Yucatán Peninsula Category:Vulnerable animals Category:Vulnerable biota of Africa Category:Vulnerable fauna of Asia Category:Vulnerable biota of Europe Category:Vulnerable fauna of Oceania smalltooth sand tiger Category:Taxa named by Antoine Risso ","title":"Smalltooth sand tiger"},{"id":"6212553","text":"The Kupa is a small river in northern Lithuania and a left tributary of the Lėvuo.LIETUVOS RESPUBLIKOS UPIŲ IR TVENKINIŲ KLASIFIKATORIUS (Republic of Lithuania- River and Pond Classifications).

The name derives from Old French and literally means Chapel in the valley. It was first recorded as Chappell ith Dale in 1677. Historically, the hamlet, and its parish, were both in the Wapentake of Ewcross and up until 1974, they were in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The hamlet is in close proximity to Ingleborough and Whernside and there are several potholes in the vicinity, the best known being Great Douk Cave. There is a pub in the village, The Old Hill Inn, which is used as a starting and ending point for various walks on Whernside or Ingleborough. The source of the River Doe is nearby. The lych gate of St Leonards Church, Chapel-le-Dale There is a church in the hamlet (The Church of St Leonard) which is now a grade II listed building. It was used as a burial plot for the navvies, and their family members, who died whilst constructing the nearby Ribblehead Viaduct between 1869 and 1876. In all, over 200 people died during the construction from accidents and outbreaks of smallpox.

The algorithm uses the same mathematical principles as the Buchberger algorithm, but computes many normal forms in one go by forming a generally sparse matrix and using fast linear algebra to do the reductions in parallel. The Faugère F5 algorithm first calculates the Gröbner basis of a pair of generator polynomials of the ideal. Then it uses this basis to reduce the size of the initial matrices of generators for the next larger basis: > If Gprev is an already computed Gröbner basis (f2, …, fm) and we want to > compute a Gröbner basis of (f1) + Gprev then we will construct matrices > whose rows are m f1 such that m is a monomial not divisible by the leading > term of an element of Gprev. This strategy allows the algorithm to apply two new criteria based on what Faugère calls signatures of polynomials. Thanks to these criteria, the algorithm can compute Gröbner bases for a large class of interesting polynomial systems, called regular sequences, without ever simplifying a single polynomial to zero—the most time-consuming operation in algorithms that compute Gröbner bases. It is also very effective for a large number of non- regular sequences. == Implementations == The Faugère F4 algorithm is implemented * in FGb, Faugère's own implementation, which includes interfaces for using it from C/C++ or Maple, * in Maple computer algebra system, as the option method=fgb of function Groebner[gbasis] * in the Magma computer algebra system, * in the SageMath computer algebra system, Study versions of the Faugère F5 algorithm is implemented in * the SINGULAR computer algebra system; * the SageMath computer algebra system. * in SymPy Python package.https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/polys/internals.html#groebner- basis-algorithms == Applications == The previously intractable \\"cyclic 10\\" problem was solved by F5, as were a number of systems related to cryptography; for example HFE and C*. ==References== * * * Till Stegers Faugère's F5 Algorithm Revisited (alternative link).

Jean- Claude, born on 7 August 1790 at the hamlet of Barbery, in the Beaujolais region of central France. He was their eighth child. All told, nine children were born into the family. Claudine, Jean, Mariette, Sébastien, Jeanne-Marie, Pierre, Anne-Marie (who died at birth), Jean-Claude, and Joseph. Jean-Claude’s oldest sister Claudine was his godmother, and his brother Jean was his godfather, hence the baby’s name Jean-Claude. His parents owned and cultivated a piece of land, and during the winter turned to weaving.\\"Jean-Claude Colin\\", A Certain Way The Revolution and the subsequent Civil Constitution of the Clergy brought a split into the Church, separating priests who supported the Constitution from those who remained faithful to Rome. Jean-Claude’s parents supported the clergy loyal to Rome. An order of arrest was issued against Jacques Colin who had openly supported the parish priest, Father Cabuchet. Jacques had to hide for a year: his house was boarded up and all his goods were sold. In 1795 Marie Colin died, aged 37. Jacques Colin died not quite three weeks later, leaving the children orphaned. Jean Claude was not yet five years old. He was put under the care of a paternal uncle, Sébastien, who lived at Saint-Bonnet-le-Troncy. Sébastien was a bachelor who employed a housekeeper, Marie Echallier, to look after the children of the Colin household. This lady was a deeply religious woman, but one of those for whom religion and guilt seemed to go hand in hand. In these years Jean-Claude developed a scrupulosity which gave him much trouble, but which was in later life to make sensitive to burdened people.\\"Marist Founder: Jean Claude Colin\\", Roncallli College, NZ At the age of fourteen Jean-Claude and his brother Pierre, entered the minor seminary of Saint-Jodard, a secondary school for boys preparing for priesthood, and hoping to spend a life of quiet prayer in a gentle ministry. The disciplined lifestyle, obedience and piety came easily to him. The River Loire was nearby, close enough for the lads of St Jodard to enjoy its banks and summer waters. In 1809 Jean-Claude continued his secondary studies at Alix, and finally at Verrières-en-Forez, where he was a contemporary of Marcellin Champagnat and John Vianney. Despite being beset with serious illness and questions raised about his suitability for an active life, Jean-Claude handled his studies without difficulty and was among the top students.\\"Who is Jean-Claude Colin?\\", Marist Fathers At the end of the summer of 1813 Jean-Claude set off for the major seminary of Saint Irenaeus at Lyon for the final years of preparation for the priesthood. He was twenty-three years old. Here he met with Jean-Claude Courveille. Towards the end of 1814 Jean-Claude Courveille, who had been a student in another seminary, transferred to Saint Irenaeus. His diocese had been suppressed and merged into Lyon. Courveille had been cured of semi-blindness after prayer to Our Lady of Le Puy and in gratitude had the inspiration and inner conviction that just as there had arisen at the time of the Reformation a Society dedicated to Jesus, the Jesuits, so at this time of Revolution there could be a Society dedicated to Mary whose members would call themselves Marists. Courveille recruited a group of senior seminarians to his idea of founding a Society of Mary. On 22 July 1816, several deacons of St Irenaeus were ordained priests of the Lyon diocese. They included Colin, Courveille and a youthful Marcellin Champagnat. Next day, 23 July, a group of twelve climbed the hill to the shrine of Notre- Dame de Fourvière overlooking Lyons to the ancient chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Here, they pledged to establish the Society of Mary as soon as they could. Colin celebrated his first Mass at Salles on 26 July. Newly ordained Frs Courveille and Champagnat were also dispatched at once to parishes in the Lyon archdiocese. ==Curate== The still shy Jean-Claude Colin was sent to the parish of his older brother, Fr Pierre Colin, in the village of Cerdon nestling high in the Bugey mountains in the newly restored diocese of Belley. While serving as assistant pastor at Cerdon, in the Diocese of Lyons, he drew up provisional rules for the Society of Mary. Pierre was eager to join the Marist Project and he convinced Jean-Marie Chavoin and Marie Jotillon to begin it with them. The town of Cerdon having passed to the newly reorganized Diocese of Belley, Colin obtained from its bishop, Mgr. Devie, permission to take a few companions and preach missions in the Bugey a poor and somewhat neglected part of the diocese. Their number increased, and in spite of the opposition of the bishop, who wished to make the society a diocesan congregation, Colin obtained (1834) from Gregory XVI the Papal bull approving the Lay Confraternity or Association of the Blessed Virgin Mary for the Conversion of Sinners and the Perseverance of the Just. In 1836 Pope Gregory XVI gave canonical approbation of the Society of Mary (priests and brothers) as an order with simple vows.Sollier, Joseph. \\"Jean-Claude-Marie Colin.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 26 Feb. 2013 ==Society of Mary== He was asked to take over the College of Belley as Principal and when Rome approved the Society of Mary in 1836 he was elected as its first Superior General. During the eighteen years of his administration (1836-1854) Colin showed great activity, organizing the different branches of his society, founding in France missionary houses and colleges. Rome assigned the new Society the evangelisation of the Vicariate of Western Oceania. In 1817 the Colin brothers invited two young women to come to Cerdon to begin the Sisters of the Congregation of Mary. One was to become its foundress: Jeanne-Marie Chavoin. Meanwhile, Father Champagnat was establishing the Brothers' branch in his first parish of La Valla. Always he saw Jean- Claude Colin as the leader of the Marist project. In 1850 the Papal approval for the laity was amended establishing the Lay branch of the Society as the Third Order of Mary. Laity were integral to Colin's vision for the Society of Mary from its earliest beginnings and he worked closely with laity at the parish in Cerdon. Laity are now involved in all parts of the world and his lay legacy is still particularly strong in Oceania. In 1854 Colin resigned the office of superior general and retired to Notre-Dame-de-la-Neylière, where he spent the last twenty years of his life revising and completing the Constitutions. The Constitutions of the Society of Mary were definitively approved by the Holy See on 28 February 1873. Jean-Claude Colin died at La Neylière two years later on 15 November 1875.

This ward stretches north to Kirkby Fleetham with a total population of approximately 1800 (as of 2005) and of 1,966 at the 2011 census. ==Geography== Leeming Bar's name is derived from the fact that it housed a Toll-House with a barrier that travellers were expected to pay at for onward travel beyond the barrier. Around 1840, the barrier was moved further south towards Leeming village, as a quirk in the local bye-laws meant that people did not have to pay for travelling within of the crossroads on either Dere Street or the Bedale to Northallerton road. RAF Leeming Located just to east of the A1(M) motorway and near RAF Leeming, it is home to the main depot of the Wensleydale Railway at Leeming Bar railway station as well as the Dales & District bus company. It was first bypassed in 1961, again in 2012, and lies on the Roman road Dere Street. It is approximately along the old A684 from the village of Aiskew and along the same road from the town of Northallerton. The A684 bypass was opened up in August 2016. ==Amenities== Methodist Church It contains a C of E church, a C of E primary School with an average of 100 pupils as well as a Regency Pizza place, which was once the village's local corner shop and post office up until 2006 when it closed down, and two parks. There are three pubs, two of which, the White Rose Hotel on Bedale Road, and the Corner House are also hotels. The other is the Willow Tree Inn on Roman Road. A new Co-op store was opened up at the junction of Roman Road and Bedale Road in the village in July 2017. The Leeming Bar service station was set up at the junction of the old A1 road and the A684 road on the western edge of the village in 1961. In 2012, it won an appeal to become an official motorway service station and was sold to Moto in 2014. The Services now lie on the adjacent A6055 local access road that has a junction with the A1(M) just to the north of Leeming Bar (junction 51). Services on the A6055 road at Leeming Bar A second service station with access to the A684 and the A1(M) at junction 51 was opened at Coneygarth in December 2014. The Coneygarth Truck Stop is run by Exelby Services who closed down their refuelling point in nearby Londonderry to run the new service station. The site is just to the north of Leeming Bar village. ==Industry== The old Brickworks An industrial agricultural business trades alongside the main road in Leeming Bar. John H Gill & Son have been in the village since 1937 when they bought out the foundry of F Mattison & Co. Run by William Mattison, the company made much agricultural machinery at their foundry which was built on railway land at Leeming Bar. However, the company was known mostly for its cast-iron mileposts, of which about 100 survive across North Yorkshire. Leeming Bar is host to an industrial estate that houses, among other things, the headquarters of Froneri, who make Fab and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles ice lollies.http://www.rr-icecream.eu/ A household waste recycling site is also on the industrial estate. The John Gill works The Vale of Mowbray food factory is also in the village. The factory has suffered two fires in the 21st century; in 2002 a major fire caused an industrial oven to explode and led to the company being prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive. In 2017, another fire led to 10,000 smoke damaged pork pies being destroyed by the company. ==References * The Lodge * Aiskew Leeming Bar C of E primary school Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Hambleton District ","title":"Leeming Bar"},{"id":"6212736","text":"Marula may refer to: * Sclerocarya birrea, a tree native to Africa ** Marula oil, extracted from the fruits of Sclerocarya birrea * Marula, Zimbabwe, a village in Matabeleland South Province * Marula mine, an open pit mine in South Africa * Marula (poet) (fl. 13th century or earlier), Sanskrit poet from India ","title":"Marula"},{"id":"6212745","text":"The Northern Ireland Law Commission is a Law Commission in Northern Ireland created under section 50 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, implementing recommendations following the Good Friday Agreement.

In WCDMA FDD cellular systems, CPICH is a downlink channel broadcast by Node Bs with constant power and of a known bit sequence. Its power is usually between 5% and 15% of the total Node B transmit power. Commonly, the CPICH power is 10% of the typical total transmit power of 43 dBm. The Primary Common Pilot Channel is used by the UEs to first complete identification of the Primary Scrambling Code used for scrambling Primary Common Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH) transmissions from the Node B. Later CPICH channels provide allow phase and power estimations to be made, as well as aiding discovery of other radio paths. There is one primary CPICH (P-CPICH) for each Cell, which is transmitted using spreading code 0 with a spreading factor of 256, notationally written as Cch,256,0.25.213, section 5.2.1 \\"Channelisation codes\\" Optionally a Node B may broadcast one or more secondary common pilot channels (S-CPICH), which use arbitrarily chosen 256 codes, written as Cch,256,n where 0. The CPICH contains 20 bits of data, which are either all zeros, or in the case that Space-Time Transmit Diversity (STTD) is employed, is a pattern of alternating 1's and 0's for transmissions on the Node B's second antenna.25.211, section 5.3.3.1 \\"Common Pilot Channel (CPICH)\\" The first antenna of a base station always transmits all zeros for CPICH. A UE searching for a WCDMA Node B will first use the primary and secondary synchronization channels (P-SCH and S-SCH respectively) to determine the slot and frame timing of a candidate P-CCPCH, whether STTD is in use, as well as identifying which one of 64 code groups is being used by the cell. Crucially this allows to UE to reduce the set of possible Primary Scrambling Codes being used for P-CPICH to only 8 from 512 choices. At this point the correct PSC can be determined through the use of a matched filter, configured with the fixed channelisation code Cch,256,0, looking for the known CPICH bit sequence, while trying each of the possible 8 PSCs in turn. The results of each run of the matched filter can be compared, the correct PSC being identified by the greatest correlation result. Once the scrambling code for a CPICH is known, the channel can be used for measurements of signal quality, usually with RSCP and Ec/No. Timing and phase estimations can also be made, providing a reference that helps to improve reliability when decoding other channels from the same Node B. Pilot signals are not a requirement of CDMA, however, they do make the UE's receiver simpler and improve the reliability of the system. ==Further reading== *The authoritative definition for CPICH in UMTS is given by ITU and ETSI project 3GPP 25.211 Physical channels and mapping of transport channels onto physical channels (FDD) * A definition for Ec/Io applicable to CPICH can be found in 3GPP 25.133 Requirements for support of radio resource management (FDD) * Some information on the power of CPICH is given in 3GPP 25.104 Base Station (BS) radio transmission and reception (FDD) ==References== Category:UMTS (telecommunication) ","title":"Common pilot channel"},{"id":"6212779","text":"LM Radio is a radio station based in Maputo, Mozambique. Historically it was a shortwave station broadcasting to South Africa and Rhodesia from Lourenço Marques, the colonial era name of Maputo, hence the name \\"Lourenço Marques Radio\\" from 1936 to 1975 when it was shut down by the government of the then newly independent country.LMRadio - Activities In 2010, following political reforms and economic development in Mozambique a new station was launched with the brand \\"Lifetime Music Radio\\", trading on the nostalgia of the original LM Radio. ==History 1933 to 1975== The first radio station in Mozambique began broadcasting on shortwave and AM on 18 March 1933, but suspended transmissions for a while in 1934 owing to a shortage of money. A South African, G. J. McHarry became involved, and in 1935 Rádio Clube de Moçambique was launched, broadcasting mostly in English. In 1947, Colonel Richard L. Meyer, who prior to World War II was General Manager of the International Broadcasting Company of London, together with John Davenport formed Davenport and Meyer and took over the management of Lourenço Marques Radio. The station recruited David Davies to run the station and he, together with another announcer, David Gordon, were the first two announcers on the new commercial station. David Gordon left in 1950 to join the staff of Springbok Radio. In 1948 LM Radio moved into a new purpose built 4-storey building which became known as the \\"Radio Palace\\". The station started producing variety shows in front of live audiences. \\"Anything Goes\\" hosted by Peter Merrill and recorded in 1948 at the 20th Century Theatre in Johannesburg was one of the first South African radio variety shows. In the late 1950s the station underwent a major format change to cater for the younger generation who were not being catered for in South Africa by the state owned SABC. LM Radio was renowned for its Top Twenty chart show, the LM Hit Parade, and played a major role in promoting South African artists and their music. LM Radio lost much of its sparkle when it was taken over by the SABC in 1972. On 7 September 1974 the station was occupied during a bloody uprising in Lourenço Marques and the administration of the station was taken over by the Frelimo army. On 12 October 1975, following Moçambican independence from Portugal in June of that year, LM Radio facilities were nationalised and the station closed down on 13 October 1975. It was replaced in South Africa by Radio 5, later known as 5FM. \\"And now, wherever you are, in the Transvaal, Natal, Orange Free State, the Cape, Southwest Africa or Rhodesia [...] greetings. And to you, to you, and especially to you, vaya con Dios\\", so went David Davies' farewell message at the end of a broadcast. ===Influence=== Until the early 1980s, broadcasting in South Africa was state controlled - the sole broadcaster being the SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation). LM Radio was privately owned and operated, and served the vast audience of young people by transmitting pop and rock music which had limited exposure on the SABC stations. Many young South African artists made their debut on LM Radio through the numerous road shows which toured the country. LM Radio also trained a whole generation of announcers and disc jockeys who later went on to make their careers on other stations in South Africa and all over the world. Names like John Berks, Gary Edwards, Fritz Greyling, Frank Sanders, Robin Alexander, Darryl Jooste (DJ the DJ), George Wayne and David Gresham all started out at LM Radio before moving to other stations such as Swazi Music Radio (SMR), Radio 702, Springbok Radio and other SABC stations, 2JJ (now known as Triple J in Sydney) and Capital 604. Other names who became famous through LM Radio included Gerry Wilmot (Big Daddy), Clark McKay, Evelyn Martin (Duarte Lacueva), Daryl Jooste, Reg de Beer and Lorna Harris. ==Relaunch in 2010== After an absence of more than 34 years, a new LM Radio, opened in Maputo. On Christmas Eve 2009, a voice that had last been heard on the airwaves three decades earlier returned with an emotion-filled announcement. \\"This is LM Radio, Mozambique’s English-language music station\\", it said. \\"We are back after a break of 34 years. I’m Peter de Nobrega. I made the closing announcement on LM Radio on 12 October 1975 and it gives me great pleasure to make the opening announcement on this historic day in 2009\\". The broadcast licence was granted on 20 September 2010. It is Mozambique's only English- language broadcaster.LM Radio - Activities The station's official name is \\"Lifetime Music Radio\\" and the slogan is \\"Happy Listening\\".LM Radio - Home LM Radio broadcasts on 87.8 FM in Maputo and surrounding areas including Matola, on 87.8 FM in Ponta do Ouro, and on 702 kHz MW in Gauteng South Africa and on satellite in Southern Africa and webstreaming.LM Radio - Tuning Guide ==Licence to broadcast in Gauteng, South Africa== In early 2014 LM Radio was granted a licence to broadcast in Gauteng on 702 kHz on AM. This date has changed to the first 6 months of 2015 due to the company Sentech not being able to deliver the transmitters and towers on time and due to the shareholders of LM Radio not being able to get the necessary finances to pay for the transmitters and launch the station in SA. Test transmissions on 702 kHz from the Welgedacht transmitter site commenced during the first week of April 2017. ==References * Official website of the current station * Historical website covering the pre-1975 era * Original building in Maputo as it looked in 2011 Category:English-language radio stations Category:Radio stations in Mozambique Category:Radio stations in South Africa ","title":"LM Radio"},{"id":"6212783","text":"Minggang () is a town in the province of Henan in Central China.

It lies in the Langstrothdale valley in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Yockenthwaite is north of Skipton and south of Hawes. The name of the hamlet is said to derive from Eoghan's clearing in a wood. Yockenthwaite lies on the north bank of the River Wharfe. It is better known than may be expected because a children's television character from The Rottentrolls takes its name from the hamlet. The hamlet is connected to the road that winds up and down Langstrothdale by a grade II listed bridge from the early 18th century. This is the only route into and out of the hamlet via road transport. ==Yockenthwaite stone circle== Yockenthwaite Stone Circle Just to the west of the village by Yockenthwaite Cave, are some ancient stones arranged in a circle. The stones, which are now a scheduled monument, are in diameter and believed to be Bronze Age in origin. The overall size and layout of the stones gave rise to the nickname of the Giant's Grave. Some of the stones have been taken and re-used for drystone walls and buildings. Speight refers to the site as a \\"druid's circle\\" and whilst it has been described as a stone circle, it is believed to be a ring cairn. Whilst 23 stones remain extant, there are spaces for three to four more stones in the circle, which have been removed. ==References Category:Hamlets in North Yorkshire Category:Wharfedale ","title":"Yockenthwaite"},{"id":"6212804","text":"Pink-Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs, commonly abbreviated to PPFMs, are bacteria that are members of the genus Methylobacterium and are commonly found in soil, dust, various fresh water supplies and on plant surfaces. Although Gram negative, Methylobacteria often stain gram variable and are easily isolated using methanol-based mineral medium. Their pigmentation, which is frequently pink but may also be yellow or orange, is thought to provide protection from solar UV radiation which damages the DNA of bacteria at low doses because of their small cell size. This color is present due to the carotenoid pigments within the cell. == Metabolism == The metabolism of PPFMs is unusual because, as their name suggests, they are able to utilize C1 compounds such as formaldehyde, methanol and methylamine. PPFM bacteria can undergo methylotrophy, a process in which the bacteria oxidize methanol with the help of the enzymes methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-linked protein. In dense and diverse communities like those found in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere, this enables them to utilize nutrients other bacteria cannot, enhancing their competitive ability. In certain environments there are limited concentrations of elements such as carbon and phosphate in a usable form. Research suggests that PPFMs breakdown unusable forms of carbon into usable forms for other species forming symbiotic relationships. == Symbiosis with plants == PPFM bacteria form symbiotic relationships with numerous species of plants. PPFMs are horizontally transmitted to the next generation of plants through their seeds. This relationship is beneficial for plants, as the PPFMs produce cytokines. Plants with more growth showed an increased concentration in cytokine production, but credit has yet to be given to the bacteria. It has also been established that PPFM symbionts produce additional growth factors such as ethylene, auxins, and gibberellic acid which benefit the plants. This relationship is a model for plant-microbe interactions. As mentioned, PPFMs are known for their ability to utilize methanol as a sole energy source. It has been reported that trees and crop species emit large amounts of the alcohol methanol from their stomata, which potentially attracts symbiotic species. Interestingly, younger trees emit even more methanol which may encourage a healthy population of PPFM from an early stage of growth. Methanol breakdown by PPFMs allows plants to grow in different niches. Without this process, plants would not have access to enough carbon to grow efficiently. Studies also indicate that PPFM can break down additional carbon sources and also utilize phosphate efficiently, potentially providing additional assistance to plants. Overall, research in this field suggests that a plant's growth, survival, and reproductive success are significantly better when grown symbiotically with PPFMs. So far this relationship is only beneficial to haploid gametophytes, such as liverworts and mosses, but additional relationships are being investigated. There is a global application to this research, implying that PPFMs would be appropriate probiotic for some species of plants. Research by Mark Holland suggests that the normal storage of seeds for market use (after drying in a 50°C oven for 48h) rids the seeds of their native PPFM species. Incubating seeds with PPFM prior to germination encouraged germination and growth compared to controls. Research suggests that this relationship extends to marine and freshwater plant species as well. Additional research in this field will allow scientists to understand the complicated, yet important, relationship between plants and bacteria. PPFMs offer a low-cost biotech application to encourage enhanced growth, reproduction, and preferred characteristics of plant species in numerous environments. == See also == * Phyllosphere * Rhizosphere == References == Category:Rhizobiales ","title":"Pink-Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs"},{"id":"6212807","text":"Norman or Norm Foster may refer to: * Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank (born 1935), English architect and designer * Norman Foster (bass) (1925–2000), American operatic bass and actor * Norman Foster (cricketer) (1878-1960), Australian cricketer * Norman Foster (director) (1903–1976), American film director and actor * Norm Foster (ice hockey) (born 1965), ice hockey goaltender * Norm Foster (playwright) (born 1949), Canadian playwright * Norm Foster (politician) (1921-2006), Australian politician * Norman Foster (rugby league) (1907–1999), rugby league footballer of the 1930s for England, and Keighley * Norman Foster (military officer), British Army and Chief of the Nigerian Army (GOC) ==See also== * Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. (1915–2011), American physicist ","title":"Norman Foster (disambiguation)"},{"id":"6212812","text":"Nikele (Nik) Moyake (c. 1933 - c. 1966) was born on a farm in Addo in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. He was a musician who played mbaqanga and jazz. ==Music career== In the early 1950s Moyake moved to Port Elizabeth where he was a key figure in the jazz scene. He met Dudu Pukwana in Walmer Estate, Port Elizabeth, and he taught both Pukwana and Duke Makatsi how to pay saxophone. Pukwana and Moyake became band mates in The Blue Notes with Chris McGregor, Mongezi Feza, Johnny Dyani, and Louis Moholo. Before The Blue Notes, Moyake was a session musician who was a vocalist in Tete Mbambisa's band the Four Yanks. Chris McGregor and Nikele Moyake met at the Castle Lager Jazz Festival hosted at Moroka Jabavu Stadium in 1962. Moyake was playing with Mbambisa's band and McGregor was playing at the festival with a septet. Although they both played in different formations, Moyake, McGregor and other members of The Blue Notes met at the festival. After The Blue Notes went on a successful national tour, the band left South Africa in 1963 heading to Antibes to start a their lives in exile. The Blue Notes left South Africa because they were in contravention of several apartheid laws; particularly that no more than three black musicians were allowed to play together (on the pretext of preventing anti-apartheid conspiracies) and that multiracial bands could not play together (Chris McGregor was white). The band left Antibes and moved to Zurich at the urging of Dollar Brand the artist currently known as Abdullah Ibrahim . When the band played the Antibes Jazz Festival in 1964, Moyake was 31 Born in the early 1930s, Moyake was the oldest member of the band and its most accomplished soloist in its early days. When the group emigrated to Europe en masse in 1964, he became isolated from the rest of the band through a combination of illness and homesickness. Also, as the oldest member, he struggled to adapt to the changes in music brought about by the maturing of his younger bandmates. When the band moved to London, he returned to South Africa in 1965 due to ill health. He played for a few more years before dying from a brain tumour. Ronnie Beer took his place in The Blue Notes. ==Tributes== In 1968, the Soul Giants recorded a tribute album dedicated to Nick Moyake called I Remember Nick. Barney Rachabane and Dennis Mpale decided to create the album in his honour. In 2012, The Blue Notes Tribute Okestra, a tribute band formed to pay homage to the original members, recorded live at The Bird's Eye Jazz Club, Basel, Switzerland in June 2012. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:1966 deaths Category:The Blue Notes members Category:Jazz saxophonists Category:South African jazz musicians Category:20th-century saxophonists ","title":"Nikele Moyake"},{"id":"6212819","text":"Gaetano Catanoso (14 February 1879 - 4 April 1963) was an Italian Catholic priest and the founder of the Suore Veroniche del Santo Volto (1934). Catanoso served as a parish priest in two different parishes for his entire ecclesial life and was an ardent devotee of the Face of Jesus which he promoted to the faithful. He also founded the Poor Clerics to encourage vocations to the priesthood while forming the Confraternita del Santo Volto (1920) to spread devotion to the Face of Jesus. He dedicated his pastoral career to bringing the Gospel message to all people and hiked or rode on a mule to reach distant and surrounding mountain villages in order to evangelize to people. His fame for holiness was widespread during his life for people hailed his remarkable qualities and the conduct in which he led his life. The cause for his canonization was introduced on 15 October 1981 and he became titled as a Servant of God while he was later named as Venerable on 3 March 1990 upon the confirmation of his model life of heroic virtue. Pope John Paul II beatified Catanoso on 4 May 1997 while Pope Benedict XVI later canonized the late priest in Saint Peter's Square on 23 October 2005. ==Life== Gaetano Catanoso was born in 1879 to prosperous landowners in Reggio Calabria as the third of eight children of Antonio Catanoso and Antonia Tripodi. In October 1889 he began his studies for the priesthood and he arrived with his father in the evening for him to be admitted into it though he had to return home several times due to bouts of ill health. In 1895 he donned the cassock for the first time and gave his first-ever sermon. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 20 September 1902 from Cardinal Gennaro Portanova and served as a parish priest for his entire ecclesial life; from 1902 until March 1904 he served as the prefect of seminarians. His first parish was in the remote hill village of Pentedattilo where he served from March 1904 until 1921. He was passionate about emulating the life of Jesus Christ in his service to the poor and would hike or ride on a mule to the distant and surrounding mountain villages to bring the message of the Gospel and hope to isolated people in desperate circumstances. To help him in this cause he founded an order of nuns known as the Suore Veroniche del Santo Volto in December 1934. From 1922 until 1949 he was the spiritual director to seminarians and from 1922 to 1933 was a chaplain at hospitals in the region. From 1921 to 1950 he served as a confessor to religious institutes and to the prison while from 1940 to 1963 he was the canon of the archdiocesan cathedral. The order established schools and also homes for the old in small places like San Lorenzo and Roccaforte as well as Chorio to educate children and care for the old and sick. The goal was to combat ignorance and the Mafia through education and the word of God. Catanoso also founded the Poor Clerics to encourage vocations to the priesthood. He was transferred to the larger parish of Santa Maria de la Candelaria in Reggio Calabria on 2 February 1921. Catanoso was a close friend of Annibale Maria di Francia and Luigi Orione whom he had met in 1918. It was Orione who encouraged Catanoso when the latter decided to establish a religious congregation of his own; his order received diocesan approval on 25 March 1958. Catanoso had a deep devotion to the Face of Christ and to that end formed the \\"Confraternita del Santo Volto\\" in 1919. He also revived Marian and Eucharistic devotions and improved catechesis while also working for the observance of liturgical feasts. Catanoso also worked for cooperation among local priests to provide missions via preaching and hearing confessions in each other's parishes. He often spent long ours in silent reflection before the Tabernacle and he promoted Eucharistic Adoration among the faithful. In 1943 he opened a makeshift orphanage for those children who were orphaned due to World War II. Catanoso died on 4 April 1963 and his final words were recorded as: \\"In te, Domine, speravi, Gesù, Maria, Giuseppe\\"; he had become ill and blind before his death though he still welcomed those who came to visit him and seek his counsel. His order in 2008 had 95 nuns in a total of seventeen houses and it would later receive full pontifical approval from Pope John Paul II on 8 December 1980. One American relative - the journalist Justin Catanoso from - Greensboro in North Carolina - wrote memoir about Catanoso and the book is titled: \\"My Cousin the Saint - A Search for Faith, Family and Miracles\\". ==Sainthood== The beatification process opened on 15 October 1981 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) and titled Catanoso as a Servant of God; the cognitional process that would collect documentation took place in the Reggio Calabria- Bova archdiocese from 15 December 1981 until its closure later on 21 November 1987. The documentation was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the process on 3 March 1989 and received the Positio from cause officials in 1989. Theologians met not long after this and approved the cause on 26 September 1989 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. who approved the dossier's contents on 19 December 1989. On 3 March 1990 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed that Catanoso lived a model life of heroic virtue. For him to be beatified one miracle needed to be investigated and approved; this miracle needed to be a healing that science and medicine were unable to explain. One such case was discovered and investigated in a diocesan process that lasted from 1993 until 1994 when all medical records and witness interrogatories were sent to the C.C.S. who validated the investigation on 10 February 1995. The medical panel of experts approved this miracle on 5 October 1995 as did their consulting theologians on 25 November 1995 and the C.C.S. themselves on 20 February 1996. John Paul II confirmed the healing to be a legitimate miracle on 25 June 1996 and presided over the beatification later on 4 May 1997. The second and final miracle needed for him to be raised to sainthood was discovered and investigated in 2003 before the documents were sent to Rome and before the C.C.S. validated the process on 14 November 2003. The medical experts approved this healing to be a miracle on 1 April 2004 with the theologians also granting assent on 25 June 2004 as did the C.C.S. on 19 October 2004. John Paul II confirmed this miracle and Catanoso's inevitable sainthood on 20 December 2004. The date for the canonization was formalized at a consistory in the afternoon on 24 February 2005 in which Cardinal Angelo Sodano announced it on the behalf of the ill pope. John Paul II died two months later but his successor Pope Benedict XVI canonized Catanoso on 23 October 2005 in Saint Peter's Square. ===Miracles=== The miracle that led to his beatification occurred in Reggio- Calabria but was not investigated until a few decades later. It involved the healing of Sister Pauline who on 3 April 1963 wanted to see Catanoso before he died. But the priest died on 4 April she - who suffered from severe asthma - knelt beside his remains and felt healed a few hours later with no breathing difficulties whatsoever.

Her career as her daughters' manager is dramatized in the musical Gypsy. ==Life and career== Rose Evangeline Thompson was born in Wahpeton, North Dakota, in 1890, the daughter of Anna (née Egle) and Charles J. Thompson. Her maternal grandparents were German. Rose Thompson married her first husband, Jack Hovick, when she was a teenager. She gave birth to Rose Louise Hovick on January 8, 1911, in Seattle, Washington, and her second daughter, Ellen June Hovick, in Vancouver, British Columbia, on November 8, 1912. Some sources indicate she was born Ellen Evangeline Hovick in 1913, but Havoc herself acknowledged the earlier year not long before she died. She reportedly had numerous birth certificates for both girls that listed them as being either several years older or younger than they actually were. The former were to evade child labor laws and the latter for reduced or free fares. As a result, for many years, they were never entirely sure of their actual ages.Karen Abbott (2010) American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare, The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee, New York: Random House; ; Laura Jacobs (March 2003) \\"Taking it all off\\", Vanity Fair, Vol. 511, p. 198. Later in their careers, the two daughters would adopt their more famous stage names, Gypsy Rose Lee and June Havoc. Rose's drive to create a performing career for her daughters eventually led to the end of her marriage to Jack Hovick, who disagreed with her intentions for the girls. Rose married her second husband, Judson Brennerman, a traveling salesman, May 26, 1916 at the Unitarian church in Seattle, Washington, with Reverend J. D. A. Powers officiating.Ancestry.com. Washington, Marriage Records, 1865–2004 from Washington State Archives. Olympia, Washington: Washington State Archives. Many years later, Rose ran both a farm in Highland Mills, New York, and a boardinghouse, some of whose tenants were lesbians, in a ten-room apartment on the seedy West End Avenue in Manhattan. At some point, a young woman by the name of Genevieve Augustine, who was said to be Mother Rose's own lover, allegedly made a pass at the visiting Lee; in a jealous rage, Mother Rose shot the woman dead. This incident was publicly explained as a suicide. After the young woman's mother demanded an investigation, a case was opened, but a jury declined to indict. Mother Rose's biographer strongly refutes the notion that Augustine was Rose's lover and doubts Rose's complicity in her death in light of her previous suicide attempts. Karen Abbott's biography of Gypsy Rose Lee references two other violent incidents from Thompson Hovick's life. One involved an unidentified \\"hotel manager\\" whom Thompson Hovick pushed out a window to his death. She claimed self-defense and was not charged. She also tried to shoot Bobby Reed, the young man who eloped with Baby June in 1928, in a police station after cops found him and brought him to the station house. A police officer had told the two to make their peace. Reed approached with his hand extended, and Thompson Hovick withdrew a concealed gun and aimed it at Reed, but the safety was still on and no bullets were discharged. A policeman tried to hold her, but she broke free and viciously attacked the hapless Reed, punching and scratching him. Thompson Hovick reportedly continued demanding money and gifts from her daughters until her death in 1954. == \\"Gypsy\\" == Thompson Hovick became known as the ultimate stage mother by way of the classic musical Gypsy: A Musical Fable, based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee. Originally staged in 1959, Gypsy – with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and book by Arthur Laurents – has since been performed in countless venues on stage and in film. Both versions portray her as a domineering, take-no-prisoners stage mother who will do anything to further the success of her daughters in show business. While the character as portrayed in Gypsy is commonly referred to as \\"Mama Rose\\" (or \\"Momma Rose\\"), this is a sobriquet that does not appear in the script, and was adamantly dismissed by its author, Arthur Laurents. In the musical Gypsy, the character is called Momma, Rose, or Madame Rose. The role has been portrayed on stage and screen by a number of notable Broadway and film stars, including Ethel Merman in the original 1959 Broadway production of Gypsy, Angela Lansbury in the original London production and a Broadway revival, and Rosalind Russell in the Warner Bros 1962 film Gypsy. Stage revivals have starred Tyne Daly, Linda Lavin, Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone, Betty Buckley, Leslie Uggams and Imelda Staunton. Lupone's 2008 revival of Gypsy, won her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, as did Lansbury's 1973 portrayal and Daly's 1990 portrayal. A television movie starring Bette Midler premiered in 1993. ==Death== Hovick died of colorectal cancer in 1954, aged 63, in Nyack, New York. She had suffered a stroke two weeks earlier. ==References *\\"The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History\\", historylink.org; accessed July 31, 2007.

He competed in the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 to 2005. He has also appeared at every Pikes Peak International Hill Climb since 1992. ==Racing careerStock car racing=== Vahsholtz made his NASCAR debut in 2003, when he drove the No. 39 Jay Robinson Racing Ford at Las Vegas. He started the race in 31st and fell to 40th after an early engine issue. Vahsholtz then moved to his own #90 Ford for the race at Pikes Peak. He finished in 18th position despite being four laps down. Vahsholtz had another top-20 finish in his first 2004 outing, which came at Nashville. In that race, he finished in the 19th position. JRR called upon him again at Kentucky, when he drove their No. 49 Ford to a 36th-place finish, plagued by engine problems. Vahsholtz went back to his own team in his 2004 finale at Pikes Peak. He got a career best start of 21st out of it, but crashed halfway through and finished 33rd. ===Pikes Peak=== Vahsholtz is known for his results and records at Pikes Peak. He took part in 26 events and won his division on 23 occasions, making him the most successful driver in the history of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. He currently holds the record for Super Stock Cars and Open Wheels. His first attempt at the peak was in 1992 in Pro Motorcycle Division.

Exactly one Primary-CCPCH, which has a data rate of 27kbit/s and is always broadcast using Channelisation Code Cch,256,1.25.213, section 5.2.1 \\"Channelisation codes\\" This channel can be detected by mobiles due to its fixed channelisation code, slot format and TTI, as well as being time aligned to the Synchronisation Channel which replaces the first 2 bits of P-CCPCH in every slot. The Broadcast Control Channel (BCH) transport channel is mapped onto the P-CCPCH, allowing mobiles to decode important system parameters prior to establishing a dedicated connection. One or more Secondary-CCPCHs are also provided to broadcast paging blocks and FACH messages. The P-CCPCH in a TDD-mode UMTS system also carries pilot bits in (in contrast to FDD-mode, which provides a distinct pilot channel named CPICH).

It lies about 5 miles south of Kirkby Stephen. It is the main hamlet in the dale of Mallerstang (a civil parish) which retains the Norse pattern of its original settlement: a series of small hamlets and isolated houses, with no village centre. In the 19th century, as the main hamlet at the centre of the dale, Outhgill had an inn, a post office, a smithy, the parish church and a Methodist chapel. Of these, only the church survives. St Mary's Church was founded by Lady Ideonea de Veteripont in the 14th century (possibly 1311) but was restored, in fact more or less rebuilt, in 1663 by Lady Anne Clifford, as the plaque above the door relates. The simple, dignified interior contains an 18th-century font, a faded coat of arms of Lady Anne from the year she restored the church, a set of shelves that used to hold the loaves of bread distributed weekly under Middleton's Charity, and kneelers embroidered by ladies of the dale. The stained glass windows all date from Victorian times or later. Memorial stone in St Mary's Churchyard In the churchyard there are the unmarked graves of 25 of the builders of the Mallerstang section of the Settle-Carlisle Railway, and members of their families, who died during the construction of the line. A monument to them, marking the area where they are buried, was dedicated in 1997. Almost opposite the church is the former Wesleyan Chapel, built in 1878. There are about a dozen houses, including one where the father of the great scientist Michael Faraday was the blacksmith in the late 18th century (moving to London in the year Michael was born).

It lies south west of Leyburn and west of the County Town of Northallerton. It is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Burton-cum-Walden. ==History== There is some evidence of an Iron Age settlement on top of nearby Burton Moor that has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It consists of about eighteen hut circles and defined fields. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as just Burton. The topynomy of the village is derived from the Old English burh-tūn meaning a fortified farm. Until the 17th century the village was known as Burton in Bishopdale. \\"West\\" distinguishes the village from the village of Constable Burton, to the east, also known simply as Burton in the early Middle Ages. At the time of the Norman invasion the village was part of the manor belonging to Thorkil, but afterwards the manor was granted to Geoffrey of Swaffham by Count Alan of Brittany, who had been awarded the lands by the Crown. West Burton (or Burton in Bishopdale or Burton-cum-Walden) was a manor or township of the ancient parish of Aysgarth, and was always coupled with Walden. The manor befell the same fate as other lands belonging to Geoffrey in that they eventually passed to Richard Duke of Gloucester in 1480. Thereafter the descent of the manor followed that of Castle Bolton into the 19th century. A less frequently photographed row of residences The village used to be an important market town and the octagonal market cross and stocks are still seen today on the village green. Burton-cum-Walden became a separate civil parish in 1866.Vision of Britain website ==Governance== The village is in the Richmond UK Parliament constituency. It is also in the Penhill ward of Richmondshire District Council and the Upper Dales electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. Burton-cum-Walden Parish Council has five Councillors and a parish clerk. ==Geography== Cauldron Force in early summer West Burton lies within the Yorkshire Dales National Parkhttp://www.walkingwiththetaxidriver.co.uk/the-walks/yorkshire-dales/west- burton-to-aysgarth-falls-and-cauldron-falls-round/ on the B6160 road to Addingham. Two other roads leave the village, both dead ends, but one leads to the two hamlets of Walden and Walden Head. The villages of Aysgarth, Newbiggin and Thoralby are all about a mile from the village. West Burton lies near the mouth of Bishopdale and at the mouth of Waldendale, the valley through which Walden Beck runs. Walden Beck runs north past the eastern edge of the village to join Bishopdale Beck on its way to the River Ure. Cauldron Force or Falls, (also called West Burton Falls), is a small waterfall in the village.

The Chambre introuvable (French: Unobtainable Chamber) was the first Chamber of Deputies elected after the Second Bourbon Restoration in 1815. It was dominated by Ultra-royalists who completely refused to accept the results of the French Revolution. The name was coined by King Louis XVIII of France. The elections, held on 14 August 1815 under census suffrage and under the impact of the \\"White Terror\\", produced a heavy Ultra-royalist majority: 350 of the 402 members were Ultra- royalists. The \\"Unobtainable Chamber\\", which was first assembled on 7 October 1815, was characterized by its zeal in favour of the aristocracy and the clergy and aimed at reestablishing the Ancien Régime. The Chambre introuvable voted the establishment of military provost-marshal courts and banished all of the Conventionnels who had voted for Louis XVI's execution. Louis XVIII, confronted with rising discontent in French society, followed the counsels of the Duc de Richelieu, prime minister since September 1815, the Duke of Wellington, the British commander of the occupation troops, and the Russian ambassador Pozzo di Borgo, and dissolved the Chamber on 5 September 1816. The subsequent elections resulted in the Ultras being temporarily replaced by the more liberal Doctrinaires, who attempted to reconcile the Revolution's legacy with the monarchy. When under the government of Jean-Baptiste, comte de Villèle, the Ultra-royalists resumed the majority in the chamber in December 1823, this chamber was dubbed Chambre retrouvée, the \\"Recovered Chamber\\", in reference to the Chambre introuvable. ==See also== *France in the nineteenth century *Bourbon Restoration *Cavalier Parliament Category:Bourbon Restoration Category:1815 in France ","title":"Chambre introuvable"},{"id":"6212940","text":"Reporters is a weekly analytical programme shown on BBC News, during BBC Breakfast on BBC One and BBC World News.

He was its president and executive director from 1967 to 1980. ==Biography== Born in Springfield, Massachusetts to Edward Francis and Lillian Piper Kilgour, Kilgour earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard College in 1935 and afterward held the position as assistant to the director of Harvard University Library. In 1940, he married Eleanor Margaret Beach, who had graduated from Mount Holyoke College and taken a job at the Harvard College Library, where they met. In 1942 to 1945, Kilgour served during World War II as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve and was Executive Secretary and Acting Chairman of the U.S. government's Interdepartmental Committee for the Acquisition of Foreign Publications (IDC), which developed a system for obtaining publications from enemy and enemy-occupied areas. This organization of 150 persons in outposts around the world microfilmed newspapers and other printed information items and sent them back to Washington, DC. An example of the kind of intelligence gathered was the Japanese \\"News for Sailors\\" reports that listed new minefields. These reports were sent from Washington, D.C. directly to Pearl Harbor and U.S. submarines in the Western Pacific. Kilgour received the Legion of Merit for his intelligence work in 1945. He worked at the United States Department of State as deputy director of the Office of Intelligence Collection and Dissemination from 1946 to 1948. In 1948, he was named Librarian of the Yale Medical Library. At Yale he was also a lecturer in the history of science and technology and published many scholarly articles on those topics. While running the Yale University Medical Library, Kilgour began publishing studies and articles on library use and effectiveness. He asked his staff to collect empirical data, such as use of books and journals by categories of borrowers to guide selection and retention of titles. He viewed the library \\"not merely as a depository of knowledge,\\" but as \\"an instrument of education.\\" At the dawn of library automation in the early 1970s, he was a member of the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA), an organization within the American Library Association, where he was president from 1973 to 1975.American Library Association, , \\"LITA Presidents\\", 2014 He joined the Ohio College Association in 1967 to develop OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) and led the creation of a library network that today links 72,000 institutions in 170 countries. It first amassed the catalogs of 54 academic libraries in Ohio, launching in 1971 and expanding to non-Ohio libraries in 1977. Kilgour was president of OCLC from 1967 to 1980, presiding over its rapid growth from an intrastate network to an international network. In addition to creating the WorldCat database, he developed an online interlibrary loan system that libraries used to arrange nearly 10 million loans annually in 2005. Excerpted from NextSpace, the OCLC Newsletter, No. 3, October 2006. Today, OCLC has a staff of 1,200 and offices in seven countries. Its mission remains the same: to further access to the world's information and reduce library costs. In 1981 Kilgour stepped down from management but continued to serve on the OCLC Board of Trustees until 1995. He was a distinguished research professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science. He taught there from 1990, retiring in 2004. He died in 2006 was 92 years old and had lived since 1990 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He was survived by his wife and their daughters, Martha Kilgour and Alison Kilgour of New York City, and Meredith Kilgour Perdiew of North Edison, New Jersey; and two grandchildren and five great grandchildren. ==OCLC== Based in Dublin, Ohio, OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat—the OCLC Online Union Catalog, the largest OPAC in the world. Under Kilgour's leadership, the nonprofit corporation introduced a shared cataloging system in 1971 for 54 Ohio academic libraries. WorldCat contains holding records from most public and private libraries worldwide. WorldCat is available through many libraries and university computer networks. In 1971, after four years of development, OCLC introduced its online shared cataloging system, which would achieve dramatic cost savings for libraries. For example, in the first year of system use, the Alden Library at Ohio University was able to increase the number of books it cataloged by a third, while reducing its staff by 17 positions. Word of this new idea spread on campuses across the country, starting an online revolution in libraries that continues to this day. The shared cataloging system and database that Kilgour devised made it unnecessary for more than one library to originally catalog an item. Libraries would either use the cataloging information that already existed in the database, or they would put it in for other libraries to use. The shared catalog also provided information about materials in libraries in the rest of the network. For the first time, a user in one library could easily find out what was held in another library. The network quickly grew outside Ohio to all 50 states and then internationally. Because of his contributions to librarianship, OCLC and LITA, jointly sponsors an award named after Kilgour. Inaugurated in 1998 and awarded annually, it highlights research on information technology with a focus on \\"work that \\"shows the promise of having a positive and substantive impact on any aspect of the publication, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information, or the processes by which information and data are manipulated and managed.\\" ==Legacy== Kilgour is widely recognized as one of the leading figures in 20th century librarianship for his work in using computer networks to increase access to information in libraries around the world. He was among the earliest proponents of adapting computer technology to library processes. The database that Kilgour created, now called WorldCat, is regarded as the world's largest computerized library catalog, including not only entries from large institutions such as the Library of Congress, the British Library, the Russian State Library and Singapore, but also from small public libraries, art museums and historical societies. It contains descriptions of library materials and their locations. More recently, the database provides access to the electronic full text of articles, books as well as images and sound recordings. It spans 4,000 years of recorded knowledge. It contains more than 70 million records and one billion location listings. Every 10 seconds a library adds a new record. It is available on the World Wide Web. Inspired by Ralph H. Parker's 1936 workParker, R. H. (1936). The punched card method in circulation work.

He also studied under George Sarton, a pioneer in the new discipline of the history of science, and began publishing scholarly papers. He also launched a project to build a collection of microfilmed foreign newspapers to help scholars have access to newspapers from abroad. This activity quickly came to the attention of government officials in Washington, D.C. In 1961, he was one of the leaders in the development of a prototype computerized library catalog system for the medical libraries at Columbia, Harvard and Yale Universities that was funded by the National Science Foundation. In 1965, Kilgour was named associate librarian for research and development at Yale University. He continued to conduct experiments in library automation and to promote their potential benefits in the professional literature. In his professional writings, Kilgour was one of the earliest proponents of applying computerization to librarianship. He pointed out that the explosion of research information was placing new demands on libraries to furnish information completely and rapidly. He advocated the use of the computer to eliminate human repetitive tasks from library procedures, such as catalog card production. He recognized nearly 40 years ago the potential of linking libraries in computer networks to create economies of scale and generate \\"network effects\\" that would increase the value of the network as more participants were added. OCLC has proved the feasibility of nationwide sharing of catalog-record creation and has helped libraries to maintain and to enhance the quality and speed of service while achieving cost control—and even cost reduction—in the face of severely reduced funding. This achievement may be the single greatest contribution to national networking in the United States. His work will have a lasting impact on the field of information science. Kilgour Building, OCLC Main Campus, Dublin, Ohio The main office building on the OCLC campus is named after Kilgour. The main entrance road to the OCLC campus is named Kilgour Place. OCLC created an annual award in Kilgour's name, the Kilgour Award, which is given to a researcher who has contributed to advances information science. ==Awards== In 1990, he was named Distinguished Research Professor of the School of Information and Library Science, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and served on the faculty until his retirement in 2004. Kilgour was the author of 205 scholarly papers. He was the founder and first editor of the journal, Information Technology and Libraries. In 1999, Oxford University Press published his book The Evolution of the Book. His other books include The Library of the Medical Institution of Yale College and its Catalogue of 1865 and The Library and Information Science CumIndex. He received numerous awards from library associations and five honorary doctorates. In 1982, the American Library Association presented him with Honorary Life Membership.

From the introduction to \\"The Scamps of Bucksnort\\": \\"Bucksnort, Tennessee, got its name from William (\\"Buck\\") Pamplin, a brother of McCager Armpstead Pamplin, my father's father. Before the Civil War, William owned and lived on the site that later became Bucksnort. 'It was like this: William loved whiskey. He would get soused to the ears with the sweet, smelly stuff, and when he did, he would roar and snort till everyone around heard him. They would say: \\"Just listen to Buck snort.\\" His snorting became so frequent and the comment was made so often, that the neighbors soon found themselves running the last two words together, thus the place was called Bucksnort. \\"In the course of time, a post office was needed. The Government wanted to know what name the community wished to be known by. Since William still owned and lived on the site, and since he still kept up his snorting, the neighbors and near-by farmers decided on Bucksnort. It was approved by the Government and the first post office and surrounding community became Bucksnort.\\" Bucksnort, a term well known to deer hunters tracking by sound since pioneer days, is the name given to multiple pre-Civil War towns and communities across Tennessee as well as in Marshall County and Bullock County, Alabama; Prentiss County and Tate County, Mississippi; Craighead County and Dallas County, Arkansas. ==Post office== The community had a post office from 1887 to 1902. ==See also== *Bucksnort, Tennessee ==External links== *Information: Scamps of Bucksnort by Lily Mae Pamplin Category:Unincorporated communities in Lincoln County, Tennessee Category:Unincorporated communities in Tennessee ","title":"Mimosa, Tennessee"},{"id":"6213029","text":"Jack's, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, originally known as Jack's Hamburgers, also known as Jack's Family Restaurants, Inc. is a fast food restaurant chain with locations in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi. It was founded in November 1960 by Jack Caddell as a single walk- up stand in Homewood, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham and now has 182 locations across the southeast, opening at a rate of about 15 per year. ==History== Jack's was founded on November 21, 1960 by Jack Caddell as a single walk-up stand in Homewood, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham. This location still operates today after several remodels, the most recent in 2019, and is the chains flagship store.https://www.eatatjacks.com/headlines/homewood-grand-re-opening The original menu featured items such as fifteen-cent hamburgers and fries, twenty-cent shakes, and a twenty-cent \\"Fish-On-A-Bun.\\" Jack's rapidly expanded and by the mid-1960s, they had more than a half dozen locations in the Birmingham metro area: the original Homewood store, Roebuck, 3rd Avenue West, Bessemer, Five Points West, Vestavia, Eastwood Mall, Alabaster and Center Point, and additional stores as far as Mississippi and South Carolina. A Jack's grand opening was akin to opening night of a new Broadway production. Pictured is the new Jack's Hamburgers in Jasper. circa 1967. In the mid to late 1970s, Jack's was expanding into south Alabama and the Florida panhandle. In the 1980s many of these locations began to close, but at least one individual was having success with Jack's. Benny LaRussa, primarily involved in the grocery business, had purchased a single franchise in the 1960s. In 1979, LaRussa abandoned groceries and purchased a franchise territory of 13 Jack's stores. From then until 1988 he expanded his territory to 33 stores. Then, in 1988, LaRussa purchased the total franchise rights to the Jack's concept. In 2015, Jack's was acquired by a fund managed by Onex Corporation, a private equity company based in Toronto, Canada. On July 25, 2019, Onex announced that it had reached a deal to sell Jack's Family Restaurants in a deal expected to close in the third quarter of 2019. The deal finally closed in August 2019. Onex did not disclose the buyer or financial terms of the deal, but Restaurant Business Online reported that AEA Investors, a private equity firm based in New York, is the buyer of the restaurant chain. In January 2017, a food worker at a Jack's in Columbus, Mississippi reportedly adulterated a hamburger by smearing her own menstrual blood and saliva on it before it was served. The worker pled guilty to a charge of \\"selling unwholesome bread or drink\\" in November 2017. ==Trademark design== Jack's restaurants were originally walk-up stands with a slanted roof and vertical orange and yellow stripes on each side. In the late 1960s, the chain began converting their walk-up stands to full, dine-in restaurants. Most upgraded restaurants featured faux stone walls. The original signs were on 5 poles and featured \\"Jack's\\" in five individual white rectangles on top with the word \\"Hamburgers\\" on a separate sign underneath. A small round sign below had the price of the hamburgers, \\"15¢\\". Another sign that shared 3 poles and had \\"Fries 15¢ Shakes 20¢\\" written on it, and the final sign shared the opposite 3 poles and had \\"Self-Service\\" written on it. Several elements had their writing changed over time, and the last one in the chain, Dora, Al, was removed in 2019 during a remodel. In the mid-1970s, Jack's began using new signage featuring the name written on an angle in white inside a red circle; the word \\"Hamburgers\\" was dropped. In the early 2000s, Jack's changed the logo from the original, all capital font to a mixed-case font. It still appears on the familiar red circle, but the circle is smaller so that the text extends outside of it. ==See also== *Milo's Hamburgers, another Alabama-based burger restaurant similar to Jack's * List of hamburger restaurants ==References== * * ==External links== * Official website Category:Companies based in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Restaurants in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Jefferson County, Alabama Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast-food hamburger restaurants Category:Fast-food franchises Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in Alabama ","title":"Jack's"},{"id":"6213032","text":"Kilbuck can refer to: * John and Edith Kilbuck, missionaries * Kilbuck Township, Pennsylvania ==See also== * Killbuck (disambiguation) ","title":"Kilbuck"},{"id":"6213044","text":"\\"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\\" is a song written by Ahmet Ertegun and Betty Nelson, the wife of soul singer Ben E.

He was known for his skills as a military leader. Lengvenis was born to Algirdas and his second wife Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver. In 1387 battle with the Teutonic Knights Lengvenis commanded one of Lithuanian formations. In 1389–1392 he was appointed by his brother Władysław II Jagiełło, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, as regent of Great Novgorod. He was baptized in the Orthodox rite as Simon and received the title of Prince of Great Novgorod. He paid homage to King Władysław II Jagiełło in Sandomierz in 1389, thus making the Novgorod Republic a fiefdom of the Polish Crown. After Lengvenis lost this title in 1392, Vytautas the Great appointed him to Mstsislaw in then eastern Lithuania. In 1406–1411 Lengvenis, once again, was nominated by Vytautas as regent of Great Novgorod. As ruler of Novgorod he led battles against Pskov, Livonian Order, and Sweden. In 1410, Lengvenis participated in the Battle of Grunwald. He led his own \\"banner\\", and a certain Georgy- the next banner in the famous list of chronicler Jan Długosz. Often this George is considered the son of Lengvenis, Yury. Many historians believe that under the command of Lengvenis there were three banners of Smolensk land, which played a significant role in the battle. In 1411 Lengvenis participated in the signing of the Peace of Thorn. He was married to Maria Dmitrovna, princess of Moscow, the daughter of Dmitri Donskoi.

He has a rivalry with fellow member Jouichirou, and a blooming relationship with member Erika. Voiced by: Shinichiro Miki Erika Tinen, age 23: Erika is a member of STAND's offensive sector. Her Gear is colored pink. She was living in the streets until she was picked up and raised by a caring man. Because she and Serge used to live in the same neighborhood but never met, she finds herself intrigued by this mysterious man and eventually attracted to him. In episode 11, she and Serge had their first kiss and, eventually, had sex. Erika was going to tell Serge that she is pregnant with his child in episode 12. Voiced by: Mayumi Iizuka Jouichirou, age 25: Jouichirou is a member of STAND's offensive. His Gear color is blue. He's a bit cocky and arrogant and likes to tease fellow member Mirei about her concern for him. He does, however, worry about her and tries to comfort her when needed. Because Serge seems to be better than him at everything even though he is a recent applicator to STAND, he shares a rivalry with him and sometimes calls him \\"Rookie\\". Voiced by: Nobuyuki Hiyama Mirei, age 15: Mirei is not part of the team's offensive but she is their resident skilled hacker. She may be young in years but she's very intelligent. Erika acts as a big sister towards Mirei. She sometimes gets very concerned for Jouichirou, a fact that Jouichirou loves to tease her about. Voiced by: Haruna Ikezawa Macus Alexander Bogard, age 29: He's a part of the offensive for STAND. His Gear color is yellow. He may or may not be a descendant of Terry or Andy Bogard; both from Fatal Fury; due to their similar last names as well as physical appearance. He is field leader when the team is out on missions. Voiced by: Keiichi Nanba Raven, age 35: The boss of STAND. He offers Serge the opportunity to work for them after displaying great ability in defeating a new machine taken over by the Virus. He doesn't go on missions or hack but he does supervise the team. He spends most of his time at his desk talking to a mysterious ghost woman called Donna about Serge and how he's linked to their past. Voiced by: Hirotaka Suzuoki Donna, age 24: A blond, mysterious entity in the form of a spirit that spends most her time talking with Raven about Serge. She has been linked to both these men while she was still alive and as the story continues, we see just how linked they really are.

Created in 1836 as the Lanificio Luigi Marzotto & Figli. In 2005 Marzotto Group's textile business separated from Valentino Fashion Group. The Group manufactures woollen and cotton yarns for clothing, and through equity investments, woollen yarns for knitwear, linen yarns and silk. ==Brands== The Group manufactures in textile sector with the brands: *Marzotto *Estethia - G.B. Conte *Guabello *Marlane *Fratelli Tallia di Delfino *Tessuti di Sondrio *Nuova Tessilbrenta *Redaelli Velluti *Lanerossi Blankets In the linen yarns sector, Marzotto Group manufactures through the Linificio e Canapificio Nazionale of which the parent company owns 100% of the ordinary shares. ==History == Marzotto headquarters Luigi Marzotto founded a wool mill in Valdagno in 1836, but handed the business to his son Gaetano, Sr. in 1842. After the unification of the kingdom of Italy in 1861, Gaetano took advantage of the company's location (companies in northeast Italy were found to make the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy more quickly than those in the south) by buying a spinning factory nearby Maglione. By then, the company's payroll had risen to over 1.200 employees. After Gaetano's death in 1910, Marzotto S.p.A. split in two, so his son Gaetano, Jr. took over the Maglione factory and his grandson Vittorio Emanuele Marzotto, who has been credited with leading the company into the export business, took over the Valdagno operations. In the 1950s, Marzotto S.p.A. diversified in the manufacturing of private-label menswear, Principe by Marzotto. After going public in 1961 with a listing on the Borsa Italiana, the Milan exchange market, the company started exporting its products to the United States. To reduce labour costs, 40 percent of the clothing production would eventually be transferred there. In the 1980s and 1990s, more and more companies were bought by Marzotto S.p.A.: Lanerossi in 1987, whose addition made Marzotto Europe's first fully integrated wool producer, Hugo Boss in 1991 and Czechoslovakia’s Nová Mosilana wool mill in 1994. The company's grandest move came in 1997, when it announced that it would merge with HPI to form Gruppo Industriale Marzotto, the world's largest designer clothing manufacturer. However, in May of that year, Pietro Marzotto (son of Vittorio Emanuele, so great-great- grandson of Luigi), abruptly stopped negotiations, which led to Pietro's resignation of his function as chief executive and the take-over by Jean de Jaeger, the first non-Marzotto to be promoted to such a function. Pietro nonetheless remained the majority shareholder of Marzotto S.p.A. and he purchased Liteksas, a Lithuanian wool garments manufacturer, in 2000, so that the company could shift part of its production to the lower-cost market. He also bought Valentino S.p.A., which had been struggling under HPI, in 2003, and the company has seen surging profits and gaining sales ever since. ==References *Official website * Marzotto treccani.it Category:Italian brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1836 Category:Textile companies of Italy Category:Companies based in Veneto Category:Italian companies established in 1836 ","title":"Marzotto"},{"id":"6213252","text":"A self-organizing list is a list that reorders its elements based on some self-organizing heuristic to improve average access time. The aim of a self- organizing list is to improve efficiency of linear search by moving more frequently accessed items towards the head of the list. A self-organizing list achieves near constant time for element access in the best case. A self- organizing list uses a reorganizing algorithm to adapt to various query distributions at runtime. ==History== The concept of self-organizing lists has its roots in the idea of activity organization of records in files stored on disks or tapes. One frequently cited discussion of self-organizing files and lists is that of Knuth. John McCabe gave the first algorithmic complexity analyses of the Move-to-Front (MTF) strategy where an item is moved to the front of the list after it is accessed. He analyzed the average time needed for randomly ordered list to get in optimal order. The optimal ordering of a list is the one in which items are ordered in the list by the probability with which they will be needed, with the most accessed item first. The optimal ordering may not be known in advance, and may also change over time. McCabe introduced the transposition strategy in which an accessed item is exchanged with the item in front of it in the list. He made the conjecture that in the average case, transposition worked at least as well as MTF in approaching the optimal ordering of records in the limit. This conjecture was later proved by Rivest. McCabe also noted that with either the transposition or MTF heuristic, the optimal ordering of records would be approached even if the heuristic was only applied every Nth access, and that a value of N might be chosen that would reflect the relative cost of relocating records with the value of approaching the optimal ordering more quickly. Further improvements were made, and algorithms suggested by researchers including: Rivest, Tenenbaum and Nemes, Knuth, and Bentley and McGeoch (e.g. Worst-case analyses for self- organizing sequential search heuristics). ==Introduction== The simplest implementation of a self-organizing list is as a linked list and thus while being efficient in random node inserting and memory allocation, suffers from inefficient accesses to random nodes. A self-organizing list reduces the inefficiency by dynamically rearranging the nodes in the list based on access frequency. ===Inefficiency of linked list traversals=== If a particular node is to be searched for in the list, each node in the list must be sequentially compared till the desired node is reached. In a linked list, retrieving the nth element is an O(n) operation. This is highly inefficient when compared to an array for example, where accessing the nth element is an O(1) operation. ===Efficiency of self-organizing lists=== A self organizing list rearranges the nodes keeping the most frequently accessed ones at the head of the list. Generally, in a particular query, the chances of accessing a node which has been accessed many times before are higher than the chances of accessing a node which historically has not been so frequently accessed. As a result, keeping the commonly accessed nodes at the head of the list results in reducing the number of comparisons required in an average case to reach the desired node. This leads to better efficiency and generally reduced query times. ==Implementation of a self-organizing list== The implementation and methods of a self-organizing list are identical to those for a standard linked list. The linked list and the self-organizing list differ only in terms of the organization of the nodes; the interface remains the same. ==Analysis of running times for access/search in a listAverage case=== It can be shown that in the average case, the time required to a search on a self-organizing list of size n is :Tavg = 1 * p(1) + 2 * p(2) + 3 * p(3) + . . . + n * p(n). where p(i) is the probability of accessing the ith element in the list, thus also called the access probability. If the access probability of each element is the same (i.e. p(1) = p(2) = p(3) = ... = p(n) = 1/n) then the ordering of the elements is irrelevant and the average time complexity is given by :T(n) = 1/n + 2/n + 3/n + ... + n/n = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)/n = (n+1)/2 and T(n) does not depend on the individual access probabilities of the elements in the list in this case. However, in the case of searches on lists with non uniform record access probabilities (i.e. those lists in which the probability of accessing one element is different from another), the average time complexity can be reduced drastically by proper positioning of the elements contained in the list. This is done by pairing smaller i with larger access probabilities so as to reduce the overall average time complexity. This may be demonstrated as follows: Given List: A(0.1), B(0.1), C(0.3), D(0.1), E(0.4) Without rearranging, average search time required is: :T(n) = 1*0.1 + 2*0.1 + 3*0.3 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.4 = 3.6 Now suppose the nodes are rearranged so that those nodes with highest probability of access are placed closest to the front so that the rearranged list is now: E(0.4), C(0.3), D(0.1), A(0.1), B(0.1) Here, average search time is: :T(n) = 1*0.4 + 2*0.3 + 3*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.1 = 2.2 Thus the average time required for searching in an organized list is (in this case) around 40% less than the time required to search a randomly arranged list. This is the concept of the self-organized list in that the average speed of data retrieval is increased by rearranging the nodes according to access frequency. ===Worst case=== In the worst case, the element to be located is at the very end of the list be it a normal list or a self-organized one and thus n comparisons must be made to reach it. Therefore, the worst case running time of a linear search on the list is O(n) independent of the type of list used. Note that the expression for the average search time in the previous section is a probabilistic one. Keeping the commonly accessed elements at the head of the list simply reduces the probability of the worst case occurring but does not eliminate it completely. Even in a self-organizing list, if a lowest access probability element (obviously located at the end of the list) is to be accessed, the entire list must be traversed completely to retrieve it. This is the worst case search. ===Best case=== In the best case, the node to be searched is one which has been commonly accessed and has thus been identified by the list and kept at the head. This will result in a near constant time operation. In big-oh notation, in the best case, accessing an element is an O(1) operation. ==Techniques for rearranging nodes== While ordering the elements in the list, the access probabilities of the elements are not generally known in advance. This has led to the development of various heuristics to approximate optimal behavior. The basic heuristics used to reorder the elements in the list are: ===Move to front method (MTF)=== This technique moves the element which is accessed to the head of the list. This has the advantage of being easily implemented and requiring no extra memory. This heuristic also adapts quickly to rapid changes in the query distribution. On the other hand, this method may prioritize infrequently accessed nodes — for example, if an uncommon node is accessed even once, it is moved to the head of the list and given maximum priority even if it is not going to be accessed frequently in the future. These 'over rewarded' nodes destroy the optimal ordering of the list and lead to slower access times for commonly accessed elements. Another disadvantage is that this method may become too flexible leading to access patterns that change too rapidly. This means that due to the very short memories of access patterns even an optimal arrangement of the list can be disturbed immediately by accessing an infrequent node in the list. Move To Front Algorithm If the 5th node is selected, it is moved to the front At the t-th item selection: if item i is selected: move item i to head of the list ===Count method=== In this technique, the number of times each node was searched for is counted i.e. every node keeps a separate counter variable which is incremented every time it is called. The nodes are then rearranged according to decreasing count. Thus, the nodes of highest count i.e. most frequently accessed are kept at the head of the list. The primary advantage of this technique is that it generally is more realistic in representing the actual access pattern. However, there is an added memory requirement, that of maintaining a counter variable for each node in the list. Also, this technique does not adapt quickly to rapid changes in the access patterns. For example: if the count of the head element say A is 100 and for any node after it say B is 40, then even if B becomes the new most commonly accessed element, it must still be accessed at least (100 - 40 = 60) times before it can become the head element and thus make the list ordering optimal. Count Algorithm If the 5th node in the list is searched for twice, it will be swapped with the 4th init: count(i) = 0 for each item i At t-th item selection: if item i is searched: count(i) = count(i) + 1 rearrange items based on count ===Transpose method=== This technique involves swapping an accessed node with its predecessor. Therefore, if any node is accessed, it is swapped with the node in front unless it is the head node, thereby increasing its priority. This algorithm is again easy to implement and space efficient and is more likely to keep frequently accessed nodes at the front of the list. However, the transpose method is more cautious. i.e. it will take many accesses to move the element to the head of the list. This method also does not allow for rapid response to changes in the query distributions on the nodes in the list. Transpose Algorithm If the 5th node in the list is selected, it will be swapped with the 4th At the t-th item selection: if item i is selected: if i is not the head of list: swap item i with item (i - 1) ===Other methods=== Research has been focused on fusing the above algorithms to achieve better efficiency. Bitner's Algorithm uses MTF initially and then uses transpose method for finer rearrangements. Some algorithms are randomized and try to prevent the over-rewarding of infrequently accessed nodes that may occur in the MTF algorithm. Other techniques involve reorganizing the nodes based on the above algorithms after every n accesses on the list as a whole or after n accesses in a row on a particular node and so on. Some algorithms rearrange the nodes which are accessed based on their proximity to the head node, for example: Swap-With-Parent or Move-To-Parent algorithms. Another class of algorithms are used when the search pattern exhibits a property called locality of reference whereby in a given interval of time, only a smaller subset of the list is probabilistically most likely to be accessed. This is also referred to as dependent access where the probability of the access of a particular element depends on the probability of access of its neighboring elements. Such models are common in real world applications such as database or file systems and memory management and caching. A common framework for algorithms dealing with such dependent environments is to rearrange the list not only based on the record accessed but also on the records near it. This effectively involves reorganizing a sublist of the list to which the record belongs. ==Applications of self-organizing lists== Language translators like compilers and interpreters use self-organizing lists to maintain symbol tables during compilation or interpretation of program source code. Currently research is underway to incorporate the self-organizing list data structure in embedded systems to reduce bus transition activity which leads to power dissipation in those circuits. These lists are also used in artificial intelligence and neural networks as well as self-adjusting programs. The algorithms used in self-organizing lists are also used as caching algorithms as in the case of LFU algorithm. The simple Move to Front and transpose methods are also applicable in real-world collections: for instance organising a spice drawer by replacing used items to the front of a drawer, or transposing a cleaning item with its front-most neighbour when it is used. == Notes  References == * * NIST DADS entry * A Drozdek, Data Structures and Algorithms in Java Third edition * S Category:Articles with example C code ","title":"Self-organizing list"},{"id":"6213256","text":"Kingsgate may refer to: ==Places== * Kingsgate, East Kilbride, Scotland * Kingsgate, Kent, England, part of Broadstairs * Kingsgate, Kirkland, Washington * Kingsgate, Winchester, Hampshire, England * Kingsgate, British Columbia * Kingsgate, Dunfermline, an indoor shopping centre located in the town centre of Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland * Kingsgate, Huddersfield, an indoor shopping centre located in the town centre of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England ==Other uses== * KingsGate Community Church, a large Christian Church with centres in Peterborough, Cambridge, and Leicester, England * Kingsgate (film), a 1989 film starring Christopher Plummer * Kingsgate Consolidated Limited, mining company operating Challenger mine and listed on the ASX as KCN ==See also== * King's Gate (disambiguation) ","title":"Kingsgate"},{"id":"6213261","text":"Pt. Vishnu Deo (Hindi: विष्णु देव) OBE (17 July 1900 - 7 May 1968) was the first Fiji born and bred leader of the Indo-Fijians. From his initial election to the Legislative Council in 1929 to his retirement in 1959, he remained the most powerful Indo-Fijians political leader in Fiji. He was a staunch supporter of Arya Samaj in Fiji and also the editor of the first successful Hindi-language newspaper to be published in Fiji. == Early life == Pandit Vishnu Deo was born on 17 July 1900. He attended Marist Brothers School and had a keen intellect, becoming a fluent debater in both English and Hindi. He joined the immigration department as a clerk in 1918, taught at a school established by M. N. Naidu in Lautoka in the early 1920s, and started his own importing and exporting agency in 1927. In 1922, he had assisted the Raju Commission which had been sent to Fiji to make enquiries into the plight of the Indian community. Vishnu Deo also founded a number of social and religious organisations. The Governor of Fiji proclaimed 15 May 1929 a public holiday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first Indians in Fiji, but Vishnu Deo wanted this to be a day of mourning; at a meeting in Lautoka on 12 May 1929, it was decided to fast and pray on the day and to form the Fiji Indian National Congress. While there was an official ceremony and floats through Suva, Vishnu Deo and his associates displayed a black flag and burned the indenture system in effigy. == Fight for equal rights == After a sustained campaign by Indo-Fijians for equal rights, constitutional amendments made in 1929 created three elected Indo-Fijian seats in the Legislative Council. In the elections later that year, Deo was elected to the Council, easily defeating John F. Grant in the Southern Division. Deo was sworn into the Legislative Council on 25 October 1929, and on 5 November moved a motion calling for common roll franchise. Upon the defeat of the motion, Vishnu Deo and the other two Indo-Fijians members resigned. The strength of support for his policy by the Indo-Fijians was demonstrated by the fact that when nominations were later called to fill the Legislative Council vacancies, no nominations were made. == Second World War == During the Second World War, Vishnu Deo advised Indo-Fijians to enlist in the Indian Platoon only if they were paid the same wages as Europeans. He was initially appointed to the Central Indian War Committee but had his appointment terminated when he published a serial record of a Committee meeting in his newspaper, the Fiji Samachar. According to his account, a majority of members at that meeting had expressed similar views regarding Indian enlistment. Later Deo, together with other Indian members of the Legislative Council, cooperated in recruiting volunteers for the Indian Civilian Labour Force. In June 1943 he addressed workers from the Ba and Lautoka sugar mills and persuaded some to join the Labour Force at better pay than what they were getting from their employer, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. == Religious activities == Vishnu Deo was a leader of Arya Samaj in Fiji. He took a proactive role in propagating the teachings of Swami Dayanand, some of which were the establishment of a castless society, education for girls, an end to child marriage and remarriage for widows. He soon found himself at loggerheads with other religious groups, who for the first time had to deal with a Hindu society aggressively promoting re-conversion to Hinduism. He participated in public debates, and during one of these debates published material for which he was convicted and fined. He was the editor of the Hindi language newspaper, Fiji Samachar, which was regarded as the mouthpiece of the Arya Samaj in Fiji. == Political leader == Although ineligible to contest the 1932 elections due to his earlier conviction, Vishnu Deo won the Southern Division seven times between 1937 and 1959.Elections for the Legislative Council: Southern Division 1929 - 1959 Fiji Election Archive During his early political career he worked closely with the other champion of common roll in Fiji, A. D. Patel. They did not have the same view on all issues, however; for example, Deo supported education in Hindi for Indo-Fijians, whereas A. D. Patel believed that regional Indian languages were the better choice for Indo-Fijians schools. As Vishnu Deo was based in the Southern Division and A.D. Patel in the Western Division, there was no competition between the two until it was decided to nominate an Indian into the Executive Council in 1948. Both Indian leaders believed that they deserved the honour, but Patel managed to outmanoeuvre Vishnu Deo and gain the support of three of the five Indian members of the Legislative Council to become the Indian Member of the Executive Council. During the next election, however, Vishnu Deo had his revenge when a candidate he supported (Tulsi Ram Sharma) easily defeated A.D. Patel, who was kept out of the Legislative Council for as long as Vishnu Deo remained politically active. After the 1950 Legislative Council elections, James Madhavan was chosen as the Indian member in the Executive Council. Vishnu Deo had to wait until 1956 before he finally joined the Executive Council. == Leader of the cane farmers == When negotiations began for the 1950 cane contract, there was a split among the Rewa farmers. Vishnu Deo stepped in to provide a unified voice for these farmers. From a personal perspective, this action ultimately had the effect of creating a further rift between himself and A.D. Patel, because he supported A.D. Patel's lifelong opponent, Ayodhya Prasad, in the ensuing cane dispute. == Later years == During his final years of public service, Deo no longer displayed his firebrand characteristics of the 1920s and 1930s, but instead had mellowed and became beloved and respected by all sections of Fiji's population. When Radio Fiji started broadcasting in July 1954, the first Hindi voice heard over the air in Fiji was that of Vishnu Deo, who presented the inaugural address.J.S. Kanwal, A Hundred Years of Hindi in Fiji, Fij Teachers' Union, Fiji, 1980 He had been appointed to the Commission in March 1954, following the death of Ami Chandra. On 14 September 1956 Pundit Vishnu Deo was appointed to the Executive Council. In the selection of Vishnu Deo, the Indian members displayed remarkable unity as reported by the Fiji Times (10/10/1956): > The appointment of Mr. Pdt. Vishnu Deo to the Executive Council was > unanimously endorsed at a meeting of the five Indian Legislative Council > members held at Nausori during the weekend. This is believed to be the first > time in Fiji when all Legislative Council members of any race combined > together to support the candidature of one of their own members into the > Executive Council. In November 1958, in his speech to welcome the new Governor, Sir Kenneth Maddocks, he again displayed a conciliatory approach and said: > I assure you Sir, that we will at all times co-operate with you in this > Council and outside the Council on all matters that are for the welfare of > the Colony and every section of the community. During the same sitting of the Legislative Council, H. B. Gibson, European member for Eastern Division, pointed out that although the rules of the Legislative Council made him the Senior Member, the Father of the House--both by length of service and by age--was Mr Vishnu Deo. == Legacy == Vishnu Deo died on 7 May 1968 but his contribution to the Indo-Fijians can be seen by the number of schools and roads named after him. Some of these are: * Vishnu Deo Road, located at Nasinu 9 ½ Miles and is the main trunk road to the newly developed suburb of Nakasi. * Vishnu Deo Secondary School, located between Lautoka and Nadi and is also the site of the University of Fiji. * Vishnu Deo Primary School, located in Raiwaga, Suva, was one of the first multi-racial schools established in Fiji == See also == * Arya Samaj in Fiji * Fiji Samachar == References == * Ramrakha on Vishnu Deo Category:Indian members of the Legislative Council of Fiji Category:1900 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Arya Samajis in Fiji Category:Politicians from Navua ","title":"Vishnu Deo"},{"id":"6213268","text":"Pular may refer to: *Pular language, a Fula language, spoken mainly in Guinea, West Africa *Pular (volcano), in Chile ","title":"Pular"},{"id":"6213271","text":"Daniel Gordon Amstutz (November 8, 1932 – March 20, 2006) was an American government official and business executive who played a prominent role during negotiation of the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules on agriculture, and in the U.S. occupation of Iraq. == Early life and education == Amstutz was born November 8, 1932, in Cleveland, Ohio. Amstutz was raised in Pennsylvania before the family relocated to Columbus, Ohio in 1946, where he graduated from Columbus North High School in 1950 and the Ohio State University in 1954. At Ohio State, Amstutz was president of the Student Senate and on the Student court, as well as being President of the Iota Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity. == Career == After graduating from Ohio State University in 1954, Amstutz joined Cargill, where he began in grain trading, eventually heading the wheat desk. He played a lead role in establishing Cargill Investor Services, of which he was president and CEO. He was persuaded to join Goldman Sachs by its top management who, having bought a metals trading company, were looking for someone to provide direction about ways to operate in futures. From 1983 to 1987, he was Under Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs, then served as Ambassador and Chief Negotiator for Agriculture during the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks from 1987 to 1989. Amstutz founded the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, which eliminated tariffs and greatly reduced federal price supports for American small farms, causing farmers to go bankrupt. ===Iraqi Occupation=== From April to September 2003, Amstutz led the U.S. Government’s agriculture reconstruction efforts in Iraq, serving as U.S. Senior Ministry Advisor for Agriculture. Given Amstutz's strong ties to U.S. multinational grain-trading companies, this appointment by the George W. Bush administration provoked criticism. The Guardian reported on a criticism from the development and humanitarian group Oxfam. According to the paper, > \\"Kevin Watkins, Oxfam's policy director, said Mr Amstutz would 'arrive with > a suitcase full of open-market rhetoric', and was more likely to try to dump > cheap US grain on the potentially lucrative Iraqi market than encourage the > country to rebuild its once-successful agricultural sector.

Criticism of the Amstutz appointment was also made in the House of Lords, where it was asked \\"why this decision was made in preference to appointing one of the experienced agricultural development specialists available within the United Nations system.\\" === Lobbying === From 1992 to 1995, Amstutz served as executive director of the International Grains Council in London, England. During his tenure, Amstutz expanded the council's coverage beyond wheat to rice and coarse grains, he launched the annual grain conferences, and he set a path for expanding the membership. From 1995 to 2000, Amstutz served as executive director of the North American Export Grain Association. At NAEGA, he lobbied for U.S. policies meant to foster growth in exporting and lobbied the U.S. Congress to push for less lenient regulations overseas of GMO foods, particularly in Europe. Amstutz attempted to establish his own consulting company in the midst of the Dot-com bubble. == Late life == Amstutz died on March 20, 2006. == References == Category:1932 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American lobbyists Category:Cargill people Category:General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Amstutz, Dan Category:United States Under Secretaries of Agriculture ","title":"Dan Amstutz"},{"id":"6213277","text":"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest is a baseball game for the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color, featuring real-life player Ken Griffey Jr. It was released in 1999. It is a sequel to Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr., released for the Nintendo 64, which itself was a sequel to Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball and Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run, both released for the Super NES. This version of the game contains actual player names, unlike the original. It contains Season, Exhibition, World Series and Home Run Derby modes. It also has familiar background music playing throughout the game. ==Gameplay== Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest was the second Ken Griffey Jr. game to use 3D computer graphics. The batting feature in this game is set up differently from most other baseball video games. The batter is given an elongated oval shape to control and in order for the batter to make contact with the ball, he must wait for the pitch location and then move the oval to the location of the pitch to make contact. Each batter will have a different sized oval or hitting zone depending on how strong of a hitter he is. This feature was originally developed in Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr. and carried over into this game with slight modifications. The fielding portion of this game makes use of the c-directional pad on the Nintendo 64 controller. As a fielder, you must run to the ball using the analog stick and then choose the correct c-button for the base to which you would like to throw. The controller has four c-buttons: c-up, c-left, c-right, and c-down and each of these represent a different base. Each c-button represents the base that would correspond with its location on the controller. For example, c-right represents first base, c-up represents second base, c-left represents third base, and c-down represents home plate. This game uses simple controls for pitching that are very similar to the controls of other baseball video games of the time. Before the pitch, there will be a menu that will show all available pitches that the pitcher can throw. In order to throw a certain pitch, you must press the button that is next to the pitch you would like to throw. The strike zone will be shown by a white rectangular box and any pitch that is located in the box will be a strike. Also, while the ball is being thrown, the pitcher may use the analog stick to move the pitch in any direction. There are several different pitches that can be thrown. They are: fastball, super fastball, change up, super change up, knuckleball, curveball, slider, and screwball. Every pitcher has his own unique set of pitches and no pitcher can throw all the pitches. The speed of the pitches can range anywhere from 37 mph to 103 mph. This game allows the player to select pitchers of a team from the bullpen or rotation. This game also allows the player to select different pitches to be thrown, based on each real life pitchers' abilities. The player of this game may create custom baseball players with different pitches, size, strength, and stamina. The player may also select the team, stadium, and choose between day or night and home or away games. ==Reception== The Nintendo 64 version received favorable reviews, while the Game Boy Color version received mixed reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation called the former version \\"one of the best arcade baseball titles in a while. Sure, the graphics pale in comparison to Acclaim's All-Star Baseball 2000, and realism is notably absent, but if you're more concerned about white-knuckled multiplayer games and .500 batting averages than pitching duels and squeeze plays, this is your game.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:1999 video games Category:Baseball video games Category:Ken Griffey Jr. video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Software Creations games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest"},{"id":"6213280","text":"This is a list of people who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with the city of Boston, Massachusetts and its surrounding metropolitan statistical area. ==0-9== * 7L & Esoteric – rap group ==A== Samuel Adams Ben Affleck Crispus Attucks * Abiel Abbot (1770–1828), born in Andover, clergyman and author * Benjamin Abbot (1762–1849), born in Andover, teacher at the Phillips Exeter Academy * Ezra Abbot (1819–1884), biblical scholar, taught at Harvard Divinity School * Joel Abbot (1776–1826), naval officer * Amos Abbott (1786–1868), born in Westford, member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts * Austin Abbott (1831–1896), born in Boston, lawyer, novelist, and academic * Benjamin Vaughan Abbott (1830–1890), born in Boston, lawyer and legal writer * Joseph Carter Abbott (1825–1882), publisher of the Boston Bee * Josiah Gardner Abbott (1814–1891), member of United States House of Representatives * Abigail Adams (1744–1818), born in Weymouth, First Lady of the United States * Abijah Adams (1754–1816), born in Boston, journalist, often embroiled in lawsuits against him * Charles Francis Adams, Sr. (1807–1886), born in Boston; son of Abigail Adams and John Adams; Congressman; diplomat; writer * Edwin Adams (1834–1877), born in Medford, 19th-century stage actor * Eliphalet Adams (1677–1753), born in Medford, clergyman and missionary * Hannah Adams (1755–1831), born in Medfield, famous Christian writer * Henry Adams (1838–1918), born in Boston, journalist, historian, academic and novelist * Jasper Adams (1793–1841), born in Medway, clergyman and college president * Nehemiah Adams (1806–1878), clergyman and author * Sammy Adams, musician * Samuel Adams, American Revolution patriot, signer of the Declaration of Independence * Aerosmith, band * Ben Affleck, Academy Award-winning actor, screenwriter and director, brother of Casey * Casey Affleck, Academy Award-winning actor, brother of Ben * George Aiken (1830–1876), born in Boston, actor and playwright * Amos T.

The novel was made into the film The League of Gentlemen, which was released in 1960 and became the year's most successful British film. ==Plot summary== Lt. Col. Hyde is forced into early retirement after 25 years of service as an officer in the British Army. To get his revenge Hyde recruits seven other officers for a special project. The officers are all equally dissatisfied and have skeletons in their closets. The job they are hired to do turns out to be a bank robbery. The seven former officers are all in bad standing with the army, and were all forced out of army for quite serious indiscretions. Hyde hires them for their respective specialities qualities that Hyde needs to succeed with the robbery. Before robbing the bank itself however, they stage a number of raids to get the weapons and trucks they need and all go off without a hitch. Hyde uses all his skills as a tactical military strategist and discipline to go ahead with the plan. The robbery is planned with military precision and everything really seems to go as planned - except for one simple error that gives them all away. ==Sequels== Boland wrote two sequels to The League of Gentlemen, The Gentlemen Reform and The Gentlemen at Large, which were published in 1961 and 1962 respectively by T.

He attended schools in Kent, first Whitehill Primary Schools and later Gravesend Grammar School. ==CareerNorwich City and Scotland=== Cave-Brown had been on the books of Charlton Athletic but joined on a scholarship at Norwich City for the 2004-05 season. He made his full Norwich debut in the dying moments of the FA Cup third round defeat against West Ham United in January 2006, and made his first start in the League Cup victory over Torquay United in August 2006, although he was stretchered off after half an hour with a leg injury. He signed a professional contract in April 2006. Cave-Brown was called up to the Scotland Under-19 squad in August 2005 and he played all qualifying games for the Scottish Under-19 side that reached the final of the 2006 European Under-19 Championship. Cave-Brown signed for King's Lynn on loan in December 2006, following the appointment of Keith Webb, the ex-Norwich City reserve team manager, as King's Lynn's new first team manager. He returned to Norwich in February 2007. In the summer of 2007, he represented Scotland in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, however the side were knocked out in the group stage having lost all three of their games against Japan, Nigeria and Costa Rica. ===Leyton Orient=== Cave-Brown was backup to summer (2007) signing Jon Otsemobor at Norwich, and was released at the end of the season in 2008, following Norwich's disappointing campaign. He then signed for Leyton Orient in July 2008, and made his first-team debut in Leyton Orient's 4–2 Johnston's Paint Trophy win against Southend United on 2 September. Unable to find a regular place in the first team, he was released by Orient manager Russell Slade on 9 May 2010. ===Non-league=== In August 2010, Cave-Brown signed for Lowestoft Town, making his debut in the 2–0 defeat at Carshalton Athletic on 21 August. During the 2011–12 season, he left Lowestoft due to work commitments outside football. In September 2012, Cave-Brown signed for Anglian Combination club Beccles Town and made his league debut in the 2–2 draw at Wymondham Town, scoring Beccles' second goal. ==References *Career stats at Soccerbase *https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175013/http://www.lowestofttownfc.co.uk/page/news.asp?ID=1277 Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Lowestoft Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from Gravesend, Kent Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:People educated at Gravesend Grammar School Category:Association football fullbacks ","title":"Andrew Cave-Brown"},{"id":"6213333","text":"Lionel Richie is an American R&B; and pop singer-songwriter, who has released 10 studio albums, three live albums, and seven compilation albums. Formerly the lead vocalist of The Commodores, Richie began a solo career in the early 1980s and has released over 40 singles, five of which became number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100. Richie's first three studio albums have all been certified \\"Multi-Platinum\\" by the Recording Industry Association of America. His second album, Can't Slow Down, is his most successful, being certified 10× Platinum (i.e. Diamond) in the US. The album spent 59 consecutive weeks inside the Billboard Top 10 (including the entire year of 1984) and a total of 160 weeks (over three years) on the Billboard 200 chart. It became the third best- selling album of 1984, and eventually sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In addition to multiple pop, R&B;, and adult contemporary hit singles, two of his singles reached the Top 30 of the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart (now Hot Country Songs). \\"Deep River Woman\\", which features country music group Alabama, was a Top 10 hit on the country music charts in 1987.

A native of Padilla, department of Chuquisaca, Torrelio joined the Bolivian Army and rose to the rank of general. He served as the notorious dictator Luis García Meza's Minister of Interior after the departure, forced by Washington, of the equally-infamous Colonel Luis Arce. The García Meza regime became internationally known for its extreme brutality. Some 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the Bolivian army and security forces between July 1980 and August 1981. In addition, the García Meza government was deeply involved in drug trafficking activities, and may have come to power financed directly by the drug cartels. This led to the complete isolation of the regime. Even the new conservative government of U.S. President Ronald Reagan kept its distance and seemed to prefer better options. Eventually, the international outcry was sufficiently strong to force García Meza's resignation on 3 August 1981. The high command of the Military of Bolivia at that point entrusted General Celso Torrelio with the presidency. Although the military's idea was to replace the polarizing García Meza with a less controversial and more acceptable leader equally as committed to the principles of the anti-communist National Security Doctrine, their plan did not come to fruition. The regime continued to be shunned internationally and despised domestically. Furthermore, a very grave economic crisis loomed on the horizon, the result of years of mismanagement, a global recession, and the onset of the so-called Latin American debt crisis. Faced with the choices of mounting a fresh repressive campaign to re-equilibrate the reeling regime (with the increased international isolation such a move would entail) or call elections, the high command chose the latter. In July 1982, General Torrelio was replaced with General Guido Vildoso, who was charged with returning the country to democratic rule. Torrelio then retired and did not return to play any role in Bolivian politics. Torrelio was replaced by the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (1982). ==See also== * Government of Celso Torrelio Villa, 1981–82 ==Sources== *Prado Salmón, Gral.

It is located south west of Leyburn. It falls within the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire. The population was estimated at 70 in 2013. In the 2011 Census the population of the parish was included with the parish of West Witton, and not separately counted. The village lies on the south bank of the River Cover. The parish extends south of the village, rising over West Scrafton Moor to the peak of Great Haw. West Scrafton has featured several times in the British television series All Creatures Great and Small, in the episodes \\"A New Chapter\\" and \\"Alarms & Excursions\\". It is also where James Herriot, whose books were the inspiration for the series, holidayed with his wife, Joan.James Herriot's Yorkshire (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's Scrafton was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The name is Old English, from scræf and tūn, meaning \\"settlement at the hollow\\". By 1286 Scrafton had been divided into East Scrafton and West Scrafton. East Scrafton was the smaller place, and is now a hamlet in the neighbouring civil parish of Caldbergh with East Scrafton. In the Middle Ages West Scrafton was a vill held by the Abbot of Coverham. It was historically a township in the large ancient parish of Coverham in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1974 it was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire. In the 19th century a small coal mine, the West Scrafton Colliery, was worked on the moorland south of the village. It was abandoned in 1914. == References  External links == * West Scrafton website Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire Category:Coverdale (dale) ","title":"West Scrafton"},{"id":"6213394","text":"Monarch Ski and Snowboard Area is a ski resort located in the state of Colorado. It is twenty miles (32 km) west of Salida, Colorado, on U.S. Highway 50. The resort is situated on Monarch Pass at the continental divide. It has 54 trails, two terrain parks, and an extreme terrain area called Mirkwood. The Monarch Mountain Lodge is located three miles (5 km) east of the ski area in the town of Garfield, Colorado. Monarch is open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. from mid-November to early April. Monarch Ski Area is advertised as a locals' mountain and charges lower lift-ticket prices than most mountain resorts in Colorado. Monarch Ski Area is named after Monarch Pass and the associated Monarch Mountain. Monarch pass and Monarch Mountain themselves are named after the 19th-century town Monarch, which was razed by the CDOT to make way for US Route 50. Snow rafting on Monarch Mountain ==History== Monarch first opened in 1939, with one rope tow running up the run named Gunbarrel: a long, steep, heavily-moguled run on the south side of the area. The tow rope was powered by a Chevy engine when it was first opened. Monarch has been owned and sold many times and is currently owned by many separate parties, none owning more than 25%. ==Ski School== A Sprung building was built in 2007 to be the new home for the ski school and rental shop. The ski school offers lessons for all ages and abilities in all three disciplines (ski, snowboard, and telemark). All equipment needed for the three disciplines are available for rental on-site. The rental shop also offers tune-ups and waxing. ==Terrain parks== The run formerly known as Slo-Motion was developed into the K2 terrain park in 2008. It is composed of all-natural features, including logs, stumps, and jumps. The run can be used by anyone, even if they have no intent of using any of the features. It is now known as the Never Summer terrain park. There is a small park at the base of the panorama double chairlift. ==External links== * Ski Monarch * Monarch's History Category:Ski areas and resorts in Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Chaffee County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Chaffee County, Colorado ","title":"Monarch Ski Area"},{"id":"6213399","text":"Salle Moulay Abdellah is an indoor sporting arena located in Rabat, Morocco.

He is known worldwide for his water color paintings. ==Background== Holzman was born in 1907 in Sambir, Galicia. He immigrated to Mandate Palestine from Vienna, Austria in 1922, settled in Tel Aviv, and began working as a house painter with his father. In 1926, Holzman began private studies under Yitzhak Frenkel at the studio of painting arts of the Histadrut School where he also worked with Mordechai Levanon, Ziona Tajar, Avigdor Stematsky, Yehezkel Streichman, Moshe Castel, and Arie Aroch. In 1929, he made his first of several influential visits to Paris, France. There, he studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and exhibited frequently. Israeli art scholar Gideon Ofrat writes of Holzman's time in France: he \\"brought from Paris impeccably French interiors and landscapes in expressionistic oils, but replaced them with lighthearted aquarelles in the manner of Raoul Dufy and Henri Matisse.\\" As a result of his studies under Frenkel - himself heavily influenced by the École de Paris - and lengthy stays in France, Holzman's oeuvre has a strong French undercurrent. He was deeply influenced by Matisse, and his colour palette evinces a marked Fauvist imprint. Gideon Ofrat further explains: \\"Holzman's landscapes (Galilean in the main) and characters (mostly Oriental) would convey optimism and mischievous gaiety; his sketch line, designed for a temperamentally rhythmic role, was overlaid with splotches of color, abstract and charmingly translucent.\\" Holzman was a founding member of the Artists' Quarter in Safed, represented Israel at the 1959 Venice Biennale, and participated in a group exhibition of Israeli artists at the opening of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. Holzman is considered a modern master of the watercolour medium. On the tradition of watercolour painting in Israel, Avishay Ayal of the University of Haifa explains: \\"originating in the early 15th century, this technique was a means for rapid sketching… In pre-State Palestine and in the early days of the State of Israel, aquarelle painting was a cheap and rapid method to disseminate art. Given the poverty that characterized the entire period, painting in watercolour and purchasing works on paper became a cheap, available option… Many of the Israeli abstract artists were great experts in watercolour painting.\\" Ayal writes further: \\"several artists became known at the time mainly as aquarellists, and their works were highly popular during that period. The paintings of Joseph Kossonogi, Mordechai Avniel, and Shimshon Holzman are full of momentum, the color flows within extensive water stains, and they represent the spirit of an era rich in practice that looks to the future with optimism.\\" Holzman's orientalist-inspired works depicting Israeli land and seascapes and Bedouin, Arab, and Jewish life are highlights of mid- twentieth century Israeli painting. He died in Tel Aviv in 1986. ==Awards== In 1937, Holzman was a co-recipient of the first Dizengoff Prize, Israel's highest honour for contributions to the Arts. Holzman won the Haifa Municipality Prize in 1948 and was awarded the Dizengoff Prize a second time in 1959. ==Selected exhibitions== * 2004: University of Haifa Art Gallery, Haifa: Our Landscape: Notes on Landscape Painting in Israel (online catalogue) * 1991: The Open Museum, Tefen: A Summer Celebration: Paintings of the Israeli Landscape Artist Shimshon Holzman * 1964: Galerie Jacques Chalom, Paris: Figures & Landscapes of the Galilee * 1963: Temple Sinai, Washington: Seven Painters of Israel: Ardon, Castel, Holzman, Mokady, Rubin, Shemi & Steinhardt * 1954: Obelisk Gallery, Washington * 1951: Galerie Léon Marseille, Paris: Holzman: Paysages d'Israël ==Selected collections== * Israel Museum, Jerusalem * Tel Aviv Museum of Art ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Ayal, Avishay, and Yoram Bar-Gal.

It was a collaboration between AOL and Telepictures Productions, a division of Warner Bros., until Time Warner divested AOL in 2009. The name TMZ stands for thirty- mile zone, the historic \\"studio zone\\" within a 30-mile (50 km) radius centered at the intersection of West Beverly Boulevard and North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. TMZ's managing editor is Harvey Levin, a lawyer- turned-journalist who was previously a legal expert for the Los Angeles television station KCBS-TV. The site claims that it does not pay for stories or interviews; however, Levin has admitted that TMZ does \\"sometimes pay sources for leads on stories\\". A companion television series, TMZ on TV, debuted on September 10, 2007. ==Development== Three months prior to the official launch of TMZ, America Online (AOL) had hinted that it was planning to launch a Hollywood and entertainment-centric news site that would be produced in conjunction with Telepictures Productions and had shown interest in launching a website featuring a focus mainly on celebrities. At the time of the launch, AOL confirmed that the site would primarily feature and consist of Hollywood gossip, including interviews, photos and video footage of celebrities and information pertaining to industry news on movies, television shows, etc. The site was described as \\"an effort to further feed the current American obsession with celebrities\\". Mike Shields of MediaWeek.com wrote, \\"the site also boasts of an expansive collection of archived star photos and videos\\", allowing fans to \\"trace changing hairlines and waistlines of their favorites performers over the years\\". ==Background== Since 2005, TMZ has signed Revlon, Chrysler, Hilton Hotels and New Line Cinema as charter advertisers to their website. The New York Times cited TMZ as \\"one of the most successful online ventures of the last few years.\\" In October 2008, the New York Times reported that TMZ, at the time, was receiving more than 10 million viewers every month. Alexa.com ranked TMZ as the 505th most trafficked website worldwide and as the 155th most trafficked website in the United States. Levin has acknowledged that TMZ has passed on multiple notable coverages because he felt that, while the stories are true, he questioned how the sources obtained their information. Levin has acknowledged that TMZ pays sources, but in the form of a \\"tip fee\\". Levin stated that TMZ pays for photos and for 'tips' or leads on stories, and defended TMZ's position by stating that the sources and tips are verified before being used or reported. In November 2009, TMZ's revenue was publicly disclosed for the first time. Telepictures (which TMZ is operated by) stated: \\"Subject to certain performance adjustments and the reimbursement of expenses, revenues are split evenly between the parties [...] Telepictures received payments of 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and 12.7 million, 9.6 million and 3.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.\\" Based on released figures, TMZ's revenues for 2008 was 25.4 million and is projected to have less revenue in the 2009 year with the revenue of $12.4 million in first three quarters of the year—unlike the previous year, which was within the 15 million range. On May 29, 2012, co- founder Jim Paratore died of a heart attack during a cycling trip in France. Paratore was known for his work in television production, producing several daytime and syndicated programs, particularly while serving as an executive at Telepictures (which co-produces the website's companion syndicated television series).Jim Paratore, Co-Creator of TMZ, Dies at 58, The New York Times, June 1, 2012. ==Legal issuesContempt of court motion=== On June 20, 2007, a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee filed an emergency motion requesting that the TMZ website be held in contempt for its publication of the entire manuscript of If I Did It, O. J. Simpson's purportedly fictionalized account of the murder of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. The filing claimed TMZ's posting of the PDF of the entire book has \\"diminished or destroyed\\" its value. ===Photographer altercation=== While actor Woody Harrelson was at New York City's LaGuardia Airport, he had an altercation with a photographer for TMZ. Harrelson defended himself stating that he had at the time just finished filming his scenes from the horror film, that consists mainly of zombies, Zombieland, and that he was \\"startled\\" by the TMZ photographer. \\"I wrapped a movie called Zombieland, in which I was constantly under assault by zombies, then flew to New York, still very much in character ... With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo, who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie.\\" ===Temporary block in the UK=== On December 24, 2010, the gossip blog \\"Oh No They Didn't\\" reported that TMZ began blocking traffic from the UK, displaying the message: \\"Due to laws within your region, you are unable to view this website.\\" Asked for further comment, TMZ responded that the blocking was due to \\"legal restrictions\\" related to English defamation law. The UK website \\"Popbitch Board\\" noted on December 31, 2010 that it is possible to get around the block by accessing the website through the Google Translate website. As of January 7, 2011, TMZ is accessible in the UK. ==BranchesTMZ Live=== TMZ Live is a live-chat program from TMZ that features Levin and fellow TMZ executive producer Charles Latibeaudiere, and occasionally senior producer Michael Babcock filling in for one or both hosts. Other TMZ staffers (mainly those who regularly appear on TMZ on TV) also appear on the broadcast as contributors to provide additional outline of the story as well as to provide opinion. The live webcast takes place at the TMZ offices in Los Angeles,Harvey Levin confirmed, during a TMZ live chat, that the live chat takes place in TMZ's office. and is broadcast on TMZ.com Monday through Fridays from approximately 1:30 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time (the length varies depending on the featured segments). The TMZ Live television and Internet programs review stories that TMZ is covering on the website, and at times, features live interviews (most of which are conducted through webcam conferencing) as well as viewer opinions via Twitter, telephone and video chat (including Skype). In addition, the program features regular segments towards the end of each edition: \\"Viewer's Choice\\" (aired as the penultimate segment) featuring viewer questions or comments about stories featured in the broadcast, with additional commentary or analysis by the hosts; \\"Hate Mail,\\" featured on the Wednesday edition of the webcast (the Thursday edition on the television broadcast), in which negative emails and letters sent by viewers (some of which feature potshots at Levin or Latibeaudiere) are read by the hosts; \\"Tim's Rejects,\\" featured on the Thursday edition of the webcast (the Friday edition on the television broadcast), in which staffer Tim Nowak presents three offbeat news stories (that are not entertainment or sports- related) which are critiqued by the hosts; and \\"The Loser's Circle,\\" featured on the Friday edition of the webcast (the Monday edition on the television broadcast) since February 2015, in which Levin, Latibeaudiere and TMZ on TV executive producer Evan Rosenblum judge a clip from a TMZ videographer that was originally rejected from being posted on TMZ.com by Levin or broadcast on TMZ on TV by post-production supervisor Chad Weiser following its initial pitch. \\"Tim's Rejects\\" and \\"Hate Mail\\" were previously aired as the last segment of their respective editions until April 2015, when they were shifted to the block preceding that occupied by the \\"Viewer's Choice\\" segment (at which point, all three segments as well as \\"The Loser's Circle\\" began to be followed by a story segment). In March 2012, Fox Television Stations tested a syndicated broadcast of TMZ Live (which is an hour-long edited version of the live webcast that is broadcast on a one-day delay from its original tape date, with segments aired in a different order, mainly due to live interviews that require the segment to be shown out of order on the webcast for varied reasons) on its television stations in Los Angeles and Phoenix. In June 2012, SiriusXM Radio announced that the show would be aired daily on its Sirius XM Stars channel. In October of that year, the television show was expanded to seven markets, adding Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit and Minneapolis. On September 9, 2013, TMZ Live began airing on all 18 Fox owned-and-operated stations. The program began to be syndicated to stations outside of the Fox Television Stations group in the spring of 2014. ===TMZ on TV=== On September 10, 2007, TMZ launched an accompanying television series, TMZ on TV. The syndicated television program airs Monday through Fridays. In the United States, the show airs in various timeslots on stations of varying network affiliation (primarily on Fox stations), mainly either in early primetime or after late local newscasts, with an hour-long 'best-of' program compiling select stories from the weekday broadcasts airing on weekends. The show covers stories similar to those found on the website and TMZ Live, with the main difference being that TMZ on TV largely delivers its stories in a humorous manner whereas a mix of humorous and serious news stories appear on the website and companion web/television series. TMZ offers viewers the option of being able to view the two most recent episodes of the program on TMZ.com after the episode's original airdate (being available for viewing for two days after the broadcast on weekdays and three days after the original broadcast on weekends). Chris Persell, of TVWeek.com, stated that the show is a \\"complement [to] the website, with news updates added to later airings of the show\\". Levin and Jim Paratore served as executive producers to the show, and the on-air cast originally included Teresa Strasser, John Fugelsang, Ben Mankiewicz and Michael Hundgen. David Bianculli of The New York Daily News strongly criticized the television show, its topics, and what he sees as its reporters' tactics and lack of professionalism. ===Dax Chat=== Dax Chat is a live chat program on Ustream hosted by TMZ clip clearance producer Dax Holt. In the broadcasts, Holt talks to \\"Chizzlers\\" about celebrity gossip and articles that have been posted on the TMZ website. ===TMZ Sports=== As early as 2009, Levin was rumored to be interested in creating a TMZ branded sports site. The site was initially expected to launch in March 2010 but those plans did not see fruition. It eventually launched as a branded section on the main TMZ website in June 2013. Premiere Networks launched a daily TMZ Sports radio show in October 2013. A television show began testmarketing on select regional Fox stations in January 2014. It then aired during the 2014/2015 seasons on Reelz under name TMZ Hollywood Sports. On November 9, 2015, the series reverted to being known as TMZ Sports and moved to Fox Sports 1. TMZ Sports is co-hosted by Evan Rosenblum, Michael Babcock, and WNBA player Renee Montgomery. ==Criticism== Victory Studios in Glendale, California (pictured here in 2007), where TMZ launched. TMZ later relocated to Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles. Since April 2013, TMZ is located in Marina del Rey, California. Since the launch of TMZ, the website has faced criticism, varying from attempted boycotts to criticism of its journalism tactics and of its focus. It has been criticized for its usage of photographs and videos obtained from paparazzi. Some have questioned the effect that aggressive and obtrusive photographers have on the subjects they cover. Many of the videos on the site show, in the footage, that their paparazzi chase people (mainly celebrities)—a practice that has been called dangerous and \\"creepy\\". Over the years, some have called for a boycott of TMZ and of the accompanying show. TMZ has also faced internal criticism due to Harvey Levin's emerging support for Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election. By 2020, dozens of former TMZ employees had spoken to the media about a racist and misogynistic workplace culture which TMZ's internal leadership was unwilling to change. === Suicide details === TMZ has received considerable criticism for its coverage of details regarding celebrity deaths, particularly suicides. After the death of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington in 2017, TMZ came under criticism for revealing detailed descriptions of Chester Bennington's suicide, including his method and immediate surroundings. Bennington's widow Talinda responded with criticism of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office as well as TMZ, concluding a Twitter tirade with the hashtag \\"#FuckyouTMZ\\". In 2018, TMZ again posted intimate details of Swedish DJ Avicii's suicide method, revealing it through several sources — some in disagreement with each other. Chester Bennington's widow reacted again unfavourably, criticising TMZ and urging people to \\"[Not] click on the TMZ article or any other about the private details of Avicii’s passing\\", adding \\"This is how [we] can stop [filthy TMZ].\\" === Indiana Jones === TMZ faced strong criticism for purchasing stolen items pertaining to the fourth Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. On October 2, 2007, IESB reported that a number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the production budget had been stolen from Steven Spielberg's production office. Movie City News, which strongly criticized TMZ for purchasing stolen items, remarked that the then-new website \\"wasn't getting off to a good start\\". According to IESB, TMZ had obtained some of the stolen property and was planning on running a story about the topic on their TV show, until the lawyers of the film's production company, Paramount Pictures, intervened. Shortly after IESB broke the story, TMZ broadcast details about the Indiana Jones production budget on their show on October 3, 2007. === Story gathering tactics === Tony Manfred of The Cornell Daily Sun strongly criticized TMZ in an article entitled \\"I Want My TMZ\\", in which Manfred criticizes various aspects of TMZ. Manfred described TMZ as being \\"a fusion of celebrity news blog and embarrassing video archive\\" and felt that the website had become \\"the poster child for the celebrity pseudo-news industry\\" and that the website has \\"distinct advantages\\" over \\"gossip magazines\\" because it can \\"show all the borderline pornographic clips that Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood can't.\\" Jennifer Metz and David Muir of ABC News acknowledged that TMZ has long been criticized for their \\"aggressive tactics, antagonizing stars with video cameras\\" and noted that those \\"encounters, capturing at times violent celebrity confrontations with photographers, receive hundreds of hits online, and critics ask if entertainment reporters are crossing the line.\\" Metz and Muir questioned whether TMZ's tactics \\"go too far\\". Ken Sunshine, publicist for Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio, stated that his clients disliked the website because it has a tendency to be negative towards celebrities when reporting on them. \\"I hate that they have anything to do with trying to put celebrities into the worst light possible and that they play the 'gotcha' game\\". A student news paper criticized for having a personality cult of figures such as Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton – celebrities who are known more as targets for paparazzi than for the work they do. In defense for TMZ's coverage, Levin said that certain celebrities are main subjects on the Web site because of their \\"relevancy\\" and because their relevancy helps draw viewership to the Web site. Liz Kelly of Washington Post attacked both Levin and TMZ in an article, stating \\"I know this is like spitting in the wind, but I have to say it: Harvey Levin, please stop it.\\" === Murder of Andre Lowe === On January 16, 2013, Andre Lowe was killed outside of a nightclub in Hollywood. A nearby reporter from TMZ ended up filming the attack and it was posted to the website without permission of the family. On January 22, 2013, TMZ ended up taking down the video after over two dozen advertisers revoked ads for the website because of the campaign. === Death of Kobe Bryant === At 11:24 a.m. Pacific Time on January 26, 2020, TMZ reported on the death of basketball player Kobe Bryant, being the first news outlet to do so. TMZ has received backlash, notably from Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, for reporting on the story before next of kin had been notified. === Channel Awesome === In 2013, Internet reviewer Doug Walker criticized the show in his \\"Top 11 South Park Episodes\\" for his reviewing series, Nostalgia Critic. The producers of TMZ were angered by the criticism and later contacted Blip, one of the sites that hosted the Nostalgia Critic videos, and had that specific video removed as a result. Walker's responded by making a sketch in his review of A.I. Artificial Intelligence parodying TMZ in a negative fashion. ===Incorrect information===  John F. Kennedy  In what The Smoking Gun called \\"a colossal screw-up\\", TMZ published an \\"exclusive\\" picture on their website of a man purported to be John F. Kennedy on a ship with several naked women that could have \\"changed history\\" had it come out during his presidential campaign. Despite having a Photoshop expert proclaiming the picture as \\"authentic\\", the picture was later discovered to have not been of Kennedy at all. The photo was discovered to have been part of a Playboy photoshoot from November 1967, which was later confirmed by Playboy representatives.  Lil Wayne  On March 15, 2013, members of TMZ's staff claimed that they had learned rapper Lil Wayne was in an \\"unstable\\" condition after he was hospitalized following a seizure and that the 30-year-old rapper had been placed in an induced coma and was breathing through tubes. Soon after the report was made, Lil Wayne's friend Mack Maine responded to TMZ's allegations on his Twitter account by stating that Wayne was \\"alive and well\\" and that he was currently at Wayne's bedside \\"watching the Syracuse game\\" with him. Maine also added that Wayne's condition was never that serious and that Wayne was never in a coma or breathing through tubes. Soon afterwards, Birdman stated on his Twitter account that Wayne was healthy enough to be released from the hospital. Approximately one hour after these messages were made, Wayne himself stated on his Twitter account that he was fine. == References  Further reading == * == External links == * * TMZ TV Official MySpace page Category:2005 establishments in California Category:American news websites Category:English-language websites Category:Internet properties established in 2005 Category:Telepictures Category:WarnerMedia brands ","title":"TMZ"},{"id":"6213426","text":"East Scrafton is a hamlet in the Yorkshire Dales in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England.

The singers during the concert included Michael Bolton, Cher, Toni Braxton, Patti Labelle, Sugar Ray, and Diana Ross. Celebrities in attendance included John Travolta, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Alexander, and Muhammad Ali and his wife Lonnie Ali.

Three other men involved with the gala have also since been convicted of federal felonies. Co-organizer Aaron Tonken was sentenced to 63 months in jail for committing fraud connected with charity fund raising. Sponsor Raymond Reggie was convicted of bank fraud and served time in jail.

The village of Patrick Brompton and other villages in the parish are mentioned in the Domesday Book which was completed in 1086. When published, there were 27 households in the village consisting of 22 villagers and 5 smallholders. The 'Hundred', Count Alan also had 195 other places including Bedale and Bellerby. The name 'Patrick Brompton' derives from the personal name 'Patrick' and Brompton derives from 'broom', a thorny bush or shrub and 'tun' deriving from an enclosure; a village; an estate. Patrick Brompton is also mentioned on the GENUKI website and in the 1820s, described as: :Patrick Brompton, (or East Brompton) a parish in the wapentake of Hang East & liberty of Richmondshire; 3½ miles NW. of Bedale.

Population of Patrick Brompton, 1801 to 2011 The dramatic drop in population around 1850 could be because the parish boundaries have changed over time. == Transport == The A684 runs through the village and the A1(M) motorway is approximately to the east of the village and 4 hours direct to London.

Lawrence was born in Springfield, Ohio, and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. His career started in the Negro National League, where he earned the nickname \\"Bull\\". Lawrence's Major League debut came in 1954. As a 29-year-old rookie, Lawrence went 15–6 with a 3.74 ERA while starting and relieving for the St. Louis Cardinals. He struggled in 1955 and was demoted to Oakland (in the Pacific Coast League), but he went 5–1 down the stretch and earned a second chance with the big-league club. Lawrence's best season came in 1956. Prior to that year, St. Louis sent Lawrence and Sonny Senerchia to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jackie Collum. With the Reds that season, Lawrence posted a 19–10 record and a 3.99 ERA. He opened the season with 13 consecutive wins and earned a spot on the National League All-Star team. That year he led the Reds in wins, innings pitched and shutouts. Lawrence's career came to a close in 1960, and he retired with an overall record of 69–62 with a 4.25 ERA in 1,040.7 innings pitched. Due largely to his 13-game winning streak and his association with the surprisingly successful 1956 Reds club, Lawrence earned induction into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1976. After his retirement from baseball, Lawrence worked for International Harvester in his hometown of Springfield, Ohio.

It is a proclaimed architectural and folklore reserve and lies in the central Rhodope Mountains, 23 km (14 mi) northwest of Smolyan, 16 km (10 mi) west of Pamporovo and 22 km (14 mi) southeast of Devin. The dominant and traditional religion in the village is Eastern Orthodox Christianity and the population is 573 (). Shiroka Laka lies at 1,206 m above sea level, at . The mayor is Aleksandar Kavroshilov. The village has existed at this place since the 17th century and was founded by Bulgarians fleeing from the forcible Islamization conducted by the Ottoman authorities of the time in the Rhodopes. ==Architecture== Shiroka Laka is famous for its authentic Rhodopean houses set in tiers on both banks of the local river. The old houses were designed in the characteristic architectural style of the Rhodopes by the noted local building masters, and feature two storeys, oriels, built-in cupboards and a small cellar with a hiding place. The thick white walls hide the yard from the outsiders' eyes. The yard is small and slab-covered and has a typical stone drinking fountain in the middle. Some of the most famous houses are those of the Zgurov, Uchikov and Grigorov families. 19th century St. Theotokos (Holy Mother) Church and St. Panteleimonas School The local Church of the Holy Mother of God was constructed in 1834 for 38 days according to the legend. It boasts an authentic iconostasis, possibly painted by apprentices of the brothers Dimitar and Zahari Zograf from Samokov, or even by the brothers themselves. The old school, built in 1835, is located near the church. There is one more church in the village, the Church of St Nicholas. ==Culture== Shiroka Laka is known not only for its old Bulgarian architecture, but also for its singing tradition and the kaba gaida, a local type of bagpipe. Some of the most prominent singers of Rodopi music come from the village, including the Kushlevi Sisters, and many of the local families are well familiar with the style. A secondary school for folklore songs and instruments was founded in 1972. Among its graduates are Neli Andreeva, soloist and singer with the Philip Kutev Folklore Ensemble, and composer Georgi Andreev. On the first Sunday of March, the village also hosts one of the best known kukeri (specific Bulgarian type of carnival) celebrations in the country, Pesponedelnik as it is called. On that day, people dressed as folklore monsters, carrying wooden swords and painted red, dance around the village to drive the evil spirits out of the homes and the peoples' souls. Their costumes are decorated with bulbs of garlic, beans and peppers and they wear a belt with characteristic Rhodope bells attached to it. ==External links== * Shiroka Laka Information Centre * Shiroka Laka at Journey.bg * Nikola Gruev's photo gallery of Shiroka Laka * Shiroka Laka Folklore Reserve Category:Villages in Smolyan Province ","title":"Shiroka Laka"},{"id":"6213536","text":"Photosynth is a discontinued app and service from Microsoft Live Labs and the University of Washington that analyzes digital photographs and generates a three-dimensional model of the photos and a point cloud of a photographed object.Microsoft shoots for 3D multi-photo viewer  CNET News.com Pattern recognition components compare portions of images to create points, which are then compared to convert the image into a model. Users are able to view and generate their own models using a software tool available for download at the Photosynth website. ==History== Photosynth is based on Photo Tourism, a research project by University of Washington graduate student Noah Snavely. Shortly after Microsoft's acquisition of Seadragon in early 2006, that team began work on Photosynth, under the direction of Seadragon founder Blaise Agüera y Arcas. Microsoft released a free tech preview version on November 9, 2006. Users could view models generated by Microsoft or the BBC, but not create their own models at that time. Microsoft teamed up with NASA on August 6, 2007 allowing users to preview its Photosynth technology showing the Space Shuttle Endeavour. On August 20, 2007, a preview showing the tiles of Endeavour during the backflip process was made available for viewing. On August 20, 2008, Microsoft officially released Photosynth to the public, allowing users to upload their images and generate their own Photosynth models. In March 2010, Photosynth added support for gigapixel panoramas stitched in Microsoft ICE. The panoramas use Seadragon based technology similar to the system already used in synths. In July 2015, Microsoft announced it would be retiring the Photosynth mobile apps. As Photosynth prepared to shut down in early 2017, Mapillary, a crowdsourced street-level imaging platform, reached out to the Photosynth community with their Photosynth-to-Mapillary blog post, and the official Photosynth Twitter account suggested users \\"check them out\\". On 6 February 2017, Microsoft decommissioned the Photosynth website and services. On 20 December 2017, Photosynth returned as a feature of the Microsoft Pix app. ==Process== In March 2010, Photosynth added the ability to upload Panoramas. Here, the edge of a panorama of a valley can be seen. The Photosynth technology works in two steps. The first step involves the analysis of multiple photographs taken of the same area. Each photograph is processed using an interest point detection and matching algorithm developed by Microsoft Research which is similar in function to UBC's Scale-invariant feature transform. This process identifies specific features, for example the corner of a window frame or a door handle. Features in one photograph are then compared to and matched with the same features in the other photographs. Thus photographs of the same areas are identified. By analyzing the position of matching features within each photograph, the program can identify which photographs belong on which side of others. By analyzing subtle differences in the relationships between the features (angle, distance, etc.), the program identifies the 3D position of each feature, as well as the position and angle at which each photograph was taken. This process is known scientifically as bundle adjustment and is commonly used in the field of photogrammetry, with similar products available such as Imodeller and D-Sculptor. This first step is extremely computationally intensive, but only has to be performed once on each set of photographs. The second step involves the display of and navigation through the 3D point cloud of features identified in the first step. This is done with the publicly downloadable Photosynth viewer. The viewer resides on a client computer and maintains a connection to a server that stores the original photographs. It enables a user to, among other things, see any of the photographs from their original vantage point. It incorporates DeepZoom technology Microsoft obtained through its acquisition of Seadragon in January 2006. The Seadragon technology enables smooth zooming into the high-resolution photographs without downloading them to the user's machine. The Photosynth Direct 3D-based viewing software is only available to the Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP operating systems. However, the team released a Silverlight version of the viewer which has succeeded the D3D viewer as the main option to view photosynths. ==Mobile apps== As of March 2009, user uploaded Photosynth collections were available for viewing on iPhones using iSynth (3D) or Seadragon Mobile (2D only). The Photosynth application was also available from the App Store to download on iPod Touch and iPhone. In May 2012, Microsoft released a Photosynth App for its mobile platform, Windows Phone. On July 10, 2015, Microsoft announced that they are retiring the Photosynth Mobile Apps, removing them from their stores, and are no longer supporting or updating them.Photosynth mobile apps being retired While the Photosynth platform was shut down in early 2017, its features re-appeared in the fall within the Microsoft Pix app for iOS. ==Capabilities== The latest generation of photosynths are easy to capture, as photographs taken by any regular digital camera or mobile phone can be uploaded to Photosynth. Users have the option to geotag their digital shots on sites such as Flickr and then upload them to the online Photosynth web service. Images uploaded on Photosynth give people the ability to seamlessly view landmarks, public spaces and objects from all sides. *Walk or fly through a scene to see photos from any angle *Zoom in or out of a photo *See where pictures were taken in relation to one another *Smoothly change viewing angle between nearby photos *Smoothly zoom in and out of high-resolution photos *Find similar photos to the one you're currently viewing == In the media == * On April 30, 2008, Photosynth was featured in the episode Admissions of the television show CSI: New York.Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

It merged into Barclays Bank in 1896. ==History== The bank was founded in 1770 by John and Henry Gurney, sons of John Gurney (1688–1741), who passed the business to Henry's son, Bartlett Gurney, in 1777. The bank was founded in what is now known as Bank Plain (formerly Redwell Street). The Quaker Gurneys were renowned for their honesty, reliability, and fair dealings — so people entrusted them their money for safe keeping. About 1777, Alderman Poole, a wine merchant, sold Bartlett Gurney premises near to the red well, and Gurney installed safes for bullion. A junior clerk slept on the trapdoor to the vaults to safeguard the valuables. The bank issued its own notes. A bull mastiff (complete with brass collar) stood on guard inside the doors at the Bank Plain premises, and there was always a blunderbuss at the ready. Bartlett Gurney died in 1802, without a male heir, in Norwich. He was succeeded in control of the bank by his cousins, including John Gurney, whose children included the banker Samuel Gurney. On his father's death in 1809, Samuel Gurney assumed the control of the Norwich bank. About the same time, he also took over the control of the London billbroking business of Richardson, Overend & Company, in which he was already a partner. The title of the firm was subsequently changed to Overend, Gurney and Company, and for forty years it was the greatest discounting house in the world. Samuel Gurney died in 1856. In 1865, the business of Overend, Gurney & Company, which had come under less competent control, went public as a joint stock company, but in 1866 the firm suspended payment with liabilities amounting to £11,000,000 Sterling. The failure of that bank ruined a number of the Gurneys, as well as numerous investors. The Norwich bank, however, escaped significant damage to its business and reputation from the collapse of the cousins' business.Ackrill, Margaret and Leslie Hannah. Barclays: The Business of Banking, 1690-1996 (2001) Cambridge University Press, Chapter 1 The Times stated, shortly after the suspension: \\"It is understood that the suspension of Overend, Gurney & Co will not in the slightest degree compromise Gurney's Bank of Norwich. That establishment recently passed into the hands of new partners, whose resources are beyond all question\\".The Times, May 11, 1866; p. 11, col F, “Money-Market & City Intelligence” Section The Gurney family was known for its wealth; in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1875 comic opera Trial by Jury, a character describes his accumulation of wealth until he \\"became as rich as the Gurneys\\". In 1896, Gurney's Bank merged with Backhouse's Bank of Darlington and Barclays Bank of London and several other provincial banks, controlled by Quaker families, to form what is now Barclays Bank. ==See also== * Gurney family (Norwich) For much of the 19th Century Henry Gurney was in partnership with Sam Baker and Walter Curtis.

In 1980 he backed the bloody coup (sometimes referred to as the \\"Cocaine Coup\\") that brought to power the General Luis García Meza. Arce served as García Meza's Minister of the Interior. ==BiographyEarly life=== Arce was born in 1938 in Sucre, Bolivia. He was the cousin of the notorious Bolivian drug lord Roberto Suárez Goméz. ===Career=== Arce's tenure as Minister involved the passing of such measures as the banning of all political parties, the incarceration and/or exile of most political opponents, the repression of trade unions, and the censorship of the mass media. Arce is reported to have said that all Bolivians who may be opposed to the new order should \\"walk around with their written will under their arms.\\" The García Meza government was also deeply involved in drug trafficking activities, with Arce as a link. Eventually, Arce was forced to resign, as was García. ===Incarceration=== In the late 1980s, Arce was extradited to the United States, where he was put in jail, serving a lengthy sentence for drug trafficking. On April 21, 1993, while he was still incarcerated, he was condemned by the Bolivian justice system to 30 years in prison for serious human rights violations incurred by the regime he took part in.Piden extraditar a ex ministro Arce Gómez que está en cárcel de EEUU In November 2007 he was released from his US prison sentence and applied for political asylum in the US. His application was denied, and on July 9, 2009, he was deported back to Bolivia to serve out the sentence for his convictions there. He was held in Chonchocoro Prison in La Paz. In 2009, he was in poor health but apparently expressed a willingness to speak about his role in the 1980-81 dictatorship. In September 2010, Arce Gómez offered to share his knowledge about the remains of people who disappeared during the dictatorship in \\"exchange for something\\": \\"If they want to know something... I have to gain something as well. It's not free.\\" His sentence is not subject to negotiation. Interior Minister Sacha Llorenty stated that Arce Gómez could face disciplinary sanctions for refusing to reveal this information, although the legal basis for doing so was disputed by legal experts. On 17 January 2017, Italian courts condemned Arce to life imprisonment for his role in the death of Italian dual-nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. The deaths had been part of Operation Condor. ==In popular culture== General Cocombre, a character based on Gómez, is featured briefly in the 1983 film Scarface. The picture of Cocombre that the Bolivian cocaine investigator Orlando Gutiérrez shows on TV during his interview (that Alejandro Sosa shows to Tony Montana and the rest of his guests), is in fact of Gómez. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Sucre Category:Government ministers of Bolivia Category:Bolivian military personnel Category:Bolivian anti- communists Category:Bolivian expatriates in the United States Category:Bolivian drug traffickers Category:Bolivian people imprisoned abroad Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:People convicted in absentia Category:People extradited from Bolivia Category:People extradited to the United States ","title":"Luis Arce Gómez"},{"id":"6213646","text":"Signage at Hubbard and Kerr on the corner of Italian Village Park { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"page\\", \\"title\\": \\"Italian Village.map\\"} Italian Village is a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, that contains an array of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. It is a designated historic district, known for its historical and cultural preservation. The building types and architecture reflect Italian influence. With its parks and preserved historic homes, Italian Village has the highest home value appreciation in Columbus. Italian Village is part of the Short North area. The neighboring Downtown district provides access to major employers, cultural and learning institutions, and entertainment venues. ==Geography== Italian Village is located in the north side of Columbus, Ohio just north of Downtown and adjacent to the central business district. The area is bounded by Interstate 670 on the south, Fifth Avenue on the north, North High Street on the west, and the Conrail railroad tracks to the east. N. Fourth Street, E. Fifth Avenue, and E. Second Avenue serve as primary corridors within the neighborhood's street system, which remains a grid street configuration. Specifically, N. Fourth Street is one of the primary routes through downtown while E. Fifth Avenue crosses both the Scioto and Olentangy Rivers. Both N. Fourth Street and E. Fifth Avenue contain residential, commercial, office, and industrial buildings. ===Land use=== Eighty percent of the buildings are residential, including single family homes, double houses and row houses. Most residential uses are low density and located in the northwest as well as along the area's major corridors. Approximately ten percent of the buildings are commercial, which are concentrated along N. Fourth Street and E. Fifth Avenue. This is a higher land use than directed by its zoning code. The zoning code also calls for more than two thirds manufacturing, though industrial buildings are scattered throughout the area. Most manufacture uses are concentrated east of N. Sixth Street and north of E. Second Avenue, while others are found along N. Fourth Street and E. Fifth Avenue. ==History== Italian Village was one of Columbus' first suburbs. The land was uninhabited until the Columbus- Worthington Pike (High Street) was built in 1823 and provided access to the area. With this road stimulating residential growth, the Italian Village area was annexed to Columbus in 1862. The North Columbus Street Railway Company, along with the progression of street car service, helped to develop Italian Village. By 1899, transportation had enabled a street system with extensive alleys that serviced horse stables behind residences. Entering the early 1900s, the Italian Village was a stable middle-class residential community. Its proximity to downtown ensured access to goods, services, and recreational facilities and provided employment opportunities. Electric trolleys carried residents to places that weren't within walking distance. ===Residential life=== Italian Village was once an immigrant neighborhood, named for its high concentration of Italian immigrants in its earliest days. However, the Italians were not the only ethnic group to occupy the Italian Village, nor were they the first. From around 1850–1870, the Irish resided in the southern part of the village as well as around Naughten Street (Goodale Boulevard), which was nicknamed ‘Irish Broadway.’ The Irish community then left the area, which made room for other residents. African American immigrants then moved to the Italian Village area for work prospects, which consisted of railroad machinery and iron works. A small group of African Americans settled in the northeast section of the village and established the Bethany Baptist Colored Church in 1882. Later on, Italians were attracted to the neighborhood by employment opportunities that were within walking distance. In the 1890s, the first Italian immigrants moved from Flytown to the nearby Italian Village area and worked in stone quarries, construction trades, railroads, and local businesses on High Street. The quality of the Italian Village's buildings as well as its character can be attributed to Italian craftsmen. In 1896, St. John the Baptist Italian Catholic Church was founded and helped to form the Italian-American community. Additionally, the Great Depression brought attention to Italian cuisine because the home grown food was much less expensive. This food was sold locally at restaurants like Presutti's Villa Restaurant on West Fifth Avenue in Grandview and small groceries throughout Italian Village such as Salvatore's Grocery. ===Employment=== At the height of employment there were approximately 6,000 job opportunities in walking distance from the historic Italian Catholic Church. The Jeffrey Manufacturing Company, located at 274 East First Avenue, was a producer of coal mining equipment. At one point in time, Jeffrey's had the distinction of being the largest single employer in Columbus with 3,400 employees. The Clark Grave Vault/Clark Auto Equipment Company, located at 375 East Fifth Avenue, had 1,200 employees. On Fourth Street near Goodale Street was the Smith Brothers Hardware Company employing 500 people. The Berry Bolt Works at 30 East First Avenue had 240 employees. Immediately south of Jeffrey's factories, at Fourth and Warren Streets, was the Case Crane, Kilbourne & Jacobs Company with 200 employees. The Radio Cab Company on Fourth Street and the Columbus Burlap Bag Company next door had a combined total of 200 employees. Then directly across the street from Radio Cab, Producer's Oil sold gas for 16 cents a gallon. There were numerous other smaller businesses that brought employment opportunities. ===Deterioration and revitalization=== Although the Italian Village flourished in the 1940s, it began to decline after World War II. Society's mobility increased- original residents moved to the suburbs and lower-income families moved into Italian Village, some after being displaced from other neighborhoods. Large single family homes were converted into multiple family dwellings. Along with residential decline came a decrease in commercial vitality; the new residents did not have the money to support local businesses on High Street. In 1951–1952, Italian Village lost a portion of Russell, Lincoln, Brickel Swan, Goodale, and Poplar Streets to a slum clearance program for construction of the inner belt and urban renewal. Continuing into the 1960s, institutions were demolished and the population of Italian Village declined. Landlords became absent as did Catholic schoolchildren, and consequently Sacred Heart Grade School and High School closed down in 1973. Concerned with the destruction of historic buildings, neighborhood residents and property owners began to take action. They envisioned an improved neighborhood and formed the Italian Village Society in 1973 to preserve the historic value of the district. The Columbus City Council then formed the Italian Village Commission to further combat the deterioration of physical conditions. Soon after in 1974, the \\"Italian Village Development Plan\\" was created with the help of volunteers and Ohio State University students. The Development Plan defined common problems and proposed rehabilitation of historic structures as well as additional solutions including development of recreation facilities, improvement of transportation flow, and enforcement of housing condition codes. The Italian Village Society and Italian Village Commission helped to develop a sense of community. In 1978, Community Development funds identified the Italian Village target area and supported housing improvement efforts. By the beginning of the 1980s, the Italian Village once again attracted middle-income families to the neighborhood. Revitalization of the area earned the Short North an “All American City” designation. ==Structures and landmarksSt. John the Baptist Italian Catholic Church=== The nave of St. John the Baptist Italian Catholic Church. Though Italian Village was a mixed ethnic area, it may have received its name from St. John the Baptist Italian Catholic Church. The church was founded in 1896 and subsequently built two years later. It became the main landmark and most distinguishing feature of Italian Village. St. John's drew members were mostly from the Columbus’ Italian immigrant population, including the St. Clair Avenue neighborhood, Flytown, Grandview, and Marble Cliff areas. The mission of the church was to bring Italian immigrants together and give them opportunity to worship in their native language and with the practices familiar to them from their earlier lives in Italy. St. John's became the center of the Italian Catholic community. In keeping with Italian Catholic tradition still alive today, parishioners would walk to church in major processions on the feast day of St. John the Baptist and other feast days that were celebrated in their native Italian hometowns. Italian is still spoken in the halls after Mass at St. John the Baptist Church, but the congregation's American-born generations are replacing their native Italian predecessors. ===The Berry Brothers Bolt Works building=== The Berry Brothers Bolt Works building was constructed in 1888 and remains one of Columbus’ most prominent factory buildings, having been named a historic site in early 1988. The National Register of Historic Places deemed the building worthy because of its architecture, its place in local history, and its potential to be an industrial archaeological site. During its time of operation, the factory used original equipment to produce machine tools, like bolts, for factories that built buggies. Berry Brothers continued production even as cars replaced buggies. By 2004, the building had fallen into a state of disrepair. Capital Equities purchased the building and renovated led by anchor tenant WSA Studio, a local architecture firm known for historic renovations. The building is now fully occupied as a vibrant office complex. ===Jeffrey Mining Administrative Office building=== The Jeffrey Manufacturing Company, which produced coal mining equipment, was a major employer in the Italian Village area early in the 20th century. Located along North Fourth Street, Jeffrey Manufacturing had more than 3,000 employees. At one point in time, Jeffrey's had the distinction of being the largest single employer in Columbus. The administrative building that housed the company still stands today, making it a historic landmark in Italian Village. ===Italian Village Park=== The Italian Village Park, located within the confines of the district, is a public park that commemorates Carl Proto, a Columbus native. The park is centrally located and boasts a playground as well as picnicking facilities. The Italian Village Park Committee is responsible for maintaining the park. The committee accepts contributions and provides updates to residents. Recent grants have enabled perennial bed plantings, donated mowing, and other forms of lawn maintenance for the park. ==Architectural character== Italian Village Rowhome Tasi The uniqueness of Italian Village can be attributed to its historic buildings, narrow brick streets, and pedestrian amenities like mature street trees and front porches. Its character also credits Italian style, which can be recognized in the mostly vernacular architecture of the neighborhood. ===Residential=== Residences in Italian Village are predominantly influenced by the Italianate and Queen Anne architectural styles. The Italianate style is defined by vertical proportions, asymmetrical floor plans, and low-pitched roofs as well as ornamental brackets at the cornice and decorative woodwork on porches. Characteristics of the Queen Anne style include steeply-pitch, irregularly shaped rooflines, asymmetrical massing, and numerous different window treatments. In Italian Village, residential buildings are set on narrow lots, close to each other and close to the street with alleys in the rear. Each house is typically two to two and a half stories high and has either a hipped or gabled roof, characteristic of Italianate style architecture. Rowhouses are constructed of brick with flat roofs and Italianate decorative cornices. The American Four Square House is common within the village, reflecting Italian architectural elements like the hipped/gabled roof and a broad front porch. Mixed-income housing ===Commercial/industrial=== Some commercial buildings reflect Italianate or even Victorian styles in their architecture, but many were renovated after High Street was widened in 1920. Buildings tend to be two to four stories high with a storefront at the base, an upper façade, and a building cornice or parapet at the top. Masonry construction with details of wood, brick, stone, or metal characterize these commercial buildings. Storefronts are almost always articulated into bays with large expanses of glass while upper floors resemble residential buildings with regularly spaced windows. Most industrial buildings are also two to four stories high and of the same masonry construction with many windows, some wood and some metal. Several industrial structures have brackets or decorative brickwork, reflections of Italianate cornice detail. ==Entertainment== Alfonso Pishtelli, one of the first residents of Italian Village, recalls attending concerts at Goodale Park and Italian festivals on St. Clair Avenue with his family and friends. “[They] looked forward to Saturdays because typically it would be mostly weddings when people [could] get together.” The Columbus Italian Festival is still held today and the Italian Village Society puts on Holiday Potlucks. Salsa Saturdays are held on Lincoln Street. There are multiple restaurants and bars in Italian Village itself, as well as art galleries. Most of these are local businesses. ===Restaurants=== • The Market: Italian Village • Bodega Café • Cosecha Cocina https://www.cosechacocina.com/ • Tasi • The Table • Arch City Tavern • Union Café • Michael's Goody Boy Diner • Mikey’s Late Night Slice • Empanada Intifada • Dane's Dessert Café • Donato's Pizza ===Bars=== • St. James Tavern • Seventh Son Brewing Co • Little Rock Bar • Midnight Hookah • Sunset Lounge • House of Cigars- Montecrisco Lounge • Short North Tavern ===Art galleries=== • Palnik Studios • Cameo Gallery • Sharon Weiss Gallery • Marcia Evans Gallery Italian Village also offers other opportunities for entertainment within the Short North including theatres, farmers markets, and pocket parks.

In September 1986 he joined Norwich City on loan before signing for the club permanently for a fee of £160,000 the following month. He was a regular for eight years at Norwich in the centre of defence until knee injuries forced him to retire during the 1994-95 season. He played for the Canaries during what was arguably the finest part of their history so far. He helped them finish fifth in the league in his first season (a year after promotion), finish fourth and reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1989, reach another FA Cup semi-final in 1992, finished a club best third in the new FA Premier League in 1993 and eliminate Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup in his penultimate season. An attempt to resurrect his career at Norwich's non-league Norfolk neighbours King's Lynn failed and Ian moved to the US to play for the Colorado Rapids in the new MLS for 1996. Butterworth continued his career in Sweden with IK Brage (11 apps 0 goals) and in September 1997 he player-manager but was soon on his way back to England when he joined Stafford Rangers as a player. In the early part of 1998, he joined Cobh Ramblers as player-manager but had left within three months. This finally signalled the end of his career as a player. In May 1998 he joined Darlington as assistant manager but resigned on 2 July 2000. In October 2000 he joined Cardiff as assistant. He was there until Sam Hammam sacked him in 2004. ==Coaching career== In May 1998, he joined Dave Hodgson's Darlington as Assistant Manager. They led Darlington to a Wembley appearance in the Division Two play-offs in 1999/2000 but in a shock move, Hodgson and Butterworth resigned from their jobs on 2 July 2000, with Hodgson immediately replaced by Gary Bennett. In October 2000, Ian was appointed as Number 2 to Alan Cork at Cardiff City and this partnership was successful as Cardiff gained promotion to Division Two in April 2001. As assistant to Lennie Lawrance, Ian helped Cardiff into Division One in May 2003. On 3 September 2004, Cardiff sacked Butterworth and fitness coach Clive Goodyear. Bluebirds owner Sam Hammam said a change was needed to give manager Lennie Lawrence a \\"right-hand man who is a super coach, a bit of an animal\\". Hammam added: \\"Lennie is the right manager for Cardiff City, we will not change that. But maybe it's time to change things around.\\" Early speculation linked former Wimbledon manager and current Watford coach Terry Burton with the role. In 2004, Norwich supporters voted Butterworth into the club's Hall of Fame. He had a stint as coach at Bristol Rovers and the FA before joining Hartlepool United as reserve team manager. He then worked for the Football Association, including a stint at the World Cup in Germany 2006 before joining Hartlepool as Reserve Team Manager in early July 2006. \\"It's a fantastic appointment for the club,\\" Pools boss Danny Wilson told his club's website.\\"I am sure he is going to be a real asset for us. The fact that he has been to the World Cup helping the FA speaks volumes,\\" he added In February 2009, Butterworth was appointed Assistant Manager at Norwich City, working alongside new manager Bryan Gunn, a former team-mate. He was made caretaker manager after Gunn's sacking in August, but he resigned on 19 August shortly after the appointment of new manager Paul Lambert. In early October 2010, Butterworth was reported to have been interviewed for the vacant Lincoln City manager's position, available since Chris Sutton quit at the end of September 2010, but lost out. Since leaving Norwich, Butterworth has helped his old Coventry and Forest teammate Stuart Pearce by scouting England Under-21s opponents. In June 2011, he was linked with the vacancy at Torquay.http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/butterworth.htm ==Managerial statistics== :As of 18 August 2009. {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Nat !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"5\\"Record - !G!!W!!L!!D!!Win % - align=leftNorwich City  align=left13 August 2009 align=left19 August 2009 1010 - !colspan=\\"4\\"Total ! 1 !! 0 !! 1 !! 0 !! } ==References * *Vital Hartlepool Profile: Ian Butterworth *Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:English footballers Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:King's Lynn F.C. players Category:Colorado Rapids players Category:IK Brage players Category:Stafford Rangers F.C. players Category:Cobh Ramblers F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Premier League players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Cardiff City F.C. non-playing staff Category:Sportspeople from Crewe Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:Expatriate association footballers in the Republic of Ireland Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football defenders Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Hartlepool United F.C. non-playing staff Category:People educated at Ruskin High School, Crewe ","title":"Ian Butterworth"},{"id":"6213691","text":"Halton Gill is a hamlet and civil parish in Littondale in the Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire, England. It is situated up Littondale from Litton. A minor road leads south west to Silverdale and Stainforth in Ribblesdale. The name of the hamlet was recorded in 1457 as Haltonghyll. The name derives from a combination of Old English and Old Norse and means the nook of land (or ravine) with a small valley by a farmstead and a stream. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Foxup and Hesleden. To the south the parish rises to the summits of Plover Hill and Pen-y-Ghent. The population of the civil parish was estimated at 60 in 2012. From Halton Gill there is a bridleway over the Horse Head Pass to the north east to Yockenthwaite in Langstrothdale. This path was used by the priest from Hubberholme to reach the small chapel in Halton Gill. To the west paths lead to the summit of Pen-y-ghent via Plover Hill. The 2010 Sainsbury's Christmas advert with celebrity chef, Jamie Oliver, was filmed in Halton Gill. Also filmed in the same year, but not released until 2012, was the film The Woman in Black, which used Halton Gill for filming as the fictional village of Crythin Gifford. Halton Gill was historically a township in the ancient parish of Arncliffe, part of Staincliffe Wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Halton Gill became a separate civil parish in 1866.Vision of Britain website The parish was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire in 1974. == References  Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire ","title":"Halton Gill"},{"id":"6213702","text":"Theridion is a genus of tangle-web spiders with almost 600 described species around the world. Notable species are the Hawaiian happy face spider (T. grallator), named for the iconic symbol on its abdomen, and T. nigroannulatum, one of few spider species that lives in social groups, attacking prey en masse to overwhelm them as a team. Spiders in this genus are about as long or longer then they are wide. Their chelicerae have two or less teeth on the front edge and none on the back edge. The front leg is the longest in both genders, but the next longest is the second leg in males and the fourth leg in females.

The route is a freeway that connects the Research Triangle Park (RTP) to both Western Wake County and the city of Durham. The section north of Interstate 40 (I-40) is known as the Durham Freeway, while the section south of I-40 is part of the Triangle Expressway. ==Route description== NC 147 winding around downtown Durham The route's entire length is a limited access freeway, linking NC 540 in Morrisville with the RTP, Downtown Durham and Interstates 40 and 85. It is a fairly urbanized commuter-route and suffers from peak-traffic during conventional rush hours. Speed limits on the freeway range from to . From NC 540 to I-40, the highway is a toll road, part of the Triangle Expressway. Tolling on this stretch of NC 147 began on January 3, 2012. From I-40 to its northern terminus, the route is known as the Durham Freeway, and serves as the primary artery through the Research Triangle Park and Downtown Durham. The Durham Freeway portion was originally envisioned as an alignment of I-40, though the interstate was built to the south of the city center instead. The Durham Freeway received the NC 147 designation in 1986. From I-40 through the Research Triangle Park, to the Briggs Avenue exit the freeway goes primarily north-south, with wide medians and shoulders and interstate-grade entrance and exit ramps. Entering Downtown Durham past Briggs Avenue, the road turns towards a more southeast-northwest alignment, and narrows considerably, with narrow medians and shoulders, and short entrance and exit ramps, following a depressed road cut to the south of Downtown Durham, passing several major landmarks including the Durham Bulls Athletic Park (visible to the north of the roadway), the Durham Performing Arts Center, and the American Tobacco Historic District. Past Downtown Durham, the freeway passes through Duke University, forming the boundary between East Campus and Central Campus. Past Duke University, the road reaches its northern terminus in a complex interchange with the U.S. 15-501 Freeway and I-85. Motorists must use U.S. 15-501 for access between I-85 south and NC 147 south, or between NC 147 north and I-85 north. At the actual northern terminus, traffic on NC 147 north merges with I-85 south, while I-85 north traffic can enter NC 147 south using exit 172. ===Dedicated and memorial names=== NC 147 features one dedicated stretch of freeway. The Buck Dean Expressway is the official name of NC 147 within the city limits of Durham that was approved on December 14, 1984. ==Tolls== Northbound on Toll NC 147NC 540 onto NC 147 Tolls along NC 147 are done by electronic toll collection (ETC) and are enforced by video cameras. Several gantries are located along the route and entrance/exit ramps, where they collect toll via the NC Quick Pass or other interoperable ETC systems. Those that do not participate in the ETC program will receive a bill in the mail and will have 30 days from date on bill before additional fees and civil penalties are applied. ==History== The Durham Freeway began with a 1962 bond referendum. The first section of the road, completed in 1970 around downtown Durham, extended from Chapel Hill Street to Alston Avenue and resulted in the destruction of a portion of the Hayti neighborhood as part of urban renewal, though a DOT engineer said the neighborhood likely would have been torn down anyway. The road was later extended west to Erwin Road and southward to where it meets I-40. In 1986, The freeway was designated as North Carolina Highway 147. The road's other names have included East-West Expressway and the I.L. \\"Buck\\" Dean Freeway. In 1979, planners said many of the city's roads needed widening, and the decision was made to extend the freeway to I-85. The first section in 1982 disrupted the Crest Street neighborhood, but the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) moved 181 houses instead of tearing them down, an action that resulted in a 1987 third-place Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) award for \\"historic preservation and cultural enhancement\\". Eventually, the problems that caused the original I-40 extension to I-85 to be delayed were overcome, and NC 147 was extended through the city. Work began in 1993, and the eastbound lanes opened May 21, 1997. The section connecting the road to I-85 opened July 31, 1998. On September 6, 2011, the south terminus at T.W. Alexander Drive (exit 4) was permanently closed to make way for NC 147's extension to NC 540 in Morrisville; this made I-40 the temporary southern terminus for three months. On December 8, 2011, the southern extension was opened. Dubbed the Triangle Parkway, the stretch of road is also part of the Triangle Expressway. Despite the spur to T.W. Alexander Drive being permanently closed, the pavement was never removed, and the abandoned section still sits just south of NC 147's interchange with I-40. () The road markings are also visible. ==Future== There are one current and two future projects involving NC 147. The first is the East End Connector which began construction in March 2015. This project, which will build a direct freeway connection designed to interstate standards between the Durham Freeway and north of the U.S. 70/N.C. 98, and which has been delayed many times, is now scheduled to be completed by May 2020. The NCDOT 2020-2029 Final STIP released in September 2019 indicates a project that will widen 3.9 miles of NC 147 to 6 lanes from the East End Connector Project south to I-40 at a cost of $1.8 million is scheduled to start in 2024. A proposed future project is the NC 147 extension to McCrimmon Parkway, in Morrisville, which is scheduled for reprioritization. ==Junction listInterstate 885== Interstate 885 (I-885) is the proposed designation traversing between I-40 and I-85/US 15 in Durham and the RTP area. Its first appearance was on August 19, 2014, when the October project letting was released, which included I-885 in the sign plans. NCDOT also listed in the documentation that fabrication of the signs cannot proceed until approval of the route is completed via FHWA; thus this routing is, for now, a proposal. If approved and designated, the Interstate would begin at the I-40/NC 147 interchange (exit 279) then go north running concurrently with NC 147 to the East End Connector, where it will switch to US 70\\\\. Continuing north concurrently with US 70, it will end at the I-85/US 15/US 70 interchange (exit 178). The existing exit numbers now on NC 147 and US 70 would be replaced by I-885. No official request has been submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) or FHWA as this route is currently proposed by NCDOT and is subject to change. The East End Connector is scheduled to be completed by November 2020. ==References * NCRoads - NC 147 * NC 147 Exit List * Future I-885 Durham East End Connector 147 Category:Transportation in Wake County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Durham County, North Carolina Category:Freeways in North Carolina Category:Transportation in Durham, North Carolina ","title":"North Carolina Highway 147"},{"id":"6213708","text":"__NOTOC__ { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"  ==Deaths== * 26 – Sir Clyde Walcott * 5 – Susan Butcher * 4 – Elden Auker ==Sporting seasons== *Auto racing 2006: **Formula One; GP2; BTCC **Indy Racing League **NASCAR; Busch; Craftsman Truck **World Rally Championship *Basketball: 2006 college basketball season in the Philippines: **NCAA Season 82 **UAAP Season 69 *Cricket 2006: England *Cycling 2006: ** 2006 UCI ProTour *Football 2006–07: **England FA Premier League **2006-07 UEFA Champions League **2006–07 UEFA Cup *Rugby union 2006: **2006 Air New Zealand Cup **2006 Currie Cup **2006–07 TOP 14 *U.S. and Canadian sports 2005–06: **2006 MLB season **2006 CFL season } ==31 August 2006 (Thursday)== *Rugby union **The 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup kicks off in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada *Basketball **2006 FIBA World Championship Fifth Place Bracket, Saitama City, Japan *** France 75, Germany 73 *** Turkey 95, Lithuania 84 ***France will play Turkey for fifth place on September 2 at 17:30 JST (4:30am EDT).

The source of the River Skirfare starts here at the confluence of Foxup Beck and Cosh Beck. The bridge over Foxup Beck in the hamlet is 17th century and was listed Grade II in 1958. The village marks the end of the main road through Littondale. There are a number of Public Footpaths and Bridleways in and around the village. The area is a mixture of sheep and beef farming. Dairy farming is harder than in comparison to other locations further down the valley because of the limitations on grass types and transportation of dairy produce out of the area. The name Foxup is of Old English origin, meaning \\"fox valley\\", from fox and hop \\"small enclosed valley\\", apparently in contrast to the adjacent valley of Cosh Beck, known as Harrop, meaning \\"hare valley\\". ==Images== File:Foxup, North Yorkshire.jpgFoxup seen from Low Bergh File:Foxup - geograph.org.uk - 132798.jpgFoxup File:Foxup Beck - geograph.org.uk - 314631.jpgFoxup Beck ==References *Foxup and Cosh on Littondale website Category:Villages in North Yorkshire ","title":"Foxup"},{"id":"6213716","text":"John Porter Mabry, Jr. (born May 7, 1969, in Austin, Texas) is a Texas politician who served as a Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives during the Seventy-eighth Texas Legislature.

It is located on Madison Avenue, attached to the south side of the Empire State Plaza, facing onto the plaza and towards the New York State Capitol. The museum houses art, artifacts (prehistoric and historic), and ecofacts that reflect New York’s cultural, natural, and geological development. Operated by the New York State Education Department's Office of Cultural Education, it is the oldest and largest state museum in the US. Formerly located in the State Education Building, the museum now occupies the first four floors of the Cultural Education Center, a ten-story, building that also houses the New York State Archives and New York State Library. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the NYSM, State Archives, and State Library to close temporarily, although work continues behind the scenes, and online exhibitions remain on offer. ==History== The State Education Building was home to the New York State Museum until 1976. The New York State Museum was founded in 1836 as the New York State Geological and Natural History Survey, formed in 1836 by Governor William Marcy to document the mineral wealth of the state.Reaka-Kudla, Marjorie L., Don E Wilson, and Edward O. Wilson, eds., Biodiversity II. Joseph Henry Press, 1997. In 1870, it was reorganized as the New York State Museum of Natural History under the trusteeship of the regents of the State University.Merrill, Frederick J H, Bulletin of the New York State Museum, Vol. 4, No. 19, November 1898 The museum was located in the State Education Building from 1912 until 1976, when it was moved to the Cultural Education Center upon the Empire State Plaza's completion. The current location opened on July 4, 1976, and 15,000 people took part in the ceremony which included a performance by Don Mclean. In June 2015, the museum announced the largest renovation in its history. Over three to four years, of exhibition space was to be modernized. The NYSM is to remain open throughout the rebuilding process, although individual galleries may be closed during construction and re-installation. ===Notable staff=== * Frederick James Hamilton Merrill – museum director (1894–1904) * John Mason Clarke – museum director (1904–1925) * William Martin Beauchamp – archaeologist (1884–1910) ==Layout and organization== New York State Museum, Albany. The large majority of the museum's permanent exhibits are located in the voluminous first floor, which features high ceilings that can accommodate large artifacts and displays, such as a subway car, fire engines, a reconstructed Mohawk Iroquois Longhouse, and a mastodon skeleton. Several smaller galleries and halls on the first floor house various temporary art exhibitions, as well as temporary scientific, historical, and cultural exhibits. Presentations and lectures (such as the weekly lecture series) are held in the Museum Theater, located near the West Gallery. A student visitors center is located behind the museum's main lobby. The Museum Store, located adjacent to the main lobby, offers souvenirs, high-quality mineral specimens, and selected New York State publications on science, history, and natural history. The second floor, generally not accessible to the public, contains education and youth services. The museum's staff, including the Division of Research and Collections and the Exhibits Division, is located on the third floor, also not accessible to the public. The fourth floor features a functioning carousel built between 1912 and 1916 which visitors may ride free of charge, plus supplementary exhibits covering regional topics and several historic cities in New York State, such as Buffalo and Rochester. The windowed walls surrounding this floor afford visitors a panoramic view of the Empire State Plaza and other areas of downtown Albany, hence the gallery's name, \\"Windows on New York\\". ==Research== As a research institution, the New York State Museum houses several programs, centers, and initiatives that further the geological, biological, archaeological and historical understanding of areas within and outside of New York State. The following is a list of several of these programs. * The Biodiversity Research Initiative (BRI)(defunct) – A partnership among conservation and environmental groups in New York State, the Biodiversity Research Initiative seeks to advance information and research for the conservation of New York State's biodiversity by funding research projects, sponsoring conferences and seminar series, and directing other initiatives. BRI hosts a biennial scientific conference at the New York State Museum. Partner groups include the American Museum of Natural History, Audubon New York, the New York Natural Heritage Program, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, the State Education Department, the State University of New York, and The Nature Conservancy. * The Center for Stratigraphy and Paleontology (CSP) – In addition to conducting basic research on the stratigraphy and fossil history of the State and adjoining regions, and disseminating subsurface geological data to the public, the CSP also works to conserve and make accessible the extensive subsurface and fossil collections of the New York State Museum. * Cultural Resource Survey Program (CRSP) – A cultural resources management (CRM) program that conducts historical and archaeological research for the State of New York. The program's work assists other State agencies, such as the New York State Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), and the Office of General Services (OGS), in meeting and adhering to their state and federal preservation mandates. This specifically refers to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, a federal law enacted in 1966 to preserve the cultural and historic resources in the United States. In doing so, CRSP works closely with New York State's Historic Preservation Officer and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. * The Laboratory for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics (LCEG) – The LCEG is a molecular phylogenetics laboratory designed for use by researchers studying animal and plant evolution. The facility provides technology that allows Museum researchers to analyze genetic variability among organisms by DNA nucleotide sequencing. The laboratory also houses the Museum's Genome Bank, a frozen tissue collection that complements the traditional dried-specimen collections by preserving plant and animal DNA for future study. * The Wildlife Science and Conservation Initiative – This program works to address the impact, both broad and fine, that human disturbances and habitat fragmentation have had on the behavior, ecology, and evolution of carnivores. While their work has primarily focused on carnivores in New York State, the Initiative has also worked to develop an automated telemetry system in Panama and investigates behavioral changes among male lions in Tsavo, Kenya. ==Collections== The collections of the New York State Museum include geological samples, paleontology specimens, historic materials, and art. Their anthropological collections are extensive, and include the collections of several early and well-known anthropologists, including Lewis H. Morgan and Arthur C. Parker. These collections are open to researchers for analysis. A supplementary storage facility in Rotterdam, New York, houses material not presently displayed, including artifacts from the September 11 attacks. ===Permanent exhibits=== Drawing of a mastodon skeleton by Rembrandt Peale Iroquoian longhouse * The Adirondack Wilderness – This exhibit explores the geology and prehistoric flora and fauna of the Adirondacks, the impact historic activities such as logging, mining, and recreational use had on regional environment and ecology, and the area's contemporary state, including conservation efforts, resource exploitation, and artistic interpretations. *The American Stoneware Collection – In 2014, a collection of 19th-century American stoneware was donated to the museum by Adam Weitsman. The exhibit includes stoneware jugs, crocks, pitchers, jars, and water containers. *Ancient Life of New York – A Billion Years of Earth History – A paleontological collection of fossils over a billion years old (some of the oldest in the eastern United States). The exhibit includes blue-green bacteria, fossilized tree stumps and spiders from Gilboa, New York, trilobites, and armored fish. * Birds of New York – Includes a display of over 170 native New York bird species in their natural settings. * Black Capital: Harlem in the 20s – An exhibit of the art and culture of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1920s, including a history of its development and the impact and influence it had on later cultural and artistic trends. * Carousel – Located on the museum's fourth floor, this full-sized carousel was made between 1912 and 1916 by the Herschell-Spillman Company of North Tonawanda, New York. It remained in use until the early 1970s in Cuba, New York, after which it was dismantled and obtained by the NYSM. The carousel is fully operational, and free rides are offered to visitors throughout the day. * Cohoes Mastodon – The skeletal remains of a mastodon excavated in Cohoes, New York in 1866. The skeleton was previously located in the Museum's front lobby. Returned from repair and restoration in 1997, it is available for viewing in the South Hall of the museum with a new display stand and interactive learning tools. * Fire Engine Hall – An exhibit of historic fire fighting vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries. * The Governor's Collection of Contemporary Native American Crafts * Metropolis Hall – An exhibit on the history of New York City, including a complete R9 New York City Subway car, and recreations of a Chinatown herbalist, Little Italy barbershop, and other storefronts. Also included is a reproduction of the brownstone front stoop streetscape setting of the Sesame Street preschool educational television program. * Minerals of New York – Geological displays from the New York State Museum's mineral collection. * Native Peoples of New York – An exhibit focusing on the prehistoric and historic cultural development of New York State, spanning the chronological spectrum from the Paleoindian period (c. 10,000 BCE) up to and including the ethnology of Native groups in New York today. Included in the exhibit are numerous prehistoric artifacts (e.g. pottery and stone tools), lifelike dioramas, scale models, and a full-sized replica of an Iroquoian longhouse. * Research Gallery – Highlights current work being conducted by staff members of the NYSM's Division of Research and Collections. * Windows on New York – Located on the fourth floor, the Windows on New York display highlights the history and characteristics of many of New York State's different regions. * The World Trade Center: Rescue, Recovery, Response – Tells the history of the World Trade Center and the September 11, 2001, attacks, including the rescue efforts, the evidence recovery operation at the Fresh Kills Landfill, and public response to the attacks. Has numerous artifacts from the site including the remains of an Engine 6 ladder truck, and the flag that was flown from next to the North Tower. ==See also== * List of New York State Historic Markers ==References== * Cultural Education Center at Emporis Buildings. * Moon New York State Handbook by Christiane Bird.

Colesberry"},{"id":"6213779","text":"Magical Tetris Challenge is a puzzle game by Capcom for the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color and PlayStation (the latter version was released in Japan and Europe only). It is a version of Tetris featuring Disney characters. It is one of the few N64 titles to be entirely in 2D. The game was also released in arcades on Seta's Aleck 64. ==Consoles version== On this version players can play as one of four characters: Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck or Goofy, and three game modes are available: Magical Tetris, Updown Tetris and an Endless mode. Magical and Updown Tetris can be played under Story Mode or in Versus Multiplayer. ===Magical Tetris=== In Magical Tetris, the player is pitted against an opponent, which is either the A.I. in Story or Endless Modes or another player in Versus Mode. Players control the standard seven Tetris pieces, race to make lines (and consecutive line clears, called combos), and attack the other player. The attacked player receives a set of \\"magical\\" pieces, which range from pentomino pieces to square blocks and even very large (up to 5x5-block sized) pieces. Players can also counter one another by making multiple lines to send the pieces back to their opponent. Because of the pentomino pieces, it is possible for a player to clear five lines at once (called a Pentris) using a 5-block straight piece. ===Updown and Classic Tetris=== Updown Tetris can be considered as an extension of Classic Tetris; Updown Tetris is available in Story and Versus Modes, whereas Classic Tetris takes up what would be the Endless mode. The magical pieces are absent from this mode, and attacking the other player sends a number of lines to the other player; the lines rise from the bottom as filled lines with a one-block gap in a predetermined column and could be used as further lines to attack the opponent. ===Common elements=== During Magical and Updown Tetris, making lines and combos fills a special meter alongside the board called the Magic Meter, with the fill line initially set to the fourth row; when a player's meter is filled, all of the blocks drop, filling any gaps, and one predetermined column drops out; all the blocks above the meter are wiped clean, the meter resets, and play continues. The meter's fill level may or may not rise depending on the difficulty. If it does rise, it moves up two lines which makes it harder to fill and less effective. The meter can be reduced by two lines (to a minimum of two) by scoring an \\"All Clear\\" of completely clearing the board of pieces. In this way, the player is left with filled columns and one empty column, allowing either a Tetris or Pentris to be made easily using a straight piece. Pieces spawn from the top one row at a time; column grids and a \\"ghost\\" piece are provided to aid the players in positioning and dropping pieces. Play stops when a piece entering the grid has to overlap a piece in the board. Players are scored according to the number of combos and counters they make in addition to any other points earned. ===Story Mode=== Players can choose to be one of four characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy, or Minnie) to play out the story; each character has a different storyline. It can be played under Magical or Updown Tetris. The last three stages pit the player's character against a Weasel and the Big Bad Wolf before facing the game's main antagonist, Pete. ==Game Boy Color Version== The Game Boy Color version is vastly different from the console versions. Magical and Updown Tetris are present in the game, plus new gameplay styles were added. All four characters are playable, alongside Pete, who is unlocked in Quest Mode, which replaces the console version's Story Mode. Due to limitations of the Game Boy's screen, the player can't see the adversary's gameplay and it is represented with a flashing laser on the left side of the screen, which height represents how tall the adversary's tetris pieces are stacked, and like it, reaching the top of the screen calls for a game over. This version also has the special meter, but only for some Tetris variants. The Game Boy Color version uses chiptune renditions of music tracks from the console version, as well new tracks. Unlike the console versions, each track is used as the theme song for a Tetris variant rather than for a Disney character. ===Quest Mode=== This mode's main goal consists of a coin rally where the player has the goal of collecting coins that can be gathered by winning a match of Tetris; these are in the possession of certain characters or buildings, and each character has its unique way of playing Tetris. Once the player has all the coins that are needed to win the rally, he must get to the rally station before another player comes in with the coins collected. After beating Quest Mode three times, Pete can be unlocked as a playable character for all game modes. Tetris variants can also be unlocked to be played in single player mode by beating Quest Mode and waiting until the credits end; Updown and Standard Tetris are the only variants available in the start when playing single player. ===Signal Tetris=== In Signal Tetris, clearing a line will cause the floor blocks below the clearing standard seven Tetris pieces will change color. The objective is to get the floor blocks to match the colors of the line of blocks under the floor. As a result, the player has to be careful about the positioning Tetrominos when clearing lines. Easy and Normal use just red and blue for the floor blocks, but the Expert difficulty adds the color yellow. ===Towering Tetris=== Towering Tetris starts you with a pile of random garbage blocks that raises throughout the game. The objective is clear the garbage blocks faster than they can raise until you reach the bottom of the pile and clear the keyhole block on the bottom line. In addition to the standard pieces, this mode also features a special 1*2 Piece that shoots an endless supply of 1*1 blocks when you press A or B and then disappears when it locks into place. ===Target Tetris=== In this puzzle mode, you are given a preset sequence of Tetrominos with which you must clear all of the Target Blocks (represented by Acorns, Lightning Bolts, or Flames depending on mode) on the screen. Each difficulty level has its own set of puzzles, with over a hundred total puzzles. ==Reception== The Game Boy Color version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the Nintendo 64 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation version a score of 27 out of 40, and later gave the GBC version a score of 26 out of 40. Nintendo Power gave the Japanese N64 version a favorable review over a month before the game was released in North America, while GameSpot gave it a mixed review, about two months prior to its North American release date. ==NotesReferences* Category:1998 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Disney games by Capcom Category:Donald Duck video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Goofy (Disney) video games Category:Mickey Mouse video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Tetris Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Harumi Fujita Category:Video games scored by Masato Kouda Category:Big Bad Wolf ","title":"Magical Tetris Challenge"},{"id":"6213780","text":"Chaudhari may refer to: *Chowdhury, a traditional title used by the landowners in the Indian subcontinent; now predominantly used as a surname *Chaudhari, Nepal ","title":"Chaudhari"},{"id":"6213785","text":"River Skirfare is a small river in North Yorkshire, England, that flows through Littondale and ends where it joins the larger River Wharfe.

It is used to allow an application to choose from one of multiple implementations or \\"condiments\\" in the application configuration, for example, to provide access to different data stores to retrieve login information, or to use different storage methodologies such as a database, binary to disk, XML, etc. The .NET extensible provider model allows a \\"component\\" to have multiple implementations using an abstract factory pattern approach. Providers are a subclass of the ProviderBase class and typically instantiated using a factory method. The provider model in ASP.NET 2.0 provides extensibility points for developers to plug their own implementation of a feature into the runtime. Both the membership and role features in ASP.NET 2.0 follow the provider pattern by specifying an interface, or contract. The provider model begins with the abstract class \`ProviderBase\`. \`ProviderBase\` exists to enforce the contract that all providers need public Name and Description properties, as well as a public Initialize method. Inheriting from \`ProviderBase\` are the \`MembershipProvider\` and \`RoleProvider\` abstract classes. These classes add additional properties and methods to define the interface for their specific areas of functionality. ==Strategy pattern renaming== It has been argued that the provider model is merely another name for the already existing strategy pattern, and that this should, therefore, be the preferred terminology for describing the design pattern at hand. ==See also== * Strategy pattern ==References External links == * MSDN: Provider Model Design Pattern and Specification * ProviderBase class documentation on MSDN Category:Software design patterns Category:.NET Framework ","title":"Provider model"},{"id":"6213821","text":"North Stainley is a village in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire, England north of Ripon.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book with 15 ploughlands and belonging to the Archbishop of York. The name of the village derives from the Old English of Stān lēah, which means a stone wood or clearing. North Stainley is on the south bank of the River Ure, and was in the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974, when it was moved into North Yorkshire. It was formerly in the wapentake of Claro, and the Liberty of Ripon. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 604, rising to 737 at the 2011 Census. In 2015, North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population of the parish to be 760. The parish includes the hamlet of Sleningford. The village is cut through by the A6108 road between Ripon and Leyburn. It has a school, North Stainley Church of England Primary School, which is rated as being Good by Ofsted and a church, St Mary the Virgin. The church was built in 1840 by the Staveley family, who owned the manor and built the Manor House in the 16th century. The pub in the village is called The Staveley Arms. Since 1983, the parish has been part of the Skipton and Ripon Parliamentary constituency. ==References *North Stainley village website Category:Villages in North Yorkshire ","title":"North Stainley"},{"id":"6213826","text":"Reversal of Fortune is a 1990 film adaptation of the book by Alan Dershowitz.

His parents Cosimo and Genovina Marcarelli were Italian immigrants from Benevento. Marcarelli moved to New York City when he was 13 where he grew up with his brother Ettore, and sisters Dora and Ida. In 1930 he studied at the Cooper Union for a year. He later supported himself by working for the Works Progress Administration, first as a teacher and then with mural painting divisions of the Federal Art Project during this period he won the Logan Medal of the Arts. He served in the US Army military service during World War II (1941–1945). Marca-Relli taught at Yale University from 1954 to 1955 and from 1959 to 1960, and at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1953, he bought a house near Jackson Pollock's home in Springs, East Hampton. As his career progressed, he increasingly distanced himself from the New York School. He lived and worked in many countries around the world, eventually settling in Parma, Italy with his wife, Anita Gibson, whom he married in 1951. Conrad Marca-Relli died on August 29, 2000, in Parma, at the age of 87. ==Career== After the war Marca-Relli joined the \\"Downtown Group\\"9th Street Art Exhibition which represented group of artists who found studios in lower Manhattan in the area bounded by 8th and 12th street between First and Sixth Avenues during the late 1940s and early 1950s. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, he was actively involved in the avant-garde art world in Greenwich Village. These artists were called the \\"Downtown Group\\" as opposed to the \\"Uptown Group\\" established during the war at The Art of This Century Gallery. His first one-man show was in New York City in 1948. In 1949 Marca-Relli was among the founders of the \\"Artists' Club\\"Artists' Club located at 39 East 8th Street. He was selected by his fellow artists to show in the Ninth Street Show held on May 21 to June 10, 1951.9th Street Show Poster The show was located at 60 East 9th Street on the first floor and the basement of a building which was about to be demolished. > The artists celebrated not only the appearance of the dealers, collectors > and museum people on the 9th Street, and the consequent exposure of their > work but they celebrated the creation and the strength of a living community > of significant dimensions.Bruce Altshuler, Avant-Garde In Exhibition New Art > in the 20th Century, New York: Harry N.

Throughout his career, Marca-Relli created monumental-scale collages. He combined oil painting and collage, employing intense colors, broken surfaces and expressionistic spattering. He also experimented with metal and vinyl materials. Over the years the collages developed an abstract simplicity, evidenced by black or somber colors and rectangular shapes isolated against a neutral backdrop. In 1967, the Whitney Museum of American Art gave him a retrospective show. The Archivio Marca- Relli, which was established by the artist and Galleria d'arte Niccoli in Parma in 1997, collects information about Conrad Marca-Relli and archives his work for a future general catalogue. ==Exhibitions== *1947, 1949, 1951: Niveau Gallery, New York City *1948-1949: Galleria Il Cortile, Rome *1953, 1956, 1958: Stable Gallery, New York City *1956: Frank Perls Gallery, Los Angeles & Hollywood *1957: Galleria La Tartaruga, Rome *1957, 1962:Galleria del Naviglio, Milan *1959, 1960–1964: Kootz Gallery, New York City *1960: Sharon Playhouse Gallery, Sharon, Connecticut *1961: Galerie Schmela, Düsseldorf; Bolles Gallery, San Francisco; Joan Peterson Gallery, Boston; Instituto de Arte Contemporáneo, Lima *1962: Galerie de France, Paris; *1963: Galerie Charles Lienhard, Zürich; Tokyo Gallery, Tokyo *1965: Galería Bonino, Buenos Aires *1967: James David Gallery, Coral Gables, Florida; Makler Gallery, Philadelphia; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City; Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts *1968: University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Alpha Gallery, Boston; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York *1969: Seattle Art Museum, Seattle; Reed College, Portland, Oregon *1970: University of Maryland Art Gallery, College Park, Maryland; Norton Gallery and School of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida *1970, 1975, 1979: Marlborough Gallery, New York City *1971: Galerie Schmela, Düsseldorf; Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Lowe Art Museum at University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida *1972, 1975: Galería Carl Van der Voort, Ibiza *1973: Galería Ynguanzo, Madrid; Galerie Numaga, Auvernier, Neuchâtel; Galerie Bahlsen, Berlin *1974, Marlborough Galerie, Zürich; Makler Gallery, Philadelphia *1975, Marlborough-Goddard Gallery, Toronto and Montreal *1977, Galería Lanzenberg, Ibiza; Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery, New York City *1978, Galería Joan Prats, Barcelona *1978–1979: Carone Gallery, Fort Lauderdale, Florida *1979: Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art.

Also called West Olentangy, it is generally bordered by West Henderson Road on the north, the Olentangy River and Clintonville on the east, Kinnear Road on the south, and Upper Arlington on the west. The area is primarily residential, although the large Riverside Methodist Hospital and the headquarters for Chemical Abstracts Service are located within its boundaries. Additionally, the west campus of The Ohio State University is located within the southern boundary of the area. ==History== The area that makes up Olentangy West was originally designated as part of the United States Military Lands. This area was set aside as payment for soldiers who served in the American Revolutionary War. Shortly after Franklin County was established, the area became part of Clinton and Perry Townships. Simon and Alexander Shattuck were major landholders in the area, having moved to Ohio from Groton, Massachusetts. They farmed the land and established a settlement called \\"Shattucksburg\\" near the current site of the Marburn subdivision. A small schoolhouse was built nearby in 1856, which was later converted to a private residence. Union Cemetery was established in 1847, having previously been used as a burial site for the Hess family, and is now one of the largest cemeteries in Columbus. 1856 Schoolhouse located on Olentangy River Road, now a private residence. Olentangy River Road was constructed in 1828 and connected the area to Franklinton and Delaware. The railroad came to the area in 1876 with the completion of the Columbus and Toledo Railroad. This track is still in service today as a freight line operated by CSX. In 1939, a bridge was built across the Olentangy River that extended North Broadway from High Street to Olentangy River Road. In the late 1940s, John D. Kraus set up OSU's first Radio telescope in the west campus farm fields next to Ackerman Run.http://www.bigear.org/ohsmarkr/History_OSURO.htm This was the first iteration of what would later be called the Big Ear. However, when more space was needed for an expansion, the project moved adjacent to Perkins Observatory in Delaware in 1961. Though the site has long since been abandoned, the ruins of the original control building and the antenna footings remain. Urban development in the area began in earnest in the 1950s, as the city of Columbus grew outward and baby boomers desired new houses away from the crowded conditions of the inner city. Olentangy River Road was expanded from two to four lanes north of Ackerman in 1956, and the University City Shopping Center was built in 1961, catering to the new families in the area as well as those in Clintonville and Old North Columbus. As the area grew, traffic congestion became a major problem, particularly on Olentangy River Road as residents commuted to jobs at Ohio State campus and Downtown Columbus. A new freeway called the Olentangy Freeway - later designated State Route 315 - was proposed by city and state officials in the early 1960s. Many problems were encountered during the process to determine the route. Officials at the Ohio State University objected to the new road running through parts of campus and causing disruption to the students and faculty. This resulted in the route being shifted west to run adjacent to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad tracks where it approaches the campus from the south. The reconfigured route required highway officials to purchase and remove a commercial building, part of the University City subdivision, and an undeveloped part of Union Cemetery. However, the owners of the Cemetery strongly objected to having their property taken for the realignment to bypass OSU. The Cemetery obtained a permanent injunction in 1967 to prevent construction through its land and suggested a tunnel under the property be built instead. The Ohio legislature then passed a bill to mend a statue and allow the right of way to be purchased for the freeway to pass through the cemetery property. Many homeowners further north also objected to having the freeway run near the river and ruining the scenic nature of the area, as well as expressing concern about safety problems from heavy fog that sometimes forms in the valley. As a compromise, state officials proposed purchasing and developing land in the area for parks. The section between Kinnear Road and Ackerman road was opened on August 7, 1972 after more than a decade of wrangling. The impasse with Union Cemetery was resolved in 1975. However, due to the years of delays, construction costs for the section through the cemetery came in higher than the original projections for the entire freeway from downtown to Worthington. The freeway route through the cemetery was completed in 1975 and the entire freeway between downtown and Interstate 270 was completed in 1980. In recent years, the area has become prized for being a centrally located yet quiet and easygoing place to live. In particular, the areas west of Route 315 are regarded as very safe and desirable neighborhoods. ==Demographics== Typical neighborhood street in Olentangy West As of the 2010 census, there were 11,765 residents and 5,917 households in the area. The racial makeup of the community was 72.06% White, 17.8% Asian, 6.0% Black, and 4.12% from other races or two or more races. The average household size is 1.99 persons, and the area has a relatively low vacancy rate of 6%. With the Ohio State campus nearby, a number of students live in Olentangy West, particularly graduate and professional students. The Buckeye Village student family housing area is home to many international students, with approximately 85% of residents in the complex foreign born. Renters make up 58% of the overall population while 42% are homeowners. However, within the subdivisions approximately 90% of houses are owner occupied. As of the 2000 census, approximately 95% of residents had attained a high school diploma or higher and 50% had attained a bachelor's degree or higher.

His father, Tom Baldwin, was a champion NASCAR modified driver. Baldwin himself briefly pursued a racing career before becoming a mechanic. Baldwin is married to the former Beth Bruce, who was Miss Winston 1991, and has four sons. ==Mechanic career== He started as a crew chief in 1997 for the #20 Hardee's Ford for Ranier-Walsh Racing. After Hardee's was acquired by CKE Restaurants early in the year, the chain's new parent company pulled their sponsorship, forcing the team to shut down. Baldwin soon became the crew chief for car owner Junie Donlavey and driver Dick Trickle. After a little over a year with the team, during which the pairing of Trickle & Baldwin garnered the team its first Top 5 finishes in 3 seasons, he moved to Bill Davis Racing as the crew chief for Ward Burton in the Fall of 1998. Burton and Baldwin won four races together, including the 2002 Daytona 500, until his departure late that season. In 2003, Baldwin became the crew chief of the No. 7 Dodge Intrepid for Ultra Motorsports driven by Jimmy Spencer. After Sirius' departure from the team, Baldwin joined Evernham Motorsports as the crew chief for Kasey Kahne. Kahne won NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors in 2004 with Baldwin, and won his first race with him at Richmond International Raceway the following season. Between 2003 and 2004, Baldwin fielded a Busch Series team with Eddie D'Hondt driven by a variety of drivers, including Wally Dallenbach Jr., Damon Lusk, Tracy Hines, and Paul Wolfe. He sold the team to Evernham following 2004. After 2005, he joined Robert Yates Racing to work with Elliott Sadler midway through the season, he left to return with BDR. ==NASCAR owner== Baldwin announced on January 6, 2009 that he started his own Sprint Cup Series team named Tommy Baldwin Racing, running Toyotas. Scott Riggs was named to pilot the car for the 2009 season. Baldwin's cars for the Daytona 500 were mainly built and assembled by volunteer crew members who were laid off by other race teams affected by the economic crisis. The No. 36 qualified for the race and earned a three-race sponsorship from Red Bank Outfitters and a one-race deal with Mahindra Tractors (which jumped aboard after Mike Skinner failed to qualify). During much of Speedweeks, the car was unsponsored and white. On May 25, 2009, Riggs announced that he would leave TBR following the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Riggs was 42nd in the point standings, with eight starts in the first 12 Sprint Cup races this season. His best finish was 25th, which came at the Daytona 500. Baldwin immediately announced that Skinner, Patrick Carpentier and Brian Simo would be sharing driving duties in the No. 36 Toyota for the remainder of the 2009 season. Carpentier filled in for Skinner when Camping World Truck Series commitments prevented him from driving in the Cup Series. Simo failed to qualify for both road course events. In September Michael McDowell replaced Carpentier and Robert Richardson ran the November Talladega race. For much of the 2009 season, TBR was a start and park operation, the reason Riggs left the team. In 2010 Tommy Baldwin Racing hired Mike Bliss to drive car No. 36. Wave Energy Drink returned as sponsor and the team also switched to Chevrolet in 2010. The team later used a number of drivers after Bliss left, including Geoff Bodine, Steve Park, Johnny Sauter, Ron Fellows, Casey Mears, J. J. Yeley, and Dave Blaney. TBR also ran a No. 35 for a handful of races. For 2011, Baldwin retained Blaney for a full season in the No. 36. The team once again went to Daytona with an unsponsored vehicle, but earned sponsorship from Golden Corral at Daytona after the team made the race. Accell Construction, All Sport, and Big Red also supported the team throughout the season. Blaney led at Daytona and Talladega and nearly pulled off upset victories at both tracks before being involved in late race incidents just laps before the finish. After a 13th-place finish at Richmond, the team moved into the Top 35 in owner's points for the first time in its three-year history. Ron Fellows drove the car at Watkins Glen, Stephen Leicht piloted the No. 36 at Richmond, and Mike Skinner at Atlanta after medical issues forced Blaney from the car. The No. 36 team finished 33rd in owner's points, which guaranteed the team a starting spot in the 2012 Daytona 500. In January 2012, Baldwin sold the owner's points from the No. 36 to Stewart-Haas Racing to allow the No. 10, driven by Danica Patrick, to be locked into the Daytona 500. Baldwin also ran the No. 35 with Park, Bodine, and Blaney on a part-time basis. TBR's best finish is third, which they've done twice. Blaney drove the 36 to third at the October 2011 Talladega race and Smith drove the No. 7 Chevrolet to third-place finish at the August 2016 rain-shortened Pocono race. TBR shut down their Cup team after the 2016 season, though it was revived for the 2017 Daytona 500 with Elliott Sadler. In 2017, Baldwin joined the newly-formed Halmar Friesen Racing Truck team as a team manager. In August, Baldwin left the team, with HFR co-owner Chris Larsen citing a lack of progress as why the two decided to split. Baldwin later become the Competition Director at Premium Motorsports, while also serving as crew chief of the team's No. 15 Cup car. In 2019, Baldwin joined back into the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series with a part time car starting with Daytona ==References* Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People from Bellport, New York Category:Sportspeople from Suffolk County, New York Category:Racing drivers from New York (state) Category:NASCAR team owners Category:NASCAR crew chiefs Category:NASCAR drivers ","title":"Tommy Baldwin Jr."},{"id":"6213937","text":"Harris Jacob Bixler (September 16, 1870 – March 29, 1941) was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

The purpose of this and similar institutions was to provide Polish youth with an opportunity for an education within the framework of traditional Polish scholarship, when that collided with the ideology of the governing authorities. In the 19th century, such underground institutions were important in the national effort to resist Germanization under Prussian and Russification under Russian occupation.David Palfreyman (ed.), Ted Tapperm, Understanding Mass Higher Education, Routledge (UK), 2004, , Google Print, pp. 141–142. In the People's Republic of Poland, the Flying University provided educational opportunities outside government censorship and control of education.Barbara J Falk, The Dilemmas of Dissidence in East-Central Europe: Citizen Intellectuals and Philosopher Kings, Central European University Press, 2003, , Google Print, p. 42. ==History Partitions === After the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned in the late-18th century, its lands were divided among its neighbors: Imperial Russia, Prussia and Austro- Hungary. Warsaw, the historic Polish capital, fell under Russian control. In the Russian and Prussian partitions the situation of Poles progressively worsened. Particularly in the Russian sector, the initially moderate ethnic policies were revised in the aftermath of the Polish revolts aimed at overthrowing Russian control, the November Uprising (1830–1831) and the January Uprising (1863–1864). Following the defeats of the uprising the autonomy of the Congress Poland was initially limited (1831) and finally abolished (1865). Among the increasing policies of Germanization and Russification, it became increasingly difficult for Poles to obtain a Polish higher education. Also, like in most parts of Europe at the time, the higher education opportunities for women that existed in the Russian Empire were severely limited,Christine Johanson, Women's Struggle for Higher Education in Russia, 1855–1900, McGill-Queen's Press, 1987, , Google Print, p. 23 and teaching or research into some fields, like Polish language, Catholicism or Polish history, ranged from difficult to illegal.Abraham Ascher, The Revolution of 1905: A Short History, Stanford University Press, 2004, Google Print, p. 47.Peter Brock, John Stanley, Piotr J. Wróbel, Nation And History, University of Toronto Press, 2006, , Google Print, p. 7.

At first it was a series of conspiratorial education courses for women, and among the first teachers were Józef Siemaszko, Stanisław Norblin, Piotr Chmielowski and Władysław Smoleński. In 1885 transformed due to the efforts of one of the students, Jadwiga SzczawińskaBetty Jean Lifton, The King of Children: The Life and Death of Janusz Korczak, St. Martin's Press, 1997, , Google Print, pp. 35–40. (also known as Zofia SzczawińskaMargarita Diaz-Andreu, Excavating Women: A History of Women in European Archaeology, Routledge (UK), 1998, , Google Print, p. 88.), the various pro-education groups were united into a single, informal, and illegal, secret university open for both sexes known as the Flying University (the courses, spread throughout the city, often changed locations to prevent the Russian authorities from learning the location and arresting the teachers and students). The fees (2–4 rubles per month) were used as gratification for the teachers, and to create a secret library. The curriculum of the Flying University covered 5–6 years with 8–11 hours per week and was divided into four main subjects: social sciences, pedagogy, philology and history, and natural sciences. Among the teachers of the university were the best contemporary Polish academics, such as Władysław Smoleński and Tadeusz Korzon (history), Bronisław Chlebowski, Ignacy Chrzanowski, Zofia Daszyńska-Golińska and Piotr Chmielowski (literature), Jan Władysław David and Adam Mahrburg (philosophy), Ludwik Krzywicki (sociology), Józef Nussbaum- Hilarowicz (biology).Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland, Columbia University Press, 1982, , Google Print, p. 235. During the twenty years of the existence of the university, its courses were attended by approximately 5,000 women and thousands of men. Among the most famous of its students was the future Nobel Prize winner, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, more commonly known as Madame Curie. Other well known students included Zofia Nałkowska and Janusz Korczak. ===Legalization=== Around 1905–1906 the Flying University was able to start legal activities, and was transformed into the Society of Science Courses (Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych), as Poland's partitioners, anticipating the coming war, sought to convert the Poles to their cause. Around 1918–1919, after Poland regained independence (as the Second Polish Republic), the Association was transformed into the private university, Free Polish University (Wolna Wszechnica Polska). In 1927 it founded a branch in Łódź. ===World War II=== During the Second World War, Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany which forbade Poles to attend university- level courses. University faculty members utilized their experience and took part in secret teaching during World War II. ===People's Republic=== After the Second World War, the Wolna Wszechnica Polska was not immediately recreated in Warsaw, although its branch in Łódź served as the foundation for the University of Łódź. During the time of communist domination in the People's Republic of Poland, as the curriculum became a tool of politics, and much of Polish history (like the Polish-Soviet War, Katyn Massacre or Praga Massacre) was censored in an attempt to 'erase' the history of Polish-Russian conflicts,Marc Ferro, The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children, Routledge, 2003, , Google Print, p. 259. the tradition of the Flying University was revived once again, first by the Society of Free Polish University (Towarzystwo Wolnej Wszechnicy Polskiej) active in Warsaw from 1957, later from 1977 by the new Flying University and Society of Science Courses, supported by Polish dissidents: Stefan Amsterdamski, Jerzy Jedlicki, Andrzej Celiński, Bohdan Cywiński, Aldona Jawłowska, Jan Kielanowski, Andrzej Kijowski, Jacek Kuroń, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Adam Michnik, Wojciech Ostrowski. Many participants of this second flying university were abused by milicja, with common incidents like a prominent dissident, Jacek Kuroń, being thrown down the stairs or his apartment ransacked by milicja-supported thugs; despite this, the Flying University was active until the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981, which, although designed to destroy the Solidarity movement, stifled the flying university's activities too. With Solidarity's peaceful victory in the 1989 Polish legislative elections, the goals of the Flying University — the freeing of Polish education from party control and censorship — had been achieved. ==See also== *Marie Curie *Polish University in Exile *Education in Poland during World War II ==References== Category:History of education in Poland Category:Congress Poland Category:Polish dissident organisations Category:Organisations based in Warsaw Category:Education activism ","title":"Flying University"},{"id":"6213961","text":"Samuel McAdow (1760–1844), a Presbyterian minister.

I would sometimes get a buzz on the house phone from the projection booth with the terse message 'Cat's on the screen.'\\"Daugherty, p. 231 The theater cat at the venue's 1990 closing was named Wim, after director Wim Wenders. Sid Geffen purchased the theater in 1973 or 1974, and ran it with his wife, then named Jackie Raynal. That same year, Geffen bought the Carnegie Hall Cinema, housed underground beneath the famed music hall. Future October Films co-founder and United Artists studio executive Bingham Ray began his film career in 1981 as a manager and programmer at the theater, and longtime Film Forum programmer and film historian Bruce Goldstein had his first New York theater job at Geffen's two venues. Geffen died in 1986. Bleecker Street Cinema, 1980s In 1990, his widow, by then remarried and named Jackie Raynal-Sarré,Per Lovece, New York Post, she was married to psychologist Jean-Paul Sarré; they appear together in Gérard Courant's 1986 short film \\"Jackie Raynal and Jean-Paul Sarré\\" from the filmmaker's \\"Couples\\" series. Per Jackie Raynal's official site(Archived on November 22, 2014), she later married real-estate businessman and film producer Joseph J.M. Saleh, and became known as Jackie Raynal-Saleh. said that because Geffen left no will, she partnered with developer John Souto to buy out Geffen's children from a previous marriage. She further said that Souto, after renting to her for four years for $160,000 annually, raised the rent to $275,000, more than the theater could sustain. Following a lawsuit and court proceedings, a judge ordered the two co-owners to bid on the building. \\"We came in with [a] $3.3 million [bid] and he came in with $3.4 million,\\" Raynal- Sarré said. In its final configuration, it had a main auditorium of 171 seats, and the 78-seat James Agee Room. The theater closed on September 6, 1990. The last film to start was Aki Kaurismäki's 74-minute Ariel, and the last film to end was the nearly two-hour Jesus of Montreal. The last film in the James Agee Room was Roger Stigliano's Fun Down There. By November of that year, it had reopened as a gay adult-film theater. Sometime afterward it returned to its art-house roots and then closed a final time on Monday night, September 2, 1991. Its final features were Alex van Warmerdam's Dutch comedy Voyeur; the documentary Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight; Ari Roussimof's war-veteran drama Shadows in the City; and Francis Teri's horror movie Suckling. The theater's final operator was Nick Russo Nicolaou. ==Influence and legacy== The foreign and independent-film programming of the Bleecker Street Cinema helped inspire future filmmakers and contributed to the cinematic education of film historians, critics and academics. As one historian wrote: Former Bleecker Street Cinema site, October 2008 ==In popular culture== Several scenes in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) were shot at the Bleecker Street Cinema, as one of the characters (Dez, played by Aidan Quinn) works there as a projectionist. In Woody Allen's 1989 Crimes and Misdemeanors, the character played by filmmaker-star Allen visits the Bleecker Street Cinema to see Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the 1943 musical Happy Go Lucky. It also appears in the film The Prince of Tides. ==See also== * 55th Street Playhouse—nearby theater which also showed art-house films * Film Forum * IFC Center * New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre—nearby at 152 Bleecker Street (until 1970s) * Quad Cinema == References* Category:1960 establishments in New York (state) Category:1990 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:1991 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Manhattan Category:Entertainment companies established in 1960 Category:Cultural history of New York City Category:Former theatres in Manhattan Category:Greenwich Village Category:Repertory cinemas Category:Entertainment companies disestablished in 1991 ","title":"Bleecker Street Cinema"},{"id":"6213981","text":"Ysgol Llanhari is a Welsh-medium school for 3-19 year olds situated in the village of Llanharry, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. ==History== Llanhari is one of the original Welsh medium secondary schools in the area, having opened in 1974.

The company was originally founded as Hansen's in 1935 in Southern California, originally selling juice products. The company renamed itself as Monster Beverage in 2012, and then sold their Hansen's juices and sodas and their other non-energy drink brands to The Coca-Cola Company in 2015. As of May 2012, Monster held nearly 35% of the $31.9 billion US energy drink market. ==History== Hansen's was founded in 1935. In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label. The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares. In April 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled products containing high-fructose corn syrup could not be labeled \\"natural\\".Mueller, Sue. FDA: High fructose corn syrup not natural, April 22, 2008 Shortly after, Hansen's Natural Corporation announced they had begun using cane sugar instead. In September 2009, Hansen brand Monster Energy sent a cease and desist letter to Rock Art Brewery, demanding the microbrewery stop selling its new Vermonster beer, drop its pursuit of a federal trademark for the name, and pay Hansen's lawyer fees. This resulted in a boycott of all Hansen products by a few Vermont retailers. In June 2015, The Coca-Cola Company took ownership of Hansen’s juice products and sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Blue Sky sodas, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands, in exchange for their energy drink brands. The Coca-Cola Company bought a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage Corp in 2015. This stake has since grown to 19.36% due to share buy backs conducted by Monster Beverage Corp. ==Sponsorship== NASCAR announced on December 1, 2016 a multi-year deal that will make Monster Energy only the third entitlement sponsor in its premier series history. However, this deal ended after the 2019 race season, and the series will be known as simply the \\"NASCAR Cup Series\\" from 2020 onward. The company is expected to continue sponsoring individual drivers, including Kurt Busch, Ty Gibbs, and Riley Herbst into the future. == Finances == For the fiscal year 2017, Monster Beverage reported earnings of US$821 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.369 billion, an increase of 10.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.

The village is situated 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of the market town Leyburn, on a slight elevation above the River Ure, which forms the southern boundary of the parish. The village is overlooked by the steeple of St. Michael's Church. Spennithorne is approximately east from Yorkshire Dales National Park containing a range of wildlife habitats. The village was historically in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 became part of the Richmondshire district in the new county of North Yorkshire. ==History== Although Spennithorne dates from Saxon times, there are very few facts recorded relating to its history. At the period of the Norman Conquest, Alan Rufus, to whom the Conqueror gave the whole of Richmondshire, distributed his lands among his retainers in feudal fashion, and in this division Spennithorne and Middleham were allotted to his brother, Ribal Fitzrandolph. In the Domesday Book Spennithorne is referred to as \\"Speningtorp\\" which Dr. Whitaker states as the thorp or village of the \\"Spening\\", or a prickly thorn. From 1856 on, the village was served by Spennithorne railway station, north-east of the village. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Spennithorne as: > a township and a parish in Leyburn district, N. R. Yorkshire. The township > lies on the river Ure, near the Leyburn railway, 2 miles SE by E of Leyburn; > and has a station on the railway, and a post-office under Bedale. Acres, > 1,280. Real property, £2,457.

The living is a > rectory in the diocese of Ripon. Value, £425. Patron, M. Wyvill, Esq. The > church is ancient. The p. curacy of Bellerby is a separate benefice. > Hutchinson, the Hebraist, was a native. ===Parish history=== Spennithorne was historically a large parish, and included the townships of Harmby and Bellerby, which both became separate civil parishes in 1866. Harmby Beck flows into the River Ure near the village, here perhaps was Spennithorne Mill in existence in 1301, however there is no trace of its remains. ==Geography== Near Colliwath Wood lies the northern boundary of the parish and the southern boundary runs along the River Ure almost parallel with the A6108, about 0.3 miles (0.4 km) south. The nearest settlements to Spennithorne include Harmby 0.8 miles (1.3 km) north-west and Middleham 2.9 miles (4.7 km) south. The nearest major city is Darlington 27 miles (43 km) north-east. The nearest railway station is at Leyburn, north west. ===Geology=== The soil is loam; composed of sand, silt and clay on a subsoil of limestone. A variety of crops are grown here with great pasture for cattle. ==Demographics== The first UK census in 1801 recorded the total population of the then parish (which included Harmby and Bellerby) at 655, and the highest recorded population total was in the 1831 census at 848 residents. By 1881 the parish was much smaller, and the population was a total of 200, The 2001 census data recorded the total population at 166 of which 79 were male and 87 were female. Of those, 154 of the residents stated their religion to be Christian and 100% of the parish were white British. The 2011 census data recorded the total population at 198, an increase of 32 from previous 2001 figures, of which 95 were male and 103 female. Of those, 151 of the residents stated their religion to be Christian and 98% of the parish were white British. ===Housing=== According to the 1841 census there were 199 houses in the parish (which then included Harmby and Bellerby). By 1921 the parish was much smaller, and there were only 37 houses in the parish. ==Occupational structure== Using information provided by the Vision of Britain website from 1881, it is possible to see the history of the social structure during the 19th century in Spennithorne and specifically the areas of occupation. There are 14 main categories of occupation, with the largest occupational status being Domestic Services and Offices (31%) with 37 people employed within this field. The next occupational status was Unspecified Occupation (12%) with 23 people and lowest occupational status' were Country Defence (1%) and Transport & Communication (1%) employing 2 people, of the 200 residents in the area. Occuptional Structure in Spennithorne in 1881 ==Landmarks== The Church of St Michael and All The Angels, Spennithorne St Michael's Church, a Grade I listed building is said to have been erected by Robert Fitzrandolph in AD 1166. The Church was completely demolished to make way for its Norman successor with only two or three small fragments being discovered: two stones with Runic ornament which have been built into the east wall of the chancel; and a Saxon monument recently discovered under the floor of the chancel which has now been placed in the wall of the vestry. The interior of the church also contains tablets to the family of Chaytor. By the mid-12th century, St Michael and All Angels Church had been built and enlarged. The existing church tower dates back to around the 14th century when the aisles were also widened to their current width, along with the channel being rebuilt and extended eastwards to its present length with the vestry being added on the north side. In 1872 the church was again thoroughly restored, costing around £2,000. The work was carried out under plans prepared by Mr. Fowler Jones of York who preserved all the old fabric which was capable of restoration, with all construction done in strict conformity with the style of the original building. The structure of the church now resembles a medieval building of which majority remains in the 21st century. In the 1970s and 1980s Spennithorne church featured in the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small. Spennithorne Hall Spennithorne Hall, the seat of C. D. Chaytor, Esq., J.P., dating back mainly to the early 18th century is best seen from the hillside to the east of Middleham. The Hall is a Grade II listed building and is described as \\"a handsome mansion, occupying a delightful situation\\". Thorney Hall is another mansion in this township, the seat and property of the Hon. A. C. Orde-Powlett. Set within five acres of formal garden and woodland, claiming to have \\"the finest view in all Yorkshire\\" Thorney Hall lies in the heart of Wensleydale. ==Notable people== *John Hutchinson (1674–1737) - Bulmer's History and Directory of North Yorkshire (1890) states: \\"Spennithorne was the birthplace of John Hutchinson, a philological and biblical writer in his own day, however now almost forgotten. Hutchinson was the son of a yeoman, and through obtaining a liberal education he served steward to several families of position, notably the Duke of Somerset receiving a sinecure appointment worth £200 a year.\\" ==References External links == * * Spennithorne School Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire Category:Wensleydale ","title":"Spennithorne"},{"id":"6214077","text":"Colin Woodthorpe (born 13 January 1969 in Liverpool) is an English former footballer. ==Playing careerEarly career=== Woodthorpe has enjoyed an extremely long professional playing career, having made his first-team debut for Chester City in the 1985-86 season at Rochdale in the Associate Members' Cup as a 17-year-old apprentice. The following season saw Woodthorpe make his Football League debut at Bury in a 1–1 draw and he ended the campaign with 30 league starts and two goals to his name. He also found the net in the northern final of the Associate Members' Cup, but Chester lost 2–1 on aggregate to Mansfield Town. He remained a regular in the left-back slot for the remainder of his time at the club and did not miss a game in the 1989-90 season. At the end of the campaign he joined top-flight side Norwich City for a six-figure sum, having made 155 league appearances and scored six times in four years with Chester's first team. ===Norwich City=== His four years with Norwich included some highlights, such as playing against Inter Milan in a UEFA Cup tie (1993), appearing in an FA Cup semi-final against Sunderland (1992) and scoring in a 3–0 win over Liverpool (1991). ===Aberdeen=== In 1994, he moved north of the border when he joined Aberdeen for £400,000, again providing matches in European competition. In three years at Pittodrie Woodthorpe made 51 league appearances before returning to the north-west with Stockport County in 1997. ===Stockport County=== Stockport County had just won promotion to Division One, a level the club would remain at until 2002 when they were relegated and Woodthorpe left on a free transfer, despite captaining the side in his final season at Edgeley Park. ===Bury=== Woodthorpe joined Bury at the start of the 2002-03 season. His first goal for the Shakers was a local derby winner at Rochdale in the Football League Trophy and his first season ended with Bury reaching the Division Three play-offs. Woodthorpe remained a regular figure in the Bury defence, despite being 20 years older than some teammates and opponents. He was released from Bury in May 2008. ==Management career== In May 2010 Colin Woodthorpe was appointed as assistant to player manager Dave Challinor at UniBond Premier Division club Colwyn Bay F.C. where they finished second and won promotion to Conference North via the play-offs, before later moving to AFC Fylde with Challinor in the summer 2012. After almost eight years in the role and an FA Trophy win at Wembley, Challinor and Woodthorpe left AFC Fylde in October 2019, after a poor start to the season.AFC Fylde on Twitter: \\"Club statement: AFC Fylde have parted ..., twitter.com, 12 October 2019 Joined Runcorn Linnets as assistant manager on 19th June 2020. ==References * *Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk *Colwyn Bay announce Dave Challinor as new manager Category:Living people Category:1969 births Category:English footballers Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Association football defenders Category:Footballers from Liverpool ","title":"Colin Woodthorpe"},{"id":"6214079","text":"Suffolk County Transit is the provider of bus services in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island in the United States and is an agency of the Suffolk County government. It was founded in 1980 as a county-run oversight and funding agency for a group of private contract operators which had previously provided such services on their own. While the physical maintenance and operation of the buses continue to be provided by these providers, other matters ranging from bus purchases to route and schedule planning to fare rules are set by Suffolk Transit itself. Though serving the entirety of Suffolk County, the one exception is in Huntington, located in the northwestern part of the county, where that town's private operator declined to join Suffolk Transit. Instead, Huntington took over that town's system which became Huntington Area Rapid Transit, or HART. Most of HART's routes do connect to both Suffolk Transit and Nassau Inter-County Express and one can transfer between HART and Suffolk Transit fairly easily. In addition, the village of Patchogue has its own local bus service.transportation ==History== Suffolk County Transit began as the consolidation of numerous private bus companies, many of which became contractors for the county. These included the Bornscheuer Bus Company which served Amityville, Copiague, Lindenhurst, West Babylon, and Babylon. Affiliated company EBT, Inc (an affiliate of School Bus Company Educational Bus Transportation, Incorporated), continues in existence under contract with Suffolk County Transit. In Central Suffolk, the East Patchogue-based Louis A. Fuoco Bus Line (1962-1992) served Patchogue, East Patchogue, Hagerman, Bellport, South Haven, Mastic, Mastic Beach, Port Jefferson, Medford, Coram, Ridge, Calverton, and Riverhead. Continued to exist during early years of Suffolk County Transit. Also, Coram Bus Service (1958-1992) primarily operated school buses, but also began serving mass transit routes in the Town of Brookhaven towards locations as far west as Commack and East Northport, and as far east as Riverhead. On the North Shore, Huntington Coach Corporation (1927–present)Huntington Coach Corporation; About Us (Official Site) served Huntington, Farmingdale, Melville, and Halesite. Quinn's Bus Lines, and later Coram Bus Service after the two were merged in 1969,Minutes from the Town of Riverhead; February 4, 1969 mainly served the area between Port Jefferson and Wading River; especially after the demise of the Wading River Extension of the Port Jefferson Branch.The Forgotten Spur: The Chronicle of the Long Island Rail Road Wading River Extension and the Adjoining Communities (Derek Stadler) In the western Town of Islip, Suffolk Bus Corporation (1946–present), which served Bay Shore, Brentwood, West Brentwood, Central Islip, Islip, and Babylon, continues in existence under contract with Suffolk County Transit.History of Suffolk Bus Corporation On the east end, Sunrise Coach Lines (1946–Present), which served Greenport, Riverhead, Southampton, Sag Harbor, and Easthampton, began operations in 1946, continued in existence under contract with joint venture Twin Forks Transit for the routes they originally operated for Suffolk County Transit. In 2006 Sunrise Coaches EXPRESS Routes were bought by Hampton Jitney.History of Sunrise Coach Lines Utility Lines, a Bee Line Incorporated subsidiary, ran from Patchogue along Montauk Highway into Merrick Road in Nassau County. This line was merged into the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority in 1973, but funding and service disputes lead to the splitting of that route between the N19 west of Babylon and S40 east of Babylon. Inter-County Motor Coach Incorporated,Inter-County Motor Coach (Buses - NYCSubway.org) which is still based in the Village of Babylon has been operating since 1922. Affiliated companies included Babylon TransitBabylon Transit (Buses - NYCSubway.org) operating from 1937 until around 1986,Babylon Transit and Lindenhurst Bus Company, which operated from 1952 to 1986,Lindenhurst Bus Company both companies running in their final years under contract with Suffolk County Transit. Alert Coach, an affiliate of Baumann & Sons Buses, Incorporated, and Acme Bus Corporation began on November 30, 1966, and had at least four lines within the county, which included a troubled history with the Suffolk portion of the old Utility Lines bus.History of Alert Coach Lines During his tenure as Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy proposed a takeover of Suffolk County Transit by the MTA.http://libn.com/politbureau/2009/05/17/mr-levy-heads-to- albany Mr. Levy Heads to Albany In 2011 the Suffolk County Legislature authorized a fare hike from $1.50 to $2.00 on the S92 and 10C routes only. In return, service on those two routes was expanded to Sunday during the summer months. The fare hike took place on June 17, 2011, with Sunday service operating from July until September. ==Fare== The current Suffolk County Transit base fare for most one-way local bus travel is $2.25. For seniors and the disabled, the base fare is $0.75; personal care attendants (PCA) may ride for free when traveling with seniors or the disabled. Students with school- issued identification pay a reduced fare of $1.25. Undergraduate students of Stony Brook University may ride to Smith Haven Mall on the S60 and 3D for free, with a valid SBU ID, on Saturdays. (The university prepaysfor the rides at the start of the school year so that it does not have to run itsown buses to Smith Haven Mall on Saturdays.) Children under five years of age are free, with a limit of three children for every paying adult. Fare payment is conducted with the traditional non-digital use of Suffolk Transit bus tokens, coins or paper currency, and must be exact. There is no magnetic reader technology in use, such as NYC or Nassau County's MetroCard, in use. Bus transfers cost an additional $0.25, and must be requested and paid for upon boarding the bus. These transfers are valid for two hours after issue and can be used on Suffolk County Transit connecting routes, or to Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) connecting routes with a special transfer request slip (transfers to NICE require payment of a \\"step-up\\" fare).You can use transfers from MTA NYC Bus, NICE Bus, HART, Other Long Island/NYC Area Bus Companies. Metro Cards Are Also Allowed With Dispatch Notice. ==Bus service hours== Suffolk Transit bus service operates 7 days a week. Many routes run Monday to Friday from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, with the exceptions of the S69, which runs until 10:20 pm, the S54 and S92, run until 10:15 pm, S1, until 10:05 pm and S45, which finishes at 10:00 pm. On weekdays, the S27 and S40, have evening service that runs their last route until around 9:00pm or so. The S47 runs June through September, 7 days a week. Many longer bus routes such as the S58 eastbound, connecting East Northport with Riverhead, run shortened routes after 4:50 pm, terminating in Middle Island, rather than Riverhead. Similarly, on Saturdays, the S62, normally connecting Hauppauge with Riverhead, only runs between the Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove and Riverhead, leaving no connection with Hauppauge on Long Island's north shore. Saturday bus service, for most routes, runs from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm. On Sundays, only the S1, S33, S40, S41, S45, S54, S58, S61, S66, S92, 3D, and 10C run, using the Saturday schedule for service times.Year Round Sunday Bus Service on 10 Suffolk County Transit (SCT) Bus Routes (Effective January 5, 2014) With the exception of the S47, S92, and 10C, there is no service on New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day.General Information about Suffolk County Transit ==Routes== Main routes are prefixed with a \\"S\\" to signify \\"Suffolk County\\" to fall in line with other nomenclature used by the MTA. Nonetheless the agency has no ties to the MTA, and in fact the \\"S\\" prefix is already used for Staten Island routes. Feeder routes do not have the \\"S\\" prefix, however they have various letter suffixes. ==Suffolk County Accessible Transportation== Suffolk County Accessible Transportation (SCAT) is Suffolk Transit's federally mandated paratransit service for ADA- eligible passengers with disabilities. SCAT service is available Monday through Saturday, 6:00 AM to 8:30 PM and Sunday 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM. The fare for an ADA eligible rider is $4.00. When that rider is accompanied by a personal care attendant (PCA), that PCA does not pay a fare, but must have the same origin and destination as the rider. If riders choose to travel with companions not a PCA, that person must pay the fare of $4.00.SCAT - Suffolk County Accessible Transportation. SCT Users Guide for the disabled ==Bus route assignments== Rather than operate its services in-house like most transit agencies, Suffolk County Transit contracts all their routes to private contractors. The table below lists the private contractors hired to provide fixed-route services.

Released on 10 November 2000, the game stars English footballer Michael Owen. Michael Owen's WLS 2000 has received reskinned versions for releases outside the United Kingdom, primarily Mia Hamm Soccer 64, which stars Mia Hamm, and was released in North America by SouthPeak Interactive. Other international versions include RTL WLS 2000 in Germany, in cooperation with RTL Television, and Telefoot Soccer 2000 in France, in cooperation with Téléfoot; both also published by THQ. == Development == Michael Owen's WLS 2000 was originally announced by Eidos Interactive in September 1998, as a Nintendo 64 conversion of Silicon Dreams Studio's previous World League Soccer game, Michael Owen's World League Soccer '99. However, it was put on hold as Eidos Interactive did not find itself suitable for the Nintendo 64 market, until it was announced, in August 1999, that THQ had picked up the game for further production. == Mia Hamm Soccer 64 == The North American release of Michael Owen's WLS 2000 was reskinned to feature American soccer star Mia Hamm, and published by SouthPeak Interactive as Mia Hamm Soccer 64, on 9 November 2000. This version was developed within twelve weeks by DC Studios, to take advantage of the high profile of Hamm and the United States women's national soccer team, who had just won the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, and be released in time for the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The athletes in the Hamm version were hand-animated, while Michael Owen's WLS 2000 used motion capture. Mia Hamm Soccer 64 was one of the first sports games to star female athletes, with Wendy Gebauer serving as commentator. In a December 2000 interview, Patti Miller of Children Now stated that the game was one of the \\"positive examples of games for girls\\". In a 2012 interview, psychologist Fernanda Schabarum retrospectively noted that the game was a \\"good example of the wrong timing and the wrong approach\\" in the matter of women in sports-oriented video games, and David Rutter, producer for the game, stated that the game being a reskin \\"made it appear more of cynical marketing tactic than a game really interested in women's sports\\". In the United States, Mia Hamm Soccer 64 sold a \\"relatively high\\" 42,886 copies. Gameplay features 18 football teams in the hypothetical U.S. Women's League, 32 national teams, and Mia Hamm's All-Star Team. Different gamemodes, such as Practice and World Cup, where the player can play on a team, with or against Hamm, in a World Cup tournament, were also included. == Game Boy Color tie-in == A Game Boy Color tie-in to the game, Telefoot Soccer 2000, was developed by Aqua Pacific, published by Ubi Soft, and released in Europe on 1 March 2000. Like the Nintendo 64 game, the North American release of Telefoot Soccer 2000 had a Mia Hamm reskin developed; titled Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout, it was released by SouthPeak Interactive on 27 October 2000. == References == Category:2000 video games Category:Association football video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Women's association football video games Category:Video games based on real people Owen Owen Category:Motion capture in video games ","title":"Michael Owen's WLS 2000"},{"id":"6214086","text":"An x-ray image of a spiral fracture to the left humerus of a 27-year-old male. The injury was sustained during a fall. A spiral fracture (a.k.a. torsion fracture) is a bone fracture occurring when torque (a rotating force) is applied along the axis of a bone. Spiral fractures often occur when the body is in motion while one extremity is planted. For example, a spiral fracture of the tibia (the shinbone) can occur in young children when they fall short on an extended leg while jumping. This occurrence is known as \\"toddler's fracture\\". Spiral fractures are also recognized as being suspicious in very young children since to obtain a fracture of this sort requires forceful twisting or jerking of the limbs. Child abuse (physical abuse) and certain conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are considered differentials when identifying spiral or torsion fractures. ==References * http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteogenesis-imperfecta Category:Bone fractures ","title":"Spiral fracture"},{"id":"6214087","text":"Christie Front Drive is the debut EP released by the American indie rock/emo band, Christie Front Drive through Freewill Records in 1994.

She is best remembered for her work on the 1954 Vocational Rehabilitation Act, which provided a great expansion of vocational rehabilitation service for people with disabilities. She publicized the government's growing role in vocational rehabilitation and encouraged expansion of vocational rehabilitation projects among non-governmental organizations. ==Education and career== Switzer graduated from Radcliffe College in 1921 with a B.A. in international law and started working for the federal government: first as an assistant secretary to the Minimum Wage Board and then for U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Public Health Service and the Federal Security Agency, becoming increasingly concerned with health care issues. Switzer became director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1950 and the first administrator of the Social and Rehabilitation Service in 1967. She retired in 1970 as the highest ranking female bureaucrat in the federal government and became vice-president of the World Rehabilitation Fund until her death a year later. Switzer was the first woman to serve on the Board of Directors at Georgetown University in 1969. She served as president of the National Rehabilitation Association from 1960 to 1961 and as advisor to many American health organizations, including the Menninger Foundation and St. Elizabeths Hospital. In recognition of her contributions to vocational rehabilitation, Switzer received the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948, the Albert Lasker Award in 1960 with Paul Wilson Brand and Gudmund Harlem, the American Association of Workers for the Blind's Ambrose M. Shotwell Memorial Award in 1962, and the Edward Miner Gallaudet Award in 1970. Switzer received honorary degrees from Hofstra University in 1969, Gallaudet College, Russell Sage College, and five other universities.

The stirring 36-bar Andante introduction is marked \\"sempre marcatissimo\\" and littered with double-stopping in the violins and violas, forming towering chordal structures. This introduction is restated at the end of the movement, and then reappears, transformed, in the coda of the fourth movement, tying the entire work together. On the second page of the score, Tchaikovsky wrote, \\"The larger number of players in the string orchestra, the more this shall be in accordance with the author's wishes.\\" The second movement, Valse, has become a popular piece in its own right. ==Premieres== The Serenade was given a private performance at the Moscow Conservatory on 3 December 1880. Its first public performance was in St Petersburg on 30 October 1881 under Eduard Napravnik. ==References in other contexts== * The score was used as the foundation of the George Balanchine ballet Serenade in 1934. * The waltz in the second movement was arranged for soprano and full orchestra for the 1945 MGM film Anchors Aweigh under the name \\"From the Heart of a Lonely Poet\\" and performed by Kathryn Grayson with José Iturbi conducting the MGM studio orchestra. * The piece incidentally accompanied the final countdown for the Trinity atomic bomb test July 16, 1945, when it was being broadcast by a Voice of America station on the same frequency being used to transmit test communications. * The waltz section was also used as the startup theme for British television station Channel Television in the 1980s. * Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman. * The waltz was used in the Google Doodle for the 100th anniversary of the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 2016. * The first movement (Pezzo in forma di sonatina: Andante non troppo — Allegro moderato) is the motif of Stefano Valentini, one of the main antagonists in the game The Evil Within 2. * Excerpts from the score were used during NBC's broadcast of a 1983 NFL playoff game between the San Diego Chargers and the Pittsburgh Steelers as a lead in to commercial breaks. ==See also== * Serenade for Strings (Dvořák) * Serenade for Strings (Elgar) ==References * *Tchaikovsky Research *Performance of Serenade for Strings by A Far Cry from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in MP3 format Category:Compositions by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Category:Serenades Category:1880 compositions Category:Compositions in C major Category:Compositions for string orchestra ","title":"Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky)"},{"id":"6214103","text":"Information pollution (also referred to as \\"info pollution\\") is the contamination of information supply with irrelevant, redundant, unsolicited, hampering and low-value information. Examples include misinformation, pornography, junk e-mail and media violence. The spread of useless and undesirable information can have a detrimental effect on human activities. It is considered one of the adverse effects of the information revolution. == Overview == Information pollution generally applies to digital communication, such as e-mail, instant messaging (IM) and social media. The term acquired particular relevance in 2003 when web usability expert Jakob Nielsen published articles discussing the topic. As early as 1971 researchers were expressing doubts about the negative effects of having to recover “valuable nodules from a slurry of garbage in which it is a randomly dispersed minor component.” People use information in order to make decisions and adapt to circumstances. Cognitive studies demonstrated human beings can process only limited information before the quality of their decisions begins to deteriorate. Information overload is a related concept that can also harm decision-making. It refers to the sheer volume of available information, without respect to its quality. Although technology is thought to have exacerbated the problem, it is not the only cause of information pollution. Anything that distracts attention from the essential facts required to perform a task or make a decision could be considered an information pollutant. Information pollution is seen as the digital equivalent of the environmental pollution generated by industrial processes.Capurro, R. (1990). Towards an Information Ecology. In: I. Wormell, ed. Information and Quality. London: Taylor Graham. pp. 122–139 Some authors claim that information overload is a crisis of global proportions, on the same scale as threats faced by the environment. Others have expressed the need for the development of an information management paradigm that parallels environmental management practices.Bray, D.A. (2008). Information Pollution, Knowledge Overload, Limited Attention Spans, and Our Responsibilities as IS Professionals. Global Information Technology Management Association (GITMA) World Conference. ==Manifestations == The manifestations of information pollution can be broadly grouped into those that provoke disruption and those that damage information quality. Typical examples of disrupting information pollutants include unsolicited electronic messages (spam) and instant messages, particularly in the workplace. Mobile phones (ring tones and content) are disruptive in many contexts. Disrupting information pollution is not always technology based. A common example are newspapers, where subscribers read less than half or even none of the articles provided. Superfluous messages, such as unnecessary labels on a map, also distract. Alternatively, information may be polluted when its quality is reduced. This may be due to inaccurate or out of date information, but it also happens when information is badly presented. For example, when content is unfocused or unclear or when they appear in cluttered, wordy or poorly organised documents it is difficult for the reader to understand. Laws and regulations undergo changes and revisions. Handbooks and other sources used for interpreting these laws can fall years behind the changes, which can cause the public to be misinformed. == Causes Cultural factors=== Cultural factors have contributed to information pollution: Information has been seen traditionally as a good thing. We are used to statements like “you cannot have too much information”, “the more information the better” and “knowledge is power”. The publishing and marketing industries have become used to printing many copies of books, magazines and brochures regardless of customer demand, just in case they are needed. EBSCOhost 1977624. New technologies that made it easier for information to reach everyone democratised information sharing. This is perceived as a sign of progress and individual empowerment, as well as a positive step to bridge the divide between the information poor and the information rich. However, it also has the effect of increasing the volume of distracting information. This makes it more difficult to distinguish valuable information from noise. The continuous use of advertising in websites, technologies, newspapers, and every day life is known as \\"cultural pollution\\". ===Information technology=== Technological advances of the 20th century and, in particular, the internet play a key role in the increase of information pollution. Blogs, social networks, personal websites and mobile technology all contribute to increased “noise\\". The level of pollution may depend on the context. For example, e-mail is likely to cause more information pollution in a corporate setting.Managing Information. 2008. In Focus: Managing the 'Information Pollution'. Managing Information, 14(10), pp. 10–12 Mobile phones are likely to be particularly disruptive in a confined space like a train carriage. == Effects == The effects of information pollution can be seen at multiple levels. ===Individual=== At a personal level, information pollution affects individuals' capacity to evaluate options and find adequate solutions. This can lead to information overload and to anxiety, decision paralysis and stress. It can disrupt the learning process. ===Society=== Some authors argue that information pollution and information overload can cause loss of perspective and moral values. This argument may explain the indifferent attitude that society shows towards topics such as scientific discoveries, health warnings or politics. Pollution makes people less sensitive to headlines and more cynical towards new messages. ===Business=== Information pollution contributes to information overload and stress and therefore disrupts decisions. Increased processing time easily translates into loss of productivity and revenue. Flawed decision making increases the risk of critical errors. == Solutions == Proposed solutions include management techniques and refined technology. * Technology-based alternatives include decision support systems and dashboards that enable prioritisation of information. Technologies that create frequent interruptions can be replaced with less “polluting” options. Further, technology can improve the presentation quality, aiding understanding. * E-mail usage policies and information integrity assurance strategies can help. Time management and stress management can be applied. This would involve setting priorities and minimising interruptions. Improved writing and presentation practices can minimise information pollution effects on others. ==Related terms== Infollution: The term infollution or informatization pollution was coined by Dr. Paek-Jae Cho, former president & CEO of KTC (Korean Telecommunication Corp.), in a 2002 speech at the International Telecommunications Society (ITS) 14th biennial conference to describe any undesirable side effect brought about by information technology and its applications. ==See also== *Digital divide *Information ecology *Information environmentalism *Information explosion *Information overload *Information quality *Information revolution *Information society *Informatization *Spam (electronic) *Stress management *Time management ==References External links == * Information Pollution – Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox, 2003 * 10 Steps for Cleaning Up Information Pollution – Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox, 2004 * Web guru fights info pollution – BBC, 2003 Category:Library science Category:Information science Category:Information technology ","title":"Information pollution"},{"id":"6214112","text":"Joe Nemechek, the 1992 Busch Series champion The 1992 NASCAR Busch Series season began February 15 and ended November 8.

In addition to her musical career, Gnant also owns an art gallery in Phoenix, Arizona. ==Life and career== Born in Hartland, Wisconsin, Gnant grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona. She first received attention when she co-composed and sang on the soundtrack to Cerise Casper's 1996 computer game, Treasure Quest starring Terry Farrell. Some of the songs were co-written by Grammy award-winning producer Richard Feldman. Gnant's tunes were instrumental during the game, and vocal excerpts appeared when certain objects were picked up. The full versions of the songs, though not the instrumentals, were included on a separate CD, Treasure Quest: The Soundtrack. In the Phoenix area, she began performing her original, more personal work, which she labeled Bohemian Geek Soul, and moved to a newly renovated Phoenix arts district that was making the transition into a Bohemian artist community. On July 12, 2005, Kyle MacDonald began a blog called One red paperclip in which he offered to trade a red paperclip and eventually traded up for a new place to live. One item he was eventually traded was a recording contract. When Gnant heard about this, she hurriedly looked for something to trade and eventually was able to offer MacDonald a room in her home with free rent for a year in exchange for the contract. The result of this was her second album, called Pivot, where she was supported by Adrian Goldenthal, Julian Goldenthal, Kris Hill, and Shea Marshall. Gnant was also able to meet numerous celebrities, including Alice Cooper and Corbin Bernsen. In a 2008 appearance on MTV's Made, Gnant coached a tomboyish girl in vocal lessons so she could fulfill her dream of being a pageant queen. ==Lifecasting== On July 31 of 2007, Gnant began lifecasting, streaming her life 24 hours a day, live on Ustream.tv. Less than a week after starting to lifecast, she had the #3 video on MySpace with 186,000 views. Her music is showcased nationwide as part of ScreenVison's pre-show entertainment in 4,000 movie theaters. Due to the lifecasting, Gnant's music reached a worldwide audience with international orders for her album, Pivot.ABC News: \\"Lifecasting makes YouTube seem like old technology: Singer/songwriter Jody Gnant uses Ustream to boost exposure\\", September 19, 2007. ==Store buyout== On May 20, 2011, Jody Gnant, Kyle MacDonald, Hal Kirkland, Gary Lachance, and Fiddy, as part of Store Buyout, walked into Hercules Fancy Grocery in New York City and bought every single item on store shelves using $20,000 in credit card cash advances in an effort to save the store from going out of business.

He was a bright student and a recipient of a New York State Regents Scholarship. He was also a talented athlete and musician. He started at third base for Great Neck South High School's varsity baseball team and played varsity tennis in college. He also earned money by playing the piano at restaurants and other local venues. He began to hone his entrepreneurial skills at a young age by trading coins and antiques while in junior high and high school. As a college student he set up a store in his dorm providing the usual necessities of dorm life such as toiletries and ordering LP's at substantial savings to his fellow dormmates. Dan majored in Latin American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis. After graduating in 1973, he headed to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia to visit the countries he had studied. Putumayo, named after the valley of the Putumayo River in Colombia, began as a hole-in the-wall retail store in New York City in 1975. Dan filled his small shop with handcrafts and clothing collected in Latin America. The store received considerable media attention and by 1985 Dan found himself designing ethnic inspired contemporary clothing and supplying 600 other stores. Putumayo also had three successful New York stores patronized by such clients as Jane Fonda and Mia Farrow. ==Switch to music== In 1991, Dan fell in love with world music when he happened upon a live concert of Kotoja, an African band lead by Babá Ben Okulolo in the San Francisco Bay area. Dan knew he had to get involved with this compelling music and put together Putumayo’s first two world music collections in 1993. That same year, Dan was joined by his long-time friend Michael Kraus, who helped him launch the label. After selling the Putumayo stores in 1997, Dan was able to focus full-time on his goal of introducing people to other cultures through great world music. He now travels extensively and, with the support of ethnomusicologist Jacob Edgar (founder of Cumbancha) pays attention to the music scenes in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, New Orleans, Johannesburg and other music centers. The opening of Putumayo Europe, in Hilversum, Holland in 2000 enabled the company to connect with the European music and retail scene. The expansion of the label’s International division has also extended Putumayo’s presence in South America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The company now has offices in 12 countries. Putumayo has sold more than 15 million CDs since it began, with 50 of its collections selling more than 100,000 copies each and several surpassing 300,000. Currently, more than 3500 specialty retailers in the U.S. and thousands more around the world sell Putumayo CDs.

It is one of the major campaign platforms of Ma Ying-jeou, the former Taipei mayor. The proposed 4.9km Beitou cable car line to ferry tourists between Xinbeitou Station and the Yangmingshan National Park would have four stops, the first of which would be built near the skating rink at Chingshui Park. It would continue to Lungfeng Valley on Yangmingshan, the first parking lot in Yangmingshan National Park, and terminate at the second parking lot. ==Scandals and controversies== Taipei City Government structured the Beitou Link Project in a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme, and awarded the BOT tender to Rich Development, a local property developer, in 2005. Construction began in early 2006, but the Project was soon mired by a series of scandals. The prosecutors detained Yen Wan-chin, the Deputy Minister of Interior, on 20 July 2006 under corruption charges, but Yen staged a hunger strike in protest of the false allegations. Six other suspects, including officials and contractors, were also arrested under the same charges. Total project cost for the Beitou Link was budgeted at NT$1 billion (US$31 million) when Ma Ying-jeou announced the BOT tender in 2005, but was increased to NT$2.9 billion (US$89 million) when the Taipei government signed the concession contract, and further to NT$3.3 billion (US$102 million) in the construction period. Local critics also questioned its controversial evasion of environmental impact assessment and possible misappropriation of state properties. Taiwan laws call for state-administered environmental impact statement for all development projects within the national parks, regardless of the project size. A local environmental protection group openly blasted Ma as \\"incompetent and shameful\\" for approving a change to the concession contract to allow construction of hotels and spa resorts in the national park without a required environmental impact assessment, and misappropriating two additional land slots totaling 4.1 hectares to the Project. Taiwan's Ministry of Interior revoked all construction permits of the project for the illegal evasion of environmental impact assessment, and Ma also agreed to halt the construction before all legal proceedings settle. According to Liberty Times, one of the three largest newspapers in Taiwan, a discussion thread about this scandal on SocialForce, an independent internet forum advocating against abuse of power by local media, began to gather popularity with many surfers contributing new allegations against Ma.

The village is situated approximately six miles north of Ripon on the A6108, which goes from Ripon to Masham and Wensleydale. The parish includes the hamlets of Nosterfield, Thornborough and Binsoe. ==History== Marmion Tower, West Tanfield The toponym is from the Old English tāna feld, meaning \\"open land where young shoots grow\\", or possibly \\"open land of a man called Tana\\". The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Tanefeld. The manor was owned by Thorkil at the time of the Norman invasion, but were afterwards granted to Count Alan of Brittany. The manor was held by Hugh, son of Gernegan thereafter and his heirs until at least 1243. One of these heirs, a woman named Avis had married Robert Marmion and held the manor in 1287. The Marmion family held the manor until 1387 when it passed to the next line of descent to the wife of Sir Henry Fitz Hugh. The Fitz Hugh family held the manor until 1513 when the direct line ended and it passed to another branch family, the Parr's. The Parr's held the manor until the death of William Parr, Marquess of Northampton in 1571. William was also the brother of Catherine Parr, Queen consort to Henry VIII. The manor was passed back to the Crown at that time before being granted in 1572 to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. The manor was inherited by his son Thomas, Earl of Exeter and thence his son William. Having no surviving son, the manor of Tanfield passed to his second daughter whose second marriage was to Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin and 1st Earl of Ailesbury and who held the manor in 1676 and was passed down the line of descent until 1738. It became the possession of Thomas Bruce Brudenell, who succeeded to the title as well. It remained with the family until 1886. The village has a monument called the Marmion Tower, a 15th- century gatehouse which belonged to the now vanished manor house and former home of the Marmion family known as the \\"Hermitage\\". At first floor level there is an example of an oriel window. The tower is now in the care of English Heritage and is a Grade I listed building. The village had a railway station on the Masham branch line of the North Eastern Railway until the line was closed in 1963. Not far from the village are the Thornborough Henges, known as the 'Stone Henge of the North'. ==Governance== West Tanfield was historically a parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974 it was transferred to Hambleton district in the new county of North Yorkshire. The village lies within the Richmond (Yorks) UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Bedale electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Tanfield ward of Hambleton District Council. The parish shares a grouped parish council, Tanfield Parish Council, with the much smaller parish of East Tanfield. An electoral ward in the name of Tanfield exists. This ward stretches east to Pickhill with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,865. ==Geography== The village lies on the A6108 Ripon to Leyburn road and on the north bank of a large meander on the River Ure. The settlements of Nosterfield, Thornborough, Binsoe, Mickley and North Stainley all lie within of the village. ===Demography=== The 2001 UK Census recorded the population of the Parish as 532 of which 48.5% were male and 51.5% female. There were 242 dwellings in the Parish of which 92 were detached. The parish population had increased to 636 by the time of the census 2011. ==Amenities== Village services include two public houses and a village store encompassing the post office. The public houses are both Grade II Listed buildings. The Memorial Hall serves as a venue for events in the village and was built as a monument to the men of West Tanfield who died during the two world wars. ===Education=== St Nicholas CE School is located in the village and is within the catchment area of Bedale High School for secondary education. The present structure in Marmion Court was built in 1965. ===Sport=== There is a village football team. The village Cricket Club which was founded in 1907 is situated at Sleningford on the opposite side of the Ure, they play league matches in the Nidderdale and District League and Wensleydale Evening League as well as local knockout cup competitions.

A razo normally introduced an individual poem, acting as a prose preface and explanation; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a vida (a biography of a troubadour, describing his origins, his loves, and his works) and the boundary between the two genres was never sharp. In the chansonniers, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, some poems are accompanied by a prose explanation whose purpose is to give the reason why the poem was composed. These texts are occasionally based on independent sources. To that extent, they supplement the vidas in the same manuscripts and are useful to modern literary and historical researchers. Often, however, it is clear that assertions in the razos are simply deduced from literal readings of details in the poems. Most of the surviving razo corpus is the work of Uc de Saint Circ, composed in Italy between 1227 and 1230. In one case, a manuscript from Bergamo, there is an explanatory rubric preceding the Occitan partimen Si paradis et enfernz son aital by Girard Cavalaz and Aycart del Fossat is in Latin. ==Sources== * Poe, Elizabeth W. \\"At the Boundary between Vida and Razo: The Biography of Raimon Jordan.\\" Neophilologus, 72:2 (Apr., 1988) pp. 316-319\\\\. * Schutz, A.

Fantasy Flight Games released an updated version in 2006 as Fury of Dracula, and a third edition in 2015 by the same name. WizKids Games released a fourth edition in 2019. ==Theme== The game takes place in Europe during 1898, eight years after the events in Bram Stoker’s novel, Dracula. One player takes the role of Count Dracula, who is seeking revenge by building an army of vampires throughout Europe. The remaining players take the roles of Hunters Abraham Van Helsing, Dr John Seward and Lord Godalming. (In the second and all subsequent editions, Mina Harker was added as a fourth Hunter.) The Hunters, following clues Dracula has left behind, join together to destroy Dracula before he can succeed. ==First edition== Disappointed by the limited availability of horror boardgames, Stephen Hand began the initial treatment of his Dracula-based horror game in 1985. His original conception was a two-game set entitled Dracula: Fact and Fiction; one part would be a fantasy game, and the other part would be a dry, historical simulation of Vlad the Impaler's Turkish campaigns. Hand ultimately shelved the project due to time constraints. A short time later, he resurrected the project after receiving encouragement from Marc Gascoigne, eventually submitting the finished project to Games Workshop in the summer of 1986. Although Workshop liked the game, they put the game on hold while they focused on stronger products, offering Hand a choice of waiting for a suitable production gap to appear, or converting the game to fit into the Warhammer Fantasy World. Games Workshop ultimately produced The Fury of Dracula and released it in the autumn of 1987, with plastic figurines. Games Workshop also released a limited edition boxed set that had metal rather than plastic miniatures, the only differentiation in the external packaging being a circular sticker marked \\"Limited Edition\\". ===Gameplay=== This edition was designed for 2-4 players (Dracula and up to three Hunters). The Hunters move openly across the game board, which is a stylised map of late 19th century Europe, while the Dracula player moves in secret by using a separate small board hidden behind a screen. By various means, the Hunters try to deduce and uncover Dracula's path, overcoming whatever obstacles he has placed along the way (including wolves, rats, bats, armed minions, fledgling vampires, fog, storms and plagues). The Hunters also gather weapons and equipment such as rifles, stakes, garlic and holy water for the eventual showdown. The Hunters can move by sea, road or rail, while Dracula is permitted to move by sea or road only. Moving by rail permits the Hunters to cover a greater distance than they could by road, but requires a die roll; the result of the roll can be anything from being delayed a turn to being able to travel to as many as three towns connected by a railway. Differences between the Hunters is minimal: Godalming receives a +1 to first-round initiative against Dracula's minions and a -1 against Dracula himself, while Van Helsing received the inverse. Seward receives no modifiers. ===Combat=== Combat is performed on a round by round basis. The time of combat is determined by a die roll, although various cards played by either side can force a particular time of day. Combatants first choose a combat option in secret, using cardboard chits. The basic options for an unarmed combatant are Fist, Dodge or Escape. Each combatant also gets an additional combat option for each weapon they possess, although Hunters are not allowed to use the same combat option twice in consecutive rounds unless the Hunter possesses two weapons of the same type, which can then be used alternately. Dracula's combat options vary greatly depending on the time of day; if caught during the day, he can only use the basic unarmed combat options. During the night, due to his supernatural powers, he has access to many more combat options. Once every combatant has secretly determined a combat option, each side rolls a die for initiative. Each side then reveals their chosen combat option, and the results of the options and initiatives are cross referenced on the appropriate chart to determine the winner for the round. This procedure repeats itself until one side is dead or successfully retreats. ===Wounds and bites=== Each Hunter has 12 Wound points, representing the amount of injuries he can sustain. Combat, encounters and certain event cards can cause damage to the Hunter, and the Hunter is eliminated from the game once the number of Wound points is reduced to zero. Wounds can be recovered by using event cards or by resting. If a Hunter is bitten by Dracula or a vampire, the player is given a Bite token. While under the effects of a bite, certain event cards (marked \\"Bitten Only\\") become playable — these can be beneficial or detrimental. A Hunter with a Bite token suffers penalties in combat against Dracula. Being bitten a second time results in the hunter becoming a vampire; he is eliminated from the game and given to the Dracula player as a generic vampire encounter. ===Dracula's Blood points=== Dracula has 12 Blood points, which are the equivalent of Wound points. Combat and certain event cards can cause Dracula to lose Blood points; in addition, every time he embarks on a sea voyage, he loses a Blood point. Dracula can also spend Blood points to activate special abilities. When Dracula's Blood points are reduced to zero, he enters Blood Death; he must retreat to Castle Dracula by the quickest route possible and he must escape every encounter as soon as possible. He can no longer win the game (although he may be able to force a draw). If he takes an additional 12 points of damage while in Blood Death, he is destroyed, resulting in a Hunter's major victory. ===Victory conditions=== Each side has a set of difficult major victory conditions and easier minor victory conditions. Once any of them have been fulfilled, either side can declare a victory. Once a minor victory has been declared, play continues until either a major victory condition is met, or all the conditions to achieve a major victory become impossible. For example, the Hunters can claim a minor victory if they force Dracula to flee to Castle Dracula. They can subsequently claim a major victory if they can find and kill Dracula at his castle; but if he successfully hides first, the major victory becomes impossible, and the game ends with a minor victory for the Hunters. It is not unusual for both sides to be able to simultaneously claim minor victories. ==Second edition== In 2006, Fantasy Flight Games released the second edition of the game, dropping \\"The\\" from the title and renaming it Fury of Dracula. The rules featured a few changes to gameplay. ===Gameplay=== The second edition adds a \\"Vampire Track\\" to the game — Dracula advances the counter by one for each Hunter he eliminates, for each vampire he creates, or for each complete day/night cycle he survives. A fourth Hunter, Mina Harker, has been added, making the game playable by 2-5 players. Each Hunter has a special ability. for example, Van Helsing can withstand an additional bite; Godalming can reroll any unsatisfactory train movement die roll due to his Wealth. Rather than using a separate board to track Dracula's movements, Dracula uses a trail of face-down cards, each representing a location on the board. Only his six previous locations can contain any encounters. As he moves along the map, the oldest location moves further down the track until it reaches the seventh position, where Dracula can \\"mature\\" the encounter or discard it. Maturing the encounter will have varying effects depending on the encounter itself - it could discarded without effect or in the case of vampires, increase the Vampire track by two, bringing Dracula closer to winning the game. Rather than determining the time of day for combat through a random die roll, the time of day is displayed on a day/night tracker that advances incrementally each turn. Every time the track advances to a new day, in addition to Dracula gaining a Vampire track point, the Hunters gain 1 Resolve point; this can be used to reveal Dracula's oldest location, allow an individual Hunter to take an extra turn, or heal a single Hunter. If the Dracula player is found to have cheated, whether intentionally or accidentally, the suggested punishment is to clear Dracula's trail to one location — revealing his current location — while suffering Blood point loss equal to a \\"Killed\\" result. (If this would destroy him, he is left with 1 Blood point instead).Fury of Dracula Rules Booklet, 2006, p.25 ===Combat=== First edition's cardboard chits for combat options have been eliminated in favour of small cards, which also contain all information about combat results, eliminating the need for separate combat resolution tables. ===Wounds/blood and bites=== Each Hunter in the second edition has a different number of Wound points; if a Hunter's Wound points are reduced to zero, the Hunter must recuperate at the Hospital of St Joseph and St Mary, but may continue to play. In addition, being bitten twice no longer eliminates the Hunter from the game; instead the Hunter is sent to the Hospital to recover. Van Helsing is resistant to bites and can withstand three before being sent to the hospital. Mina Harker begins with a Bite Token, meaning that \\"bitten only\\" events are usable right from the start of the game. ===Blood points=== Dracula's Blood points have been increased from 12 to 15. However, although a variety of events and special abilities make it much easier for Dracula to recover Blood points in second edition, if he is reduced to zero Blood points, Dracula is destroyed. However, Dracula can no longer be killed outright by a single attack. Suffering a \\"Killed\\" result in combat reduces his Blood Points to a predetermined amount on his character sheet (0, 5 and 10 Blood points), and combat continues. ===Victory conditions=== First edition's varying degrees of victory have been eliminated in favour of a much simpler system: The Hunters win if they are able to kill Dracula. Dracula wins if he is able to advance the Vampire track to 6. ==Credits for first and second editions== First edition:The Fury of Dracula Rulebook, 1987, p.14 *Designer: Stephen Hand *Rules Editor: Mike Brunton *Graphic Design: Bil Sedgwick *Board Art: Colin Dixon *Counter Art: Dave Andrews *Character Illustrations: Martin McKenna, Colin Dixon, Dave Andrews *Paste-up: Heidi Allman, Dave Clemmett, Dave Oliver *Playtesters: Mandy Wooton, Andrew Colclough, Colin Hand, Matther Tudor & Co, Alan Merret, Graeme Davis, Bil Sedgwick, Jervis Johnson, Sean Masterson, Charles Elliot, Tim Pollard *Box Art: Jim BurnsGame box, back, 1987 Second edition:Fury of Dracula Rules Booklet, 2006, p.29 *Designer: Stephen Hand *Second Edition Development: Kevin Wilson *Rules: Kevin Wilson *Editing: James Torr *Graphic Design: Andrew Navaro, Scott Nicely *Art Direction: Kevin Wilson, AndrewNavaro *Flavor Text: Dan Clark *Lead Playtester for this Edition: Tony Doepner *Playtesting for this Edition: Rodger Bernstein, Matthew B.

He spent 33 years at Norwich City, 13 as a player, seven on the commercial staff and 13 as chief scout. The Times noted his aggressive defending by writing \\"Forbes got his customary booking; the referee ought to take his name in the changing room rather than on the pitch thus saving time.\\" ==Career== Forbes joined Colchester United in September 1961 from Scottish non-league side Musselburgh Athletic, making his league debut later that season. He quickly established himself as a regular in the Layer Road side, playing in two promotion-winning teams and two relegation teams over the next 7 years. In September 1968, after playing 270 league games for Colchester, scoring twice, he moved to Norwich City for a fee of £10,000. At Carrow Road, he helped the Canaries into Division One, and in 1970 he was voted the fourth winner of the Barry Butler Trophy, the fans' award for player of the year. He was captain of the Norwich team that won promotion to the first division for the first time in 1972. In October 1976 he looked to have lost his place and joined Torquay United on loan. He returned to Carrow Road and won his place back, finishing his Norwich career with 295 league appearances, in which he scored 10 times. On leaving Norwich he played for Great Yarmouth Town, before joining Diss Town as player-coach. Playing colleague Dave Stringer said of Forbes, \\"If he shouted in Norwich it could be heard in Yarmouth\\", adding that \\"his former defensive partner was the 'perfect leader'\\". ==Retirement== Within a year of leaving Carrow Road, he returned, joining the Norwich City commercial staff where he was in charge of Club Canary organising trips to away matches. In March 1988, he was appointed as Norwich's Chief Scout, a post he held until his retirement in 2001, by which time he had spent 33 almost unbroken years at Carrow Road. In 2002, Forbes was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.*Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk In 2013, Forbes, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, moved to a care home.

Flint currently resides in Bozeman, Montana in the United States. A former high school math and history teacher, Rasmussen signed a contract with Professional Bull Riders and currently provides entertainment at their events. Long associated with the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Rasmussen earned the title of PRCA Clown of the Year for eight consecutive years and won the Coors Man in the Can honors seven times. == Early life == On January 25, 1968, Stan and Tootsie Rasmussen had their youngest child, Flint, in Havre, Montana. Flint Rasmussen grew up in Choteau, Montana, where he started his career in sports Rasmussen was an All-State football player and track star for Choteau High School. After high school, Rasmussen attended college at the University of Montana Western where he completed a double major in history and math as an honor student. As the public radio sports announcer for the UMW Bulldogs, Rasmussen had his voice heard for the first time by an audience. To help with the expenses of college, Rasmussen worked as a barrel clown in western Montana. Rasmussen made his first appearance as a rodeo clown in Superior, Montana, at the age of 19. Flint had his first thoughts about being a rodeo clown when he told his father and brother that he could do better than the rodeo clowns at the time. \\"I just thought it needed a new energy, a young guy who could relate and get young people to get back to rodeo,\\" Rasmussen said. After he completed college, Flint Rasmussen returned to the town he was born, Havre, and taught at Havre High School in addition to coaching football and track. While teaching at Havre High School, Flint was also the public address announcer at Northern Montana College (now MSU - Northern) home Lights and Skylights Basketball games.

Flint met ex-wife, Katie Grasky, who was a barrel racer, while he was touring. Flint Has two daughters, Shelby and Paige, who also barrel race. == The Rodeo Clown == According to the Journal of Folklore Research, \\"The clown of the rodeo qualifies as the clown of cowboy society, and thus in the rodeo he exaggerates, satirizes, rearranges, and challenges the assumptions upon which the social and natural relations of the cowboy world operate.\\" The rodeo clown goes back to the old western stories, where cowboys play tricks and tell lies. The rodeo clown's main act comes at the last event bull riding. During the ride, the clown faces the bull and plays the bullfighter, but after the ride, resumes his role as the jokester and story teller. == Achievements == \\"I think it's hard to come into this sport cold at 25 and try to learn it,\\" Rasmussen said. But that did not stop him. Flint Rasmussen's did his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1998. That same year, he was a barrel clown at the Pendleton Round Up, and thirteen years later, in 2011, Rasmussen was inducted into the Pendleton Hall of Fame.

Flint got back to the arena with only a few differences: he had to wear a heart rate monitor and had to take a few breaks when his heart rate exceeded 140 bpm. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Rodeo clowns Category:People from Choteau, Montana Category:People from Havre, Montana Category:University of Montana alumni Category:Schoolteachers from Montana ","title":"Flint Rasmussen"},{"id":"6214277","text":"The Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway (BBR) is a privately owned railway company that provides a rail link in Zimbabwe between Beitbridge at the South African border and Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayo.

He could trace his musical ancestry in an eminently distinguished line back to the Romantic Era of the 19th Century. He was born in 1920 and was only four years old when he appeared in public for the first time, at London's Wigmore Hall. His last solo recital at London's Royal Festival Hall was attended by HM The Queen Mother. ==Musical education== Vallier's mother was Adela Verne, the finest woman pianist of her time and herself a contemporary and even rival of Paderewski, whose teacher Leschetizky was a pupil of Czerny who taught Liszt. Vallier's aunt and principal teacher was Mathilde Verne, through whose famous piano school in London passed the young Vallier as well as the pianists Solomon and Moura Lympany, and even socialite Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Mathilde Verne was herself the finest pupil of Clara Schumann, from whom she inherited a direct insight into her husband Robert Schumann's music and their friends and colleagues Mendelssohn, Chopin and Brahms.Chords of Remembrance, Mathilde Verne (Autobiography) - Hutchinson, 1936 Vallier's father was Jean Vallier, a distinguished operatic Bass. Vallier was immersed from his first years in the purest traditions of piano playing embellished with authenticity of interpretation. Vallier gave his first solo concert at the age of eight, and was something of a child prodigy giving recitals in the South of France.Monte Carlo Gazette, 1931 He was heard by Moritz Rosenthal (Liszt's pupil) whom he much impressed. However his Aunt wisely held back developing the young talent too early. Vallier was sent to study in Vienna for three years with Walter Kerschbaumer, a pupil of Busoni. Alfred Cortot proclaimed him a brilliant musician; later he worked with Edwin Fischer. ==Early career== He returned from Vienna in 1939 and was about to embark on a tour of the US but the War intervened. Unlike many of his contemporaries, and much to the chagrin of his parents and aunt, Vallier served directly in the war years and was a crack shot with a rifle. He was demobilised with the rank of Captain. He resumed his performing career and concertized extensively. There were some notable recitals in London and the UK and some in Europe. With his mother on the BBC he gave the first televised performance of Mozart’s Piano Concerto for Two Pianos, and the first performance in the UK of Dohnányi’s Second Piano Concerto with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. He was one of the last who would improvise the cadenza to a concerto, particularly Beethoven, and, as an encore, would invite the name of a composer and tune from the audience and then improvise a piece in the style of the composer suggested. He also undertook valuable educational work in bringing classical music to children in parts of the country where live performances were rare in the 1940s and early 1950s at schools for the WEA. His amiable personality helped immeasurably in this task. However his career did not take off in the way his pre-war years had predicted. ==Musicology== He turned to teaching and musicological research. He taught in London, at the London College of Music. Over many years he became an international authority on Chopin. He was a lifelong friend of Chopin expert Arthur Hedley and gave several first performances of then recently discovered Chopin works. These and some of Vallier’s detailed writings appeared in his Oxford University Press Chopin Edition (1986).Oxford Keyboard Classics, Chopin, John Vallier - Oxford University Press, , 1986 ==Later career== Vallier returned to concertizing at the end of the 1970s with immense success. The start of his South Bank Concert with the Paderewski Piano Sonata in E Flat Minor was delayed by 20 minutes because of box-office queues. He followed in his mother’s footsteps with touring successes particularly in Latin-America. He was acclaimed internationally for his virtuosity and stylistic insight. A Chopin Recital at New York’s Carnegie Hall in 1983 was particularly well received, and Vallier was to return to tour the States the next year. ==Illness and death== Vallier returned to CBS Studios in London for recordings, but noticed something wrong with his breathing. He was diagnosed with lung cancer. In 1984 he had a lung removed resulting in a 22” scar on his back, and subsequently also contracted pleuritic influenza, prostatitis and shingles. He was thereafter on painkillers, taking 3,000 pills a year. Despite all odds, he returned again to the concert platform, in a solo recital in 1986 at London's Royal Festival Hall, attended by HM The Queen Mother. Although cleared for five years of the cancer, a second primary (a rarity) occurred in his other lung. Vallier died in June 1991, aged 71. ==Musical style== Vallier inherited the family music tradition as well as music scores annotated with technical and interpretative markings by Paderewski and Clara Schumann. Perhaps not surprisingly given his musical pedigree Vallier was particularly at home with the music of the Romantics. He had a strong orchestral approach to performance, with wide range of dynamics, excitement, subtle pedal technique, all embellished in a singing legato sound (a principal characteristic of Clara Schumann's teachings). He possessed a formidable technique, yet was a man of small stature and despite considerable power in performance maintained a restrained position at the keyboard. ==Archives== The annotated scores and various musical memorabilia handed down to John Vallier continue to survive today in the family archives. The Collection includes scores of Robert Schumann's music containing the personal annotations of Clara Schumann; Robert Schumann's conducting baton (with which Schumann conducted the first performance of his Rhenish Symphony in 1851); letters from Clara Schumann; her writing case and gold book mark; music scores annotated by Ignace Jan Paderewski, the great Polish Pianist and Statesman; paintings by Sir Hubert Von Herkomer, RA; etc. Excerpts shown here are from the last page of Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor with a dedication to Mathilde Verne by Clara Schumann: none and the front page of Paderewski's Sonata in E flat minor Op. 23, with the composer's dedication to Adela Verne: none ==Composer== Vallier's output was modest as a composer, and primarily his works were finely-crafted miniatures for the piano. His Toccatina won especial popularity and was first recorded by Benno Moiseiwitsch and later by Marc-André Hamelin (2001). Witches’ Ride (depicting the Witches of Zennor, Cornwall) was also popular and often featured in his own encores. However his last work was a large-scale, his Piano Concerto in A Minor, a commission from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He completed it two days before he died. ==Personal life== Vallier's fiancé was killed in the war, and despite several close relationships later he did not marry. He had a love for speed and for many years rode a Norton motorcycle. He was a considerable athlete, a good runner and cricketer. He was an aristocratic entertainer, with a myriad of anecdotes, most of them based on truth, many handed down from his family. To this he brought a gentle temperament and his self-effacing natural modesty that endeared him to many. ==References * keyboardgiants.com Category:1920 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:English classical composers Category:English classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century English musicians Category:English male classical composers Category:20th-century British composers Category:British male pianists Category:20th-century British male musicians ","title":"John Vallier"},{"id":"6214288","text":"Vallier is a topographic surname of French and Old English origin, referring to someone who lives in a valley.

There is also an isolated population in the Crimea. A number of notably large specimens are specially protected in Turkey; the largest is the Aslanardıçı (\\"Lion Juniper\\"), 25 m tall and 3.38 m trunk diameter, estimated to be 1,700 years old (Boscawen 1994). ==Description== Juniperus foetidissima is a medium-sized tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to diameter. It has a broadly conical to rounded or irregular crown. The leaves are of two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 8–10 mm long on seedlings and re-growth after branch damage, and adult scale-leaves 2–3 mm long on older plants. It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some individual plants are monoecious, producing both sexes. The cones are berry- like, 7–13 mm in diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 1-2 (rarely 3) seeds; they are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 2-3.5 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It often occurs together with Juniperus excelsa, being distinguished from it by its thicker shoots 1.2–2 mm diameter (0.7-1.3 mm diameter in J. excelsa), and green, rather than grey-green, leaves. The crushed foliage has a strong foetid smell, from which the species gets its name. Juniperus foetidissima, in the Taurus Mountains, Turkey. ==References== * *Adams, R. P. (2004).

Its origins stretched back to 1951, when three independent car clubs met in Kingston, Ontario to found the Canadian Auto Sport Committee. In 1951, inventor, engineer and MG race driver Marshall Smith Green came from Montreal to meet in Kingston with designer Jack Luck. Green asked Luck to design the Club's logo. Logo designed by Jack Luck in 1951 for Marshall Green The name was changed to the Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs in 1958, when Regions across the country were developed. To get permits for International Races, CASC was affiliated with the Royal Automobile Club (RAC plc) of Great Britain until 1967, when it was recognized as a full member by the FIA as Canada's governing body of auto racing. The nation's motoring interests, meanwhile were represented to the FIA by the CASC's roadgoing counterpart, the CAA. During its lifetime, CASC developed strong national series', such as the Canada Class; the original Honda Michelin series, the Players/GM Motorsport Series, and the Rothmans Porsche Cup series'. It also worked closely with its US counterpart, the SCCA, to develop and co-sanction the Can-Am, and Formula Atlantic series'. As Canada's national governing body, CASC sanctioned such major events as the Player's 200 sports car races, the Shell 4000 rally, the 24 Hours of Mosport, and the Canadian Grand Prix, which alternated between Mosport and Circuit Mont-Tremblant. The organization's demise came as a result of a boycott by Bernie Ecclestone's FOCA of the Canadian Grand Prix in 1987, as detailed in Terry Lovell's Ecclestone biography, Bernie's Game. CASC's FIA accreditation was revoked at the international body's next General Assembly, and its powers were instilled upon a single associate of Ecclestone's, Bernard Mailloux, until handed over to a new body, ASN Canada FIA, in 1990. Many of CASC's records were handed over to its Ontario Region, which re-affiliated as a territory to the new ASN, while other CASC regions were disbanded and replaced by re-formed territorial organizations. Details of the CASC history can be found in the book The Chequered Past: Sports Car Racing & Rallying in Canada 1951 - 1991 by David A Charters.

It is distinctly characterized by a basket he carries, along with a staff, drinking gourd, and a cape affixed to which is a scallop shell, symbol of a pilgrimage to Saint James. ==History== Devotion to Holy Infant of Atocha originally began as a Marian devotion with a medieval statue of the Madonna and Child in Toledo, Spain. According to Juan Javier Pescador, it originally reflected devotions to three different depictions of the Virgin Mary: Our Lady of Atocha, Our Lady of Antigua, and Our Lady of Pregnancies that later coalesced into Our Lady of Atocha.Pescador, Juan Javier. Crossing Borders with Santo Niño de Atocha, University of New Mexico Press (2009), The image of the Divine Child was detachable, and devout families would often borrow the image of the infant when a woman was about to give birth to her child. In the 13th century, Spain was under Muslim rule. The town of Atocha, now part of Madrid's Arganzuela district, was lost to the Muslims, and many Christians there were taken prisoners as spoils of war. The Christian prisoners were not fed by the jailers, but by family members who brought them food. According to pious legend, the caliph ordered that only children under the age of 12 were permitted to bring food. Conditions became increasingly difficult for those men without small children. The women of Atocha prayed before the statue of Our Lady of Atocha at a nearby parish, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to ask her son Jesus for help. Reports soon began among the people of Atocha that an unknown child under the age of twelve and dressed in pilgrim's clothing had begun to bring food to childless prisoners at night. The women of the town returned to Our Lady of Atocha to thank the Virgin for her intercession and noticed that the shoes worn by the Infant Jesus were tattered and dusty. They replaced the shoes of the Infant Jesus, but these became worn again. The people of Atocha took this as a sign that it was the Infant Jesus who went out every night to help those in need. ==Description== The Holy Child of Atocha is depicted dressed as a boy pilgrim dressed in a brown cloak with a white lace collar over a blue robe. He wears a brimmed hat with a plume and carries a basket full of bread in one hand and a pilgrim's staff in the other. The pilgrim's staff is often depicted with a water gourd fastened to it. On the cloak he wears a Shell of Saint James, the symbol of the pilgrims to the Shrine of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. The Child is said to roam the hills and valleys, particularly at night, bringing aid and comfort to the needy, and thereby wearing out his shoes. He is usually shown seated. ==Devotion beyond Atocha== The Moorish conflict extended well beyond the town of Atocha. During dire points in their journey, travelers reported that a young boy, dressed as a pilgrim, would come to them bringing food and other necessities. The boy would often travel with them until they were out of danger and then guide them to the safest roads to reach their destination. Pious legends continued to be developed and the miraculous Child later became considered to be the Child Jesus and was given the title the Holy Child of Atocha. ===Mexico and New Mexico=== There are two primary shrines to Niño de Atocha: at Fresnillo and Plateros in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico, and at Chimayo, New Mexico, USA.Zavaleta, Antonio Noe. \\"Santo Niño de Atocha\\", Celebrating Latino Folklore, (Maria Herrera-Sobek ed.) Vol. 3, p. 1027, ABC-CLIO, 2012 The original Mexican Niño de Atocha was installed in the church of Saint Augustine along with the silver Christ in 1554 not long after a silver strike in Plateros. In those years silver was discovered in Fresnillo and mines were being opened in the mountains near the settlement. Within a few weeks of the opening of the mine of Fresnillo, there was an explosion and many miners were trapped. The wives of the miners went to the church of St. Augustine to pray for their husbands and noticed that the child on the image of Our Lady of Atocha was missing. At the same time, it was said that a child came to the trapped miners, gave them water and showed them the way out of the mine. Whenever there was a problem at the mine the child helped the miners in need. Each time this happened, the image of the child on the Virgin's arms was found to be dirty and his clothes had little holes in them. After that, the Holy Child was taken off his mother's arms and put on a glass box for everyone to see. The Holy Child of Atocha has become a symbol of Zacatecas and the protector of miners. Many make pilgrimages to Plateros at Christmas to bring toys to the Holy Child. ===The Philippines=== Holy Infant of Atocha is also popular among the Filipino Catholics. The local variant, simply known as Santo Niño (Holy Child), is portrayed very similarly to the Spanish Atocha, except that it is always standing rather than sitting. He bears a staff with an attached bag or basket, which is usually filled with coins or candy, and he dons a pilgrim hat resembling the Atocha image. The current Santo Niño found in many Filipino homes is traditionally dressed in either green or red garments. In Filipino Folk Catholicism, red garments are suited for images enshrined at home, while green ones are for those enshrined in business establishments; a common offering to the latter is a bowl filled with coins and sweets. In addition, many Filipinos customarily dress the Santo Niño in modern attire that reflects their professional roles, such as nurses, doctors, janitors, teachers, and policemen, as a means of asking for his patronage. These customs relating to dress are also applied to replicas of the Santo Niño de Cebu, brought by Ferdinand Magellan to the islands in 1521, and the Infant Jesus of Prague. ==Pop culture and other references== In the film Napoleon Dynamite, Pedro suggests placing santos around the hallways of his high school, recommending El Santo Niño de Atocha. He says that his Aunt Concha has seen him. Holy Infant of Atocha is sometimes associated with the Yoruba orisha Eshu, or Elegua. This holy infant appears in the 1991 novel Mojo and the Pickle Jar, by Douglas Bell. In Michael Jackson's video for \\"Beat It\\", there is a picture of the Santo Niño above his bed. On the television sitcom George Lopez, the Holy Infant of Atocha is displayed in the family's kitchen. The Colombian television historical drama Escobar, el Patrón del Mal features references to the Holy Infant of Atocha. The saint is a particular favorite of Pablo Escobar's mother, Emilia Hermilda Gaviria. She displays a very large portrait of the saint (same as the image above) in her foyer and invokes him in verbal blessings upon her loved ones. ==See also== *Infant Jesus of Prague *Divine Infant Jesus *Holy Umbilical Cord *Infancy Gospels *Holy Infant of Good Health ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Pescador, Juan Javier.

It was released in 1998-1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others, helping add to the authenticity of the game. The game is unrelated to Sega's Monaco GP series. The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 1950s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks. ==Reception== The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms except the Dreamcast version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. PC Gamer gave the PC version universal acclaim, months before its U.S. release. An unnamed reviewer of Next Generation said of the N64 version in its July 1999 issue, \\"With 16 tracks, 22 cars onscreen at the same time, two-player split-screen racing, excellent graphics, detailed physics, and great gameplay, it's a hard title to stop playing.\\" Four issues later, however, Chris Carla of the same magazine (now labeled NextGen) said of the Dreamcast version, \\"If you've got a Dreamcast and [you] want GP racing, this isn't bad, but we'd much rather play Ubi's Speed Devils instead.\\" In Japan, where the same Dreamcast version was ported for release on March 11, 1999, followed by the PlayStation version on September 30, Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40 for the former, and 26 out of 40 for the latter. Pete Wilton of Official UK PlayStation Magazine gave the PlayStation version seven out of ten, saying, \\"Despite minor annoyances (where's the commentary?) and unrealistic arcade looks, Monaco GP is certainly better than the disappointing F1 '98. The trouble is, some 18 months on, it still can't best F1 '97. It seems like the racing leegends of yesteryear still take some beating.\\" Edge gave the PC version a score of seven out of ten in its December 1998 issue, saying that despite the issues, the game \\"proves one of the most comptent and technical recreations of modern F1 currently available.\\" Seven issues later, however, the same magazine gave the Japanese Dreamcast import six out of ten, calling it \\"a proficient, F1 simulation title with a respectable set of handling dynamics. It's just that things have moved on a little since its original appearance six months ago, and this version is therefore unable to match its predecessor's impact. Some genuine enhancements -- rather than a seemingly straightforward port -- would have been welcome.\\" AllGame gave the Dreamcast, PC and PlayStation versions each three stars out of five, with Brad Cook saying of the Dreamcast version, \\"I have to give this game a higher rating than I thought I would simply because I know it will appeal to its intended audience. Just stay away if you want Arcade-style action\\"; Michael L. House saying that the PC version \\"crosses the finish line in fairly good shape. I'm a firm believer that all games don't necessarily have to fit exclusively in a restrictive \\"either/or\\" category but can fill niches in a sliding scale of desirability. Just as those gamers who do themselves an injustice by adamantly shouting there is only one viable golf simulation because of a strict, narrow mindset, so to[o] will racing fans unwilling to experience alternatives in the Formula 1 racing genre\\"; and Jonathan Sutyak saying of the PlayStation version, \\"While Monaco Grand Prix more than passes from a technical standpoint, there are a few things excluded that keep it from being a classic.\\" Jes Bickham of N64 Magazine gave the N64 version 87% in his early review, calling it \\"a rattlingly good game.\\" Cam Shea of Hyper gave it 83% in his early review, calling it \\"a semi-sim that would make a good introduction for F1 fans intimidated by steep learning curves.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and Nintendo Power gave the European version average reviews, months before its U.S. release date. The PC version was a runner-up for Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1999 \\"Racing Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Dirt Track Racing.

The Opisthothelae are sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, the Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. The fairly recent creation of this taxon has been justified by the requirement to distinguish these spiders from the Mesothelae, which display many more primitive characteristics. Those that distinguish between the Mesothelae and Opisthothelae are: * The tergite plates on the abdomen of Mesothelae but absent in Opisthothelae * The almost total absence of ganglia in the abdomen of Opisthothelae * The almost median position of the spinnerets in the Mesothelae compared with the hindmost position of those of the Opistothelae Among the Opisthothelae, the fangs of the Mygalomorphae point straight down in front of the mouth aperture and only allow the spider to grasp its prey from above and below, whereas in the Araneomorphae, they face one another like pincers, allowing a firmer grip. Lampshade spiders (family Hypochilidae) show some characteristics of Araneomorphae despite being mygalomorphs and have fangs that can move diagonally. Distinguishing araneomorphs and mygalomorphs on first inspection is difficult unless the specimens are large enough to permit immediate examination of the fangs, although their differences in behavior can provide help for identification in the wild. ==References== Category:Arthropod suborders Category:Spiders ","title":"Opisthothelae"},{"id":"6214452","text":"Mark Francis Barham (born 12 July 1962) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right-winger.

The group's origins lie within an arachnid sub-group defined by the presence of book lungs (the tretrapulmonates); the arachnids as a whole evolved from aquatic chelicerate ancestors. More than 45,000 extant species have been described, organised taxonomically in 3,958 genera and 114 families. There may be more than 120,000 species. Fossil diversity rates make up a larger proportion than extant diversity would suggest with 1,593 arachnid species described out of 1,952 recognized chelicerates. Both extant and fossil species are described yearly by researchers in the field (see External links for most recent list of fossil species). Major developments in spider evolution include the development of spinnerets and silk secretion. ==Early spider-like arachnids== Among the oldest known land arthropods are Trigonotarbids, members of an extinct order of spider-like arachnids. Trigonotarbids share many superficial characteristics with spiders, including a terrestrial lifestyle, respiration through book lungs, and walking on eight legs, with a pair of leg-like pedipalps near the mouth and mouth parts. They lacked the ability to spin silk: there is no evidence for either spigots or spinnerets within the group. An unpublished fossil exists which has distinct microtubercles on its hind legs, akin to those used by spiders to direct and manipulate their silk, but given the lack of any structures associated silk production, it seems unlikely the structures were associated with silk. Trigonotarbids are not true spiders, and the trigonotarbids have no living descendants. ==Emergence of true spiders== Geratonephila attacking Cascoscelio incassus preserved in amber, c. At one stage the oldest fossil spider was believed to be Attercopus which lived during the Devonian. Attercopus was placed as the sister-taxon to all living spiders, but has now been reinterpreted as a member of a separate, extinct order Uraraneida which could produce silk, but did not have true spinnerets. A number of recent discoveries have also demonstrated that taxa existed until the Cretaceous that had both spinnerets, and a whip-like telson. The oldest true spiders date to the Carboniferous age, or about 300 million years ago. Most of these early segmented fossil spiders from the Coal Measures of Europe and North America probably belonged to the Mesothelae, or something very similar, a group of spiders with the spinnerets placed underneath the middle of the abdomen, rather than at the end as in modern spiders. They were probably ground-dwelling predators, living in the giant clubmoss and fern forests of the mid-late Palaeozoic, where they were presumably predators of other primitive arthropods. Silk may have been used simply as a protective covering for the eggs, a lining for a retreat hole, and later perhaps for simple ground sheet web and trapdoor construction. They co-existed with a range of spider-like forms which had some, but not all, the characters associated with the true spiders. As plant and insect life diversified so also did the spider's use of silk. Spiders with spinnerets at the end of the abdomen (Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae) appeared more than 250 million years ago, presumably promoting the development of more elaborate sheet and maze webs for prey capture both on ground and foliage, as well as the development of the safety dragline. The oldest mygalomorph, Rosamygale, was described from the Triassic of France and belongs to the modern family Hexathelidae. Megarachne servinei from the Permo-Carboniferous was once thought to be a giant mygalomorph spider and, with its body length of 1 foot (34 cm) and leg span of above 20 inches (50 cm), the largest known spider ever to have lived on Earth, but subsequent examination by an expert revealed that it was actually a relatively small sea scorpion. By the Jurassic, the sophisticated aerial webs of the orb-weaver spiders had already developed to take advantage of the rapidly diversifying groups of insects. A spider web preserved in amber, thought to be 110 million years old, shows evidence of a perfect \\"orb\\" web, the most famous, circular kind one thinks of when imagining spider webs. An examination of the drift of those genes thought to be used to produce the web-spinning behavior suggests that orb spinning was in an advanced state as many as 136 million years ago. One of these, the araneid Mongolarachne jurassica, from about , recorded from Daohuogo, Inner Mongolia in China, is the largest known fossil of a spider. The 110-million-year-old amber-preserved web is also the oldest to show trapped insects, containing a beetle, a mite, a wasp's leg, and a fly. The ability to weave orb webs is thought to have been \\"lost\\", and sometimes even re-evolved or evolved separately, in different breeds of spiders since its first appearance. ==See also== * Spider taxonomy * Insect evolution ==References== * * * ==External links== * Picture of spider fossil * Dunlop, J.

It is situated approximately west of Leyburn. The village population was 120 at the 2001 census, increasing to 170 by the 2011 census. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Thorfinn, but the tenant-in-chief being Count Alan of Bedale. The name of the village derives form a mixture of Old English and Old Norse and was originally prēost tūn sker, which translates as Priests farm (or settlement) under rock (or cliff). The village used to be in the Wapentake of Hang West and in the parish of Wensley. Traditionally, worship was undertaken at the church in Wensley as there was no church in the village save for a small Methodist chapel, but the village does have a small \\"mission room\\" (St Margarets Church) that was constructed in 1862 and is now a grade II listed building. However, services are only held twice-monthly. The Wensleydale Railway passes just to the south of the village. Previously, the village and that of neighbouring Wensley were served by railway station on the line and whilst the line has been re-opened as a heritage railway, the station is in private hands and has not been opened up to passengers. The village is mostly contained in a conservation area that was designated in 1989. It is just outside of the Yorkshire Dales National Park due to quarrying and a military firing range which lie just to the north of the village. Besides quarrying (which is still ongoing in the modern era) the area was also known for its iron ore and lead industries. These were documented as far back as the early 14th century though may have been explored earlier. There are remains of the old lead mining industry in the nearby Condenser Wood. Some of the old lead processing buildings are still standing and are now listed buildings, including the peat store that would house a years' worth of peat to be used in smelting lead. Various chimneys were built to vent the fumes from the smelting process, but these were quite low in the valley and would cling to the surroundings rather than disperse. Because of this, a flue was constructed that extended for in a northerly direction and fed into a chimney at Cobscar Mill above Preston- under-Scar at above sea level. ==References Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire Category:Wensleydale ","title":"Preston-under-Scar"},{"id":"6214468","text":"Paul Cadieux is a Canadian film and television producer.

In the US, it is promoted by more than 15 commercial programs as well as several private schools for students with disabilities. == Orton and Gillingham == Samuel Torrey Orton (1879-1948), a neuropsychiatrist and pathologist at Columbia University, studied children with language processing difficulties such as dyslexia. Together with educator and psychologist Anna Gillingham (1878-1963), he created techniques to teach reading that integrate kinesthetic (movement- based) and tactile (sensory-based) learning strategies with teaching of visual and auditory concepts. In 1935, Gillingham, with her longtime collaborator Bessie Stillman, published the Gillingham–Stillman manual, Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. This is now known as the Orton–Gillingham (O-G) method, \\"a multisensory phonics technique for remedial reading instruction.\\" ==Implementation== The Institute of Education Sciences (the independent, non-partisan statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education), describes the approach as follows: \\"Orton-Gillingham is a broad, multisensory approach to teaching reading and spelling that can be modified for individual or group instruction at all reading levels. Teaching sessions are action oriented with auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements reinforcing one another. The approach targets persons with the kinds of language processing problems (reading, spelling, and writing) associated with dyslexia.\\" According to Rose and Zirkel, O-G programs typically \\"use a multisensory approach to teach basic concepts of spelling, writing, and reading and continually build upon mastered skills.\\" Variants of O-G \\"have taken the form of more than 15 commercial programs and several private schools for students with disabilities.\\" == Research on its efficacy == In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, \\"Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction.\\" The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton- Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques. An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from classroom use of OG methods with first graders, and use in special education or resource room settings with older children with learning disabilities. According to a review of the literature in 2008, its efficacy is yet to be established. In July 2010, a US Department of Education agency reported that it could not find any studies meeting its evidence standards to support the efficacy of Orton-Gillingham based strategies. == References == Category:Phonics curricula Category:Special education Category:Learning disabilities Category:Learning to read Category:Reading (process) ","title":"Orton-Gillingham"},{"id":"6214484","text":"Malkhaz Akishbaia (Abkhaz: Малхас Акшба, Georgian: მალხაზ აკიშბაია; born May 6, 1972) is an Abkhaz politician and the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the de jure Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia (GARA) from March 2006 to June 2009.

Now, she has come back to London to be a part of her sister Shirani's (Ameesha Patel) marriage, to the New York-based, Gujarati businessman Kunal Shah (Suniel Shetty), who is also Danny's best friend. In a plan to get back to Danny and to make him jealous, Anu convinces her colleague Aman (Akshaye Khanna), to accompany her to the wedding as her new beau. Incidentally, Shirani was also involved with Danny earlier, which resulted in heartbreak for her too, as everyone learns of Danny's womanizing ways. Arjun Khanna (Anupam Kher) is the father of Shirani. Betty (Lilette Dubey), Anu's mother, married Arjun after her first husband died when Anu was little. As time passes by, Aman finds Anu fascinating and later it develops into a fondness between the two. How Anu and Aman's relationship undergoes a change during the course of these incidents forms the crux of the story. It turns out that Danny had used Kunal to get to Shirani and he believes that they can still be together. Shirani keeps trying to tell Danny that she loves Kunal. Anu reacts with Aman in an unfriendly way but later they form a friendship that in time turns into love. When Anu finds out about Danny's relationship with Shirani, she breaks down knowing that everyone knew (even Aman) but didn't tell her. She tells Aman to go away but Kunal (who thinks of Aman as a friend) convinces him to stay for his sake (Aap ki khatir). The truth is revealed to everyone and then they believe that Anu loves Aman. Anu's parents convince her to go after Aman but she is too late as he has already left. When Shirani tells Kunal about Danny, he is heartbroken and chases Danny away. While chasing Danny, he finds Aman going away and he convinces Aman to ask Anu again for her love. He agrees and makes Kunal realize that he and Shirani are also meant to be together and to marry Shirani.

He kidnapped Julie Dart in July 1991 and later murdered her after she tried to escape. He subsequently kidnapped Stephanie Slater in January 1992, eventually releasing her after payment of a ransom. According to Slater, she was raped during her imprisonment, but Sams has denied this. After Sams was convicted and imprisoned he attacked a female probation officer. He also became notorious for his attempts to sue the prison, initially successfully, for losing his artificial leg, and then because his bed was too hard. ==Life== Michael Sams was born and grew up in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire.\\"The Michael Sams trial: train spotters obsession left chain of clues\\", The Independent He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of 20. After three years he returned to Keighley and worked as a lift engineer, graduating to become a central heating engineer, later setting up his own company.Kirby, Terry, \\"The Michael Sams Trial: Train spotter's obsession left chain of clues\\", The Independent, 9 July 1993. However, Sams turned to crime and was first imprisoned in 1976 for stealing a car and making a false insurance claim. While in prison, Sams was diagnosed with a cancer that led to the amputation of one of his legs. After his release, Sams was forced to sell his ailing business and took a job for Black & Decker. He later started a new business in the 1980s, selling power tools. Sams was married three times.\\"Police recall 'nasty piece of work' with the constant smile. Outwardly quiet and easy-going Michael Sams disguised his darker side\\", The Herald Scotland, 9 July 1993. He had two sons by his first wife, but the marriage broke down shortly before he was sent to prison. His second marriage also ended in divorce. At the time of his arrest for the kidnappings he lived in Sutton on Trent, Nottinghamshire with his third wife. ===Kidnappings=== Julie Dart On 9 July 1991, Sams drove to a local red light area and picked up a sex worker named Julie Dart, an 18-year-old Leeds resident.Richard Whittington-Egan, Molly Whittington-Egan, Murder on File, Neil Wilson Publishing, 2013. She was blindfolded and taken to Sams' warehouse, where she was placed in a coffin-like box and chained to the floor. According to Sams' later confession, Dart smashed her way out of the box in an attempt to escape, but she was unable to get out of the room. Sams, who had wired an alarm to the box, returned to chain her to a roof beam. The following day, Sams forced Dart to write a letter to her boyfriend demanding a ransom of £140,000, or \\"the hostage would never be seen again\\". He also made her write other notes. After the notes were written, Sams murdered Dart with a hammer.Newton, Michael, The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers, Infobase Publishing, 2006, p.275. Nine days later he dumped her body in a field in Easton, Lincolnshire. Since it was never likely that Dart's ransom would be paid, it has been suggested that Sams always intended to kill her. Paul Britton, a clinical psychologist who advised the detectives who interviewed Sams, argues that he abducted a prostitute because it would be relatively easy and was good \\"practice\\". It would also not create too much of \\"a stir\\". By killing Dart and leaving her body where it would easily be found, Sams would \\"convince the police that he was to be regarded as a serious adversary\\" and intimidate his next victims into paying up.Britton, Paul, Picking up the Pieces, Random House, 2013, p.396.Kinnell, H., Violence and Sex Work in Britain, Routledge, 11 January 2013, p.194. McGredy-Hunt, however, notes that Sams continued to demand ransom for several days after Dart's death, only dumping her body (initially hidden in a wheelie bin) after the smell became difficult to conceal. Sams continued to send messages to the police. One stated: \\"prostitutes are easy to pick up, and I won't spend any more time in prison for killing two instead of one.\\" He later claimed to have kidnapped another prostitute, but police could find no evidence that any had gone missing. Sams also sent messages stating he would intentionally cause a train crash unless he was paid a ransom. He also attempted to blackmail supermarkets by threatening to poison food.Duncan Maclaughlin, William Hall, The Filth: The Explosive Inside Story of Scotland Yard's Top Undercover Cop, Random House, 2012, p.236. Stephanie Slater Some months later, on 22 January 1992, Sams kidnapped again. Using a false name, he arranged to meet Stephanie Slater, an estate agent, ostensibly to view a property in Turnberry Road, Great Barr, Birmingham. At the property he attacked Slater, tied her up, and then took her to his workshop. Sams again demanded a ransom, this time from Slater's manager at the estate agency. When it was paid, Sams released Slater.This is Bradford Given his previous crime, police had expected the kidnapper to kill Slater. They hoped to stop him by following him after he picked up the ransom, but Sams had anticipated this, and devised an elaborate scheme to successfully give them the slip. Interviewed in 2013 on BBC Radio 4's One to One programme, Slater said that for eight days she was held handcuffed, legs bound, blindfolded and gagged in a \\"coffin\\" inside a wheelie bin laid horizontally. Sams had told her she would be electrocuted if she tried to move. Slater said that when she was allowed out of the coffin for food, she chatted about herself to Sams, \\"to humanise\\" herself and to increase her chances of survival. Within twelve hours of her release, she was made to face a press conference, even though she was still drugged and highly distressed. Police later acknowledged that this was an error of judgement.BBC Radio 4, \\"One to One\\", 10 September 2013. On the BBC television programme Crimewatch, the police made public a tape recording of the kidnapper's voice, which was recognised by Sams' first wife. Sams was arrested, and forensic evidence was gathered of his responsibility for Dart's murder. He was convicted in July 1993 and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Dart and the abduction of Slater.Tingle, Len. Yorkshire and Lincolnshire: The Price of Justice?, BBC News, 6 November 2003. Accessed 4 June 2008 Upon being positively identified by Slater, Sams admitted the kidnapping, but denied the murder charge in court. He confessed to the murder in prison three days after he was found guilty. Out of the £175,000 ransom that was paid for the release of Slater, Police located £150,000 buried in a field by using Ground-Penetrating Radar. The remaining £25,000 was never recovered. Following her release, Slater felt unable to return to work as an estate agent, and moved to the Isle of Wight in 1993. She subsequently worked with police forces to advise them on how to deal with kidnap survivors, and with the survivors themselves, to help them to recover from their ordeals. She died on 31 August 2017, aged 50, from cancer. ===Imprisonment=== Sams continued to offend after he was imprisoned, attacking a female probation officer with a metal spike. He received an addition of eight years to his term for this act. Sams was awarded £4,000 damages when the prison service lost his artificial leg during a transfer. The award caused considerable public outrage. He also brought a civil case because he believed that his prison bed was too hard. A further complaint was that he was unfairly held in solitary confinement leading to a loss of earnings, and that works of art he had painted in prison had gone missing.Keely, Alistair, \\"Luff Challenges Murderer's Right to Take Legal Action Behind Bars\\", The Birmingham Post, 2000, p.3. He made the news again in April 2007 when, in a letter to Inside Time, a newspaper for prisoners, he claimed that \\"OAPs in prison are far better off than those in the community.\\" Sams remains in prison, having served 28 years of his life sentence. No recommended minimum term was reported at his trial, and it is unknown whether any Home Secretary or High Court judge subsequently ruled how many years Sams must serve before he can be considered for parole. Now aged , he is among the oldest and long-serving life sentence prisoners in England and Wales. ==Other allegations== In her 1995 book about her ordeal, Beyond Fear: My Will to Survive, Slater wrote that Sams raped her on the first night of her imprisonment. After her release, Slater had denied that she had been raped. She later said that this was to spare her mother, who had a heart condition, from unnecessary further anguish.BBC Radio 4, \\"One to One: Carolyn Quinn speaks to Stephanie Slater\\", 10 September 2013. Online Sams denied raping Slater, asserting, \\"I cannot allow this to go unchallenged\\". He made the unsubstantiated claim that they had a consensual affair. Sams attempted to sue Slater for libel,\\"Kidnapper Sams sues victim for libel: Briefly\\", The Independent, 29 January 1995. but lost the case.\\"Detectives eventually got on right track to catch Sams\\", Birmingham Mail, 20 April 2011. Crime writer Christopher Berry-Dee, in Unmasking Mr Kipper: Who Really Killed Suzy Lamplugh?, has put forth the case that Sams killed estate agent Suzy Lamplugh in 1986, but this has been dismissed by police. ==Dramatisation== In 1993 the kidnapping of Slater and subsequent manhunt for Sams was the subject of an edition of the BBC1 series Crimewatch File, titled \\"A Murderer's Game\\", which reconstructed some of the events. A dramatisation of Slater's book, Beyond Fear (1997), was broadcast on the opening night of the new Channel 5. Adapted by Don Shaw, it was directed by Jill Green, with Gina McKee as Slater and Sylvester McCoy as Sams. ==References External links == * Thrown in at the deep end – post about the role of a Family Liaison Officer in the Slater case, by the West Midlands Police Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century English criminals Category:British people convicted of kidnapping Category:British people convicted of theft Category:English amputees Category:English people convicted of murder Category:English prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Cancer survivors Category:Extortionists Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by England and Wales Category:Criminals from Yorkshire Category:People from Keighley Category:People from Sutton-on-Trent ","title":"Michael Sams"},{"id":"6214508","text":"ATVI may refer to: * Activision Blizzard * Afghanistan Technical Vocational Institute ","title":"ATVI"},{"id":"6214522","text":"Efflux may refer to: * Efflux (microbiology), a mechanism responsible for moving compounds out of cells * e-flux, a publishing platform and archive == See also == * Efflux time, part of a measure of paint viscosity * Flux (biology), movement of a substance between compartments * Influx (disambiguation) * ","title":"Efflux"},{"id":"6214524","text":"APCCAndhra Pradesh Content Corporation * APC by Schneider Electric, an American manufacturer * American Potash and Chemical Company, American chemical manufacturer * APEC Climate Center, the Climate Centre for the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation * Asian and Pacific Coconut Community, an intergovernmental organization of coconut producing nations known as APCC * Asia Pop Comic Convention, an annual comic book fan convention in Metro Manila, Philippines ","title":"APCC"},{"id":"6214537","text":"Apis nigrocincta is a species of honey bee that inhabits the Philippine island of Mindanao as well as the Indonesian islands of Sangihe and Sulawesi. The species is known to have queens with the highest mating frequencies of any species of the tribe Apini. It is a middle-sized species of the tribe Apini, compared to the larger A. dorsata or smaller A. florea. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Apis nigrocincta is part of subfamily Apinae within the Hymenopteran family Apidae. Apidae is the largest family of bees consisting of over 5,600 species, with the only bees that are colonized by humans for honey production. The subfamily Apinae includes a majority of the honey bee species, with 19 tribes; A. nigrocincta is part of Apini. Unlike the stingless honeybees of genus Meliponini, A. nigrocincta is part of the genus Apis of true honeybees. The genus Apis is split into three major lineages – dwarf, giant, and cavity-nesting honeybees. Apis nigrocincta is a cavity-nesting species and is most related to Apis cerana, Apis koschevnikovi, and Apis cerana nuluensis. ==Description and appearance== The bees have a hind wing length ranging anywhere from 5.5 mm to 5.9 mm, and a hind wing width within the range of 1.35 mm to 1.5 mm. The bees have rust-colored scapes, legs, and cylpeuses, with reddish-tan hair color that covers most of the body. A. nigrocincta has a proboscis characteristic to those of the tribe Apis. The proboscis is characterized by a tube around the glossa formed by the flat galae and basal segments of the labial palpi. Liquids are brought to the mouth through the tube by a back and forth movement of the glossa, capillary action, and suction through the mouth. The proboscis is stored in a large groove on the underside of the head, known as the proboscidial fossa, when not in use. Pollen is carried by scopal hairs on the underside of the abdomen or on the hind legs. Teeth and carinae are not present in the mandibles of workers. In females, the claws are cleft and ariola are present. The hind tibia and flabellum are similar to the tribe Bombus. ===Reproductive structure and function=== In queens, the ovariole count can range from 150 to 180 per ovary, and that number is much smaller in workers, although variable. In males, the genitalia are greatly reduced compared to other Hymenoptera, but replaced by ornate endophalluses. Within the species of Apis, there is very little differentiation in male genitalia of Apis. However, there is a striking variance in male endophalli for A. nigrocincta, and an explanation could be due to the female choice hypothesis, in that variability in male structure can be attributed to the fact that females choose their mates. ==Distribution and habitat== There is little known about the biogeography of the species, only that it is found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. A. nigrocincta is suggested to have been derived from China, as it shares similar morphologies with A. cerana from the mainland than with A. cerana from the southwest. It is also stipulated that a proto-nigrocincta may have come from Borneo during the Quaternary glaciation. On southern part of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, most colonies are found above 400 m elevation, unlike its cousin A. cerana, of which most colonies are found below 400 m elevation. However, in areas without A. cerana, A. nigrocincta can be found in low elevation as well. In addition, A. nigrocincta inhabit areas that are more forested or mixed culture areas, in either natural or man made cavities near streams. In central Sulawesi, A. nigrocincta is only found at elevation levels of 550 m or higher. The areas with a higher density of A. nigrocincta have shorter, less defined dry periods but more pronounced wet periods. Finally, where A. cerana and A. nigrocincta coexist, competition will influence the location of either species. ===Nest structure=== A. nigrocincta is a medium-sized cavity-nesting species. Colonies are “permanent” and new colonies are formed by fission. Multiple combs are found in dark cavities such as hollows of trunks of live or dead trees, underneath roofs, water jars, and caves. Combs are also built with multiple attachment sites so that the contents of the nest are spread out over several points of contact. These nesting sites are close to the ground, usually 4–5 m in distance. Multiple combs are built in a pattern in which there is a uniform distance, known as the bee space, between each comb. There are two types of combs in a brood: smaller ones for workers and larger ones for drones, with worker cells averaging around 4.5 mm. Queen cells can be found on the lower edges of the combs, while honey is stored in the upper as well as the outer part of the combs. ==Colony cycle== Little has been observed concerning the colony cycle of A. nigrocincta. Colony reproduction occurs when an old queen bee leaves the nest with a large number of worker bees after communicating with a dancing scout. These dances will indicate final destinations that range anywhere from 140 to 1,920 m, although scouts will travel anywhere from 75 to 2,340 m, distance much further than A. cerana. A rapid expansion of the nest will occur, and brood rearing will occur. ==Kin selection Queen === A colony will have anywhere from 7 to 15 queens per colony. Virgin queens that emerge from the queen cells of A. nigrocincta will be accepted by other species, but A. nigrocincta will not accept alien queens when queens of the same species are present, although there is no evidence that alien queens mate with A. nigrocincta drones. When a mother queen leaves the nest in a prime swarm, the first emerged queen will start “piping” by pressing her thorax on the surface of the comb and vibrating, causing a piping sound. Her fully developed sisters will also vibrate their thoraxes, creating a “tooting” sound. As long as these sounds continue, the younger queens will remain in their cells. Only after the next swarm will the next queen emerge and start the cycle of “piping” and “tooting.” If there are not enough workers to form a swarm, young queens will fight to the death until there is only one queen left. ==Behavior Migration === Similar to virtually all other Asian honeybee species, A. nigrocincta will abandon a nest to start a new one through migration and absconding. Due to the tropical climate of Southeast Asia, conditions for migration and absconding are possible year round, though predation pressure is severe in many areas. Colonies will leave due to disastrous events of nature or situations where abandonment is necessary, or due reduced resources. In addition, one can predict colony migrations due to seasonal declines in pollen or extreme temperature. ===Waggle dance=== The waggle dance of A. nigrocincta shares similarities with waggle dances of other cavity-nesting Asian honeybees. The dance will be performed on a vertical plane in an enclosed nest cavity near the entrance in the darkness of the cavity. During the straight portion of the dance, the location of a resource based on its position relative to the sun, while during the angle portion, the angle relative to the vertical represents the angle of the food source relative to the sun. The dance tempo is slower than that of A. cerana. ===Mating=== Drones will congregate to specific sites known as drone congregation areas, and queens will mate at these sites when she is out on her mating flight. When a queen encounters a drone, she can choose to exercise choice of mates before mating, although there is currently no evidence of this preferential treatment. A drone will then hold on to a queen and turn his endophallus inside out into the opened sting chamber of the queen. This then will paralyze him, and the distal part of his genitalia will break off the sting chamber will be filled with sperm. The queen will then return from her mating sight with a mating sign that protrudes from the sting chamber Mating frequency A. nigrocincta queens mate with a relatively high number of males compared to queens of other bee species, with observed numbers of different matings ranging from 42 to 69 drones per queen. The mating frequency is the highest documented for honeybees, aside from Apis dorsata, Apis laboriosa, and Apis cerana nuluensis, the only Apis species that do not have documented paternity frequencies. Similar to other Apis species, A. nigrocincta have monogynous colonies with queens mating with a large number of males. ===Defense=== The primary measure of defense for A. nigrocincta is to live in cavities, as the cavities restrict accessibility of resources to a predator, but allow possession of valuable and limited resources to the bees themselves. Entrances to these cavities are guarded and check incoming traffic for any intruders. Another act of defense is “body shaking,” a violent and pendulum like swaying of the abdomen, performed by worker bees to discourage any insects, especially wasps, from invading the nest. ==Differences between A. cerana and A. nigrocincta== A. nigrocincta has been mistaken for the species A. cerana, as the two species live in similar areas and can be confused for each other in their behavior and to a certain extent, appearance. In areas where A. cerana and A. nigrocincta live together, they can most immediately be distinguished by their coloration and size: A. cerana tends to be darker and smaller, while A. nigrocincta tends to be larger and have a yellowish clypeus (the lower area of the face). They can best be differentiated using morphometrics, which can also be used to identify morphologically distinct populations in both species. The architecture of the colonies is also a point of difference: the opening of the drone cell of A. cerana is covered in wax, under which there is a conical cocoon with a central hole or pore. In A. nigrocincta, however, the cell of the drone has a narrow opening, without a hard wax cap and hole. In addition, the queens of A. nigrocincta generally create colonies with greater numbers of drones than those of A. cerana.'' The species builds nests in cavities like the closely related Apis cerana. In fact, there are few substantial differences between the two species: the genitals of the respective drones, for instance, are identical. However, there are small morphological differences, genetic polymorphism in the mitochondrial DNA, as well as behavioral differences. A. nigrocincta contracts the parasite-caused honey bee disease varroatosis by playing host to the species of Varroa mite known as Varroa underwoodi. In this way, they are similar to Apis cerana nuluensis, which is also susceptible to the same species of parasite. ==References *Collection of scholarly articles on Apis nigrocincta nigrocincta Category:Hymenoptera of Asia Category:Insects of Indonesia Category:Insects of the Philippines Category:Fauna of Mindanao Category:Insects described in 1861 Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist) ","title":"Apis nigrocincta"},{"id":"6214543","text":"Pardos was the catepan of Italy briefly in 1042 following the short term of George Maniakes. In July 1042, Maniakes was disgraced and recalled by Constantine IX Monomachos at the behest of Romanus Sclerus, brother of the emperor's mistress. According to Johannes Skylitzes, Romanus had even raped Maniakes' wife. In September 1042,The year is given as 1043 by Lupus Protospatharius, but he begins his year in September. Pardo arrived with an army at Otranto to take over command from Maniakes. According to Lupus Protospatharius, he brought a chrysobull, but the meaning of this is uncertain.Chalandon, p. 103 (n8). Pardos was accompanied by Nicholas, Archbishop of Bari, who, though under the jurisdiction of the Roman see, was apparently a Byzantine loyal, and by Tubaki, a protospatharius. It is probable that the archbishop had joined the catepan in a prior landing, during which the Greeks had negotiated with the Lombard rebel leader Argyrus. Subsequently, Argyrus abandoned the Lombard cause for the Greek. Pardos and Tubaki were arrested at Otranto, however, and executed by Maniakes, who was acclaimed emperor by his troops. ==ReferencesSources== *Chalandon, Ferdinand.

The broad-based centre-left government of Prime Minister Juho Kusti Paasikivi (National Coalition/Independent) remained in office after the elections. ==Background== The communists could, for the first time since 1929, freely present their candidates. Through the Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL), they were able to win over a large section of Social Democratic voters. The Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) had been banned by the time of the election. Prime Minister Paasikivi urged in February 1945 Finnish voters to elect \\"new faces\\" to Parliament, which they certainly did: almost half of the 200 deputies were new. Some wartime deputies, including Social Democrat Väinö Tanner and Agrarian Viljami Kalliokoski, decided voluntarily not to seek re-election, because under the new political climate (Finland's desire to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union), their wartime political activities, including their association with the informal Finnish-German military alliance, looked suspicious. The right-wing and centrist parties had to campaign carefully, so as not to appear anti-Soviet, while the Communists could loudly and vigorously accuse the right-wing and centrist parties of accepting their ban from open political activity, which had lasted from 1930 to 1944. One major economic issue in these elections was the continued scarcity of goods caused by the wartime rationing. Communists promised the impoverished voters a quick improvement in their living standards, and also other major parties promised more prosperity in the starting peacetime. These promises were made despite the still limited Finnish foreign trade - World War II would only end in Europe in May and in Asia in September - and the heavy burden which the Soviet Union's war reparations payments imposed on the Finnish economy.Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen, Helsinki: WSOY, 2003Sakari Virkkunen, Finland's Presidents I / Suomen presidentit I, Helsinki: WSOY, 1994Martti Turtola, Risto Ryti: A Life for the Fatherland / Risto Ryti.

It is the fifth part of the cycle for piano four-hands, Ze Šumavy (From the Bohemian Forest) Op. 68, B. 133, composed in 1883. The work is also transcribed by the composer for cello and piano (B. 173) and for cello and orchestra (B. 182). The original piano cycle Op. 68 was composed in 1883 on demand of Fritz Simrock. As it was popular in the late nineteenth century to make arrangements of popular works for other instruments, on 28 December 1891 Dvořák made an arrangement for cello and piano of the fifth piece, for a farewell concert tour he gave with violinist Ferdinand Lachner and cellist Hanuš Wihan in the first months of 1892 before embarking for the New World. The arrangement became so popular that Dvořák made a new arrangement for cello and orchestra on 28 October 1893. The arrangements were first published in the fall of 1894 by Fritz Simrock, who changed the German title given by Dvořák – Die Ruhe (The Silence), a literal translation from the Czech Klid – to Waldesruhe (Silent Woods). Like the other pieces in Op.68, Silent Woods is a lyrical character piece, bearing the tempo marking Lento e molto cantabile for the main, dreamy theme in D major, which is reprised (Lento. Tempo I) after a light intermezzo (Un pochettino più mosso) in C minor. ==Discography== * Yo-Yo Ma, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Seiji Ozawa, Sony CD (1994) and Kultur DVD (2007) ==See also== * List of compositions by Antonín Dvořák ==References== * Pospíšil, Milan.

Dit da jow is a common Chinese liniment used as a folk remedy to supposedly heal external injuries, such as bruises or sore muscles. ==Background== There are several different recipes for Dit da jow, most of which are considered to be a \\"secret formula\\" passed down through oral and written history of traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. Dit da jow is primarily used by martial artists to aid the healing of Dit Da and also iron palm training. Dit da jow is an analgesic liniment traditionally preferred by martial artists. Often a martial arts master blends his own mixture of aromatic herbs such as myrrh and ginseng, which when combined are believed to stimulate circulation, reduce pain and swelling, and improve healing of injuries and wounds. The tradition became known as \\"hit medicine\\". The main supposed healing function of dit da jow, according to traditional Chinese medicine, is to unblock blood stagnation and blood stasis. When one suffers a trauma type injury, qi is blocked in the meridians causing pain and swelling. Dit da jow supposedly opens up this blockage allowing the qi to flow freely allowing the injury to heal. Dit da jow is made from herbs put in a glass or polyethylene terephthalate plastic jar and mixed with an alcohol such as vodka or gin. Centuries ago, Dit da jow was made by combining the herbs in a clay vessel and adding rice wine, then burying the vessel in the ground for months or even years; it was believed that the longer the herbs sat in the alcohol, the stronger the solution became. ==Typical ingredients== The herbs and other ingredients are typically coarse-ground, then steeped in alcohol (vodka or rice wine is common), sometimes with heat, and then aged. ===Traditional ingredients=== Traditional recipes may include: * baji tian (morinda root) * (stemona) * baidou kou (white cardamom) * baihuashe (pit viper) * baiji zi (mustard seed) * (white peony, Paeonia lactiflora) * baizhi (white angelica) * banxia (Pinellia) * (black Atractylodes) * (Aconitum kusnezoffii, a member of the large aconitum genus) * cheqian zi (cooking plantain seed) * chenpi (aged citrus peel) * chenxiang (Aquilaria wood) * chishao (Paeonia lactiflora, red peony) * chuanpo shi (Maclura tricuspidata) * chuanshan long (Dioscorea polystachya, Chinese yam) * chuanwu (Aconitum carmichaelii) * chuanxiong (ligusticum root) * (rhubarb) * danshen (salvia) * danggui (angelica root) * danggui wei (angelica root tail) * digupi (lycium bark) * dingxiang (clove bud) * (angelica pub) * duzhong (eucommia bark) * ezhu (Curcuma zedoaria) * fangfeng (siler root) * fuhai shi (pumice) * fuling (perenniporia) * (raspberry fruit) * fuzi (Aconitum) * gancao (glycyrrhiza uralensis’') * ganjiang (ginger root) * gaoliang jiang (galangal rhizome) * gegen (kudzu root) * gouqi zi (lycium berry) * gusuibu (drynaria) * guileren (trichosanthes seed) * guizhi (cinnamon) * haifeng teng (kadsura stem) * hong hua (carthamus/safflower) * hua jiao (prickly ash pepper or sichuan pepper(?)) * huang bai (phellodendron) * huang qin (skullcap) * ji xue teng (millettia) * jiang huang (turmeric) * jiang xiang (dalbergia rosewood) * jie geng (platycodon) * jing jie (schizonepeta) * kuan jin teng (tinospora cordifolia stem) * li lu (veratrum) * liu huang (sulfur) * liu ji nu (artemisia) * long gu (dragon bone) * lu lu tong (liquidambar fruit) * luo shi teng (star jasmine vine) * ma huang (ephedra) or gui zhi (cinnamon) * menthol * mo yao (myrrh) * mu dan pi (mountain peony) * mu gua (quince fruit) * mu tong (akebia) * mu xiang (Saussurea costus) * niu xi (achyranthes) * pu gong ying (dandelion) * pu huang (cattail pollen) * qian nian jian (homalomena) * qiang huo (notopterygium incisum) * qin jian (gentian root) * qing pi (citrus peel) * rou cong rong (cistanche) * rou gui (cinnamon bark) * ru xiang (frankincense) * san leng (sparganium or bur-reed) * san qi (panax pseudoginseng) * shan zhu yu (cornus berry) * she chuang zi (cnidium seed) * sheng di huang (rehmannia) * shu di huang (cooked Rehmannia root) * song jie (pine branch) * su mu (Caesalpinia sappan) * tao ren (peach kernel) * tian ma (Gastrodia) * tian nan xing (Arisaema) * {{translzhitalic=notubie chong}] ('Eupolyphaga sinensis, dried cockroach) * tu si zi (cuscuta seed) * wei ling xian (clematis root) * wu jia pi (Eleutherococcus) * wu ling zhi (mouse droppings) * wu wei zi (Euodia fruit) * xi xing (wild ginger) * xiang fu (cyperus nut) * xu duan (dipsacus root) * xue jie (dragon's blood) * yan hu suo (Corydalis) * yu jin (turmeric tuber) * ze lan (Lycopus lucidus) * zhang nao (camphor) * zhi ke (bitter orange peel) * zi ran tong (pyrite) * zi su ye (perilla leaf) * zi wan (Callistephus root) ===Westernized recipe ingredients=== Some recipes instead use ingredients more readily available, such as: * Arnica blossoms * Blessed thistle * Cinnamon bark * Comfrey * Ginger root * Goldenseal root * Myrrh * Pseudoginseng * Rhubarb root * Sarsaparilla root * Witch-hazel ==References== Category:Biologically-based therapies Category:Traditional Chinese medicine Category:Drugs in China ","title":"Dit da jow"},{"id":"6214657","text":"Jeffrey B.

The operation began on 15 June 1993. It was suspended on 19 June 1996, and was terminated on 2 October 1996. ==Background== The operation replaced naval blockades Operation Maritime Guard (of NATO; begun by the U.S. in November 1992) and Sharp Fence (of the WEU). It put them under a single chain of command and control (the \\"Adriatic Military Committee\\", over which the NATO and WEU Councils exerted joint control), to address what their respective Councils viewed as wasteful duplication of effort. Some maintain that despite the nominal official joint command and control of the operation, in reality it was NATO staff that ran the operation. ==Purpose== The operation's purpose was, through a blockade on shipments to the former Yugoslavia, to enforce economic sanctions and an arms embargo of weapons and military equipment against the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and rival factions in Croatia and Bosnia.Kathleen M.

At any given time, 22 ships and 8 aircraft were enforcing the blockade, with ships from Standing Naval Force Atlantic and Standing Naval Force Mediterranean establishing a rotating duty. (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S.), and eight maritime patrol aircraft, were involved in searching for and stopping blockade runners. Most contributors to the operation supplied one or two ships. The Turkish Navy, for example, participated with frigates, submarines, and tankers.

Each boarding team was composed of a \\"guard team\\" to board and wrest control of the target ship, and a \\"search team\\", to conduct the search. The ships were authorized to board, inspect, and seize both ships seeking to break the blockade and their cargo. The Combined Task Force 440 was commanded by Admiral Mario Angeli of Italy. It marked the first time since its founding in 1949 that NATO was involved in combat operations. === Jadran Express incident === On 11 March 1994, a combined British and Italian intelligence operation led to the capture of the Maltese merchant ship Jadran Express by the Italian frigate Zeffiro, which forced the freighter into the port of Taranto. The ship had departed from Odessa bound to Venice with a cache of 2,000 tons of Soviet-designed weaponry, valued at U$S 200 million. Manned by Italian marines from the San Marco battalion, the Jadran Express was eventually escorted by Zeffiro to the naval base of La Maddalena, where her cargo was unloaded under heavy security. ===Lido II incident=== alt= The issue of differing views among nations in the coalition as to the use of force authorized by rules of engagement arose in April 1994.Stacey A. Poe, \\"Rules of Engagement: Complexities of Coalition Interaction in Military Operations Other than War\\", Faculty of the Nava War College, February 13, 1995 Faced with the Maltese tanker Lido II making its way towards a Montenegrin port with 45,000 tons of fuel oil, the American cruiser USS Philippine Sea asked the NATO commander (a British Commodore) for guidance, and received authorization to use \\"disabling fire\\" to stop the tanker, if necessary. He received confirmation that he should follow the British commodore's guidance from his own higher authority. Under U.S. Navy standards, \\"disabling fire\\" means firing rounds into the ship's engineering space. The U.S. cruiser was about to pass the order along to the Dutch HNLMS Van Kinsbergen. However, the fact that the Dutch definition of \\"disabling fire\\" involves launching rounds into the bridge of the target ship, with an increased risk of loss of life, became important. The ship was boarded by Dutch Marines inserted by helicopter from HNLMS Van Kinsbergen and eventually stopped without firing a shot on the first of May. Three Yugoslav Navy corvettes challenged the NATO operation and one of them tried to ram the British frigate as it was assisting Van Kinsberger. The corvettes eventually fled following the reaction of the British warship, supported by Italian Tornado aircraft which scrambled from an airbase at Gioia Del Colle. Lido II had to undergo repairs before being diverted to Italy, since the crew had sabotaged the ship's engine room. The leaking was contained by an engineer party from HMS Chatham. Seven Yugoslav stowaways were found on board.\\"NATO and WEU ships encounter Yugoslav Navy while preventing violation of UN embargo\\".

United Nations Naval Peace Operations in the Territorial Sea. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, p. 42, note 81. A similar incident had taken place off Montenegro a year before, on 8 February 1993, when a boarding party from the Italian frigate Espero forcibly seized the Maltese freighter Dimitrakis, which feigned an emergency in order to divert her route to the port of Bar. The merchant was smuggling coal to the Serbs from Romania. ===Statistics=== The \\"NATO and WEU forces challenged more than 73,000 ships, boarded and inspected almost 6,000 at sea, and diverted 1,500 suspect ships to ports for further inspection.\\" Of those, nearly a dozen vessels were found to be blockade runners, some carrying arms in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. NATO officials said no ships were able to run the blockade successfully, and that the maritime blockade had a major effect in preventing escalation of the conflict. ===Suspension=== The blockade was suspended following a UN decision to end the arms embargo, and NATO's Southern Command said that: \\"NATO and WEU ships will no longer challenge, board or divert ships in the Adriatic\\". The Independent warned at the time that \\"In theory, there could now be a massive influx of arms to Bosnia, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), although senior military and diplomatic sources yesterday said that they thought this would be unlikely.\\" ==Applicable UN resolutions== The blockade was conducted in accordance with numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions: UNSCR 713, UNSCR 757, UNSCR 787 UNSCR 820, and UNSCR 943. Resolution 787 authorized participating states to \\"use such measures ... as may be necessary ... to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping ... to insure strict implementation of\\" the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia. Over the course of the operation, the blockade was redefined in accordance with UNSCR 1021 and UNSCR 1022. ==Ships participating== * Belgian Navy: ** ** * Canadian Forces Maritime Command: ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** * Royal Danish Navy: ** HDMS Niels Juel * French Navy: ** Commandant Blaison ** ** ** Quartier Maitre Anquetil * German Navy: ** Emden ** Rheinland-Pfalz ** Niedersachsen * Hellenic Navy: ** ** ** ** * Italian Navy: ** Espero ** Euro ** Fenice ** Libeccio ** Grecale ** Luigi Durand de la Penne ** Lupo ** Zeffiro * Royal Netherlands Navy: ** HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerk ** ** HNLMS Karel Doorman ** HNLMS Abraham van der Hulst ** ** ** HNLMS Pieter Florisz ** HNLMS Van Kinsbergen * Portuguese Navy: ** * Spanish Navy: ** ** ** ** ** * Royal Norwegian Navy: ** * Turkish Navy: ** ** TCG Kocatepe * Royal Navy: ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** * U.S. Navy: ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** \\"Military News\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 6, 1994, retrieved June 8, 2010 ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ==See also== * Yugoslav Wars *Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid ==References * Security Council resolutions * UN Security Council Official Website, including all resolutions * NATO Regional HQ Allied Forces Southern Europe Fact Sheet on Operation Sharp Guard * Update on Operation Sharp Guard, December 1995 * General Framework Agreement * \\"Evolution of the Conflict\\", NATO Handbook, December 18, 2002 *\\"Operation Sharp Guard: the sea embargo of Serbia and Montenegro\\", Barberan, J.

Gaetano Guadagni (16 February 1728 – 11 November 1792) was an Italian mezzo-soprano castrato singer, most famous for singing the role of Orpheus at the premiere of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice in 1762. == Career == Born at Lodi,See Howard, P: Happy birthday, Gaetano Guadagni (Musical Times, September 2007, pp. 93-96) Guadagni joined the cappella of Sant'Antonio in Padua in 1746, but also made his public operatic debut at Venice that year, which did not meet with ecclesiastical approval: he was dismissed from his position in Padua by 1748, and soon after appeared in London as a member of Giovanni Francesco Crosa (\\"Dr Croza\\")'s buffo (comic) company. He does not appear to have had the typical rigorous training that most castrati undertook (see castrato), which may account for his being described by the music historian Charles Burney as a \\"wild and careless singer\\" on his arrival in England. He was rapidly taken up in theatrical and musical circles in the capital, and also acquired a reputation for his sexual activities, as did many castrati. This was reported by Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann dated 23 March 1749: > Delaval, a wild young fellow, kept an Italian woman, called the Tedeschi.the > soprano Caterina Tedeschi He had notice one day that she was actually then > in bed with Guadagni, a handsome young eunuch, who sings in the burlettas. > The injured cavalier takes one of his chairmen and a horsewhip, surprises > the lovers, drags them out of bed, and makes the chairman hold Mars, while > he flogged Venus most unmercifully. After that execution, he takes Guadagni, > who fell on his knees and cried and screamed for mercy – 'No, Sir, said > Delaval, 'I have another sort of punishment for you', and immediately turned > up that part, which in England is accustomed indeed to be flogged too, but > in its own country has a different entertainment – which he accordingly gave > it.Lewis, Wilmarth Sheldon (ed), The Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's > Correspondence, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 1960, Volume 20 (with > Sir Horace Mann, IV), p.41, . Also quoted in Haggerty, George E., Horace > Walpole's Letters. Masculinity and Friendship in the Eighteenth Century, > Lewisburg PA, Bucknell University Press, 2011, p. 121, . For performances in 1750 Handel rewrote three arias in Messiah for him, the first, \\"But who may abide\\", being particularly adapted to a castrato's bravura technique (which he clearly had acquired by this date). Handel had previously set this text as recitative, and then as a comparatively gentle minuet in triple time throughout. Both of these were for bass voice: for Guadagni, as well as transposing the first section up an octave, Handel wrote a new, virtuosic setting of the text \\"For he is like a refiner's fire\\", especially exploiting the singer's fine low notes. Guadagni also took part in revivals of Samson (for which Handel reworked a part originally written for Susannah Cibber), Judas Maccabeus, Belshazzar and Esther. The one role that Guadagni actually created for Handel was Didymus in Theodora. Where Messiah had exploited his virtuosity in rapid passage work, this new role gave him, at the beginning of the aria \\"The raptur'd soul\\", a fine opportunity to display his \\"artful manner of diminishing his voice like the dying notes of an Aeolian harp\\", as Burney described it. The latter also claimed to have helped Guadagni with his English, saying that, \\"during his first residence in London he was more noticed in singing English than Italian\\". In 1755, he was engaged by David Garrick to sing in an English opera The Fairies by Handel's sometime amanuensis, John Christopher Smith, and the famous actor, again according to Burney, \\"took much pleasure in forming him\\". At this time his voice was described by Burney as a \\"full and well-toned countertenor (here meaning that his range matched that of the contemporary English voice of that name; however, the historian was mistaken in his perception that Guadagni's voice changed from alto to soprano in later life).Howard, P: Did Burney blunder? (Musical Times, Vol. 139, No. 1864, Autumn 1998, pp. 29-32) Burney also remarked on unusual details in the manner of Guadagni's performance: \\"attitudes, action and impassioned and exquisite manner of singing the simple and ballad-like air Che farò [in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, see below], acquired his very great and just applause\\". In Italy he had further great success in the years 1756 to 1761, being admired as much for his singing as his acting, though was often in trouble with impresarios: \\"he rarely does his duty\\" was the complaint, probably meaning that he would not curry favour with audiences, neither bowing to acknowledge applause, nor being willing to repeat arias. In his desire thus to maintain dramatic unity, he was an ideal interpreter for the role of Orpheus in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, which he premiered in Vienna on 5 October 1762 . This opera, to a libretto by Calzabigi, marked the start of Gluck's reforms of opera seria, in which the composer moved away from the more usual type of serious Italian opera then current, epitomised by the operas of composers like Vivaldi and Hasse in their settings of the libretti of Metastasio. Guadagni sang in other \\"reform operas\\": Orestes in Traetta's Ifigenia in Tauride (1763), and the title role in another of Gluck's operas, Telemaco (1765). He also continued to sing in Metastasian roles by composers such as Jommelli and Gassmann, and by Gluck himself. By 1767, his expressive, yet inherently simple style was finding much less favour with opera-goers than the more typical florid singing of his contemporaries. In the summer of 1769, he made his last visit to London, and became embroiled in the financial problems involving his impresario, the Honourable George Hobart, manager of the King's Theatre, Haymarket, who also offended the singer by hiring one Zamperina (his then mistress) in preference to Guadagni's own sister. Eventually Guadagni left the company there, and took part in unlicensed performances of Mattia Vento's Artaserse, sponsored by the former singer Theresa Cornelys at her home, Carlisle House, in Soho Square: for these he was fined £50, and threatened with Bridewell Prison, and maybe another whipping. His performances in London in the season of 1770-71 included a pasticcio version of Gluck's Orfeo, with additional music by Johann Christian Bach, Pietro Antonio Guglielmi, and one aria arranged by Guadagni himself. By 1773, the singer had fallen in with the blue-stocking Maria Antonia of Bavaria, Dowager Electress of Saxony, and had followed her to Munich. Here Burney encountered him again, and reports fascinatingly on his ability to sing perfectly in tune: so exact was his intonation in duets with his fellow castrato Venanzio Rauzzini that their singing generated \\"difference tones\\". He sang further settings of the Orpheus story by Antonio Tozzi (1775) and Ferdinando Bertoni (1776), which by no means continued the reformist tendencies of Gluck. == Retirement == Guadagni retired to Padua, where he became something of an institution, renowned for his prodigal generosity: during his career he had amassed a large fortune, and he now built himself a splendid house in the city. Having rejoined the cappella of the church of San Antonio in 1768, he remained a member until his death, at an annual salary of four hundred ducats. For this, as Burney remarked, he was \\"required to attend only at the four principal festivals\\". His last operatic role was Deucalion in Deucalione e Pirra by Antonio Calegari (1781). Lord Mount Edgcumbe heard him in 1784: \\"I had the good fortune to hear a motetto, or anthem, sung by Guadagni … He was now advanced in years … his voice was still full and well toned, and his style appeared to me excellent.\\" Mount Edgcumbe, Lord R: Musical Reminiscences of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe (London, 1834; repr. Da Capo, New York, 1973), pp 34-35 By this time, Guadagni had become fond of singing Orfeo behind the scenes, with the action represented by puppets. Sometime between 1785 and 1787 he suffered a stroke that rendered him incapable of speech, and for some time severely affected his ability to sing. His return to some public notice was an emotional occasion: \\"… at mass, the musico Guadagni came to sing from devotion, and without payment … this was about eight months after his attack, but he also wished to sing; and he sang the versetto \\"Qui tollis peccata mundi\\" in the Gloria to the great admiration of the public, who applauded him.\\" Pigna, F: Memorie, (Padova, Biblioteca Antoniana, ms. 623), c. 246 r == References == * Cattelan, P.: \\"Guadagni, Gaetano\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

However, an older Syriac translation (The Four Gospels in Syriac Transcribed from the Sinaitic Palimpsest [edited by R.L. Bensley, J. Rendel Harris & F.C. Burkitt], Cambridge 1894) has — while using in Matthew iv : 5 (p. 7) the same word as the Peshitta—in Luke iv : 9 (p. 145) the translation qarna, a word whose first meaning is horn, but which also means ‘angle’. There is accordingly a possibility of a second solution, namely, that the Arabic q.r.ya should be read (the emendation would be a very slight one), qurna, which signifies ‘projecting angle’.\\" ===English translations=== * Critique of Christian Origins: a parallel English-Arabic text, edited, translated, and annotated by Gabriel Said Reynolds and Samir Khalil Samir, Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 2010. ==NotesReferences== *Abu Sa'id al- Bayhaqi, Sharh 'Uyun al-Masa'il, MS Leiden, Landberg t15, fol. 1t3v—1t5v, whence Ibn al-Murtada, (al-Mu'tazila, Arnold), 66 ff. *al-khatib al- Baghdadi,qTa'rikh Baghdad, xi, 113 ff. *al-Subki, tabaqat, iii, 114, t19-t0 *Ibn al-Athir, viii, 510-1, ix, 77-8, t35, x, 95 *I.

The stem leaves are arrow-shaped, narrow and toothed. It blooms between May and July, with racemes or spikes of small white flowers that have 4 sepals and 4 longer petals. Later it has round, flat, winged pods with a deep apical notch, measuring across. They contain small brown-black seeds. The common name 'pennycress' is derived from the shape of the seeds looking like an old English penny. Other English common names are: stinkweed, bastard cress, fanweed, field pennycress, frenchweed and mithridate mustard. It belongs to the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Pennycress is an annual, overwintering herb with an unpleasant odor when its leaves are squeezed. It grows up to 40 to 80 cm depending on environmental conditions. White, lavender or pink flowers with four petals develop between five and eight seeds per plant. Numbers of chromosomes is 2x. Pennycress, has flat and circular notched pods and is a common weed throughout much of North America and its native Eurasia. Its seeds have a high oil content and the species has gained interest as a potential feedstock for biofuel production. ==Morphology== Pennycress is planted and germinates in the fall and overwinters as a small rosette. The central stem and upper side stems terminate in erect racemes of small white flowers. Flowers are self-pollinated and produce a penny sized, heart-shaped, flat seed pod with up to 14 seeds. Each dark brown seed is oval-shaped and slightly larger than a camelina seed (Camelina sativa). Pennycress grows as a winter annual across much of the Midwestern US and the world. ==Distribution== It is native to temperate regions of Eurasia, but is a naturalized introduced species throughout temperate North America and therefore has a circumpolar distribution. In the British Isles it is regarded as an archaeophyte (an ancient introduction). In population collections of wild pennycress, it was found in the northern parts of the United States. Pennycress habitats include cropland, fallow fields, areas along roadsides and railroads, gardens plots, weedy meadows, and waste areas. This plant prefers disturbed areas, and its capacity to invade higher quality natural habitats is low. ==Climate requirements== Pennycress grows well in many different climates. It can produce seeds in the northern hemisphere during the winter season. In the US and the Mediterranean its sown commonly in October and can be harvested in May/June. To reach its yield potential a precipitation of about 300mm is needed. Pennycress has a rather low water use efficiency needing 405 liters of water to produce 0,45kg of seeds. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Limited water availability depresses the yield. In general, pennycress is not well adapted for arid environments where natural precipitation is the only source of moisture. ==Ecology== Field pennycress is a weed of cultivated land and wasteland. A study in Germany indicates that a pennycress-corn double-cropping system improves spider diversity to a larger degree than mustard-corn, green fallow-corn and bare fallow-corn double cropping systems. The addition of pennycress to a corn rotation also increased and stabilized ground beetle diversity more effectively than a mustard (Sinapis alba)–corn rotation, a green fallow–corn rotation, or a bare fallow–corn rotation. This was mainly due to the evenness of plant cover throughout the growing season. Therefore, Bioenergy from double-cropped pennycress may support ground beetle diversity. Pennycress can be utilized as part of a comprehensive integrated weed management strategy. Fall establishment can provide early spring ground cover and suppress aggressive spring germinating weeds such as common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and tall waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus). Johnson et al. (2015) speculated that weed suppression may have been caused by allelopathic compounds rather than ground cover when pennycress seeding rates and companion crops were taken into account. ==AgronomySeeding=== Current studies suggest a seeding rate of 1500 seeds per hectare for Europe while 672 seeds per hectare is suggested for the US. This variability is due to different climates. The recommended seeding depth is around 1 cm. For good germination rates pennycress needs about 25-40mm of water and favours cold and wet conditions. ===Fertilization=== In order to increase yields several studies evaluated the effect of fertilization on pennycress. Generally cover crops like pennycress are used to take up the available nutrients to prevent them from leaching. Nitrate and sulphur fertilization had positive effects on the seed yield of pennycress, but also no fertilized treatments showed sufficient yields. ===Harvesting yield=== Pennycress can be harvested with common machinery used for grain/corn and soy bean production. This makes it favorable for integration in many crop rotations. As pennycress is grown over the winter period the combines for harvesting are available in spring time as the harvest of all other crops happens at a different time of the year. The seed yield ranges from 500 kg/ha to 2400 kg/ha while most studies suggest an average yield of 1100 kg/ha. ===Integration in soy maize crop rotations=== In the mid east of the US a common crop rotation is Soybean and Maize. After harvest the fields are kept as fallows. Pennycress appears to be especially well suited for oil production when cultivated before soybean. As a cover crop grown over the winter period with harvest taking place in spring, it can effectively reduce soil erosion, prevent nutrient leaching, improve soil structure and increase biodiversity. The required machinery for cultivation is already available in the region, as it is the same used for maize and soybean production. ==UsesOil=== The first attempts to grow pennycress as an oil crop took place in 1994. However, since 2002 its more and more considered as a potential oil crop rather than a “noxious weed”. High erucic acid content (>300g per kg of its total seed oil DM) makes the oil unsuitable for food purposes. Pennycress also contains Glucosinolates, which make the usage as food undesirable. Recently pennycress oil has attracted great interest as raw material for jet fuel and Biodiesel production. Oils with high eruic aicid are especially suitable for jet fuel production. Oil characteristics are highly influenced by specific environmental conditions such as precipitation. ===Feed/Food=== Due to the high eruric acid content the seeds are unsuitable for human consumption. Instead, the biomass can be used as feed for livestock. Its fast growth under cold conditions favors the usage as fodder as a second crop. Its low biomass production makes it undesirable to concentrate on pennycress cultivation for fodder production. ===Edible uses=== The field pennycress has a bitter taste; it is usually parboiled to remove the bitter taste. This is mostly used in salads, sometimes in sandwich spreads. It is said to have a distinctive flavour. ===Use as a source of biodiesel=== Pennycress is being developed as an oilseed crop for production of renewable fuels.Arvegenix LLC websiteField pennycress shows feedstock potential The species can be planted in the fall, will germinate and form a vegetative mass which can overwinter. In the spring, the oil-rich seed can be harvested and used as a biodiesel feedstock. ==Research== Pennycress is related to the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Researchers have begun studying the genetics of pennycress in order to improve its potential use as a biofuel crop. For example, the transcriptome of pennycress has been sequenced.

The helicopter was a YH-40—a preproduction version of the UH-1 Iroquois—modified and tested in several helicopter and compound helicopter configurations. The Bell 533 was referred to as the High Performance Helicopter (HPH) by the Army, and reached a top speed of in 1969, before being retired. ==Design and development== The U.S. Army began a program to study improvements to current helicopters that could be demonstrated by testing. Analyses by three helicopter companies showed that performance could be greatly improved. Bell Helicopter was one of the participants and investigated improvements to the UH-1B Iroquois. After the study, Bell submitted a proposal for the High Performance Helicopter.TRECOM Technical Report 63-42, 1963, p. 5. On 7 August 1961, the Army's Transportation Research and Engineering Command (TRECOM) awarded a contract to Bell Helicopter for a high-performance helicopter to conduct research.Robb, Raymond L. \\"Hybrid helicopters: Compounding the quest for speed\\" . Vertiflite. American Helicopter Society, Summer 2006. The basic High Performance Helicopter In response, Bell built the Model 533 from a YH-40-BF, one of the six preproduction UH-1s.Pelletier, Alain J. Bell aircraft since 1935. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press. 1992. . The dynamic components of the YH-40 were updated with components designed for the UH-1B. The research for the contract was split into two phases; phase one would be to determine the benefits of an overall reduction in drag, phase two would determine the benefits of auxiliary thrust. The Bell 533 was flight tested in three main configurations. The first configuration was the basic YH-40 helicopter with drag reduction changes. The second configuration added a pair of jet engines for additional thrust. The third configuration added swept wings for extra lift. ==Operational historyInitial testing=== During the first phase, a general clean-up of the airframe was performed to reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor. The skid landing gear also had streamlined fairings applied to it and the rotor mast was replaced by a mast that could be tilted in-flight. Bell 533 with jet engines added The reconfigured helicopter was first tested in the NASA Ames Research Center wind tunnel, which confirmed that the modifications had significantly reduced the aircraft's drag. The 533 made its maiden flight on 10 August 1962 at Bell's Fort Worth, Texas headquarters utilizing the two-bladed UH-1B rotor. Before beginning the program flight testing, the helicopter was fitted with a gimbal- mounted three-bladed rotor. Modifications to the flight controls allowed either rotor to easily be fitted to the aircraft in a short time, and the three-bladed rotor could be mounted on the gimbal or rigidly to the mast. In this configuration, the 533 achieved a true airspeed of 150 knots (173 mph, 278 km/h) in straight-and-level flight. Bell 533 with wings, without engines The Army funded the second phase to study the effects of auxiliary propulsion on the helicopter. Bell configured the 533 with two swept-back wings. The sweep of the wings was adjusted by maintenance personnel on the ground. Later in the program, the tilt of the wings was linked to the collective control to limit lift and to control rotor speed during autorotational profiles. After flight tests to determine the characteristics of the aircraft with the wings installed, the wings were removed. Starting on 21 October 1963, Bell began test flights with two Continental CAE J69-T-9 turbojet engines in nacelles mounted directly to the aft portion of the fuselage. The thrust from the two 920-pound (4.09 kN) thrust engines caused turbulent airflow over the standard elevators, so an additional elevator was mounted on the vertical fin on the opposite side of the tail rotor. Following the modification, flight tests were resumed on 2 March 1964, with both wings and engines mounted. In this configuration, the Bell 533 achieved 186 knots (214 mph, 344 km/h) using maximum auxiliary thrust. ===Independent testing=== In April 1964, contracted testing was completed with the Army. Bell immediately fitted the two-bladed rotor with tapered blade tip caps for the company's own independent testing. The blade tip modification allowed the helicopter to reach 193 knots (222 mph, 357 km/h) using the maximum auxiliary thrust from the Continental turbojets. In an effort to achieve even higher speeds, Bell removed the J69-T-9 engines and replaced them with 1,700-pound (7.56 kN) thrust J69-T-29 engines. The additional thrust helped make the 533 the first rotorcraft in history to exceed 200 knots (230 mph, 370 km/h), reaching 205 knots (236 mph, 380 km/h) on 15 October 1964. Six months later, on 6 April 1965, the Bell 533 became the first rotorcraft to reach 217 knots (250 mph, 402 km/h). In addition to the higher speeds, Bell test pilots were able to demonstrate that the additional thrust from the auxiliary engines allowed the compound helicopter to maintain sustained 2 g turns at 60-degree bank angles. ===Follow-on research=== By early 1968, the Army and Bell were working together again to expand the envelope of the Model 533. Bell removed the wings previously used and replaced them with a stub wing mounted higher and further back on the airframe. Bell also replaced the J69 turbojets with Pratt & Whitney JT12A-3 (J60) engines, capable of producing 3,300 pounds (13.3 kN) of thrust each, mounting the new engines on the ends of the stub wings. Bell also modified the helicopter flight controls to change pitch control from inputs to the rotor during lower flight speeds to airplane-style elevator control during high-speed flight. On 15 April 1969, the Model 533 achieved its highest speed of 274.6 knots (316.0 mph, 508.6 km/h).Spenser, Jay P. \\"Bell Helicopter\\". Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers, p. 274. University of Washington Press, 1998. . The final configuration of the Model 533 for the research contract was with a proprietary, four-bladed, flex-beam rigid rotor developed by Bell. Afterwards, the Model 533 was returned to its original two-bladed configuration and retired. ==Surviving aircraft== Bell 533 on display The Model 533 is on display (in highest speed configuration) at the US Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Fort Eustis, Virginia. ==See alsoReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Bell Helicopter.

It was founded in 1985 to compete with New York Telephone Company using fiber optics, and expanded to other major cities. The company was acquired by AT&T; in 1998. ==History== The company was formed as Teleport Communications in 1985 by Merrill Lynch as the private sector participant in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's \\"Teleport Project\\". William Corley who ran the SI economic development took the vision forward to promote Jobs for the community. The Teleport Project envisioned a satellite earth station complex in Staten Island connected to the stock exchanges, financial services companies and corporate headquarters located in Manhattan. Microwave connections were not feasible due to the congestion of New York's airwaves so Teleport Communications decided to utilize fiber optics for a network connecting satellite earth stations at The Teleport to customers in Manhattan. However, the simultaneous advent of national fiber optic networks reduced the need for satellite communications, leaving Teleport Communications' network largely unused. Merrill Lynch hired former AT&T; manager Robert Annunziata to develop a new strategy for Teleport Communications. Annunziata's plan was revolutionary: Teleport Communications would use the fiber optic network to compete with the New York Telephone Company, the historic monopoly telephone company in New York, and re-introduce competition for local telecom services. Teleport Communications' service was very popular with long-distance carriers such as AT&T;, MCI and Sprint who wanted to connect their long-distance networks to their largest customers without using the local telephone companies (the so-called regional Bell Operating Companies — RBOCs) which were perceived as strategic competitors that wanted to get into the long-distance business. Teleport Communications' services were also popular with financial services companies that wanted duplicate and independent high speed connections between their New York area offices and the stock exchanges. The financial services and long-distance companies quickly asked Teleport Communications to replicate its services in Boston. Merrill Lynch formed a partnership with Fidelity Investments for Teleport Communications-Boston. Similar expansions followed in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston and other major cities across the United States and the company was renamed Teleport Communications Group (TCG). Merrill Lynch later sold TCG to the cable TV industry, with Cox initially taking a 20% ownership. The remaining 80% was subsequently sold to TCI, Comcast and Continental Cablevision. TCG and the cable companies then started to deploy jointly built fiber optic networks in many other cities. TCG then added carrier-grade Class 5 switches to the fiber optic networks to become the first and largest Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), competing broadly with the traditional local telephone companies. Critical to TCG's ability to compete with the traditional monopolies were a series of favorable decisions by state regulators, particularly in New York, Massachusetts and Illinois, which allowed TCG and other CLECs to interconnect as \\"peers\\" at reasonable rates. These regulatory initiatives were ultimately codified and made applicable nationally through the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. The success of TCG and other CLECs demonstrated that competition was possible in the local telephone market. This contributed to the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which eased the entrance of new CLECs by requiring the incumbent telephone companies, the largest being legacies of AT&T;, to interconnect with the new entrants. In 1998, TCG was acquired by AT&T; for $12 billion. At that time the publicly traded TCG (NASDAQ: TCGI) served 65 markets and generated $800 million in revenue. Its largest investors were Cable Television companies TCI, Comcast and Cox Communications. == References == Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States ","title":"Teleport Communications Group"},{"id":"6214840","text":"Nuclear graphite is any grade of graphite, usually synthetic graphite, specifically manufactured for use as a moderator or reflector within a nuclear reactor. Graphite is an important material for the construction of both historical and modern nuclear reactors, due to its extreme purity and its ability to withstand extremely high temperatures. Graphite has also recently been used in nuclear fusion reactors as well, such as the Wendelstein 7-X. As of experiments published in 2019, the use of graphite in elements of the stellarator's wall and a graphite island divertor have greatly improved the plasma performance within the device; yielding better control over impurity and heat exhaust, and long high-density discharges.Core graphite from the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment ==History== Nuclear fission, the creation of a nuclear chain reaction in uranium, was discovered in 1939 following experiments by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, and the interpretation of their results by physicists such as Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch. Shortly thereafter, word of the discovery spread throughout the international physics community. In order for the fission process to chain react, the neutrons created by uranium fission must be slowed down by interacting with a neutron moderator (an element with a low atomic weight, that will \\"bounce\\", when hit by a neutron) before they will be captured by other uranium atoms. By late 1939, it became well known that the two most promising moderators were heavy water and graphite. In February 1940, using funds that were allocated partly as a result of the Einstein-Szilard letter to President Roosevelt, Leo Szilard purchased several tons of graphite from the Speer Carbon Company and from the National Carbon Company (the National Carbon Division of the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio) for use in Enrico Fermi's first fission experiments, the so-called exponential pile. Fermi writes that \\"The results of this experiment was [sic] somewhat discouraging\\" presumably due to the absorption of neutrons by some unknown impurity. So, in December 1940 Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite. During this conversation it became clear that minute quantities of boron impurities were the source of the problem. As a result of this meeting, over the next two years, MacPherson and Hamister developed thermal and gas extraction purification techniques at National Carbon for the production of boron-free graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT Graphite (\\"Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature\\") by National Carbon, and it was \\"the first true nuclear grade graphite\\". During this period, Fermi and Szilard purchased graphite from several manufacturers with various degrees of neutron absorption cross section: AGX graphite from National Carbon Company with 6.68 mb (millibarns) cross section, US graphite from United States Graphite Company with 6.38 mb cross section, Speer graphite from the Speer Carbon Company with 5.51 mb cross section, and when it became available, AGOT graphite from National Carbon, with 4.97 mb cross section. (See also Haag [2005].) By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped 250 tons of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago where it became the primary source of graphite to be used in the construction of Fermi's Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor to generate a sustained chain reaction (December 2, 1942). AGOT graphite was used to build the X-10 graphite reactor in Oak Ridge TN (early 1943) and the first reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington (mid 1943), for the production of plutonium during and after World War II. The AGOT process and its later refinements became standard techniques in the manufacture of nuclear graphite. The neutron cross section of graphite was also investigated during the second world war in Germany by Walter Bothe, P. Jensen, and Werner Heisenberg. The purest graphite available to them was a product from the Siemens Plania company, which exhibited a neutron absorption cross section of about 6.4 mb to 7.5 mb (Haag 2005). Heisenberg therefore decided that graphite would be unsuitable as a moderator in a reactor design using natural uranium, due to this apparently high rate of neutron absorption. Consequently, the German effort to create a chain reaction involved attempts to use heavy water, an expensive and scarce alternative, made all the more difficult to acquire as a consequence of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage by Norwegian and Allied forces. Writing as late as 1947, Heisenberg still did not understand that the only problem with graphite was the boron impurity. ==Wigner effect== In December 1942 Eugene Wigner suggested that neutron bombardment might introduce dislocations and other damage in the molecular structure of materials such as the graphite moderator in a nuclear reactor (the Wigner effect). The resulting buildup of energy in the material became a matter of concern The possibility was suggested that graphite bars might fuse together as chemical bonds at the surface of the bars when opened and closed again. Even the possibility that the graphite parts might very quickly break into small pieces could not be ruled out. However, the first power-producing reactors (X-10 Graphite Reactor and Hanford B Reactor) had to be built without such knowledge. Cyclotrons, which were the only fast neutron sources available, would take several months to produce neutron irradiation equivalent to one day in a Hanford reactor. This was the starting point for large-scale research programmes to investigate the property changes due to fast particle radiation and to predict their influence on the safety and the lifetime of graphite reactors to be built. Influences of fast neutron radiation on strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, thermal expansivity, dimensional stability, on the storage of internal energy (Wigner energy), and on many other properties have been observed many times and in many countries after the first results emerged from the X-10 reactor in 1944. Although catastrophic behaviour such as fusion or crumbling of graphite pieces has never occurred, large changes in many properties do result from fast neutron irradiation which need to be taken into account when graphite components of nuclear reactors are designed. Although not all effects are well understood yet, more than 100 graphite reactors have successfully operated for decades since the 1940s. A few severe accidents in graphite reactors can in no case be attributed to insufficient information (at the time of design) regarding the properties of the graphite in use. In the 2010s, the collection of new material property data has improved knowledge significantly. ==Purity== Reactor-grade graphite must be free of neutron absorbing materials, especially boron, which has a large neutron capture cross section. Boron sources in graphite include the raw materials, the packing materials used in baking the product, and even the choice of soap (for example, borax) used to launder the clothing worn by workers in the machine shop. Boron concentration in thermally purified graphite (such as AGOT graphite) can be less than 0.4 ppm and in chemically purified nuclear graphite it is less than 0.06 ppm. ==Behaviour under irradiation== This describes the behavior of nuclear graphite, specifically when exposed to fast neutron irradiation. Specific phenomena addressed: *Dimensional change (shrinkage and neutron-induced swelling) *Change in elastic modulus (measured by impulse excitation technique) *Change in coefficient of thermal expansion *Change in thermal conductivity *Change in electrical resistivity *Irradiation induced creep As the state of nuclear graphite in active reactors can only be determined at routine inspections, about every 18 months, mathematical modelling of the nuclear graphite as it approached end-of-life is important. However as only surface features can be inspected, and the exact time of changes is not known, reliability modelling is especially difficult. ==Manufacture== Nuclear graphite for the UK Magnox reactors was manufactured from petroleum coke mixed with coal-based binder pitch heated and extruded into billets, and then baked at 1,000 °C for several days. To reduce porosity and increase density, the billets were impregnated with coal tar at high temperature and pressure before a final bake at 2,800 °C. Individual billets were then machined into the final required shapes. ==Accidents in graphite- moderated reactors== There have been two major accidents in graphite-moderated reactors, the Windscale fire and the Chernobyl disaster. In the Windscale fire, an untested annealing process for the graphite was used, causing overheating in unmonitored areas of the core and leading directly to the ignition of the fire. The material that ignited was not the graphite moderator itself, but rather the canisters of metallic uranium fuel within the reactor. When the fire was extinguished, it was found that the only areas of the graphite moderator to have incurred thermal damage were those that had been close to the burning fuel canisters. In the Chernobyl disaster, the moderator was not responsible for the primary event. Instead, a massive power excursion during a mishandled test caused the catastrophic failure of the reactor vessel and a near-total loss of coolant supply. The result was that the fuel rods rapidly melted and flowed together while in an extremely high power state, causing a small portion of the core to reach a state of runaway prompt criticality and leading to a massive energy release, resulting in the explosion of the reactor core and the destruction of the reactor building. The massive energy release during the primary event superheated the graphite moderator, and the disruption of the reactor vessel and building allowed the superheated graphite to come into contact with atmospheric oxygen. As a result, the graphite moderator caught fire, sending a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and over a very widespread area. ==References== *Haag, G. 2005, Properties of ATR-2E Graphite and Property Changes due to Fast Neutron Irradiation, FZ-Juelich, Juel-4813. ==External links== *Manufacturing and Production of Graphite, IAEA Nuclear Graphite Knowledge Base *Graphite Behaviour under Irradiation, IAEA Nuclear Graphite Knowledge Base Category:Carbon forms Category:Neutron moderators Category:Nuclear technology ","title":"Nuclear graphite"},{"id":"6214873","text":"Lashkargah is a district in the east of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, surrounding the provincial capital of Lashkargah.

He has served as a coach for the Toronto Blue Jays in MLB and for their farm teams in Minor League Baseball. ==Career== Langford grew up in Varina, Virginia. He attended Varina High School, where he participated in four sports. He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a free agent in 1973. He made his MLB debut with the Pirates in 1976. Before the 1977 season, the Pirates traded Langford, Tony Armas, Doug Bair, Dave Giusti, Doc Medich and Mitchell Page to the Oakland Athletics for Phil Garner, Chris Batton, and Tommy Helms. In a streak that began on May 23, 1980, Langford pitched 22 consecutive complete games. The streak ended on September 17, when he came within of an inning of another complete game. He then pitched consecutive complete games in his next three starts. Langford led the American League in complete games and innings pitched that year, and also won a career high 19 games for the Athletics. In 1983, Langford was hit by a line drive in his elbow and tore a muscle in the elbow when trying to play through the injury. However, he'd already been in decline before then. Although he reportedly had a sore elbow late in the 1982 season, his lackluster statistics (11-16, 4.32 ERA) led baseball writer Rob Neyer to wonder if he'd been injured earlier in the season. Neyer estimated that in 1981, Langford threw as many as 129 pitches per complete game, a heavy workload for a young pitcher even then. A's manager Billy Martin has often been criticized for overworking Langford and the other members of the 1981 rotation He had a 4–19 win-loss record from the 1983 through 1986 seasons. He attempted a comeback to baseball in 1988, pitching for the Columbus Clippers, a minor league baseball affiliate of the New York Yankees. The Yankees did not promote him to the major leagues, and he retired after the season. Langford joined the Toronto Blue Jays organization in 1996 as a pitching coach in the minor leagues. He served as a major league pitching coach in 2002. After the 2008 season, the Blue Jays named Langford their roving minor league pitching instructor. The Blue Jays named Langford their major league bullpen coach for the 2010 season. After the 2010 season, he became the Blue Jays' pitching rehab coordinator. He became the pitching coach for the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League. ==Personal life== Langford lives in Florida with his wife Terrie, an art teacher. They have two children: Jamie, an elementary school teacher, and Travis, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force. ==References Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Virginia Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Farmville, Virginia Category:Florida State Seminoles baseball players Category:SCF Manatees baseball players Category:Toronto Blue Jays coaches Category:Gulf Coast Pirates players Category:Salem Pirates players Category:Charleston Charlies players Category:Shreveport Captains players Category:Modesto A's players Category:Tacoma Tigers players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota alumni ","title":"Rick Langford"},{"id":"6214914","text":"Nemunėlis () is a river in northern Lithuania and southern Latvia.

He played for Leicestershire Like his near contemporary, Stuart Broad, he was educated at Oakham School. ==Cricket career== Boyce achieved a unique feat on 23 June 2010 by winning a man of the match award, despite only appearing as a substitute. Will Jefferson had batted for the Leicestershire Foxes in their Friends Provident t20 North Group match against the Warwickshire Bears at Edgbaston, but suffered an Achilles problem resulting in Boyce taking to the field, instead. Neil Carter, Jim Troughton and Tim Ambrose were all run out by Boyce, as he helped the Foxes to win by 32 runs. After the match, Boyce was named man of the match, and he took part in the presentation ceremony with Paul Allott. Boyce's fielding would play a similarly instrumental role for the Foxes in the final of the following year's Twenty20 competition on 27 August 2011, again at Edgbaston. Boyce had played in the Super Over victory over the Lancashire Lightning in the day's earlier semi-final, although he was not needed to bat. For the evening's final against Somerset, he was replaced in the Foxes' team by Jigar Naik. However, once again Jefferson had batted but was not able to take to the field, again due to an Achilles problem. This meant that Boyce would again appear as a substitute for Jefferson at Edgbaston. Boyce took the catches of James Hildreth, Peter Trego, Jos Buttler and Alfonso Thomas, all off the bowling of man of the match Josh Cobb, thus helping to steer the Foxes to a win by 18 runs and clinch the trophy. He has acted as captain for Leicestershire. On 23 July 2015 Boyce announced his retirement from cricket to take up a career in finance. ==Career best performances== as of 27 June 2013 {class= style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"1\\" !colspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"Batting - ! !Score !Fixture !Venue !Season - FC align=\\"center\\"135 Leicestershire v Kent Leicester align=\\"center\\"2013 - LA align=\\"center\\"80 Leicestershire Foxes v Hampshire Royals Leicester align=\\"center\\"2009 - T20 align=\\"center\\"63* Leicestershire Foxes v Lancashire Lightning Manchester align=\\"center\\"2012 } ==Charity work== After the 2012 English cricket season had finished, Boyce set out to walk the length of Great Britain on a route from John o' Groats to Land's End in order to raise money and promote awareness for mental health charity Mind. Although not suffering himself, he was inspired to raise awareness about depression after the suicides of sportsmen Gary Speed and Peter Roebuck. He was also frustrated by people such as Piers Morgan showing a lack of comprehension about depression and how it can impact on people from all walks of life. He started the walk in September and completed it in December. For part of the walk he was joined by fellow cricketers, including Paul Nixon. ==References * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Leicestershire cricketers Category:People educated at Oakham School Category:Sportspeople from Cheltenham ","title":"Matthew Boyce"},{"id":"6214925","text":"Jack Rabbit is an \\"out and back\\" wooden roller coaster located at Seabreeze Amusement Park in Irondequoit, New York.

Exhibition pavilions and leisure and recreation buildings were erected on the site, the two largest commercial pavilions being the Palace of Engineering and Palace of Industry, and countries in the British Empire contributed their own national pavilions. The Exhibition was master-planned by Thomas S. Tait, who headed a team of architects, which included Basil Spence and Jack Coia. The most prominent structure was the Tait Tower (officially the Tower of Empire) 300 feet in its own height which on the hill made it high. Although it could have remained as a permanent monument after the exhibition, the tower was handed over to the Army after the exhibition ended and demolished in June 1939. Note the date. The story this demolition was to avoid it being used by German bomber aircraft for location-finding is an urban myth.Glasgow's Great Exhibitions by Perilla Kinchin and Juliet Kinchin The nearby Gilmorehill tower at Glasgow University is at least as prominent so equally useful for location finding and wasn't demolished. ==Origins== The idea of the exhibition came from the Scottish Development Council, created in the 1930s, under the aegis of its founder chairman Sir James Lithgow, industrialist and Britain\`s foremost shipbuilder. Cecil Weir, convenor of the Council\`s general purposes committee made the suggestion, at Lithgow’s behest, and gave shape to the idea. In 1936 his report and proposals were announced. In a few months’ time after meeting government bodies , industries and manufacturers the Empire Exhibition project was officially launched in October 1936 in the Merchants House, Glasgow.Empire Exhibition Final Report 11 January 1939, by Captain Graham, General ManagerSir Cecil Weir KCMG, KBE, MC.

An active member of the Liberal Party, he advocated social and economic reform. He would become president of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and later a founder of the Institute of Production Engineers. He was appointed the first Civil Defence Commissioner for Western Scotland, receiving his sealed orders at the Exhibition on 25 September 1938, five days before Chamberlain arrived back from Munich. Throughout WWII he was one of the five members of the UK Industrial & Export Council. He was also made Controller of Factory & Storage Premises and then Director General of Equipment & Stores with supreme control over all production. He introduced the policy of the Concentration of British Industry which freed up 70 million square feet of premises, and 260,000 male workers for active service, resulting in greatly improved efficiency and production and the training of women workers. Of his many initiatives here and jointly with his American counterpart, Weir introduced the mass production of penicillin, essential to the survival of Allied service personnel; industrial- scale production of the pressed-steel jerrican for the Allies, based on the Nazi invention , the war being global and fast moving in contrast to trench- warfare; and ahead of peacetime conceived the scheme of Demobilisation Clothing for 9 million service men and women, and with no distinction for rank.Our Illustrious Forbears by Charles Oakley published in 1980Sir Cecil Weir KCMG, KBE, MC.

Above- ground construction started in July 1937 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth unveiled the granite Commemoration Stone on the hill, where it remains today. The total area of buildings was well over I million square feet. Construction was of steel and timber, throughout clad in four-foot- square asbestos panels, the idea being drawn from Mendelsohn and Chermayeff’s Bexhill Pavilion built in 1935, for which Tait had been the assessor. The permanent Palace of Art was built of brick. Construction at Bellahouston was completed in 10 months, making it a record for international exhibitions.

The lovely pavilions in Dominion and Colonial Avenues in Empire Court, separated by a beautiful ornamental lake and fountains with the great Engineering Hall at one end and the Industrial Halls at the other, flanked by innumerable pavilions erected by great industrial companies, newspapers and public services grouped below the terrace approach to the Garden Clubhttps://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00405&t;=2 and the Tower gave the plan a grace and variety which took full advantage of the beauty of the natural features with which the site abounded. On the other side of the Hill with its dominating Tower lay the Scottish pavilions, the Highland Village or Clachan,https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00426&t;=2 the Palace of Arts, the Peace and Fitness Pavilions and the Concert Hall along with a number of smaller pavilions of a private character. Three fine new churches were well attended throughout the run of the Exhibition. The Commonwealth and its myriad resources and customs came to life in these exhibits. The Exhibition could fairly be dubbed as much an exhibition of industrial achievement as of culture and the arts.\\"Sir Cecil Weir KCMG, KBE, MC. (1953) - Civilian Assignment> Nineteen restaurants, and numerous milk and snack bars, met the appetites of visitors from Britain and overseas, who for transport around the vast site had use of fifty Lister passenger autotrucks quietly traversing the roadways on a one-way route, linking pavilions, and passing the well-used bandstands. Ten thousand were carried each day. The Concert Hall – from which the BBC broadcast - staged classical concerts, jazz, dance bands, and variety billings arranged by Messrs Collins Variety Agency, and the Film Theatre presented newsreels, documentaries and cartoons. At other times its stage was used for drama, under the guidance of James Bridie, and for choral concerts.Empire Exhibition - Official GuidePerilla Kinchin and Juliet Kinchin (1988) - Glasgow's Great Exhibitions There were frequent displays by the Army, Navy and Air Force, pipe band competitions and massed band parades and open-air dancing. The Amusement Park,https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00428&t;=2 with its sub- franchise of the Big Ride (or Mountain Railway), was highly successful with its 28 large devices and 105 side-shows and games. An international football tournament was held throughout the summer for the Empire Exhibition Trophy, being won by Celtic, with Everton as runners up. The number of spectators totalled 340,000, a figure not added in to the main Exhibition attendances. A total of 87 national and international Congresses and Conferences were held, usually in the Concert Hall and its committee rooms, with smaller conferences held in the Castle Hall in the Clachan, and in the Fashion Theatre.Perilla Kinchin and Juliet Kinchin (1988) - Glasgow's Great ExhibitionsEmpire Exhibition Final Report 11 January 1939, by Captain Graham, General Manager ==Legacy buildings== The only major surviving original structure on the site is the Palace of Arts, designed by Launcelot H Ross, and now used for sporting and health activities. The Palace of Engineering was dismantled in 1940, transported to Scottish Aviation at Prestwick and re-erected, dramatically increasing the company's factory floor space. The building is still used by aviation industry today and is a distinctive feature at Prestwick Airport. The former South Africa pavilion with its distinctive curvilinear Dutch Baroque gables also survives. Built as a temporary structure, the building was later moved to Ardeer in Ayrshire to become a staff canteen within ICI Ardeer. The Empire News Theatre, which showed films and newsreels, with a small stage for live performance, was re-erected in Lochgilphead in 1939 as a cinema. In 1991 it became a travel lodge.http://www.scottishcinemas.org.uk/scotland/lochgilphead.html The highland Clachan was shipped to San Francisco. Billy Butlin bought the Concert Hall and some of the fountains. The city Information Bureau for the exhibition, and tourism, continued at Argyle Street/St Enoch Square, Glasgow for many decades.Photographed in Henry Morton\`s book Old Glasgow published in 1988 In December 2007, Digital Design Studio at Glasgow School of Art created a 3D graphic reconstruction of the 1938 exhibition, sourced from contemporary photographs, film footage, sketches and drawings from the archive of the Mitchell Library, amongst other sources. In 2010, the Digital Design Studio was awarded a further research grant to enhance the 3D model for public engagement.http://www.gsa.ac.uk/researchandpostgraduate/content/default.asp?page=s18_3_12 The Glasgow School of Art's YouTube channel contains several videos of the 3D model.https://www.youtube.com/user/GlasgowSchoolofArt?feature=chclk#p/a/u/1/ONdp4HcXiNg Bellahouston Park, with its parklands and gardens, continues in popularity with its entrances from Paisley Road West, Dumbreck Road and Mosspark Boulevard. The Palace of Arts, Bellahouston Sports Centre and the dry ski and snowboard slopes are established centres of fitness and recreation. The acclaimed House for an Art Lover, built in the 1990s to the 1901 designs of Charles Rennie MacIntosh is a major attraction and function venue, adjoined to the flower gardens, sculpture park and art studios. Nearby on the park nurseries is the modern Prince & Princess of Wales Hospice, opened in 2018. The Beresford Hotel opened in 1938 to provide accommodation for those attending the Empire Exhibition and was often described as Glasgow's first skyscraper, being the tallest building erected in Glasgow between the two world wars, at 10 storeys high. The building now consists of 112 private residences but remains one of the city's most notable examples of Art Deco/Streamline Moderne architecture. and is protected as a category B listed building. ==See also== * International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry (1888) * Glasgow International Exhibition (1901) * Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry (1911) * Glasgow Garden Festival (1988) ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Empire Exhibition - Official Guide softback 230 pages, plus photographs of sponsors and creators, plans and 73pp adverts *Empire Exhibition - Official Catalogue hardback 254 pages, including all committees and exhibitors, plus pp45 *Empire Exhibition Final Report 11 January 1939, by Captain Graham, General Manager. 185pp *Sir Cecil Weir KCMG, KBE, MC.

Salant (born c. 1945) is an economist who has done extensive research in applied microeconomics (mostly in the fields of natural resources and industrial organization). His 1975 model of speculative attacks in the gold market (with Dale Henderson) was adapted by Paul Krugman and others to explain speculative attacks in foreign exchange markets. Hundreds of journal articles and books on financial speculative attacks followed. In a series of six articles,\\"Market anticipations of government policies and the price of gold\\" (with Dale Henderson), Journal of Political Economy 1978, 86, pp.627-48\\"The vulnerability of price stabilization schemes to speculative attack,\\" Journal of Political Economy 1983, 91, pp.1-38\\"Recurrence of a modified random walk and its application to an economic model\\" (with Roberta Wenocur), SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, 1981, pp. 163-66\\"Private storage of common property\\" (with Gerard Gaudet and Michel Moreaux), Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 2002, 43, pp. 280-302\\"The effects of periodic quotas limiting the stock of imports of durables\\" (with Gerard Gaudet), Journal of Economic Theory, 2003,109,pp.402-19\\"The proposed cap-and- trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions: the case of the unbuttoned collar\\" (with Makoto Hasegawa), 2010 Salant has continued to focus instead on real speculative attacks. These may be divided into two categories: (1) speculative attacks induced by government policies such as total allowable catch quotas in fisheries, H1-B immigration quotas, commodity price ceilings, and most recently the proposed price-collars on tradable emissions permits; and (2) speculative attacks that are naturally occurring rather than induced by government policy such as the precipitous depletions of storable common properties (e.g. “oil rushes”). In industrial organization, he has contributed to the literatures on horizontal mergers, price discrimination, durable goods monopoly, and cartels. Salant also has a long-standing interest in the Alger Hiss case and has published in that area as well. He earned his B.A. in mathematics at Columbia University in 1967, and his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973. He worked at the Federal Reserve Board and the Rand Corporation, where he coedited The RAND Journal of Economics.

Around 1740 he went to Bologna, where he studied until 1745 with the famous music theorist Giovanni Battista Martini. ==Career== Then he moved to Venice, where in 1752 he was appointed as first organist at San Marco. From 1755 to 1777 he was choirmaster at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti, also in Venice. In the period 1778–1783 he was in London, where he composed operas for the King's Theatre. Back to Venice in 1784, he succeeded Baldassare Galuppi in 1785 as Kapellmeister of San Marco and preserved this position until his retirement in 1808. ==Music Works== A prolific writer of church music, Bertoni also composed 70 operas which fell into oblivion, except Orfeo (Venice, Teatro San Benedetto, 1776), based on the same libretto of Ranieri de' Calzabigi of the work of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Orfeo ed Euridice (Burgtheater, Vienna, 1762). Bertoni composed this work especially for his friend Gaetano Guadagni, a castrato, who would interpret the role of Orfeo (the same role he had interpreted in Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice).

It has approximately 18,000 inhabitants. The district has much pre World War I and World War II architecture still in existence. It has a vibrant though somewhat discreet artistic community. ==The construction of the district== Oude Noorden is a typical residential area which was destined for the crowded city of Rotterdam to relief. The first houses were built in 1870 around the Noordsingel, which was part of the single plan of city architect Willem Nicolaas Rose. However, it was stipulated that the workers' houses were not allowed to be built on the Noordsingel. For the rest of the neighborhood were wide streets with large blocks provided. But the streets were narrow and the houses were built close together. Between 1870 and 1930 expanded the area further and further to the north, which in 1903 became necessary to annexing a part of the territory of Hillegersberg. == Shopping and touristic areas == Oude Noorden is home to several shopping areas. The Zwart Janstraat and Noordmolenstraat together make up the 'Noorderboulevard', which is home to many (multicultural) stores. The adjacent Zwaanshals and neighboring Noordplein and Zaagmolenkade have seen an influx of small stores after makeovers of the buildings. In the early 20th century, the Noordplein was home to regular outdoor markets.Markt aan het Noordplein 1950-1958 Today it is home to many other events, such as markets, carnavals, music festivals and food festivals.Noordpleinrotterdam.nl In recent years, there has been an increase of these events, which has brought activity back to this area. == Present and future == After years of deterioration, quality of life in Oude Noorden has been improved significantly by the submunicipality and housing corporations. The shopping districts Zwart Janstraat, Noordmolenstraat and adjacent Zwaanshals are now home to many multicultural stores. Both the government and the housing corporations are attempting to build up the image of the neighborhood. == Architecture == Pijnackerplein Oude Noorden is a mixture of architectural styles. Most notable are the styles of the 20th century and the urban renewal in the 1980s. The district is compact with a high number of inhabitants per square kilometer. Notable buildings are the bandstand at the Pijnackerplein, and the Convent of the Ruivenstraat. In the third Pijnackerstraat is the building in which the oldest neighbourhood library of the Netherlands was established. ==Notable residents== Many notable Dutch people are from the Oude Noorden. Coen Moulijn, Willem de Kooning, Patricia Paay, Wim Jansen, Faas Wilkes, Yvonne Keeley and Rita Reys are born in the district. There is a monument for soccer player Coen Moulijn, the wall of Coen Moulijn. It is in the Bloklandstraat where he lived for years, the street where Wim Jansen also grew up. ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods of Rotterdam ","title":"Oude Noorden"},{"id":"6215092","text":"The Volodarsky Bridge () is a bridge across the Neva River in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Along with the two nearby villages of Great Fencote and Little Fencote it forms the civil parish of Kirkby Fleetham and Fencote. At the 2011 census, it was recorded as having a population of 560. ==History== There were two distinct villages named Kirkby and Fleetham at one time. Both are mentioned in the Domesday Book as Cherchebi and Fleetha both belonging to the lands of Count Alan of Brittany. The nearby hamlets of Gt and Lt Fencote are referred to in the Fleetham entry as the Fencotes. The lands of Fleetham before the Norman Conquest were owned by Gamli, son of Karli and Uhtred. After 1086 the manor was granted to Odo the chamberlain. The lands around Kirkby remained with Aldred (Eldred) throughout that time period. The name derives from a combination of kirkju-býr, Old Norse for village with a church, flēot the Old English for small stream and hām the Old English for farm. The manor of Kirkby was passed to Aldred's son Gospatric, whose daughter Godareda succeeded to his lands, but a clear line of succession does not emerge again until William Giffard in the thirteenth century, whose demesne lordship subsequently lapsed. The demesne titles were then in the possession of the Stapleton family until 1514 when Sir Thomas Metham let the lands to the Conyers. The heirs of the Methen family sold the manor in 1600 to Leonard Smelt. On the death in 1740 of Leonard Smelt, the M.P. for Northallerton, the manor passed to the Aislabie family who, via the distaff side, held it until 1845. At the turn of the twentieth century it passed to the Courage family. Castle Mound The manor of Fleetham passed to the Scrope family of Castle Bolton in the thirteenth century. It was passed down that line of descent via Lord Fauconberg and the Darcy family until 1670 when it was conveyed to Richard Smelt, younger brother of the then lord of Kirkby, thus uniting the two manors. The moated site in the parish at , south of the Three Tuns Inn, is a scheduled ancient monument. It is the site of moated manor house, built in about 1314, on the site of an earlier motte and bailey castle. ==Community== The village has a Church of England Primary School. It is within the catchment area of Northallerton School for Secondary education to the age of eighteen. There is a local Pub/Bed & Breakfast called The Black Horse and the village has a Shop/Post office. ==Governance and geography== The village lies within the Richmond UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Swale electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Leeming Bar ward of Hambleton District Council. The River Swale runs close to the village on the east side and the A1 motorway runs approx to the west of the village. The village also lies under the landing flight path of RAF Leeming. It lies west of the County town of Northallerton, south east of Catterick and north east of Bedale. ==Demography (of civil parish area)== {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" ! colspan=\\"17\\" Population - !

The property was bought in the 1720s by John Aislabie (1670–1742), MP for Ripon and Chancellor of the Exchequer, for his son William Aislabie, also MP for Ripon. The present house was built in the mid-1700s by William for his daughter, Ann Sophie, who had married William Lawrence. Subsequently, it was left (with property in Clint), by William's granddaughter, Miss Sophia Elizabeth Lawrence (1761–1845), to her second- cousin once-removed, Harry Edmund Waller III, JP, DL (1804–1869), a direct descendant of Edmund Waller, thence to his son Edmund Waller VI (1828–1898), who sold it in 1889 to Edward Courage of the Courage brewing family. Since then much of the estate has been sold off. The hall has gone through several disguises including hotel and \\"country retreat\\". It is currently privately owned with part let out as apartments. ===Pictures of Kirkby Fleetham Hall=== File:Kirkby Fleetham saloon pre 1889.jpgKirkby Fleetham Hall's saloon pre 1889.

Dave Rat writes articles for various professional sound magazines and has been asked to speak at sound conventions and events such as AES. He has designed speakers and sound equipment such as the MicroWedge, which is manufactured by Eastern Acoustic Works and is now a familiar monitor wedge on many worldwide tours. Dave Rat wrote a column for Live Sound International magazine entitled, \\"Rat Tales\\" in the November 2006 issue and another in the May 2007 issue.http://www.livesoundint.com/ On May 22, 2006 Dave Rat started a blog entitled \\"Roadies In The Midst\\" on the Rat Sound Systems Inc. website chronicling his experiences as Front of House sound engineer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their Stadium Arcadium tour. At the time he had acted as their Front of House (FOH) engineer for the past 19 years. The tour ended in August 2007. However, Dave continues to post entries discussing the adjustment back to normal life. He went back out as Front of House engineer for the Blink 182 Reunion Tour and likewise chronicled his exploits on that long-running arena and amphitheater tour in 2009. On May 15, 2011, Dave announced through his Twitter page that rehearsals were underway for the upcoming Red Hot Chili Peppers tour, which was expected to last two years. In December 2005 Dave innovated a unique sound system design based on two side-by-side speaker systems that he called The Double Hung PA. The outer stereo speakers reproduced guitar, bass, toms and cymbals and the inner speakers reproduced vocals, kick and snare. Since no single instrument or vocal was sent to both systems, comb filtering and interference issues were avoided while system clarity was increased. The Red Hot Chili Peppers toured with the Double Hung System for the duration of their Stadium Arcadium tour. In July 2008, the Brazil-based sound company Gabisom implemented the side-by-side PA concept for the Rock in Rio festival in Portugal and in 2009 Pennsylvania based sound company, Clair Brothers, provided touring artists U2 with an in-the-round stadium sized sound system, based on the same double hung PA concept. In 2009 Dave began working on several steerable sub woofer array concepts which he implemented on the Blink 182 reunion tour. The Vortex, Slotfire and V-Fire configurations describe methods of arranging and delaying conventional sub woofers such that low frequency sound bleed onto stage is reduced and horizontal subwoofer coverage to the audience is steerable. Dave worked with Soundgarden in the Summer of 2011 on their North American tour. Following that, Rat again worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their 2011-13 I'm with You tour and the band's 2013-14 tour that followed. He again worked with them on their 2016-17 The Getaway World Tour. On January 12, 2017, Rat announced that after nearly 26 years working with the Chili Peppers he would no longer be the sound engineer for the band following their January 21, 2017 show in Minnesota. Rat said \\"I truly love Flea, Anthony, Chad, Josh and all my dear and close friends I consider family both on the road now and those that have moved on to other adventures over the years.

McCarney resigned after going 4–8 in his final season, despite five bowl appearances during his tenure, the most of any Iowa State coach. Chizik's contract with ISU was a six-year deal worth a guaranteed $6.75 million. With incentives, the total had the potential to be more than $10 million.

However, less than one month later, Willis left Auburn to coach for the University of Alabama. Ted Roof would eventually replace Willis and serve as Auburn's linebacker coach and defensive coordinator. Roof had previously been the defensive coordinator at Minnesota before coming to Auburn. Chizik hired Gus Malzahn as his offensive coordinator. Malzahn enjoyed the nation's top offense at Tulsa the previous two seasons. He subsequently hired Curtis Luper and Trooper Taylor, both of whom were coaching at Oklahoma State, to coach running backs and wide receivers. Chizik also brought Jay Boulware from his ISU staff to be the special teams coordinator and hired former Auburn player Tracy Rocker away from Arkansas to coach the defensive line. The final hire was UNC linebackers coach Tommy Thigpen as safeties coach. Chizik's incentive-laden contract at Auburn was for five years with a salary of approximately $1.9 million per year, an $800,000 increase from his Iowa State contract. Iowa State was paid $750,000 by Chizik to be released from his contract which was paid by a loan from Auburn that was forgiven $150,000 for every year Chizik coaches, and would have been paid off entirely if he reached the end of the five-year deal. For the BCS Championship winning 2010 season, Chizik earned a base salary of $2.1 million plus bonuses worth an additional $1.1 million, including $500,000 for 13 wins, an SEC title, a BCS bowl appearance and winning the AP SEC Coach of the Year and an additional $600,000 for winning the BCS Championship Game.

The next year, he led the team to a 14–0 record and the BCS National Championship—the first undisputed national championship in school history. With the loss of several players from that team who opted to go pro, Chizik's third team slipped to 8–5. The 2012 season was the first season that Chizik did not have Gus Malzahn on staff; Malzahn had accepted a Head Coaching Position at Arkansas State following the 2011 season. The 2012 season was extremely disappointing as the team finished 3–9 and was outscored 150–21 in its final three SEC games—including a 49–0 loss to Alabama in the Iron Bowl. Overall, Auburn went 33–19 during Chizik's tenure as head football coach. Chizik was released after four seasons, and Auburn bought out his contract for $11.09 million. Chizik got $7.5 million based on his December 1 contractual buyout amount and assistant coaches got the remainder. His record at Auburn was 33-19. However, not counting the 2010 national title season, his record was 19-19, including 7-17 in SEC play.

The 2014 team ranked 120th nationally in overall defense. Through 11 games, Chizik's defense had surrendered 384 yards per game, a major factor in the Tar Heels going on a school record eleven-game winning streak and earning their 1st ACC Coastal Division championship.

Home versions were released for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, SNES, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and Microsoft Windows. A version for Game.com was announced, but cancelled. Hangtime was the third basketball game by the original development team behind the NBA Jam series. The title was changed due to the NBA Jam name being acquired by Acclaim Entertainment, the publisher of the games for the home market. Acclaim's NBA Jam Extreme was released the same year as Hangtime. Features introduced in Hangtime included character creation, alley oops, and double dunks. A software update known as NBA Maximum Hangtime was released for the arcades later in the life cycle. A sequel, NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC, was released in 1999. The theme song \\"Whatcha Gonna Do?\\" was produced by rapper M-Doc of Indasoul Entertainment. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is largely the same as the Midway's NBA Jam games, with some additions. One of the most prominent additions is the \\"Create Player\\" feature, which allows players to create a custom basketball player, specifying height, weight, power, shooting, and defensive skills using a limited number of attribute points. Created players can be made more powerful as players earn additional attribute points by winning games. The game retains many of the same rules of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition, including the two-on-two match ups, statistics tracking, legal pushing and \\"on fire\\" mode. Additions to the gameplay include spin moves, alley oops and double slam dunks - a slam dunk performed after one team member in the middle of a dunk passes to the other member. Alley-oops and double dunks can trigger the new \\"team fire\\" mode in which both team members are on fire. Each team now has five members of the roster to choose from. The original arcade version features team rosters from the 1995-96 NBA season, while the home console versions feature team rosters that were accurate to the 1996-97 NBA season. The player can select from any of the 29 NBA teams and match them in four quarters of NBA basketball (three minutes each), with three-minute overtimes if necessary. Just as in the NBA Jam games, the game can keep track of the teams a player has beaten using a player's created ID and PIN. Optionally, the player can load their created player. Players using their ID face off against a series of NBA teams, starting with the Vancouver Grizzlies and ending with the Chicago Bulls (who were on their way to being NBA champions at the time of the game's release). After beating all 29 teams, the player faces off against a number of secret characters. New to the game is a three-digit \\"combination lock\\" feature. Similar to the \\"Kombat Kodes\\" in Mortal Kombat 3, the feature allows players to enter codes on the Match Up screen that alter the game's appearance and/or gameplay. The initial arcade version and the home versions included an NBA trivia quiz at the end of each game played. Answering enough trivia questions correctly in the arcade game originally qualified players for a prize drawing, while on home versions it gives players more attribute points for their created players. ==Home versions== Midway released home versions of the game for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, as well as for the previous generation's consoles, the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. Funcom developed the Genesis and Super Nintendo versions. In 2020, Tastemakers LLC, under its Arcade1Up brand, released a 3/4 scale arcade cabinet that included Hangtime, alongside its precursors NBA Jam and NBA Jam: Tournament Edition. Code Mystics developed this version of Hangtime, a largely faithful emulation of the arcade original, but with some players omitted due to issues with licensing. ==Reception== Computer and Video Games dubbed Hangtime \\"the real, and quite worthy, successor to NBA Jam TE\\". The graphics improvements were lauded, as were the new features, moves and the created player feature. A reviewer for Next Generation likewise attested that \\"NBA Hangtime has all the playable qualities of NBA Jam, plus a slew of perks that make this worthy of your arcade quarters.\\" He was particularly impressed with the Create a Player mode, and said the fact that this costs an extra quarter is more than balanced by the fact that the custom player is permanently written into the arcade cabinet's memory. Despite this, he scored it only 3 out of 5 stars. The home ports received mixed reviews. In contrast to their reviews for the arcade version, most critics remarked that the game does not offer enough new features over NBA Jam, though they disagreed as to how much of a problem this is. Reviewing the Nintendo 64 version, Air Hendrix of GamePro concluded that \\"Jam-style hoops is nothing new, but Hangtime does it with enough flash and freshness to keep you happily dunkin' like a fool.\\" He cited the selection of players, numerous secrets, smooth graphics, multiplayer matches, and create-a-player mode. He rated the Genesis version lower in every category except control, noting the weaker sound effects and announcer's voice. However, he gave it a similar recommendation. GamePros The Rookie found that the Super NES version likewise suffers from inferior graphics and sound but is still highly enjoyable to play. Doug Perry of IGN also praised the create a player feature, calling it \\"easily one of the coolest elements of the game, and separates it from the pack.\\" Perry wrote that the port didn't make much use of the N64's capabilities, but called it a \\"fun, arcade-perfect port that will bring most basketball fans lots (sic) enjoyment.\\" GameSpot was far more negative, with Jeff Gerstmann reviewing the N64 version and writing that the game only featured \\"minor changes\\" and concluding \\"Unless you've been shooting digital hoops in a cave for the past few years, you've seen it all before.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation agreed: \\"Basically, if you've played NBA Jam, then you've played most of NBA Hangtime.\\" He further criticized that aside from the support for four players without the use of a multitap, the game make poor use of the Nintendo 64's capabilities, with 2D graphics and a low frame rate. He went so far as to say that the Super NES version of NBA Jam looks equally good and plays better due to the more appropriate controller. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly had a more middling response. Joe Rybicki, similarly to Gerstmann and Next Generation, said the game \\"offers basically nothing new, except updated players and bigger character sprites.\\" Co-reviewer Todd Mowatt, while criticizing that the AI tends towards goal-tending, felt the game was an overall improvement over the 16-bit basketball games. The PlayStation version was criticized for its long loading times and rampant slowdown, and reviews uniformly recommended buying the Nintendo 64 version instead. Kraig Kujawa was far more positive about the PC version, saying that it was an accurate conversion, although lamenting that it didn't include online play. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed NBA Hangtime as the 5th best arcade game of all time. ==Maximum Hangtime== NBA Maximum Hangtime is an upgrade released in late 1996 to the arcade version of NBA Hangtime featuring the 1996-1997 NBA rosters. Otherwise, the gameplay is essentially the same except for the addition of a hidden \\"hot spot\\" on the court for each player where they shoot more accurately. \\"Maximum\\" also has some additional secret codes and hidden players. ==References== Category:1996 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cancelled Game.com games Category:Funcom games Category:National Basketball Association video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Jonathan Hey Category:Video games with digitized sprites Category:Windows games Category:Midway video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"NBA Hangtime"},{"id":"6215231","text":"Beinwil may refer to: in Switzerland: * Beinwil (Freiamt) in the canton of Aargau * Beinwil am See in the canton of Aargau * Beinwil, Solothurn, location of the Beinwil Abbey ","title":"Beinwil"},{"id":"6215257","text":"Christopher Allen Codiroli (born March 26, 1958) is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues in 1982–1988 and 1990.

The organization, named GLOBE, contacts Bruno via his computer and a special gadget watch, and is completely unaware of its top spy's young age, as he hides behind a computer-simulated avatar of a full-grown man (in the image of Bruce Willis). The members of GLOBE that Bruno works with in person, such as Jarlsburg (voiced by Tony Jay), and Harris (voiced by Mark Hamill), are also unaware that GLOBE does not know Bruno's actual age, and assume that the organization must know what it is doing in sending the boy into dangerous situations. The episodes consist of Bruno managing to live a double life without his parents' or friends' knowledge (for example, in one episode he tells his parents that he is camping in the garden and he sets up a torch to project a fake silhouette of himself onto the side of the tent, so that it looks like he is inside it). Meanwhile, with an alibi set up, Bruno will be out saving the world, or foiling a major heist with the aid of his British spy partner Jarlsburg (in one episode, one of Bruno's classmates catches Bruno on camera in the process of carrying out a spy mission and tries to blackmail him; however, Bruno erases the videotape and his secret is safe; his classmate was unable to expose him). Later in the series, Jarlsburg quits being Bruno's partner, after hesitating to fire a weapon in fear that he will hit Bruno. Bruno objects to Jarley quitting the team. Jarley eventually comes to his senses and returns to being Bruno's partner. He apologizes to Bruno for quitting. In the course of each mission, they usually meet Harris (a spoof of the character \\"Q\\" in the James Bond books and films) who supplies Bruno with gadgets, which Bruno usually finds a use for later on in the episode. As well as voicing the title character, Willis was one of the executive producers and also co-wrote and sang the theme song for the show with backing singers. ==Episode list== { class= FFFFFF\\" !

The entire site of Beinwil Abbey is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. The abbey was founded around 1100, probably by the local nobility. It was first mentioned in 1147. After conflicts arising from the territorial claims of the towns of Solothurn and Basel against the Counts of Thierstein, who acted as the abbey's Vögte (lords protectors), it was burnt down in 1445. After Beinwil had been taken over by Solothurn in 1519, the town authorities impounded much of the abbey's possessions. By the 16th century, only a few monks were left in the abbey, and it was formally dissolved in 1554. A small community remained, the care of which was assumed firstly by Einsiedeln Abbey, in 1589, and then, from 1622, by Rheinau Abbey. As no monastic revival could be achieved due to the remote location, it was decided to re-settle the community at Mariastein Abbey, a new foundation in a pilgrimage center, which took place in 1648. In anticipation of this, Mariastein became a member of the Swiss Congregation, now part of the Benedictine Confederation. From Mariastein, at the end of the 18th century, it was at length possible to revive Beinwil, and at that time the church and the monastic premises were rebuilt. The abbey was however suppressed in 1874 by plebiscite during the Kulturkampf, and the community of Mariastein went into exile. The abbey church, dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa, was destroyed by fire in 1978. It has now been comprehensively restored and a high altar has been installed, dated about 1700, from Bellwald. The former abbey was used as an ecumenical conference and retreat center from 1982 until 2018. It is now an Orthodox Monastery. ==Politics== In the 2007 federal election, the most popular party was the FDP, which received 48.03% of the vote.

They inhabit Tajikistan's Sughd province in the valleys of the Yaghnob, Qul and Varzob rivers. The Yaghnobis are considered to be descendants of the Sogdian-speaking peoples who once inhabited most of Central Asia beyond the Amu Darya River in what was ancient Sogdia. They speak the Yaghnobi language, a living Eastern Iranian language (the other living members being Pashto, Ossetic and the Pamir languages). Yaghnobi is spoken in the upper valley of the Yaghnob River in the Zarafshan area of Tajikistan by the Yaghnobi people, and is also taught at schools.Inside the New Russia (1994): Yagnob It is considered to be a direct descendant of Sogdian and has often been called Neo-Sogdian in academic literature. The 1926 and 1939 census data gives the number of Yaghnobi language speakers as approximately 1,800. In 1955, M. Bogolyubov estimated the number of Yaghnobi native speakers as more than 2,000. In 1972, A. Khromov estimated 1,509 native speakers in the Yaghnob valley and about 900 elsewhere. The estimated number of Yaghnobi people is approximately 25,000. The Sogdian language is one of the Iranian languages, along with Bactrian language, Khotanese Saka, Persian language, Tadjik language, Pashto language, the Kurdish languages and Parthian language. It possesses a large historic literary corpus. ==History== Yaghnobi children. ===Antiquity=== Their traditional occupations were in agriculture, growing produce such as barley, wheat, and legumes as well as breeding cattle, oxen and asses. There were traditional handicrafts including weaving which was mostly done by the men. The women worked on moulding earthenware crockery. Большая Советская Энциклопедия The Yaghnobi people originated from the Sogdians, a people dominant in the area until the Muslim conquests in the 8th century when Sogdiana was defeated. In that period Yaghnobis settled in the high valleys. ===pre-20th century=== The ancient Sogdians fled to the Yaghnob Valley to escape the medieval Arab Caliphate, and their direct descendants, the Yaghnobi, lived there in peaceful isolation until the 1820s.Jamolzoda, A. Journey to Sogdiana's Heirs www.yagnob.org ===20th century=== Until the 20th century the Yaghnobis lived through their natural economy and some still do, as the area they originally inhabited is still remote from roads and power transmission lines. The first contact with Soviet Union in the 1930s during the Great Purge, led to many Yaghnobis being exiled, but perhaps the most traumatic events were the forced resettlement in 1957 and 1970, from the Yaghnob mountains to the semi-desert lowlands of Tajikistan. Вокруг света – Страны – - Таджикистан – Последние из шестнадцатой сатрапии left In the 1970s, Red Army helicopters were sent to valleys to evacuate the population, ostensibly because Yaghnobi kishlaks (villages) were considered at risk from avalanches. Some Yaghnobis reportedly died of shock in helicopters as they were moved to the plains. Many were then forced to work at cotton plantations on the plains. As a result of overwork and the change in environment and lifestyle, several hundred Yaghnobis died of disease. While some Yaghnobis rebelled and returned to the mountains, the Soviet government demolished the empty villages and the largest village on the Yaghnob River, Piskon, was removed from official maps. Officials also destroyed Yaghnobi religious books, the oldest of which was 600 years old. Yaghnobi ethnicity was officially abolished by the Soviet government. A group of Yaghnobi-speaking schoolchildren from Tajikistan Since 1983, families have begun to return to the Yaghnob Valley. The majority of those that remain on the plains tend to be assimilated with the Tajiks, as their children study in school in the Tajik language. The returnees live through the natural economy, and the majority remain without roads and electricity. ===21st century=== The Yaghnob Valley comprises approximately ten settlements, each housing between three and eight families. There are other small settlements elsewhere. The upper Yaghnob River Valley was protected by an until recently almost impenetrable gorge. They also live in and about the Amu Darya River, the Yaghnob River, the Yaghnob Valley, the Qul River, the Varzob rivers and the town of Anzob. == Religion == The Yaghnobi people are Sunni Muslims but a few also profess Isma'ilism. Some elements of pre-Islamic religion (probably Zoroastrianism) are still preserved.According to http://www.pamirs.org Zoroastrian Designs on Embrodiary ==Genetics== Ethnic Yaghnobi children of Tajikistan; the Yaghnobi people speak a language that is a direct descendant of medieval Sogdian. A group of Yaghnobi-speaking men from Tajikistan Y-DNA haplogroup R1 (R-M173), is found at a relatively high level of 48% among Yaghnobi males. However, detailed breakdowns of this result into subclades are unavailable. That means it is unclear if these examples of R1 are subclades common in Central Asia, Eastern Europe and South Asia, and associated with the Copper Age Kurgan Culture of the Eurasian Steppe and the spread of Iranian-speaking peoples, who entered the area circa 3000 BCE.R. Spencer Wells et al., \\"The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (August 28, 2001). While R1a1a, also known as R-M17, represents 16% of the total (and these individuals are also known to be negative for a rare subclade defined by M87), it is not clear whether the remaining 32% of Yaghnobi males belong to R1a(xR1a1a), which has been found in populations native to areas between South Asia and Western Europe, R1* (R-M173*), or R1b (R-M343). The spread of agriculture from the Middle East during the Neolithic era is associated with Haplogroup J, which is found at a significant level of 32%. Haplogroup L (M20), which is most common in modern South Asian populations, is found at a rate of approximately 10%. ==References *The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire * *PAMIRI TAJIKS AND YAGHNOBIS *On the Edge of the Snow - A Documentary (A Long Draft Trailer) Category:Iranian ethnic groups Category:Ethnic groups in Tajikistan Category:Central Asia Category:Yaghnob ","title":"Yaghnobi people"},{"id":"6215404","text":"NBA In The Zone '98 (Also known as NBA Pro 98 in Australia and Europe) is a basketball game for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation.

Initiated by the international charity campaigner Jon Dee, the project comprised a number of singles, compilations and a documentary. A special record label Life-Aid Armenia Records was established for producing and distributing the releases by Rock Aid Armenia. All of the Rock Aid Armenia projects were coordinated by Jon Dee. Dee started the project after overseeing the satellite transmission of footage from the Armenian earthquake zone which he distributed to TV newsrooms worldwide. Other key members of the team included film producer Paul Lovell (who produced and edited the Smoke on the Water documentary and who was co- executive producer of \\"Smoke on the Water\\"), Phil Banfield (manager of Ian Gillan who assisted on the track) and Rock Aid Armenia's Peter Welles-Thorpe, David Highton, Isobel Sarkissian and Sarah Kaye. ==\\"What's Going On\\" single== The first Rock Aid Armenia project was a remake of \\"What's Going On\\" that featured Aswad, Errol Brown, Richard Darbyshire, Gail Ann Dorsey, Boy George, David Gilmour, Nick Heyward, Mykaell S. Riley, Labi Siffre, Helen Terry, Ruby Turner, Elizabeth Westwood and the Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra. The B-side was \\"A Cool Wind Is Blowing\\", a piece of Armenian duduk music played by Djivan Gasparyan. The record was produced by Steve Levine and the executive producers were Fraser Kennedy and Jon Dee. This was released as a single on Island Records. ==\\"Smoke on the Water\\" single== Cover of Rock Aid Armenia single \\"Smoke on the Water\\" The project is most remembered for a re-recording of Deep Purple's famous hit song, \\"Smoke on the Water\\", with different vocalists singing each verse. The single made it to the UK Top 40 Singles Chart. The track was recorded by an elite group of contemporary progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal musicians who gathered at the historic Metropolis Studios in Chiswick, London. Recording began on July 8, 1989 and was completed over 5 different sessions. The rock musicians involved in the recording of the song included: Vocals: * Ian Gillan * Bruce Dickinson * Paul Rodgers * Bryan Adams Guitars: * Brian May * David Gilmour * Tony Iommi * Ritchie Blackmore * Alex Lifeson Bass: * Chris Squire Keyboards: * Geoff Downes * Keith Emerson Drums: * Roger Taylor John Paul Jones and Jon Lord were credited as \\"helping\\" behind the scenes with the track. The track's producers were Gary Langan and Geoff Downes. Talent co-ordination for the record was overseen by Jon Dee, with David Gilmour being the first to join up after a call from Dee. Ian Gillan's manager Phil Banfield also helped out with talent recruitment. \\"Paranoid\\" by Black Sabbath was used as a B-Side for the releases. In 1990, the song was released again with an alternate mix, one example of which was released by Dino Music, which unlike the rest, had \\"Black Night\\" also by Deep Purple as a B-side and had Tony Iommi's name incorrectly spelt on the front of it as \\"Tommy Iommi.\\" ===Rock Aid Armenia: The Making of Smoke on the Water documentary=== The recording sessions for the re-recording of \\"Smoke on the Water\\" were filmed and released in the same year on video as Rock Aid Armenia: The Making of Smoke on the Water, along with interviews and a video clip for the single. Film producer Paul Lovell produced and edited the final extended version of the documentary which was released on Laser Disc and VHS in Japan in 1991. The organization has since been made available for viewing via YouTube. ==The Earthquake Album == The other successful parts of the project were The Earthquake Album (which was the first UK charity album to go gold) and the accompanying The Earthquake Video. These compilations consisted of donated tracks by Pink Floyd, Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Gary Moore, Black Sabbath, Asia, Mike + The Mechanics, Rush, Deep Purple, Foreigner, Yes, Whitesnake and others.

She wrote a book, Who Gets the Drumstick?, about her blended family's experiences. The book was the basis for two motion pictures: the 1968 film, Yours, Mine and Ours, starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda; and 2005 remake, starring Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid. ==Biography== Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born in 1930 in Seattle, Washington. Her father owned a lumber mill, which came under severe stress during the Great Depression. Helen would later describe how her observations of her father would shape her personality, and in particular how it would teach her to value independence and problem- solving.Helen Beardsley, Who Gets the Drumstick?, New York: Random House, 1965, pp. 17-18. Brandmeir trained as a nurse in Seattle. In 1949 at age 19 she married Richard North, then a chief petty officer in the United States Navy. Their marriage lasted for eleven years and produced eight children. In 1960, the Norths were stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington and Helen was six months pregnant with their eighth child, Teresa Rose. Now a Lieutenant, junior grade and A-3 Skywarrior bombardier navigator, North was killed on June 7, 1960, when the A-3 he was flying veered off the runway during takeoff at NAS Whidbey Island/Ault Field and crashed in 5 1/2 feet of water.Full Reports of A-3 Accidents, a3skywarrior.com; accessed June 13, 2018. Following Teresa's August 1960 birth in Oak Harbor, Washington, North relocated to San Leandro, California. She then married, secondly, on September 9, 1961 to Chief Warrant Officer Francis Louis \\"Frank\\" Beardsley, USN, who at the time served as Personnel Officer at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. A widower, Frank Beardsley brought 10 children from his first marriage; combined with Helen's eight children the newlyweds had 18 children. During the marriage the Beardsley had two children of their own. In 1964, they legally adopted each other's children. Helen's children unanimously agreed with the decision to change their names from North to Beardsley. The huge resulting family sparked nationwide interest in the Beardsleys, especially on how Frank and Helen handled the day-to-day logistics of raising such a large family. Media coverage and attention followed the family. The Beardsleys landed some celebrity endorsement contracts, and they sold the rights to their story to Desilu Productions. Desilu then produced the first of the two films based on the Beardsley's courtship, marriage, and combined large family. Helen Beardsley also appeared on the television show To Tell the Truth to tell the story of her family; she fooled two of the four panelists. After 30 years in the Navy, Frank Beardsley retired in 1966. Looking to buy a business, in 1968 he bought a nut and candy store named Morrow's Nut House in Monterey, California. Frank Beardsley operated the business with the help of the older children, including two sons who had returned from active duty in the Marines. At the time, Helen served on then- Governor Ronald Reagan's Advisory Council on the Status of Women. Later, the family owned three bakeries. Frank and Helen Beardsley's marriage lasted until her death in Healdsburg, California, on April 26, 2000, aged 70, from Parkinson's disease and a stroke. Frank Beardsley later remarried. He died on December 11, 2012 at 97. According to Kermit Schafer, a member of the audience on The Tonight Show provided a classic quip when the Beardsleys appeared on the show with all those children. The family had just left the stage, and the show had cut to a commercial break. Johnny Carson was in awe of the huge family and he said, \\"I have only three kids. I don't know how they do it.\\" Someone in the seats stood up and hollered, \\"Oh, yes, you do!\\" ==References *\\"Official\\" Yours, Mine and Ours Family Site *Helen North Beardsley on Find A Grave *Helen Beardsley on InfoPlease Category:1930 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:Catholics from Washington (state) Category:Catholics from California Category:American memoirists Category:American women memoirists Category:Writers from Seattle Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:20th-century memoirists ","title":"Helen Beardsley"},{"id":"6215439","text":"George Allen Frazier (born October 13, 1954), is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1978–1987, primarily as a set-up reliever.

Frazier was offered a college scholarship in baseball, football, and basketball. In 1981 while with the Yankees, Frazier tied a World Series record (with Lefty Williams) with 3 losses.

Although the founding of the Swiss Confederacy was first celebrated on this date in 1891 and annually since 1899, it has only been an official holiday since 1994. ==History== The date is inspired by the date of the Federal Charter of 1291, Pacte du Grütli, placed in \\"early August\\", when \\"three Alpine cantons swore the oath of confederation\\" (Schwyz, Uri and Unterwald), an action which later came to be regarded as the founding of Switzerland.\\" The document is one of several dozen pacts attested for the territory of Switzerland in the period of the mid-13th to mid-14th century. The foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy had been mostly associated with the Bund of Brunnen of 1315, or with the Rütlischwur, dated to 1307 by Aegidius Tschudi. The Federal Charter of 1291 first assumed great importance in a report by the Federal Department of Home Affairs of 21 November 1889, suggesting a celebration in Bern in 1891 that would combine the city's 700th anniversary with the Confederacy's 600th anniversary. The date of the Federal Charter came to replace the formerly more prominent, traditional date of 8 November Rütlischwur, 1307 in popular consciousness in the 20th century, specifically after the 650th anniversary celebrations of 1941. It has been an official holiday since 1994, following the acceptance of a federal popular initiative in its favour in 1993. 1 August is celebrated each year with paper lantern parades, bonfires, hanging strings of Swiss flags, and fireworks. ==Town-specific celebrations== Fireworks in Basel The day of independence is typically celebrated at a local municipality level, though certain events draw nationwide attention. Since the mid-19th century, Schaffhausen has illuminated the nearby 25-meter-high Rhine Falls for special events. Beginning in 1920, the waterfall has been regularly lit for the national holiday and since 1966 is now lit only for this holiday. At the historic location of Rütli Meadow above Lake Lucerne, a representational celebration is staged in the location where the legendary pledge of alliance, the Rütlischwur is said to have taken place. In Basel there are fireworks at the Rhine on the evening of 31 July. File:1augustweggen.jpg\\"1. Augustweggen\\", bread baked to celebrate Swiss National Day ==Celebrations around the world== Until 2013, the largest Swiss National Day event in the USA was organized and held annually by the Swiss Benevolent Society of New York. Usually held in Manhattan, the event draws thousands of Swiss, Swiss-Americans and Friends of Switzerland from around New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. The event was held at the group's former hospice in Mount Kisco, New York during the 1970s. Since, 2014 the event format has changed with the motto Back to the roots. It is a great family event again where one can enjoy everything ranging from Swiss sausages to Raclette, Swiss wine, bands, a DJ and kids' corner. Since 2014, the event has been organized by the Swiss Society of New York, the Swiss Benevolent Society of New York and the Consulate General of Switzerland in New York. Celebrations are also held in Washington, District of Columbia by the Swiss Club of Washington D.C. on the Swiss Embassy grounds, in Monterey County, California at the Swiss Rifle Club and in the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier in Swiss Park. The Swiss Park celebration features Swiss cultural events and games, including a crossbow competition. In Britain it is also Yorkshire Day, celebrating the county of Yorkshire. Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate, founded in 1919 by a Swiss baker, celebrate both of these days in its 6 cafe-tearooms across Yorkshire. For the National celebration, a festival is usually held every year, two Saturdays before the actual 1 August date to allow an opportunity for Swiss families based in the UK to attend prior to the long August summer break. Typically Swiss National Day is held at University College London, organised by the Swiss National Day London Committee, an independent group of volunteers, with the support of the Swiss Embassy London and other Swiss clubs such as City Swiss Club, New Helvetic Society and Unione Ticinese. Mont Sutton Quebec hosts one of the largest Swiss National Day celebrations outside Switzerland. Each year, it features one canton, with food and products from that canton. ==References * Swiss National Day New York, USA * Swiss National Day in London, UK * Swiss National Day in Quebec, CA Category:August observances Category:Swiss culture Category:National days ","title":"Swiss National Day"},{"id":"6215452","text":"NBA In The Zone '99 is a basketball game for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation, it was released in 1999.

This is opposed to a flipped image, which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis. Flopping can be used to improve the subjective aesthetic appeal of the image in question. == Use in advertising == There are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective. On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text. == Use in art == Cultural considerations come into play -- a picture of a person eating with their left hand may be flopped for publication in a Muslim publication, due to the strong taboo against eating with the left hand in Muslim society. Similarly, Vincent van Gogh took the trouble to etch some of his originals in mirror-reversed form so that when printed, people in the image would appear, correctly, as right-handed. An example of flopping is the use of Joseph Edward Southall's painting Fishermen and Boat as part of the art associated with Kate Bush's album Aerial. The picture is flopped, and the name \\"AERIAL\\" added to the boat. == Image flipping == Billy the Kid. (Flopped tintype photo) A common movie blooper is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called \\"flipped images\\". Flopped images are common because they can be used to correct continuity errors between shots and are hard to see without extensive examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites. One of the most famous flopped images is this picture of Billy the Kid carrying a Model 1873 Winchester rifle and a pistol belt with the pistol on his left. This led people to believe he was left-handed, but it was later revealed to be a flopped image due to the cartridge loading gate on the rifle being on the wrong side.The loading gate on a Model 1873 Winchester lever action rifle is on the right side of the receiver. ==In moviemaking== In James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" movie, the scenes of the ship at Southampton Pier were shot flopped, and later reversed. > \\"Oh, don't even talk to me about flopping\\", groans Winslet … \\"It made me > laugh when I saw sailors with 'ENIL RATS ETIHW' written across their > hats.\\"James Cameron's Titanic by Ed W.

It is an important section of the M0 ringroad around Budapest. The bridge cost 63 billion forints (approx. US$ 300M) to build and was officially opened on September 30, 2008; however, the National Transport Authority of Hungary has only issued temporary permits because of disagreement among suburban cities surrounding the bridge. An online naming poll to determine the new name of the recently built bridge caused controversy and received media attention when American comedians Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart won. ==Gallery== Image:Megyeri híd2.jpg Image:Megyeri bridge under construction.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri1.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri2.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri3.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri4.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri5.jpg Image:Civertanmegyeri6.jpg ==Technical information== The total length of the bridge is 1862m. Structurally it is composed of five parts: #Left quayside inundation area bridge: 148m #Main Danube-branch bridge (cable stayed): 590m with a span of 300m #Szentendre Island inundation area bridge: 559m #Szentendre Danube-branch bridge: 332m #Right quayside inundation area bridge: 218m ==Naming poll== The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport of Hungary organized a public vote online to solicit possible names for the new bridge. The three names with the most votes, as well as suggestions from local governments, cartographers, linguists and other experts, were to be reviewed by a government committee before a final name for the bridge was chosen. New nominations were accepted until August 21, 2006, and the voting ended on September 8, 2006. On August 1, 2006, Reuters reported that the top candidate according to the online poll was the \\"Chuck Norris híd\\", named for American action star Chuck Norris. (Chuck Norris facts reached the height of their popularity around this time.) On August 9, 2006, American satirist Stephen Colbert discussed the story on his comedy program The Colbert Report, instructing his viewers to visit the polling website and vote for him instead of Norris. The next day the number of votes for him had grown 230 times, and he now asked his viewers to follow a link from his own \\"Colbert Nation\\" website, to avoid \\"all that illegible Hungarian\\". Colbert's site also indirectly offered techniques for \\"stuffing the ballot box\\", as users of their forums created several automated scripts to cast multiple votes for Colbert. On August 15, 2006, he repeated his call to be voted top of the Hungarian poll, and by August 22, 2006, the \\"Stephen Colbert híd\\" was in first with 17 million votes, about 14 million votes ahead of the second-placed Zrínyi híd, named after the Croatian-Hungarian national hero, Miklós Zrínyi, and about 7 million more than the entire population of Hungary. The same day, the site announced a new round of voting, which would require registration to participate, and Colbert asked his viewers to \\"call off the dogs\\", requesting on his website that fans stop using scripts to vote. Despite this, the \\"Stephen Colbert híd\\" remained in the top position on the website in the second round. On September 14, 2006, András Simonyi—the ambassador of Hungary to the United States—announced on The Colbert Report that Stephen Colbert had won the vote. Unfortunately for Colbert, Ambassador Simonyi declared that under Hungarian law, Colbert would have to be fluent in Hungarian, and would have to be deceased in order to have the bridge named for him. However, after saying the rules could most likely be bent, he invited Colbert to visit Hungary and view the construction in person and gave him a Hungarian passport and a 10,000 HUF Bill, with an approximate value of, as the ambassador put it, 'fifty dollars, fifty good US dollars'. Colbert promptly tried to bribe him with said money.http://indavideo.hu/video/A_Stephen_Colbert_hid_sztori_vege ===Results=== {  + Round 1 Top Five ! Name ! Votes !

It stands at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers in Wichita, Kansas adjacent to the Mid-America All-Indian Center. Surrounding the base of the statue are multiple displays which describe the local tribes that used to inhabit this area, as well as several fire pits which sometimes light up to illuminate the statue at night. The fire pits, which are known as the Rings of Fire, are lit manually for public safety and run in 15-minute increments. They are generally lit once a night around 7 pm during the winter and sunset during the summer. ==History== The sculpture, commissioned by the city and private organizations to mark the United States Bicentennial, was erected in 1974. It has since become one of Wichita's most recognized and beloved symbols. A spring/summer 2006 project elevated the sculpture on a 30-foot rock promontory so it could be seen from farther away. A profile image of this statue comprises the motif adopted by the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, a U.S. Air Force flying unit which is based at nearby McConnell Air Force Base. From 1993 through 2004, an image of the statue, along with the words \\"Keeper of the Plains,\\" appeared on the tails of Boeing KC-135 air refueling tankers assigned to the 22nd ARW. ==In popular culture and the arts== The Keeper of the Plains was mentioned by Christian musician Rich Mullins in his 1991 song \\"Calling Out Your Name\\". ==Gallery== File:The Keeper of the Plains Wichita, Kansas.jpgThe Keeper at night lit from below and the footbridge spanning the Arkansas River (2013) Image:ThisIsAmbient- KeeperOfThePlains-Day.pngKeeper of the Plains in December, 2010.

Chuyhn studied a wide variety of martial arts under the tutelage of Jaang Saan Ying. Along with Choy Lay Fut, he was trained in other arts such as “Nam Ying Jao Kuyhnn” (Southern Eagle Claw) and “Ngok Fei Pai” (named after and created by the General, Ngok Fei). His training in these styles prepared him for what he would learn under both Wong Lam-Hoi and Wong Yan-Lam. Chyuhn first learned Lama Pai under the direction of Wong Lum Hoi. Such an accomplished martial artist was Chyuhn that he learned all of Wong Lum Hoi’s Lama Pai hand and weapon sets in under 7 years. Towards the end of his training he sought out the teachings of Wong Yan Lum upon his return to Guangdong. He spent many years learning different forms from Wong Yan Lum until he completed the Lama Pai style. Jyu Chuyhn was the only man who learned with both teachers and was accepted by both as a disciple. He learned the entire system and was given permission by both Wong Yan Lam and Wong Lam Hoi to pass on the Lama Pai system.

At the end of the 17th century, a wooden arena was built there. Until 1816, the island was used for dog hunts involving various animals such as bears, bulls, deer, and cows, although these were repeatedly banned. This is the origin of the island's name, which translates to hunt or chase. In 1931, Štvanice Stadium was built on the island, and originally consisted entirely of wood. This later became the ice skating centre of Prague until its demolition in 2011. Ice Hockey World Championships were held at the stadium four times: in 1933, 1938, 1947, and 1959. It was here that in 1947, the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team won the world championship for the first time. In 1986, a modern tennis arena was built on Štvanice, with nine outdoor and two indoor courts; the central court has a capacity of 8,000 seats and is the annual site of the ATP and WTA Prague Open tournaments. The island also has a roofed skatepark, and as such it is the only place which permits year-round skateboarding in Prague. In 2006, a neighbouring indoor skate bowl was added to the facility. In the eastern part of the island there used to be a public swimming pool, which in the 1990s had a nudist resort. This was of interest for being set up almost directly in the centre of Prague, near a hydropower plant and an adjustable water slalom track.

He contributed several books to the Arab library and his famous newspaper Al-Alam continued to form public opinion in Syria for two decades. ==Early life== Husrieh was born to a prominent family in Amara District in Old Damascus, where he was educated in its primary schools. He then continued his education at The Higher Arab Academy for Translation. In 1932, Husrieh began to write a weekly column for the daily, al-Sha'b. One year later, he co-founded the Syrian Labor Union in Damascus and helped establish branches in Aleppo, Homs, and Hama. ==Career== In 1936, Husrieh allied himself with Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, leader of the Syrian opposition to the National Bloc regime of President Hashim al-Atassi. Shahbandar and Husrieh spoke out against the Franco-Syrian Treaty that Atsasi had signed in Paris in 1936 that promised Syrian independence from France over a 25-year period. A portrait painting of renowned Syrian journalist, author, publisher and researcher, Izzat Husrieh. Husrieh argued that the National Bloc had given too many concessions to the French, including the right to maintain military bases in Syria for use in the event of war in Europe. Jamil Mardam Bey, the architect of the 1936 treaty who had become prime minister shortly after that, closed al-Sha'b and placed Husrieh under 24-hour surveillance. Husrieh retaliated by issuing a secret pamphlet entitled al-Istifham(Question mark) that criticized the National Bloc and its entire leadership, accusing them of establishing a dictatorship in Syria. In 1942, following the death of Shahbandar, Husrieh joined al-Istiqlal al-Arabi (Arab Independence), another anti-Bloc publication, and served as its editor-in-chief. In May 1944, Izzat Husrieh founded his own evening newspaper in Damascus called Al-Alam (The Flag), becoming editor-in-chief. When the Bloc achieved Syrian independence in 1946, Husrieh softened his criticism of them and allied himself with Bloc's successor, the National party. From 1944 to 1947, his career was supported by Prime Minister Saadallah al-Jabiri, who helped Husrieh to acquire the license of Al-Alam, until his death in 1947. In the 1940s, Husrieh wrote for the popular Damascus daily, al-Qabas (The Firebrand). When Syria and Egypt merged to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) in February 1958, he criticized the government of President Gamal Abdel Nasser and hailed the coup that ousted the union in September 1961. From 1961 to 1963, he allied himself with the post- Nasser government of President Nazim al-Qudsi, who like Husrieh, had supported Shahbandar during his youth. In March 1963, the Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party came to power and pledged to restore the UAR. The officers closed Husrieh's newspaper, terminated his civil rights, and forced him into retirement. Husrieh remained in Syria and worked until 1970 as a publisher without writing any articles in the press. ==Community service== Husrieh also worked with an excavation team to renovate historical sites and contributed in building several mosques in Damascus. He co-founded a committee to help protect the old quarters of the Syrian capital and started up another committee to monitor human rights issues in Syrian prisons.

Some of his early influences included Chuck Berry, James Burton and Scotty Moore. While still a teenager in Woodstock, he became acquainted with Levon Helm and was exposed to the Band's music. Weider went on to become an accomplished studio session player in cities such as Atlanta and Nashville but eventually returned to Woodstock and was invited to become the Band's sole guitarist in 1985, remaining until the group's dissolution in 2000 following the death of Rick Danko in late 1999.\\"Jim Weider takes the TCAN stage Friday\\" - The Dedham Transcript As a member of The Band, he opened for the Grateful Dead at their final show.

For amplification, Weider uses a combination of Fender amplifiers and his own signature series JW40 amp, designed in conjunction with Fargen Amplification, Inc. He is also the co- designer of the AnalogMan King of Tone pedal, which he uses on his pedalboard. In addition to his work with the Band and his own musical group, the Jim Weider Band, Weider has performed and recorded with numerous other musicians, including Robbie Dupree, Dr. John, Graham Parker, Keith Richards and Bob Weir. He has also played alongside Keith Richards and Scotty Moore, who worked with Elvis Presley. He is also featured in several instructional videos produced by Homespun Video. Following the departure of Jimmy Vivino in early 2009, Weider performed with the Levon Helm Band until Helm's death in 2012. The latest incarnation of The Band's history, The Weight Band, originated inside the barn of Levon Helm in 2012 when Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante, both former members of The Band, were performing \\"Songs of The Band\\" with Garth Hudson, Jimmy Vivino and Byron Isaacs. After receiving support from fans, Weider, Ciarlante and Isaacs decided to continue the tradition of performing songs from The Band and invited Brian Mitchell and Marty Grebb -who contributed to both the Jericho and Jubilation albums- to complete their sound. The Weight Band later added Albert Rogers (2016) and Michael Bram (2017). In July 2017, PBS's Infinity Hall Live program began airing a televised performance by The Weight Band, featuring new music by the band. In January 2018, Weider announced the first studio album for the Weight Band, World Gone Mad. \\"Common Man\\" - co- written by Levon Helm - was released as the first single. Recently, The Weight Band was announced as the first headliner for the new Folk & Americana Music Series, a celebration of the genre's rich musical history and influence, at the Boch Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Their first guest was the Guthrie Family (Woody Guthrie). In addition to playing in The Weight Band, Weider tours with G.E.

It was the seat of the former municipality Evrostina. Its population stands at 1,080 (2011 census) but rises dramatically during the holiday season and many of the houses and flats are second residencies to people living mostly in Athens (142 km) or Patras (73 km). Its nearest main town is Corinth (50 km). One of its main characteristics is that its coastal houses and flats are flanked by the old national road to the south and give directly onto the pebbled sea shore to the north. Due to its restricted parking facilities and the infrequent train service, it is not a stop-over town for passing traffic, or amenable to day trips. Its name derives from its geographical location, squeezed between the mountains and the deep Corinthian Sea. Derven means narrow passage or path in Ottoman Turkish. It was founded early 19th century by inhabitants of the nearby village of Zacholi who exported and processed raisins. Its trading apogee came between 1923–1940 when hundreds of workers processed the so-called Corinth raisins that arrived by boat on its small port. The port no longer exists. The northern coastline of the Peloponnese has been afflicted by erosion and sea level rise for many years. More specifically, in the region of Derveni, Corinthia, on 29 February 2012, generalised erosion of the coastal zone was observed on account of seabed subsidence (up to 30 m) along the coastline, destroying dozens of houses and business premises. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&reference;=E-2012-003604&language;=EN It is linked by rail to Athens and Patras. ==Notable people== *Miltos Manetas, Painter and Internet artist, Founder of the InternetPavilion ==References *Municipality of Evrostina Category:Populated places in Corinthia ","title":"Derveni, Corinthia"},{"id":"6215600","text":"Tașlîc (Romanian; , ) is a commune and village in Transnistria, Moldova, the second largest commune in the Grigoriopol sub-district.

It is one of the world's leading manufacturers of products from carbon. The company portfolio ranges from carbon and graphite materials and solutions to carbon fibers and composites. With 29 production sites around the globe (16 in Europe, 8 in North America and 5 in Asia), and a service network in over 100 countries, SGL Carbon is a globally operating company. The company headquarters is Wiesbaden, Germany. The SGL share had been included in the German MDAX since 1995 and fell in the smaller SDAX in September 2014. In March 2020, the Deutsche Boerse announced that SGL Carbon will no longer be a constituent of the SDAX due to the low free float market capitalization. In 2019 the company generated sales revenue of €1,087 million and employed 5,100 staff worldwide. ==History== SGL Carbon AG originated in 1992 from a merger between SIGRI GmbH (Germany) and Great Lakes Carbon (USA) to share a company according to German law. (Some information about the history of Great Lakes Carbon can be found on the Wikipedia page for its founder George Skakel). SIGRI traced back to Gebr. Siemens & Co (Gesco), founded in Berlin as a subsidiary of Siemens AG in 1878. The company originally produced carbon. In 1920, the company set up a plant in Meitingen (Bavaria) and in 1928 merged with Planiawerke AG für Kohlefabrikation in Ratibor (Upper Silesia) to form the new Siemens Planiawerke AG für Kohlefabrikate. After the Second World War, the Meitingen plant of the Siemens Planiawerke AG für Kohlefabrikate merged with Chemische Fabrik Griesheim to form Siemens Plania Chemisches Werk Griesheim, the majority of which was acquired by Hoechst AG in 1953. In 1967, as a result of the merger with electrode manufacturing at Hoechst AG, Siemens Planiawerke AG für Kohlefabrikate also became a majority holding of the chemical company. There it was amalgamated with the Siemens Plania Chemisches Werk Griesheim and other enterprises of Hoechst AG. In 1985 it was renamed SIGRI GmbH and finally Hoechst AG acquired total ownership in 1989. After the merger with Great Lakes Carbon, Hoechst AG retained a 50 percent stake in the new company. The remaining participation was sold in 1996 as part of restructuring of the Hoechst Group. Since then SGL Carbon AG is publicly traded. In the course of the strategic realignment in 2017, SGL Carbon sold its former core business with graphite electrodes and the business with cathodes, furnace linings and carbon electrodes. At the beginning of 2018, the company sold its shares in the joint venture SGL-Kümpers to the former joint venture partner Kümpers GmbH. SGL Carbon's Headquarters in Wiesbaden-Schierstein (Germany) Also in 2018, SGL Carbon acquired the shares in the joint venture Benteler-SGL from Benteler AG and announced the gradual acquisition of BMW Group's shares in the joint venture SGL Automotive Carbon Fibers (ACF). ==Group structure== The company has the following structures: The function of the Board of Management follows the principle of a management holding which acts as a legally independent entity (SGL Carbon SE). The operating business is divided into the two business units Graphite Materials & Systems (GMS) and Composites - Fibers & Materials (CFM). ==Products/applications and markets== The Graphite Materials & Systems business unit operates primarily in the areas of graphite specialties. The main customer industries of the varied products and applications are process equipment, the automotive and the chemical industry, electronics, energy, battery, environmental protection the semiconductor industry including LED, industrial furnace construction and mechanical engineering, medical technology and pharmacy as well as nuclear technology. The Composites - Fibers & Materials product portfolio covers carbon fibers, braking and clutch components as well as composite materials and components. The focus of the business unit is the development and market launch of materials, products and solutions. Currently there is a high demand, particularly for composite materials, which feature low weight on the one hand and can withstand high loads on the other. In addition, they are corrosion- resistant and only expand slightly when exposed to heat. For this reason, there is an increasing demand in the aerospace and automotive industry, in mechanical engineering and process equipment, medical technology as well as in the sports industry and energy generation (wind turbines). ==Locations== At the end of 2018, SGL Carbon had a total of 31 production sites (17 in Europe, 8 in North America and 6 in Asia). In Germany - in addition to its headquarters in Wiesbaden - the company has a total of five production facilities, located in Meitingen (near Augsburg), in Bonn in Wackersdorf, in Limburg and in Willich. In addition, SGL Carbon has an extensive service and distribution network with which it supplies its customers in approximately 100 countries worldwide. ==Electrode cartel and antitrust litigation== In the field of graphite electrodes for electric arc furnaces, SGL Carbon was one of eight companies that operated a cartel and fixed prices between July 1992 and June 1997. The primary purpose of the cartel was to fix the price and allocate the volume of graphite electrodes sold in the United States and elsewhere.SGL Carbon Plea, filed with DOJ SGL Carbon was among the companies accused and fined for operating as a cartel and price fixing in the carbon electrode business. This was initially discovered in the US but later the European commission added their own case and fine. Eight companies were fined under the EEC action, the largest were Germany's SGL Carbon AG and UCAR International (Now Graftech International Ltd. of the United States). In the finding the EEC states: :The Commission's decision comes after a thorough investigation, which established that the eight producers, which together account for the quasi totality of the production world-wide, operated a secret cartel during most of the 90s resulting in considerably higher prices than if the companies had competed against each other.EUROPA press release: Commission fines eight companies in graphite electrode cartel SGL Carbon received the highest fine of the eight conspirators, amounting to €80.2 million in Europe in addition to the $135 million in the United States. To protect itself against damage payments for price fixing, SGL Carbon sought Chapter 11 protection in the United States. The Third Circuit adopted a \\"good faith\\" test and rejected a bankruptcy petition filed only because of the magnitude of anticipated antitrust claims.Findlaw Case Reference ==Sponsorship== SGL Carbon was the main sponsor to the German Cycling team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and namesake of the football stadium from the German team FC Augsburg in the first German league from 2011 to 2015. ==References== Category:Chemical companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Wiesbaden Category:Societates Europaeae ","title":"SGL Carbon"},{"id":"6215647","text":"\\"'Movin' On\\" is a song written and recorded by English girl group Bananarama.

This is also the second single released by Bananarama as a duo (following Cruel Summer 89), as Jacquie O'Sullivan had left the group the prior year. It was produced by Mike Stock and Pete Waterman, two-thirds of the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) trio who had produced a bulk of Bananarama's past hits. \\"Movin' On\\" is a pop song with disco influences, as Stock and Waterman attempted to create an ABBA-like sound for the Please Yourself album. The single met with mixed reviews and moderate success when released, peaking at number 24 in the UK singles chart.

In 2012, the song was re-released by Bananarama on their Now or Never EP in a new version. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard called it a \\"tasty dance confection\\", adding that \\"the group's trademark unison vocals are now more tightly focused and interesting to the ear.

Several muscular men pose on podiums as live Grecian statues. As a nod to their trademark silliness, they can be seen tussling in the midst of their choreographed descent down the stairs.

He is the brother of executed Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa, and the son of Ogoni chief Jim Wiwa. Wiwa is an internationally renowned expert on the effects of globalisation, especially as it relates to the highly controversial business practices of Royal Dutch Shell in the Niger Delta. Vice-chairman of the Toronto chapter of the Sierra Club Canada and an active member of Amnesty International, Wiwa is frequently called upon to advocate for development programs in Canada and abroad and to campaign for increased corporate responsibility. This work has taken him to Ireland, which he visits in support of the Shell to Sea campaign. Currently, he is the Country Director for the Clinton Health Access Initiative in Nigeria. Owens Wiwa addresses a Shell to Sea rally in Dublin after the Rossport Five are released from prison ==Education== Wiwa graduated from medical school at the University of Calabar in 1985 and completed his internship at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. In 1989, he founded his own private clinic in the Ogoni town of Bori. ==Activism== The six kingdoms of the Ogoni—Gokana, Ken-Khana, Nyo-Khana, Eleme, Babbe and Tai—are situated in the southeast corner of Nigeria's Rivers State in the heart of the Niger River delta. A tribe of fishermen and farmers, the Ogoni are an ethnic group, numbering over two million people. In 1958, Royal Dutch Shell discovered petroleum in Ogoniland. Over the next few years, Shell identified a total of six oil fields in the Ogoni territory which it began exploiting through a joint venture with the government. Over the next 35 years, this venture—in which the government was a majority partner and Shell the largest private partner—produced 634 million barrels of oil worth US$30 billion. Chevron, ExxonMobil, Texaco, BP, Agip and Elf Aquitaine also have operations in the delta and offshore, but their combined presence is dwarfed by Shell's. In 1990, Ken Saro-Wiwa, a popular writer, television personality and businessman, founded the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a non-violent action group which called for Ogoni political self-determination and a greater share of petroleum revenue from the Nigerian government, as well as the ownership of the petroleum beneath their land. MOSOP claimed that pollution resulting from Shell's oil extraction turned their once abundant kingdoms into an ecological wasteland, their air reeking of sulphur, their water holes and creeks poisoned with petroleum, their night sky turned by burning gas flares into a perpetual twilight. For its part, Shell insisted that allegations of environmental devastation in Ogoniland were not true. \\"Any industrial enterprise, including oil operations, has an impact on the environment, and this is true in Ogoni,\\" Shell said in an official statement. \\"A further impact on the lives of people in the area comes from the rapidly expanding population which has caused deforestation, erosion and over-farming leading to degraded soil.\\" At his clinic in the heart of Ogoniland, Owens witnessed an increase in cases of asthma, bronchitis and skin disease caused by the deteriorating environment. To address the social and environmental issues affecting his patients, Owens joined his brother's movement in 1992, becoming the chair of MOSOP's Social Welfare and Health Committee. As MOSOP's spokesman, Ken brought the plight of the Ogoni people to the world stage. Throughout 1991 and 1992, he spoke at environmental conferences and high-profile world events, most notably addressing the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples in Geneva. In December 1992, MOSOP issued an ultimatum to Shell, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, calling for $6 billion in rent and royalties and $4 billion in compensation for environmental devastation—and all within 30 days or it would be assumed that they intended to quit Ogoniland. There was no reply. A month later, a Shell worker was rumoured to have been assaulted and Shell announced it was pulling out of Ogoniland to avoid placing its workers at risk. In February 1993, Shell held a meeting in London to discuss what it should do about the situation in Ogoniland in general and Ken Saro-Wiwa in particular. The government of Nigeria was also working on the \\"Saro-Wiwa problem\\". On 28 April 1993, a US contracting firm accompanied by Nigerian military personnel was laying pipelines for Shell in Ogoniland. When a number of farmers complained about the bulldozing of their crops, ten thousand Ogonis held four days of peaceful demonstrations to protest the construction. The government responded by bringing in soldiers to suppress the crowds and, on the last day, one of the protesters was shot dead. Amnesty International issued an alarm over this incident. Tensions in the delta increased in June 1993 after Saro-Wiwa was arrested and charged with sedition. After extensive pressure by Amnesty International and other groups, he was released a month later on bail. During this period, the government dispatched soldiers to seal off Ogoniland from the outside world, but on 30 July, the police were mysteriously removed from the area. Five days later, the coastal Ogoni town of Kaa was attacked and destroyed. More than 100 people were killed and 8,000 were left homeless. The military described the incident as an \\"ethic clash\\" between the Ogoni and their neighbours, the Andoni. Both tribes denied any involvement or that they even had a dispute. In the autumn of 1993, ten more Ogoni villages were attacked with Kaa community now completely sacked. Seven hundred and fifty people were killed and thirty thousand were left homeless in these military-style assaults. Amnesty International believed the military supported these attacks and MOSOP accused Shell of complicity. Because of his involvement with MOSOP, Owens was arrested and imprisoned in December 1993 and April 1994, as well as July of that same year. In early 1994, Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha launched a full assault on Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni. His military's agenda was set forth in a memo drafted by Major Paul Okuntimo stating: \\"Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic activities to commence.\\" The document goes on to ominously recommend \\"wasting operations coupled with psychological tactics\\" during MOSOP gatherings. On 24 May 1994, a massacre occurred at the palace of the Chief of the Gokana. Four Ogoni leaders sympathetic to the government and Shell were set upon by a mob chanting \\"vulture, vulture.\\" They were beaten to death with clubs and burned. The military accused Ken Saro-Wiwa of inciting the attack even though he had been barred from entering Ogoniland earlier that day at a police roadblock. Nevertheless, Ken was arrested along with 15 others. They were held without charge, clamped in leg irons and tortured. When Owens learned that Ken had been arrested, he travelled to Nigeria's largest city, Lagos, to confer with Ken's lawyer. When he arrived, he saw that the arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa had made the front page of every Nigerian newspaper. The papers also listed the names of suspects the police were looking to apprehend for the same crime. Owens Wiwa was number one on the wanted list. He went underground. Even though he was a fugitive, Wiwa met with human rights groups, environmental groups, church leaders, and western embassies in Nigeria frequently, informing them of the situation and requesting that they put pressure for Ken's release. The response to the campaign was overwhelming. The media reacted with a clamorous condemnation of the Nigerian military. Groups such as PEN International, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and Human Rights Watch turned the arrest of Ken Saro-Wiwa into their cause célèbre. Royal Dutch Shell was vilified and boycotted around the world. In February 1995, after being imprisoned for nine months without charge, Ken Saro-Wiwa was finally brought to trial. Bypassing normal legal procedures, Abacha set up a special military tribunal to try Ken and the others for the murder of the Ogoni chiefs. The international community condemned the trial as a sham. On 31 October 1995, Ken and eight other Ogoni activists were sentenced to death. They were hanged less than two weeks later, on 10 November. International reaction to the executions was swift. The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria. More than a dozen countries, including the United States, recalled their ambassadors. ==Exile== Owens moved swiftly. With his ex-wife and infant son in tow, he escaped the country with his life. With the help of Anita Roddick and her socially conscious cosmetic empire, The Body Shop, the Wiwas found temporary safe haven in London. Among those who gave the refugee Wiwa family temporary shelter was British novelist Doris Lessing. After several precarious months in England, Owens was able to relocate his family to permanent safety in Canada with the aid of Greenpeace Canada and Toronto's Bloor Street United Church. Wiwa resides in Toronto, Canada with his wife and three children. == The search for the bones of Ken Saro-Wiwa == Canadian author J. Timothy Hunt's biography of Wiwa entitled The Politics of Bones documented Wiwa's personal battle against the Nigerian government to locate his brother's remains after they were buried in an unmarked mass-grave. Over the torturous course of ten years, Wiwa finally succeeded in locating and properly burying his brother in the summer of 2005. ==See also== *History of Nigeria ==External links== * The Politics of Bones, by J.

Woody and Haynes formed side project Gov't Mule in 1994 with former Dickey Betts drummer Matt Abts. Haynes and Woody decided to leave The Allman Brothers Band in 1997 to put a full-time effort into Gov't Mule. Prior to that, Woody played in the 1970s jazz fusion rock band Montage, and following that with former Kiss drummer Peter Criss in the Criss Penridge Alliance in the 1980s. Woody was found dead the morning of Saturday August 26, 2000 at the Marriott Courtyard in Queens, New York. A preliminary autopsy performed was inconclusive and showed no immediate cause of death; but he was subsequently determined to have died of a heroin overdose.Dixie Lullaby by Mark Kemp. Free Press: 2004. pgs 201-2 He was survived by his wife Jenny and daughter Savannah. Woody's death helped Haynes in his decision to return to The Allman Brothers Band. Gov't Mule continued on after Woody's death with Andy Hess assuming bass duties after a three-year period that saw a rotating group of bass players including Mike Gordon, Dave Schools, Oteil Burbridge (Woody's replacement in the Allman Brothers Band), George Porter Jr. and Les Claypool. The Canadian band Big Sugar wrote one song \\"Nashville Grass\\" about Woody's death and funeral. ==Musical equipment== Woody had a large collection of bass guitars (around 450), featured in his own bass instruction video and was held in high esteem for his playing. The Epiphone Rumble Kat signature bass was similar to two specially built double-neck instruments that Gibson made him: a bass/guitar and a bass/mandolin. With the Allman Brothers, although Woody used many different basses, Gibson Thunderbirds were his preferred instruments, along with Alembic basses. With Gov't Mule, Allen usually played the Gibson EB series, particularly the hollow-bodied EB-2 and the solid-bodied EB-3. At times he played a Rickenbacker or Gibson Thunderbird. Ampeg SVT was his amp of choice most of the time. Epiphone posthumously released an Allen Woody Limited Edition Bass, a semi-hollow arch-top similar to the Rumble Kat. Woody played esthetically customized Musicvox 4 string Spaceranger and Space Cadet Basses with Gov’t Mule. He played a Musicvox Space Cadet 12 String guitar and Yellow Musicvox Space Cadet 12 String Bass on tour with Blue Floyd performing extended 12 string bass solos in his role as second guitarist in the band. The movie Rising Low, directed by fellow bass player Mike Gordon, is a documentary about bass players dedicated to the memory of Allen Woody and features bass players that he respected and knew in his lifetime. ==Discography== ;Recordings of the Allman Brothers Band where Woody performs * Seven Turns (1990) * Shades of Two Worlds (1991) * Live at Great Woods (1991 VHS/LaserDisc Release, 2014 DVD Release) * An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set (1992) * Where It All Begins (1994) * An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set (1995) * Play All Night: Live at the Beacon Theatre 1992 (2014) ; Govt.

The Kroisos Kouros is central to two ongoing archeological debates: first, whether kouroi represented specific young men or were generic representations of idealized archetypes which might not actually resemble a specific person commemorated, and thus are symbolic representations embodying the ideal of the male warrior en promáchois (ἐν προμάχοις), \\"in the front line\\" of battle, not naturalistic ones; and second the authenticity of the Getty kouros, which bears a falsified provenance and displays a suspicious similarity to the Kroisos kouros.Marion True.

It is located in the northeastern part of Queens County, at the head of the once-navigable portion of the Hillsborough River at the point where the river begins to narrow significantly. Mount Stewart had a population of 209 at the time of the 2016 Census. The community played an important role in the province's early transportation history, being the site of a bridge over the river along the route between the capital at Charlottetown and the shire town of Kings County at Georgetown. == Railway junction == In the early 1870s, the Prince Edward Island Railway ran its mainline between both communities through Mount Stewart. If any one wanted to travell to Georgetown or Souris from Charlottetown, they would have to come through or make a stop at Mount Stewart. Mount Stewart also came to be referred to as Mount Stewart Junction after the PEIR built a line northeast to Morell and Souris. During the 1930s, the community became the centre of all railway service accessing eastern PEI after the Hillsborough River Bridge carrying the railway line to Murray Harbour between Charlottetown and Southport was condemned. The CNR constructed what was known as the \\"Short Line\\" between Mount Stewart and Lake Verde, permitting rail traffic to continue to serve the southeastern part of the province. People would also use the railways to transport vegetables, potatoes, lumber, and other resources. The last train that came here was from Charlottetown in 1989, it was also when the railway stopped running. == Trails == Spikes were pulled out of the railway and they turned them into trails. In 1992 they started pulling the spikes and I took them around ten days or more, to get from cardigan to Mount Stewart. Now that the spikes are pulled out we have wonderful tracks that go all around P.E.I. If it hadn't been for hard work earlier on then we wouldn't have that beautiful scenery and tourist spot that we have now.A. Coffin, Personal interview, June 6, 2013 == Education == There is one school that is operating in Mt. Stewart currently. It was built May 7, 1976. It is located 120 Main Street, Mount Stewart, PE. There are approximately 160 students as of April 2013. The grades are Kindergarten up to Grade Eight. In 2009 two schools joined Mount Stewart Consolidated, such as St. Teresa's and Tracadie Cross. After students finish grade eight they go to Morell Regional High School for grades 9-12. The school that was operating before the current school is now being used for storage. == Sports == Baseball in Mount Stewart and surrounding areas was and still is very popular. The teams have won the Atlantic championships over many years. They also had a team in the KCBL (Kings County Baseball League). Some of the local boys went to the Florida Rookie League. This league was for males in university who show dedication to playing pro ball. == Links to World War Two == When World War II began in 1939, about 50 members of the community left to serve in the war. In some cases this included 4 members of a family. During the war many items were rationed, including items such as sugar, tea, molasses, and gas. People were only permitted to drive 35 miles from the community. Also during the war there were air drills, and blackout drills twice a month.A.

Since 2009 unhampered access to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has been in the second National Human Rights Action Plan of the Philippine government. ==Focus on Information and Communication Technology== (6) Access to information and communication including ICT In the last 10 years, there has been much progress in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development, and it opens up many opportunities for people with disabilities in networking, solidarity, employment, and independent living. But it has also widened the gap between persons with disabilities and the non-disabled. The Digital divide includes inaccessibility to infrastructure for ICT, Internet, and ICT skills. These problems are acute in rural areas. The multi-media environment is creating barriers for people with visual disabilities. Three targets are set to improve the situation: 1) By 2005, persons with disabilities should have at least the same rate of access to the Internet and related services as the rest of citizens in a country of the region. 2) By 2004, international organizations should incorporate web accessibility standards for persons with disabilities in their international ICT standards. 3) Governments should adopt, by 2005, ICT accessibility guidelines for persons with disabilities in their national ICT policies. ==Timeline== 1993–2002 – United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) proclaimed the “Declaration of Asia-Pacific Decade for Disabled Persons”.

Rosenberg has been producing webcomics since 1997, making him one of the original webcomic artists. When the National Cartoonists Society added a new category, Online Comic Strips, in 2011, Rosenberg was the first winner. Rosenberg graduated from Cornell University in 1995 with a major in biology. Before working full-time as a webcomic artist, he also worked as a website design consultant. On January 19, 2003, Rosenberg married graphic designer/printmaker and fellow Cornell alum Amy Melnikoff. In August 2006, the Rosenbergs moved from their Manhattan apartment to a house in Westchester County, New York. Because he was living in Manhattan at the time, Rosenberg's early work also tended to be set predominantly in this location. Later works branched off into real and imagined locations vastly disjointed from his previous comics. ==Works== *Goats - Started April 1, 1997, Rosenberg placed it on hiatus on April 30, 2010. He ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in February 2012 to fund the publishing of Goats book IV and to finish the story. As of August 2014, the Goats website has been relaunched but no merchandise or new comics have been delivered. *Scenes from a Multiverse - This strip started on June 14, 2010, and is updated semi-daily on weekdays (updates were daily, Monday through Friday, initially).

Rodallega started his professional career with Deportes Quindío in 2004. An impressive first season with the club earned him a call-up to represent Colombia at the U-20 South American Championship in 2005, where he went on to set a new record for most goals scored in the tournament. A move to Deportivo Cali and his senior international debut followed later in the year before he moved abroad, signing for Mexican Primera División side Monterrey. A disappointing spell resulted in a loan move to Atlas before being transferred to Necaxa in 2007. In January 2009, he moved to Wigan Athletic for a fee of £4.5 million. After initially struggling at the club, he finished as the club's top goalscorer in his first full Premier League season. He scored 24 goals for the club, making him their all-time leading Premier League goalscorer. ==Early and personal life== Rodallega was born in El Carmelo, Colombia, and lived in the village with his parents and two elder sisters. Rodallega and his wife Carolina have a son, also named Hugo. His cousin Carmen is also a footballer, and has played for the Colombia women's national football team. ==Club careerEarly career=== Rodallega began his career at local amateur club Boca Juniors de Cali before signing for Deportes Quindío in 2004. He scored his first goal in professional football on 11 April 2004 in a 1–1 draw against Deportivo Cali. He went on to score a total of 13 goals in his first season, earning himself a call-up to the Colombia under-20 squad for the South American Youth Championship. He signed for Deportivo Cali during the middle of the 2005 season, where he won his first honours at club level, helping the team win the 2005-II Copa Mustang. Rodallega had now caught the attention of foreign clubs and signed for Mexican Primera División club Monterrey in 2006. He failed to replicate his previous goal scoring record, finding the net three times before being loaned out to Atlas. He was then transfer listed after scoring just once in 15 games for Monterrey during the Clausura 2007 tournament, and was subsequently signed by Necaxa. His spell at Necaxa was more successful, where he managed to score 16 goals during his first season with the club. ===Wigan Athletic=== Wigan Athletic in 2010 On 20 December 2008, Necaxa claimed they had started negotiations to sell Rodallega to English Premier League side Wigan Athletic. On 12 January, Wigan manager Steve Bruce confirmed that Rodallega had been granted a work permit, and on 26 January he finally completed his move to the club for a fee of £4.5 million. Rodallega made his debut for Wigan as a 77th-minute substitute for Amr Zaki against Liverpool on 28 January 2009 at the DW Stadium. He nearly made an instant impact for his new team, hitting the crossbar with a powerful strike from a 25-yard free- kick. After a slow start, he scored his first goal for Wigan against West Brom on 9 May 2009, and went on to score three goals in the last four games of the season, helping the club finish in 11th place. In Wigan's first match of the 2009–10 season, Rodallega got the team's first goal of the season in a 2–0 away win against Aston Villa, with a \\"spectacular\\" half-volley from the corner of the penalty area. Rodallega appeared in all 38 league games during the season, and despite Wigan's new manager Roberto Martínez often playing him on the left wing, he also finished as the club's top goalscorer with ten league goals. On 5 February 2011, Rodallega scored his seventh goal of the season in a 4–3 win against Blackburn Rovers, equalling the club record of 20 Premier League goals for Wigan. He broke that record on 16 April, scoring the opening goal in a 3–1 win against Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, making him Wigan's leading goalscorer of all time in the Premier League. On 22 May 2011 Rodallega scored a 78th-minute header against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium which secured a 1–0 win and Wigan's Premier League status for 2011–12. On 17 December 2011, Rodallega made his 100th league appearance for Wigan, coming onto the pitch as a substitute against Chelsea. Rodallega later announced that he wanted to leave Wigan and despite no deals were made officially in the January 2012 transfer window. At the end of the 2012 season he was released by the club, his contract having lapsed. ===Fulham=== On 12 July 2012, Rodallega signed a three-year deal with Fulham after the expiration of his contract at Wigan. He scored his first Fulham goal to open the scoring against former club Wigan in a 2–1 away win on 22 September 2012. He then found the net for a second time against Newcastle United on 10 December 2012 at Craven Cottage, heading in Damien Duff's free kick to win the game 2–1. It was Fulham's first win in seven games. Rodallega scored the winning goal against fellow strugglers Birmingham City on 27 September 2014, helping Fulham claim their first league victory of the season. On 1 October, Rodallega opened the scoring as Fulham thrashed Bolton 4–0 for their third consecutive win under caretaker manager Kit Symons. On 24 October, Rodallega scored twice as they defeated London rivals Charlton 3–0 to move Fulham out of the relegation zone. ===Akhisar Belediyespor=== Rodallega signed with Akhisar Belediyespor in 2015. He scored a hat-trick against league leaders Beşiktaş on 23 April 2016. By doing so, he became the first foreign player at Akhisar to score three goals in a match. ==International career== In 2005, Rodallega was selected in Colombia's squad for the U-20 South American Championship. He made his debut in Colombia's opening game against Bolivia. He came onto the pitch as a half- time substitute, and went on to score four goals in the second half of the match. Colombia finished the tournament as champions as Rodallega became the tournament's all-time top goal scorer with a total of 11 goals in nine games, beating Luciano Galletti's record of nine goals. Rodallega was also selected for the FIFA U-20 World Cup, but failed to live up to expectations and was dropped from the team after the group stages as Colombia lost against Argentina in the second round. Rodallega's senior international debut was in a friendly against Venezuela. He briefly played in goal during Colombia's final tournament game at the 2007 Copa América, when first string goalkeeper Róbinson Zapata was given a red card and Colombia had no more available substitutes. He was able to complete the game with Colombia winning 1–0. On 30 April 2008, Rodallega scored two goals, assisted 1 goal and got a penalty awarded for his country in a 5–2 friendly match victory over Venezuela, being hailed by many Colombians as the return of \\"Rodagol\\" who scored 11 goals in the Sub 20 WC qualifier tournament in 2005. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Deportes Quindíorowspan=\\"2\\"Primera A20043113colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–3113 - 2005127colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–127 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!43!!20!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!43!!20 - Deportivo CaliPrimera A20052612colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–202812 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Monterreyrowspan=\\"2\\"Primera División2006 C143colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–143 - 2007 C15130colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–181 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!29!!4!!3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!32!!4 - Atlas (loan)Primera División2006 A175colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–175 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Necaxarowspan=\\"3\\"Primera División2007 A169colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–169 - 2008 C207colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–207 - 2008 A179colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–179 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total!!53!!25!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!53!!25 - rowspan=\\"5\\" Wigan Athleticrowspan=\\"4\\"Premier League2008–091530000colspan=\\"2\\"–153 - 2009–1038103010colspan=\\"2\\"–4210 - 2010–113690010colspan=\\"2\\"–379 - 2011–122320000colspan=\\"2\\"–232 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total!!112!!24!!3!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!117!!24 - rowspan=\\"4\\" Fulhamrowspan=\\"2\\"Premier League2012–132933010colspan=\\"2\\"–333 - 2013–141322123colspan=\\"2\\"–176 - Championship2014–1533100010colspan=\\"2\\"–3410 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total!!75!!15!!5!!1!!4!!3!!0!!0!!84!!19 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Akhisar Belediyesporrowspan=\\"2\\" Süper Lig2015–16341932colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–3721 - 2016–17 17400colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–174 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total !51233200005425 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Trabzonspor rowspan=\\"3\\"Süper Lig 2016–17 156colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–156 - 2017–18 23558colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–2813 - 2018–19 331541colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–3716 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total !71269900008035 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Denizlispor rowspan=\\"1\\"Süper Lig 2019–20 23610colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–246 - !colspan=\\"2\\" Total !23!!6!!1!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–!!24!!6 - !colspan=\\"3\\" Career total!!500!!160!!24!!12!!6!!3!!2!!0!!532!!175 } ===International goals=== {  - !

Often called one of China's \\"living treasures\\", Chan was featured as such on the cover of Inside Kung Fu magazine in 1996.Cater, Dave: \\"Chan Tai San's Journey of a Lifetime\\", Inside Kung Fu (October 1996), pp. 38–41. ==Early training and military service== Chan said he began kung fu training at age eight under Yee Hoi-Long (余海龍), a stonemason who worked for the Chan family. Yee taught \\"hung fist\\", also called \\"hung kuyhnn\\" or \\"village style\\", a forerunner to hung ga, and \\"hung tao choy mei\\" (which means \\"hung head choy tail\\"), later known as jow ga, a system combining strong \\"hung\\" style fist work with active choy-style footwork. Chan learned from Yee for about six years. Chan was 13 when, after the death of his father, he was sent by his family to the Clear Cloud Temple where he began training in kung fu and Buddhism and was mostly a student of Jyu Jik Chuyhn (朱亦傳).Parrella, M.: Chan Tai San's lineage Retrieved 27 December 2009.Inside Kung Fu (October 1989). Chan was also taught by the monk Gaai Si Wu Song and trained mostly in the choy lay fut style.Cater, Dave (1993): \\"A Tradition Whose Time has Come\\", Inside Kung Fu (September 1993), p. 56. At 17, Chan left the monastery to fight against the Imperial Japanese Army, enlisting in a peasant division which also had some of the most skilled traditional martial arts fighters in China. While in the army, Chan trained and served with Cheung Lai-Chung 張禮泉 (bak mei, \\"white eyebrow\\" style), baahk mo jyu 洪瑋翔 (nicknamed the \\"white haired devil\\", hung fut style) and others. ==Career== After the war, Chan traveled throughout China meeting and training with more sifu such as Mok Jing-Kiu (head of the Mok family style) and Chan Sai-Mo陳世武 (choy lay fut style) and Chan Jik Seung 陳績常 (bak mei). In his 40s, Chan went back to the Clear Cloud Temple and learned lama pai (喇嘛派) from Jyu Jik Chuyhn. Other arts he trained in were the southern eagle claw, also known as golden eagle, the ngok ga style as well as the Jow Ga Style under Jow Biu. Devoting himself to mastering the Tibetan lion's roar system, he trained with various sifu of related lineages such as Deng Gum To (鄧錦濤) of the hop ga and Gung Yuet Gei 孔乙己 of white crane and a Mai Yi Po of Lama from Mongolia. Chan trained and promoted Chinese martial arts in China and abroad. He was coach of the Guangdong Province martial arts demonstration team from 1980 to 1982, a hand- to-hand fighting (sanshou) instructor for an elite fut san military unit, and a member of the executive committee of the Toi San region martial arts association.Cater, Dave: \\"A Tradition Whose Time has Come\\", Inside Kung Fu (September 1993). As a member of the national demonstration team (and through exhibitions at national level tournaments in the United States), Chan demonstrated internal martial arts (qigong), iron palm and iron body. Chan was one of only a few instructors who openly taught the lama pai style. When he opened his classes to Americans, there were estimated to be only five other public lama pai sifu in the world.Ross, David: \\"The Lion's Roar\\", KungFu Wushu (Winter 1995). \\\\- Ross, David: \\"Is Traditional Practical?\\", KungFu Wushu (October/November 1996). \\\\- Slovenz, Madeline Anita: \\"The Year Is a Wild Animal: Lion Dancing in Chinatown\\", Drama Review, Vol. 31 No. 3 (Autumn 1987), pp. 74–102. ==Footnotes== Category:Chinese martial artists Category:1920 births Category:2004 deaths ","title":"Chan Tai San"},{"id":"6215850","text":"Wallenstein Palace () is a Baroque palace in Malá Strana, Prague, that served as a residence for Imperial Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein and now houses the Senate of the Czech Republic. ==History== Gardens of the palace Garden frontage with sala terrena The original Palace was built in years 1623-1630 by Albrecht von Wallenstein, Duke of Mecklenburg (1583-1634), who made his name and fortune as the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces in the Thirty Years War. Emperor Ferdinand II feared Albrecht von Wallenstein's calculating mind and had him assassinated in 1634 in the town of Eger (now Cheb). He lived in the palace for only a year before his death. His widow sold it to his nephew and it remained in the Wallenstein family until 1945. After the Second World War, the palace became Czechoslovak state property and was renovated to house government offices. Today, the Senate of the Czech Republic operates out of the main palace buildings. The Riding School is used as a branch of the National Gallery in Prague. The challenging restoration of the main building began in mid-1999. The most valuable parts of this building in historical and artistic terms are the Main Hall, the Knights' Hall, the Antechamber, the Audience Hall and the Mythological and Astronomical Corridors. Albrecht of Wallenstein had traveled in Italy, and when the palace was built between 1623 and 1630, Italian architects and artisans were used including Andrea Spezza (likely the main architect), succeeded in 1628 by Niccolo Sebregondi. The interiors were decorated by the Florentine Baccio del Bianco (1604-1656), who completed the ceiling fresco in the Main Hall, figure paintings in St Wenceslas Chapel, and most important parts of the decoration of the Mythological Corridor during the first year of construction. The Florentine Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni (1586-1654), engineer and army colonel, played an important role in the construction. Pieroni's father Alessandro (1550-1607) had been an architect for the Medici. Pieroni studied the design of the new part to Wallenstein's Castle in Jičín and the church of St. Jacob there, and the garden, Sala Terrena, and Riding School are attributed to him. Pieroni also influences the astrological and astronomical decoration of the Mythological Corridor and other interiors. The total value of interior furnishings after his death was 70 000 gold pieces, while another 134 000 gold pieces was invested in jewels and tableware made from precious metals. To make space for this palace, Wallenstein razed 26 houses, six gardens, and two brickworks at the site. Wallenstein Palace was built to rival Prague Castle. Four courtyards are created by the palace layout. Its complex includes period gardens, the Avenue of Sculptures, stables and the large Riding School. The monumental conception of the loggia with three arcades on doubled columns recalls the Baroque style. The Italian style garden includes an aviary, a grotto, and a fountain by Adrian de Vries (c.1545-1626). After years of neglect after the war, the gardens have been reconstructed. Wallenstein would have dined in the huge sala terrena (garden pavilion) that looks out over fountain and rows of bronze statues. The sala terrena and its rich stucco decoration were modeled after the portico of a Livornese church. Today, these are copies of the Netherlander sculptor Adriaen de Vries’ works. The originals were looted by the Swedish army in 1648, and they can be seen today at Drottningholm Palace. Immortal Beloved (film), a 1994 film about the life of Beethoven was filmed in the gardens. ==DescriptionMain wing=== Albrecht Wallenstein as Mars (cropped) The main wing of Wallenstein palace was largely a reconstruction of the Trcka residence that runs 60 meters along Valdstejnske namesti. The façade has three rows of identical windows which stream light into the Main Hall. It incorporates both late renaissance and Nordic mannerism which is expressed in the portals and Netherlandish dormer- windows. Initially, in keeping with the architectural style, the Main Hall was decorated with tapestries and furniture ordered from Italy and the Netherlands. Much of the original furnishings were looted either in 1648 by the Swedes or 1742 by the French. The west wing of the complex hosts the Main Hall, that rises to the height of two stories. The Duke is depicted by Baccio del Bianco, in the middle ceiling fresco as the god of war, Mars, riding in a war chariot drawn by a team of horses. In the painting, the Duke is holding the reins of four horses while Mars is usually seen only holding three horses. This is another example of Albrecht von Wallenstein's vanity. The stucco work depicting weapons, war trophies and musical instruments were probably made by Santino Galli and Domenico Canevalle. These are references to The Duke's career in the military. When it was built, it was the second largest hall after the Spanish hall of Prague Castle with an area of 288 meters squared and a height of 10.5 meters. This is original façade was altered in the mid nineteenth century to include marble portals from the Cerninsky palace and the entire hall was rebuilt as a barracks. A key feature of the palace is the system of corridors that connects all parts of the palace. In many palaces of the period it was necessary to go from room to room to move around, but it was possible for the Duke of Wallenstein to walk from the main Audience hall to his private study and then around the gardens to the stables at the north end of the palace complex via the corridors. The Ovidius corridor is named after frescoes of Metamorphoses, the Astronomical corridor is depicted by allegories of four continents and zodiac emblems, all made by Baccio del Bianco.Ladislav Čepička-Eliška Fučíková: Waldstein : Albrecht von Waldstein - Inter arma silent musae? Academia Praha 2007 (in German), German edition A map of Wallenstein Palace Originally tile stoves placed in each room heated the palace. The tile in the Antechamber was used later to line the fireplace. Guests waited in the antechamber to be granted audience with the Duke. Due to an adaptation in the 19th century, it is a kind of Mirror Hall with two Venetian mirrors made in the 18th century on the Italian island of Murano. The only objects original to the room are a set of four chests used by the Duke to hold his wardrobe. They are Italian chests made around the turn of the 17th century. ===Audience Chamber=== The Audience Chamber is a small circular room adjoining the Antechamber and the Mythological Corridor. A door leading from the Audience Chamber to a staircase was preserved from the Trèkovský dùm, one of the original properties on the site. Several other salvaged architectural pieces were incorporated into the palace. Stuccowork and paintings depict Ovid's Four ages and portraits of the Four Periods of the Day. The Baroque stuccowork of the dome in the Audience Chamber is mirrored in the Mythological corridor. The mythological corridor also has murals depicting planet motifs and legends such as Mercury & Argus, Diana and Acteon, Perseus killing Medusa, Callisto metamorphosed into a bear, and the Rape of Europa. Ovid's Metamorphoses inspired Baccio del Bianco's frescoes in this corridor. ===Chapel=== The palace chapel is two stories high and richly decorated with scenes from the legend of St Wenceslas. Cabinet-maker and woodcarver Arnošt Jan Heidelberger constructed the chapel altar in 1630. Its construction marked the first Baroque monument of its kind in Prague and the beginning of the Baroque age in the Czech lands. Three oratories open on the western wall of the chapel. The Duke used the first floor for services while his wife sat on the second floor and servants were restricted to the third floor. Baccio del Bianco is responsible for the paintings in this chapel. St Eusebius's like a death is depicted in the first oratory. Following that, the Duchess's oratory was decorated with usual Marian iconography. Frescos of the Chapel were inspired by St Vitus cathedral in Prague Castle. Ernest Heidelberger is assumed to have created the sculpture work for the Chapel. ==References External links == * Wallenstein Palace - DiscoverCzech * tiscali.pragensia * The History of the Wallenstein Palace Category:Houses completed in 1630 Category:Palaces in Prague Category:Baroque architecture in Prague Category:1630 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Official residences in the Czech Republic Category:Waldstein family Category:Albrecht von Wallenstein Category:Czech Baroque gardens Category:Baroque palaces ","title":"Wallenstein Palace"},{"id":"6215861","text":"Euphorbia atropurpurea, called tabaiba majorera or tabaiba roja in Spanish, is a shrub in the family Euphorbiaceae native to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It can reach 2 metres in height, and grows in ravines, and on slopes and terraces. The plant grows best in humid conditions in mid to low altitudes (300-1,200 m) on the south and west parts of the island. It is plentiful in the towns of Teno, Santiago del Teide, and the slope of Güímar. Detail of the floral bracts The shrub can reach over 2 m with succulent brown stems and branches without spines. It has large bluish green leaves, which form a rosette at the end of the branches. The plant flowers from winter to spring (December to May). The flowers have dark red bracts greater than 1 cm in size. These bracts lend the plant its name, atropurpurea (from the Latin ater or \\"black\\", and purple). It should not be confused with E. bravoana, which is endemic to the nearby island of La Gomera and also has purple-red bracts. The fruit is a red capsule with three dark brown seeds. Like other plants in the genus Euphorbia, it produces a toxic white latex if cut. E. atropurpurea is used as an ornamental plant in gardens for its eye-catching appearance and flowers. It requires little care, but requires sunlight and a certain amount of environmental humidity. It generally spreads by seeds, or more rarely by simply branching out. In the area of Masca, in Tenerife, hybrids between E. atropurpurea and Euphorbia regis-jubae occur, which the Swedish botanist Eric Ragnor Sventenius named Euphorbia navae in honour of Alonso de Nava y Grimón, founder of the Botanical Garden of La Orotava. ==References External links == * More images of E. atropurpurea atropurpurea ","title":"Euphorbia atropurpurea"},{"id":"6215863","text":"Saronikos () is a former municipality in Corinthia, Peloponnese, Greece.

It is nectarivorous, feeding on nectar from primarily banana flowers. It is found in several countries in South and Southeast Asia. ==Taxonomy and etymology== It was described as a new subspecies in 1911 by Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen. Andersen described it as a subspecies of the long-tongued nectar bat, with the trinomen Macroglossus minimus sobrinus. Beginning in approximately 1983, it has been considered a full species rather than a subspecies. Its species name \\"sobrinus\\" means \\"cousin;\\" Andersen possibly chose this name to reflect what he believed was its close relationship to M. minimus minimus. ==Description== Andersen noted that it differed from the long-tongued nectar bat in several ways. Overall, it is a larger species with a longer snout. Its forearm is long. Individuals weigh . ==Biology and ecology== It is nectarivorous, feeding on the nectar of flowers. It consumes nectar almost exclusively from banana flowers. It is nocturnal, foraging at night and roosting during the day in trees. When roosting during the day, it roosts singly or in small, \\"well-spaced parties.\\" ==Range and habitat== Unlike the long-tongued nectar bat, which is considered a coastal species, the long- tongued fruit bat is considered an inland species. Its range includes several countries in Asia, including Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. ==Conservation== It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority.

The son of an obstetrician/gynecologist who ran a clinic, Takamori was exposed to a wide range of people from an early age. At home, his father’s extensive library of both art and medical texts became a fascination for Takamori, who relished everything from Picasso reproductions to anatomical charts. Takamori’s interest in the arts persisted into early adulthood and upon his graduation from the Musashino Art College in 1971, he apprenticed to a master folk potter at Koishiwara, Fukuoka, Kyushu - Koishiwara ware. While learning the craft of industrial ceramics in a factory setting, he saw a traveling exhibition of contemporary ceramic art from Latin America, Canada, and the United States. Blown away by what he describes as the “antiauthoritarian” quality of the work, Takamori began to question his future as an industrial potter. When renowned American ceramist Ken Ferguson visited the pottery, the two had an immediate rapport and Ferguson encouraged Takamori go to the United States and study with him at the Kansas City Art Institute. In 1974 Takamori made the move to the United States, receiving his B.F.A. from the Kansas City Art Institute and later attending Alfred University in New York for his M.F.A. After working as a resident artist at the Archie Bray Foundation in Helena, Montana, he moved to Seattle, Washington in 1993, where he took his current teaching position as associate professor of the ceramics department. Akio Takamori died of pancreatic cancer on January 11, 2017.http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/01/12/24799336/seattle-artist-akio- takamori-has-died ==Work== Takamori’s evolution as an artist began as he worked with Ferguson to break free of the constraints of industrial pottery and find new ways to express himself in clay. Since those first years at the Kansas City Art Institute his work has changed greatly, but it has always been figurative, based on the human body and expressive of human emotion and sensuality. In the 1980s, Takamori worked innovatively with the vessel form and its structure, creating flat envelope shaped pots formed from slabs. Once the ceramic piece was finished, he would paint onto the surface adding details of the figures that he was representing. These figures often explored human relationships. His work in this format lasted about ten years. In the mid-1990s a visit to the European Ceramic Work Center in the Netherlands resulted in a shift from vessels back to an early interest in sculpture and the figure. Takamori created groupings of standing figural sculptures. The figures portray historical characters, contemporary society and rural villagers recalled from the artist's childhood in Japan. Most of Takamori’s work has been strongly influenced by his Japanese heritage. He has translated traditional Japanese prints into three-dimensional porcelain sculptures, he recreated his hometown in Japan from memory using clay, and he has translated Peter Bruegel’s paintings into sculptures of Japanese people. Takamori collaborated with Master Printer Mike Sims, of The Lawrence Lithography Workshop in Kansas City, Missouri, to create a series of prints that combine digital images of his ceramic sculptures with more traditional lithography printing techniques. ==Awards== 2011 United States Artists 2006 Joan Mitchell Foundation 2003 Flintridge Foundation Awards for Visual Artists 2001 Virginia A.

During the 1960s and 1970s, his writings had a strong influence on the Western academic discussion about Marx's economic theory. ==Life and career== Meek was born in Wellington, New Zealand, where he attended school and entered Victoria University in the mid-1930s, initially to study law, and later economics. There he became interested in the thought of Karl Marx, theatre and local left-wing politics. Some of his articles of that period in New Zealand journals like Spike,See e.g. “Stalin worship: is it a communist cult?”, “”Auden in the Theatre”, “Apocalypse”. In: The Spike, or Victoria College Review, 1941, pp. 13-16 etc. Salient and Tomorrow were written under pseudonyms. In 1939, he graduated with a Masters in Law, and was awarded a fellowship to Cambridge University. However, World War II intervened and his graduate studies at Cambridge were delayed for six years. In 1944, he married a communist activist, Rona Stephenson (better known as Rona Bailey) though they were soon divorced again. Meek revealed himself to be the brightest Marxian thinker of his generation in New Zealand; his first monograph, a pamphlet called \\"Maori Problems Today\\" (1943) discussed a topic which had previously been largely ignored by the Communist Party of New Zealand. R.L. Meek, Maori problems today: a short survey.Wellington : Progressive Publishing Society, 1944. 47 pp. His 1946 lecture to the Wellington Branch of the New Zealand Geographical Society on Maori emancipation was published in the New Zealand Geographer.Ronald L. Meek, \\"Some features of New Zealand's racial problem\\". New Zealand Geographer, Vol. 3 No. 1, April 1947. In 1946 Meek moved to Cambridge, England, with a Strathcona studentship to read for a Ph.D. under Piero Sraffa and Maurice Dobb. Two years later, in October 1948, he moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he became university lecturer in the Department of Political Economy, and in 1949 he finished his doctoral thesis, \\"The development of the concept of surplus in economic thought from Mun to Mill\\". He also remarried and learnt to play the piano. Meek was lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Glasgow until 1959, and Senior Lecturer from 1960 to 1963. His first major work, Studies in the Labour Theory of Value, was published by Lawrence & Wishart in 1956 (a second edition was published by Monthly Review Press in 1973). The book was widely read and had a big influence on the discussions of Marxian, Ricardian and Post-Keynesian economists in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1956 Meek also quit the Communist Party of Great Britain and he abandoned his previous support for the policies of Joseph Stalin, although he continued to be a Marxist until his last years. He was acknowledged to be a scholarly authority on Adam Smith and on the Physiocrats. In the introduction to an article from 1971, \\"Smith, Turgot and the 'Four Stages' Theory,\\" Ron Meek writes: \\"In the good old days, when I was a fierce young Marxist instead of a benign middle-aged Meeksist, I became very interested in the work of the members of the so-called Scottish historical school...\\"Meek, Ronald L. “Smith, Turgot, and the ‘Four Stages’ Theory.” History of Political Economy 3, no. 1 (1971): 9. From 1963 until his death he was Tyler Professor of Economics at the University of Leicester, where he initiated a B.Sc. course in Economics and a Public Sector Economics Research Centre. He published numerous books and articles on classical political economy, Marxian and Sraffian economics, as well as on electricity pricing and social theory.

They were not 'built' as such but rather re- formed from Class 201 and EPB vehicles for use on -- (North Downs Line) services. Six three-car sets were created, numbered 1201-1206. ==Creation== By 1964, the majority of services on the Southern Region of British Railways had been converted to diesel and electric operation. However, steam locomotives continued to operate the entire service on the North Downs Line. New trains for this route could not be justified as passenger numbers were relatively low. Twelve carriages from Class 201 diesel-electric units were available for use following service cuts on the Hastings Line, so a decision was made to combine these vehicles with six redundant driving trailers from 2-EPB electric multiple units (EMU). Several changes were made to the vehicles before they entered service. The EPB vehicles were fitted with buckeye couplers to allow them to attach to the DEMU vehicles. A three-bay luggage area was created in the former EMU carriages to cope with the high level of mail traffic on the Reading to Tonbridge route, while the engines in the former DEMU vehicles were uprated by 100hp. The new units were given the numbers 1201-1206, and entered service in January 1965. They were commonly referred to as 'Tadpoles' due to the difference in body profiles between the 201 and EPB stock. Following the adoption of TOPS in the late 1960s, the units were given the Class number 206. ==Operations== As the Class 206 had no first class seating, their use was limited. As well as working on the North Downs Line, the units were occasionally used on the Oxted Line when other units were unavailable, and on some journeys between and . They were replaced by Western Region diesel multiple units from February 1979. It was intended that four of the units should be broken up into component carriages from May 1979, with 1205 and 1206 retained for other uses, but delays in the introduction of Western Region units saw 1204 survive until August and 1203 until September. From September 1979, only one unit was required for the North Downs Line, with the other used on the Marshlink Line between and Ashford. Following a derailment at in March 1980, 1205 and 1206 were temporarily disbanded to provide cover for damaged Class 201 vehicles. 1205 was disbanded permanently in November 1980. In May 1981 the last surviving unit, 1206, was replaced on the Reading to Tonbridge route by a Western Region unit, and was used between Hastings and Ashford for a further four years before being disbanded. ==Class 206/1== In June 1986, the Class 206 number was reused for another hybrid unit. Class 205 unit 1113 was involved in a collision at in May 1985, causing two of its three carriages to be damaged and later scrapped. It re-entered service in April 1986 with two vehicles from a withdrawn Class 202 unit, and was redesignated as a Class 206 two months later, taking the TOPS number 206101. It operated regularly on the Marshlink Line until October 1987, when it was withdrawn.Welch (2004) p.86 ==Technical details== Power car (one per three-car set) * Weight: 54 tons 2 cwt * Transmission: Electric, two English Electric traction motors * Train heating: Electric ==References *History on the 3R 'Tadpole' class *Info and photo page on the class 206 Category:Diesel electric multiple units Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Train-related introductions in 1964 ","title":"British Rail Class 206"},{"id":"6215948","text":"Regina Derieva (; February 7, 1949 – December 11, 2013) was a Russian poet and writer who published around thirty books of poetry, essays, and prose. From July 1999 until her death she lived in Sweden. Joseph Brodsky called Derieva \\"a great poet\\", stressing that her poems are hers \\"only by name, only by her craft\\". \\"The real authorship belongs here to poetry itself, to freedom itself. I have not met anything similar for a long time, neither among my fellow countrymen nor among English-speaking poets\\". Tomas Venclova has stated that \\" Regina Derieva was, first and foremost, a Christian poet, a worthy heir of a long line of metaphysical poets, be they English, French or Russian. Far from any inflated rhetoric or didactics, her poems reached the very core of the Christian experience, which meant serious and fearless attitude to life, suffering and death. The imagery and syntax of the Gospels and the Books of Prophets was, for her, a natural element just as apocalyptic presentiments and mystical hope formed the axis of her world-outlook\\". Les Murray has a blurb on the back cover of Derieva's Alien Matter : ”Science teaches that eighty percent of the universe consists of dark matter, so called. Regina Derieva learned this same fact in a very hard school. She does not consent to it, though. She knows that the hurt truth in us points to a dimension where, for example, victory is cleansed of battle. Her strict, economical poems never waver from that orientation”. Derieva's work has been translated into several languages, including English, French, Swedish, Arabic, Italian, Chinese, Thai, Greek, and other languages. A compact disc with her readings in Russian of selected poems was issued in 1999. Derieva's work has appeared in the Poetry magazine, Evergreen Review, Modern Poetry in Translation, Poetry East, The Liberal, Ars Interpres, Salt Magazine, Quadrant, Notre Dame Review, Dublin Poetry Review, Quarterly Literary Review Singapore, Words Without Borders, St. Petersburg Review, Poetry International, Artful Dodge, Atlanta Review, POEM Magazine, The Hopkins Review, The American Poetry Review as well as in many Russian and Swedish magazines. She translated poetry by Thomas Merton and contemporary American, Australian, British, Polish, and Swedish poets. Regina Derieva participated in a number of Swedish and international poetry festivals. Derieva's poetry is strongly affected by her Catholic faith. In 1996, a significant Italian composer and organist, Fra Armando Pierucci, composed a cantata for the series of Regina Derieva's poems. This cantata is titled Via Crucis.pilgrims star 27002 Via Crucis. In 2003, she received the Shannon Fellowship of the International Thomas Merton Society. In 2009, the Catholic Church of Sweden awarded her the ORA ET LABORA medal for her literary work to benefit the Church. Regina Derieva's funeral took place on December 23, 2013, and she is buried at the Norra Begravningsplatsen (Katolska Kyrkogården) in Stockholm. Regina Derieva's gravestone The volume of poetry, memoirs, essays, fiction, and photographs in honor of Regina Derieva, Curator Aquarum, was published in 2015. Her papers are at Stanford University. ==Works== Books of Poetry * Handwriting (Russian: Почерк). Alma-Ata: Zhazuchy, 1978. * Life Junction (Russian: Узел жизни).

It is the site of the Rütlischwur in traditional Swiss historiography, the oath marking the foundation of the original Swiss Confederacy. As such it is treated as a national monument of Switzerland. Since 1860, the Schweizerische Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft (SGG) has organized a celebration at the site on Swiss National Day (1 August), since 1994 recognized as a public holiday. ==History== Aerial view (1953) The Rütli became a site of symbolic importance for Swiss national identity in the early 18th century, with incipient National Romanticism. In the 1780s, there were (unsuccessful) proposals to erect a monument to Liberty at the site. Under the Helvetic Republic, the Rütli became a site of pilgrimage for conservative dissidents. In 1804, the year after the dissolution of the Helvetic Republic, Friedrich Schiller published his Willam Tell, which dramatized the Rütli oath. A patriotic Rütlilied was written by Johann Krauer and Franz Joseph Greith in 1820. In 1859, the Rütli meadow was bought by the Schweizerische Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft (SGG, \\"Swiss society for public utility, founded 1810) with the aim of preserving it as a site of national importance, among other reasons because there were plans to build a hotel at the site. The SGG turned ownership of the site over to the Confederacy under the condition of treating it as an unalienable national property and leaving its administration entrusted to the SGG. On July 25, 1940, General Henri Guisan used the site for his speech, now remembered as the \\"Rütlirapport\\", to all commanding officers of the Swiss Armed Forces in which he outlined the Reduit strategy and his aim never to surrender if invaded (see Switzerland during the World Wars): :\\"I decided to reunite you in this historic place, the symbolic ground of our independence, to explain the urgency of the situation, and to speak of you as a soldier to soldiers. We are at a turning point of our history. The survival of Switzerland is at stake.\\" Since 1991, Rütli has also been the start of the Swiss Path hiking trail created to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Switzerland. The National Day celebrations at the Rütli were disrupted by Neo- Nazis in 2005. In reaction to this, access to the celebration was subject to pre-registration the following year.John Tagliabue, In Peaceful Switzerland, Trouble at a Historic Meadow, New York Times, 23 July 2007. In apparent connection to this controversy, an individual caused a detonation at the 2007 celebration. The \\"attacker\\" was dubbed \\"Rütli-Bomber\\" in the popular press and spent a year in custody and while being investigated by federal police. It turned out that the \\"bomb\\" consisted of legal fireworks buried in the meadow at a depth of 20 cm. The case was closed without charges being filed in 2011.Nadja Ackermann, Rütli-Bomber, Année Politique Suisse, 11 October 2011 (updated 10 August 2016). ==See also== *Rütlischwur *Federal Charter of 1291 *Swiss patriotism ==References * Rütli Commission website (English/French/German/Italian) * https://www.sgg-ssup.ch/en/ruetli-en.html Category:Geography of Switzerland Category:Geography of the canton of Uri Category:Monuments and memorials in Switzerland Category:Tourist attractions in the canton of Uri ","title":"Rütli"},{"id":"6215983","text":"NFL Quarterback Club 2000 is a sports video game developed by Acclaim Studios Austin and published by Acclaim Entertainment for Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast in 1999. ==Reception== The game received unfavorable reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

It is about a William Castle-type independent filmmaker, with the American home front during the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop. The film stars John Goodman, Cathy Moriarty, Simon Fenton, Omri Katz, Lisa Jakub, Robert Picardo, Kellie Martin, and Jesse White (in his final theatrical film role). It was written by Jerico Stone and Charles S. Haas, the latter portraying Mr. Elroy, a schoolteacher. ==Plot== In Key West, Florida in October 1962, Gene Loomis and his younger brother, Dennis, live on a military base with their mother while their father is away on a United States Navy submarine. At a local movie theater one afternoon, Gene and Dennis see a promo for an exclusive engagement of producer Lawrence Woolsey's sensational new horror film, entitled Mant! Woolsey is scheduled to make an in-person appearance at the cinema in Key West the following Saturday. After the boys return home to the base, the Loomis family watches as President Kennedy delivers a speech confirming the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Meanwhile, Woolsey arrives in Florida with his actress girlfriend, Ruth Corday. He finds the fearful atmosphere created by the ongoing missile crisis to be the perfect environment in which to host Mant!'s premiere. Woolsey has brought along two of his actors — Herb Denning, a former hired thug, and Bob, a victim of the Hollywood blacklist forced to find work in cheap, independent \\"B\\" movies — to impersonate outraged protestors who publicly object to Mant!'s exhibition. However, Jack and Rhonda, a local couple, make a strong argument for allowing the premiere based on First Amendment rights. Later, Gene reads an issue of Famous Monsters of Filmland and recognizes Denning from his appearance in an earlier Woolsey film. At school, Gene gradually befriends one of his classmates, Stan, and becomes infatuated with Jack and Rhonda's daughter, Sandra, after she gets a week of detention for protesting against uselessness of a \\"duck and cover\\" air raid drill, telling the other students that it would be preferable to die from the immediate effects of an atom bomb instead of acute radiation syndrome caused by fallout. Stan has a crush on another girl, Sherry, whose former boyfriend, Harvey Starkweather, is a violent juvenile delinquent and would-be poet. After Harvey threatens Stan for pursuing Sherry, Stan lies to her to call off their first date. Woolsey continues to devote himself to the promotion of Mant!, hiring Harvey to dress as the mutated half-man, half-ant creature from the film, and installing buzzers in theater seats as part of a gimmick he calls \\"Rumble-Rama,\\" although the cinema's manager, Howard, is concerned about the effects \\"Rumble-Rama\\" could have on the fragile balcony area, which has a maximum capacity of just 100 people. At the Saturday matinee, Sherry encounters Stan, who is attending the screening with Gene and Dennis; she is upset that he deceived her, but later reconciles with him. Sandra attends the premiere with her parents, but leaves them to watch the movie with Gene. When Harvey (costumed as the Mant! monster) sees Sherry and Stan kissing during the film, he attacks Stan in a rage, then punches Woolsey after Woolsey tries to intervene, and a chase ensues. Stan takes a rifle from a nuclear fallout shelter located inside the movie theater and uses it to frighten Harvey away, but Sandra and Gene are locked inside the shelter after the door is accidentally closed. While trapped, the two comfort each other and eventually share their first kiss. Woolsey helps rescue Sandra and Gene from the shelter before their oxygen supply runs out; however, Harvey reappears and holds a switchblade to Ruth's throat, demanding money from Woolsey before fleeing with Sherry. Howard calls the police, and Harvey is arrested after crashing his car outside the movie theater as Sherry and Stan reunite. Woolsey also realizes that Harvey has turned the \\"Rumble-Rama\\" machinery up so high that the overcrowded balcony in the cinema is starting to collapse. Assisted by Gene, Woolsey projects trompe l'oeil footage of a mushroom cloud that appears to blast a hole through the screen and outside wall of the theater, thus evacuating the panicked audience. Once the Cuban Missile Crisis has ended, Ruth and Woolsey leave for another premiere in Cleveland, Ohio, bidding goodbye to Sandra and Gene. Woolsey has grown fond of them, telling Ruth he might like to have children of his own some day. The film ends as Sandra and Gene watch helicopters fly over the beaches in Key West, waiting for Gene's father to return. ==Cast== * John Goodman as Lawrence Woolsey * Cathy Moriarty as Ruth Corday / Carole * Simon Fenton as Gene Loomis * Omri Katz as Stan * Lisa Jakub as Sandra * Kellie Martin as Sherry * Jesse Lee as Dennis Loomis * Lucinda Jenney as Anne Loomis * James Villemaire as Harvey Starkweather * Robert Picardo as Howard, the Theater Manager * Jesse White as Mr. Spector * Dick Miller as Herb Denning * John Sayles as Bob * David Clennon as Jack * Lucy Butler as Rhonda * Belinda Balaski as Stan's Mom * Naomi Watts as Shopping Cart Starlet ==Production== Joe Dante says the financing of the movie was difficult. > Matinee got made through a fluke.

[Laughs.]\\"Joe Dante\\" By Joshua Klein AV Club Nov 29, 2000 > accessed 3 February 2014 Principal photography began on April 13, 1992. Filming took place in and around Florida, including the towns of Cocoa, Maitland, and Key West in the Florida Keys. The interior sequences in the school and the theater were filmed on set at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. The street scenes were filmed at Oxnard, California. Production was completed on June 19, 1992. ===Music=== The original score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Several cues from previous films were also used, arranged and conducted by Dick Jacobs, including \\"Main Title\\" from Son of Dracula (1943); \\"Visitors\\" from It Came from Outer Space (1953); \\"Main Title\\" from Tarantula (1955); \\"Winged Death\\" from The Deadly Mantis (1957); two cues from This Island Earth (1955), \\"Main Title\\" and \\"Shooting Stars\\"; and three cues from the Creature from the Black Lagoon trilogy: \\"Monster Attack\\" from Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954); \\"Main Title\\" from Revenge of the Creature (1955); and \\"Stalking the Creature\\" from The Creature Walks Among Us (1956). ===Casting=== Joe Dante has cast character actor Dick Miller in each of his movies to date, casting him here as one of the men protesting the monster movie's release, and as a soldier holding a sack of sugar. Also appearing in supporting roles are William Schallert and Robert O. Cornthwaite (who both appeared in scores of low-budget films of all genres); Kevin McCarthy (perhaps best remembered for his role in Invasion of the Body Snatchers) as well as Robert Picardo, both of whom appeared in several of Dante's movies. John Sayles, who collaborated with Dante on earlier movies, appears as one of the men protesting the monster movie's release. ===Films within the film=== Mant! Woolsey's low-budget Mant! is a parody morphing of several low-budget science-fiction horror films of the 1950s (many in black & white) that fused radioactivity with mad science and mutation: In particular Tarantula (1955), wherein a scientist is injected with an atomic isotope formula with disastrous results, and in general the films Them! (1954); The Beast with a Million Eyes (1955) The Deadly Mantis (1957); The Black Scorpion (1957); The Amazing Colossal Man (1957); Monster That Challenged the World (1957); Beginning of the End (1957); War of the Colossal Beast (1958); The Fly (1958) and The Alligator People (1959). The depiction of Mant!'s use of \\"Rumble-Rama\\" is a riff on William Castle's many in-theatre gimmicks (\\"Emergo\\", \\"Percepto\\", \\"Illusion-O\\", \\"Shock Sections\\" etc.), however, the only \\"monster movie\\" produced or directed by William Castle before 1970 was 1959's The Tingler, which did not use a radiation theme. \\"Rumble-Rama\\" is also a nod to Sensurround, Universal's sound process of the 1970's. Matinee also mentions some of Woolsey's earlier \\"films\\": Island of the Flesh Eaters, The Eyes of Doctor Diablo, and The Brain Leeches (not to be confused with the real-world 1977 film of the same name). The Shook-Up Shopping Cart Although Matinee is set in October 1962, its other film within a film, the family-oriented gimmick comedy The Shook-Up Shopping Cart (featuring an anthropomorphic shopping cart), is a reference to some color Disney comedies that came later in the decade: The Love Bug (1969) in particular, and The Ugly Dachshund (1966); Monkeys, Go Home! (1967); Blackbeard's Ghost (1968); The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit (1968); The Million Dollar Duck (1971); Snowball Express (1972) and The Shaggy D.A. (1976) in general.DVD Savant: Joe Dante interviewed on the DVD release of Matinee By Glenn Erickson May 11, 2010The Onion A.V.

It ranked at #6 at the box office, grossing $3,601,015 in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $9,532,895 in its theatrical run. ==Reception== Matinee was well received by film critics and has a 92% approval rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews with an average rating of 7.61/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Smart, funny, and disarmingly sweet, Matinee is a film that film buffs will love -- and might even convert some non-believers.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three and half out of four stars and wrote, \\"There are a lot of big laughs in Matinee, and not many moments when I didn't have a wide smile on my face\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Matinee, which devotes a lot of energy to the minor artifacts of American pop culture circa 1962, is funny and ingenious up to a point. Eventually, it becomes much too cluttered, with an oversupply of minor characters and a labored bomb-and-horror-film parallel that necessitates bringing down the movie house\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B+\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"In Matinee, Dante has captured the reason that Cold War trash like Mant struck such a nerve in American youth: The prospect of atomic disaster was so fanciful and abstract that it began to merge in people's imaginations with the very pop culture it had spawned. In effect, it all became one big movie. Matinee is a loving tribute to the schlock that fear created\\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Peter Rainer wrote of Dante's film: \\"He pulls out his bag of tricks and even puts in an animated doodle; he's reaching not only for the flagrant awfulness of movies like MANT but also for the zippy ardor of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons. He does everything but put a buzzer under your seat\\". In his review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \\"At the same time that Dante has a field day brutally satirizing our desire to scare ourselves and others, he also re-creates early-60s clichés with a relish and a feeling for detail that come very close to love\\". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, \\"In this funny, philosophical salute to B-movies and the B-moguls who made them, Dante looks back fondly on growing up with the apocalypse always on your mind and atomic mutants lurking under your bed\\". In his review for the USA Today, Mike Clark wrote, \\"Part spoof, part nostalgia trip and part primer in exploitation-pic ballyhoo, Matinee is a sweetly resonant little movie-lovers' movie\\". ==See also== * Cuban Missile Crisis * List of films featuring fictional films ==References* * Joe Dante interview at DVD Savant Category:1993 films Category:1990s comedy-drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:American films Category:Films about the Cuban Missile Crisis Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Category:Films directed by Joe Dante Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:Films set in 1962 Category:Films set in a movie theatre Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films about shapeshifting Category:1993 comedy films Category:1993 drama films ","title":"Matinee (1993 film)"},{"id":"6216014","text":"A neighborhood Internet service provider (NISP) is a small scale broadband Internet service provider targeted at a single subdivision or neighborhood. They are built in a neighborhood to provide Internet access to residents in the community, often using rooftop antennas in a hub-and-spoke arrangement to bridge the last few hundred feet to the residences (or possibly businesses). Such a network requires a local network engineer (often a volunteer) to maintain network integrity and monitor the quality of service. There are firms that will install and maintain such a network, but there are other options. For instance, a loosely knit community might use a wireless mesh network to connect collectively owned access points. ==Advantages== With the right number of subscribers a NISP can easily cost less than the traditional DSL and cable lines. NISP offers greater speed in connectivity for larger groups of people compared to a Wi-Fi hotspot but at a cheaper price than wireless community network. NISP can use software such as P2P (peer-to-peer) in order to function efficiently with high performance neighbors. This can lead to the greatest amount of bandwidth being used by all. At the same time traffic can be kept within the network. ==Disadvantages== There are some legal disadvantages to having an NISP. For example, if the Internet connection being provided is secured by only one username and password, this makes the connection less secure since more than a few people have access. Another disadvantage is if a person has a stronger wi-fi transmitter they can use a particular frequency even if it causes the other neighbors connection to weaken. ==Alternate options== In smaller areas it can be beneficial to use Wi-Fi Hot Spots since it can provide more security, fewer legal repercussions, and cheaper and faster connectivity. For bigger groups it can be beneficial to use a wireless Internet service provider instead. ==See also== *Peer-to-peer *Hotspot (Wi-Fi) *Wireless Internet service provider *Wireless community network *Wireless mesh network ==References== Category:Internet service providers ","title":"Neighborhood Internet service provider"},{"id":"6216015","text":"The Regulatory Reform Act 2001 (c.6) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It replaced the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. It removed some of the constraints on Deregulation Orders under the 1994 Act, by providing wider powers for government ministers to make a Regulatory Reform Order by statutory instrument. The Act was introduced to the House of Lords on 7 December 2000, and passed to the House of Commons on 19 March 2001. It passed its Report Stage and Third Reading on 4 April 2001. Under the 2001 Act, a government minister can make a Regulatory Reform Order to \\"[reform] legislation which has the effect of imposing burdens\\", with a view to removing or reducing the regulatory burdens. The Act can only be used to reform existing legislation, so cannot be used to codify the common law, and can only be used where burdens are removed (although, unlike the 1994 Act, new burdens can also be imposed where proportional). An Order cannot be used to remove \\"necessary protections\\". The draft Order must be opened to public consultation, reviewed by Committees from both Houses of Parliament, and then approved by both Houses of Parliament. However, they are not debated on the floor of either chamber, unlike a Bill. The Act provided for four Deregulation Orders that were moving through the approval process to be completed. Between enactment in April 2001 and July 2005, the Act was used to pass 27 Regulatory Reform Orders. For example, to make orders to remove restrictions on business tenancies; to liberalise rules on gaming machines; to extend licensing hours for New Year's Eve 2001; and, for the Queen's Golden Jubilee, to remove the 20-partner limit on partnerships, and to rationalise legislation on fire safety. The Act has been largely replaced by the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The Act expands the range of ministerial order-making powers, allowing orders to be made in a wider range of circumstances, more quickly and efficiently, with less consultation and scrutiny. ==See also== * List of regulatory reform orders ==References== *Halsbury's Statutes.

Harman sometimes used the pseudonym Ted Horn. Harman was two months old when his parents moved from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where he grew up familiar with horses and the ranching lifestyle. His father had previously homesteaded in Pagosa in 1891. Harman dropped out of school after seven years and never had any formal art training. ==Kansas City== Fred Harman was the finest brush and ink artist of the Western genre. He was self taught and his eye for dramatic perspective, the authentic details he put into all of his work, is unmatched. Born Leslie Fred Harman, he worked as a pressman’s helper at The Kansas City Star, he came in contact with the newspaper's art staff. When he was 20 years old, he was employed at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, working with Walt Disney as an animator. Harman and Disney partnered to form their own company but went broke within a year. Harman then went back to Colorado. Harman's brother, Hugh Harman, was also an animator at Disney's Kansas City studio.Reynolds, Moira Davison. Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945-1980, McFarland, 2003. In the fall of 1924, Harman got a wire from an artist friend, Sam McConnell, about an illustrating job at Artcrafts Engraving Company. He took the first train he could get to St. Joseph, home of the Pony Express. In addition to his work as a catalog illustrator for Artcrafts (for the Olathe Boot Company, among other catalogs), Harmon created promotional art, book illustrations and film costume designs commemorating the Pony Express, and bought canvas and paint to create his own paintings at home in his spare time. Artcrafts then was on the 5th floor of the Jenkins Music Building, and Fred met and married musician Lola Andrews, who worked on the first floor of the same building. The couple had a son on May 27, 1927, the day Lindbergh arrived in Paris. Harman did not have the money to pay the hospital bill for his son's birth, so his boss at Artcrafts, William Henry Guenther Sr., bought one of Harman's paintings (of a cowboy with red hair) for the exact amount needed to cover the bill. The couple later moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where Fred was a partner in an advertising agency for several years before it failed. He was employed in Iowa for a short time before moving his wife and son to Pagosa Springs, where they built a log cabin. In 1933, he moved to Los Angeles, where he edited, illustrated and published a Western magazine that collapsed after three issues. Although the Stendahl Art Gallery staged a show of his paintings, none sold.Taos and Santa Fe Painters ==Red Ryder== Harman self-syndicated his Bronc Peeler strip from 1934 to 1938, finding few takers as he visited various West Coast newspaper offices. When he visited New York in 1938, he met publisher and licensing guru Stephen Slesinger and found success. Stephen Slesinger was looking for an exceptional artist to draw Red Ryder and Fred Harman was a perfect match. He was a genuine cowboy who had the talent and the knowledge of the authentic details Slesinger sought. Harman worked with Slesinger for a year, with other artists in Slesinger's New York Studios before Red Ryder was ready to debut. Red Ryder was launched, with a year's full of pre-written storylines, a multi-pronged, licensing campaign and a parade of appearances with Harman appearing as a real-life cowboy artist. Popular comic books, illustrated books and juvenile novels, Radio shows, movies, and an avalanche of dependable quality merchandise followed: From school supplies to camping supplies, toys, games, puzzles, novelties, craft kits and leather kits, wallets with secret pockets, watches, camping cookware and more. An exclusive Red Ryder Corral at J.C. Penny's offered Red Ryder Cowboy themed clothing, hats, suspenders, underwear, accessories, housewares and rugged Red Ryder Ranch Brand clothing for work and play. Soon there were Red Ryder Rodeos, Little Beaver Powwows, Red Ryder sponsored family events and outdoor youth programs. In 2020 Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc., owners of the Red Ryder trademarks, copyrights and archives, will celebrate the 80th Anniversary of Red Ryder's outdoor youth programs.. In March 1953, Harman embarked on a six-week USO tour, doing chalk talks at camps in England, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey and Africa.Western Treasures ==Cowboy Artists of America== Roping, oil painting by Fred Harman Harman lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while also maintaining his Pagosa Springs ranch. After he retired from the strip in 1964, he turned to painting at his Albuquerque studio. The strip was continued by Bob MacLeod, Jim Gary, John Wade Hampton, Edmond Good, the same talented artists who had helped produce the Red Ryder content, in the New York Studios of Stephen Slesinger. Harman was one of the original 1965 members of the Cowboy Artists of America, along with Joe Beeler, Charlie Dye, John Hampton, and George Phippen; and Harman's paintings were included in the first annual exhibition of the Cowboy Artists of America on September 9, 1966, at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City. Harman died in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1982. ==Awards== Among other honors, Harman was one of only 75 white men in history to be adopted into the Navajo Nation.Colorado Travel and Recreation Guide In 1958, he received the Sertoma Award as Colorado's Outstanding Citizen.National Cartoonists Society: Fred Harman The Red Ryder Round-up is an annual July 4 weekend event in Pagosa Springs, home of the Fred Harman Art Museum.Pagosa Daily Post: \\"Business Spotlight: Fred Harman Art Museum\\", Pagosa Daily Post, May 1, 2009. ==References *Fred Harman Western Art Museum *Cowboy Artists of America history *Find a Grave Category:1902 births Category:1982 deaths Category:American comic strip cartoonists Category:Artists of the American West Category:People from Burbank, California Category:People from Pagosa Springs, Colorado ","title":"Fred Harman"},{"id":"6216036","text":"Wayne in his shop Wayne C.

Bodindecha hold the post of Samuha Nayok () the Prime Minister of Northern Siam from 1827 to 1849. He was known for his leading roles in putting down the Laotian Rebellion of King Anouvong of Vientiane () and Siamese-Vietnamese Wars in 1831-1834 and 1841-1845 (). His descendants bear the surname Sinhaseni (). ==Life== Bodindecha was born on 13 January 1776 in modern Phra Nakhon District during the Thonburi Kingdom period, with personal name Sing (lit. \\"Lion\\"), as the fourth child to Chao Phraya Abhayraja Pin. His mother was Lady Fug. His father, Chao Phraya Abhayraja Pin, had served as Samuha Kalahom () the Prime Minister of Southern Siam. Abhayraja had his son Sing become a royal page of Prince Isarasundhorn. The prince was later crowned as King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai and Sing was transferred to the service under Prince Maha Senanurak the Front Palace. He joined his lord in the campaign against Burmese Invasion of Phuket in 1809 and rose through ranks in Front Palace Police Bureau. He was later made Phraya Ksetraraksa the Head of Agriculture Department of the Front Palace. In 1816, during one of the royal barge processions, Bodindecha accidentally had his barges passed across in front of one of the royal barges and faced treason charges. Bodindecha was imprisoned and only through the intervention of Prince Chetsadabodin that he was pardoned and released but relieved of his positions. He went on to serve Prince Chetsadabodin in his mercantile affairs. When Prince Chetsadabodin was crowned as King Rama III in 1824, Bodindecha was made Phraya Ratchasuphawadi the Head of Conscription Department. ===Laotian Rebellion wars=== In 1826, King Anouvong of Vientiane rebelled against Siamese rule in Lao Rebellion. Bodindecha with the title Phraya Rajasupawadi was assigned Southern Laos and the Kingdom of Champassak. Bodindecha managed to take the city of Champassak and capture King Nyô and send him to Bangkok. Chao Phraya Abhaybhudhorn the Samuha Nayok fell ill and died during the campaigns in 1827. King Rama III then elevated Bodindecha to Chao Phraya Rajasupawadi and transferred the responsibilities of the Samuha Nayok to him. When Prince Maha Sakdi Polsep, the leader of the campaign, returned to Bangkok, Bodindecha was left in charge in Laos. He brought the renowned Lao Buddha image Phra Bang from Vientiane to Bangkok (which would later be returned to Vientiane in 1867). Upon his return to Bangkok, King Rama III commanded Bodindecha to return to Laos in order to completely destroy the city of Vientiane to prevent further rebellions. During this time, Emperor Minh Mạng sent Vietnamese envoys to bring Anouvong from Nghệ An Province back to Vientiane to negotiate. Anouvong, however, ambushed the Siamese garrisons and retook Vientiane. The position of Bodindecha's encampment at Nong Khai became insecure so Bodindecha decided to retreat south. Anouvong sent his son Raxavong Ngao to lead Lao army to pursue Bodindecha. Bodindecha decided to meet his enemies at Bokwan (modern Nong Khai). Rattanakosin Chronicles of the Third Reign from 1931 gives accounts on personal engagements between Bodindecha and Raxavong Ngao. Raxavong Ngao drove Bodindecha off his horse and rushed his spear at the Siamese general that narrowly missed. Raxavong Ngao then slashed Bodindecha with sword but Bodindecha's younger brother ran to aid and received the blow and died. Bodindecha took the opportunity to stab Raxavong's thigh with knife. Siamese soldiers came to rescue and shot Raxavong Ngao at his knee. Lao soldiers then carried Raxavong Ngao off the battlefield. Bodindecha's victory at the Battle of Bokwan in 1828 caused Anouvong to flee to Xiang Khuoang. Chao Noy the ruler of Muang Phuan told Bodindecha the whereabouts of Anouvong so that Bodindecha managed to send his men to capture Anouvong and sent him as captive to Bangkok. Upon his return to Bangkok, King Rama III officially invested him with the title of Chao Phraya Bodindecha the Samuha Nayok Prime Minister of Northern Siam. The title name \\"Bodindecha\\" was from the king's personal name \\"Chetsadabodin\\". ===Siamese-Vietnamese Wars=== In 1833, Bodindecha led Siamese armies to attack Saigon and to put the Cambodian Prince Ang Em on the throne at Oudong against the pro-Vietnamese king Ang Chan II, while his colleague Chao Phraya Phraklang led the fleet. Bodindecha marched through Cambodia virtually unopposed as King Ang Chan had fled to southern Vietnam along with his court. Bodindecha joined Phraklang at Châu Đốc, An Giang Province in 1834 and they both marched the fleet along the Bassac River to Saigon. Bodindecha met the Vietnamese fleet at Vàm Nao canal in January 1834 and the Battle of Vàm Nao ensued. The Siamese were defeated and Bodindecha and Phraklang retreated to Châu Đốc. After repeated Vietnamese attacks on Châu Đốc, Bodindecha decided to retreat to Battambang, his main base. Initial Siam's defeat enabled Nguyen dynasty to fully control Cambodia. After the death of King Ang Chan in 1834, Emperor Minh Mạng put Cambodia under direct rule led by Trương Minh Giảng. Bodindecha made Prince Ang Em the governor of Battambang and returned to Bangkok. However, Prince Ang Em switched side to Vietnam in 1838 and gave Siamese officials in Battambang to the Vietnamese. Bodindecha returned to Battambang in 1839 and in 1840 the native Cambodians rose in rebellion against Vietnamese rule. In November 1840, Bodindecha laid siege on Pursat and managed to obtain peaceful surrender. The Vietnamese had retreated from Cambodia to An Giang Province by 1841. Bodindecha then sent Ang Im's younger brother Prince Ang Duong to Oudong as a candidate for Cambodian throne. Bodindecha returned to Bangkok in 1845. The Vietnamese, however, renewed their attacks in May 1845 and took Phnom Penh. Bodindecha hurriedly marched to Oudong to defend. Nguyễn Văn Chương led the Vietnamese armies to lay siege on Oudong in September 1845. After some fightings and stand-offs, both sides agreed to negotiate. After five-month- long siege, Nguyễn Văn Chương lifted the siege and went back to An Giang. It was agreed that Prince Ang Duong was to be crowned and tributes would be sent to both Siam and Vietnam. Bodindecha presented the royal regalia granted by King Rama III to Ang Duong and crowned him as the King of Cambodia in 1848. ==Final years and death== After many years in Cambodia, Bodindecha finally returned to Bangkok in 1848. On his way to Bangkok, Bodindecha met Phraklang again at Chacheongsao where the Teochew societies had rioted and took over the city. Bodindecha supported Phraklang in his subjugation of Chinese rioters and they together returned to Bangkok. One year after his return to Bangkok, on 24 June 1849, Bodindecha passed away during the Cholera epidemic, aged 73, at his residence near modern Sampheng, Samphanthawong District. King Rama III sponsored his cremation in 1850 at Wat Saket. ==Family and Issues== Bodindecha had several wives, as per the contemporary practice of the era. His main wife was Lady Peng, daughter of Phra Pipitsali.

The seat of the municipality was in Kalianoi, 41 km southwest of the town of Kiato. The municipal unit occupies a mountain valley with an average altitude of 600 metres. Mount Kyllene dominates it to the NW, rising to a height of c. 2,400 metres. The largest village is Kaisari, but the principal antiquities are just south of the modern village of Stymfalia, a hamlet of c. 150 inhabitants. ==History== Silver obolus from Stymphalos depicting Heracles on the obverse and a Stymphalian bird and inscription ΣΤΥΜΦΑΛΙΑ on the reverse. View of Hadrian's aqueduct. In ancient Greece, Stymphalos, lying in this valley of northwestern Arcadia, was famous as the site of one of the Labors of Hercules, the slaying of the Stymphalian birds. Hera, whose presence is never far from Heracles, was venerated at the site in an archaic form in which she took three phases, as maiden, matron, and even widow.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 7.22.2. Pindar mentions an Olympic victor in the mule-cart race (a man called Hagesias) in his sixth Olympian Ode, and urges the members of the choir to venerate their virginal Hera, who was apparently a survival of pre-Olympian religion. Pausanias mentions a statue of Dromeus, a long-distance runner from Stymphalos who won at all the Panhellenic Games in the mid-5th century BC. Little else is known of Stymphalos from ancient literature. Artemis was the principal divinity of the town and her temple seems still to have been in use in Roman times. One unusual aspect of the goddess is that her sanctuary is referred to in an inscription of the early 2nd century BC as that of Brauronian Artemis, an Athenian cult. An inscription commemorating Stymphalian hospitality to the people of Elateia was to be set up in the agora of Elateia and in the sanctuary of Brauronian Artemis at Stymphalos. Demeter and Hermes are also epigraphically attested. Anastasios Orlandos excavated parts of the site for the Archaeological Society of Athens between 1924 and 1930. Since 1982, excavations of the site on the north shore of Lake Stymphalia have been under way, directed by Hector Williams for the University of British Columbia. Archaeological surveys and excavations have revealed a town refounded in the 4th century BC.The Bronze Age and early classical Stymphalos has not been precisely located. The later city was laid out on a grid plan, with six-meter- wide roads running north–south every thirty metres, which intersected major east–west avenues at intervals over a hundred metres. Houses have also been identified, as have a theatre, a palaestra, a fountain house, several temples, and the sanctuary, where an inscription preserving the letters POLIAD... (\\"of Athena Polias\\") found by Orlandos in 1925, but now lost, seems to indicate Athena Polias as the divinity worshipped, though no further confirmation of this has been found. A graffito on a sherd from the site refers to the goddess of childbirth, Eilythyia. Large quantities of jewelry (mostly copper or bronze) suggest a sanctuary frequented by women; the partially preserved statue of a child supports the kourotrophic interpretation of the cult. In an annex to the temple, several dozen loom weights suggest the further presence of Athena in a weaving workshop. The sanctuary was destroyed, probably by the Romans in 146 BC, but later seems to have been at least revisited to judge from early to mid Roman pottery lamps from the area. There are four early Christian cemeteries. Just to the north of the ancient city are the remains of the medieval Cistercian monastery of Zaraka, also partially excavated by the Royal Canadian Institute. There are various other smaller sites scattered around the valley, but as yet there has been no systematic survey of them. ==References *Stymphalos Excavations *Kiato Greater Area Category:Populated places in Corinthia ","title":"Stymfalia"},{"id":"6216070","text":"Aydilge Sarp (born June 25, 1979) is a Turkish writer, poet and singer- songwriter. ==Biography== Aydilge Sarp was born in 1979 in Kütahya, Turkey.

Kettering, were native citizens of Dayton. They moved to Hinsdale, Illinois near Chicago in the 1940s. During the polio epidemic in the 1950s, they were inspired by the care given at Hinsdale Hospital, which would play a vital role in the foundation of Kettering Medical Center. Following the death of his father in 1958, the younger Ketterings moved from Illinois back to Dayton to help manage family affairs. Health care was a primary focus of Charles Kettering, so Eugene and Virginia led efforts to open a local area hospital in his honor. Ground was broken on July 7, 1961. In 1964, Charles F. Kettering Memorial Hospital opened under the leadership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In October 2010 Kettering Medical Center opened the Benjamin and Marian Schuster Heart Hospital, a new wing to the hospital that included a renovated lobby and new main entrance with an outpatient pharmacy, expanded gift shop and bakery.

Stringed instruments hanging on a wall. Shown here are 4 Lookoeos, 2 mandolins, a banjo, a guitar, a violin, a Guraitar and a bass guitar. Kantele Plucked string instruments are a subcategory of string instruments that are played by plucking the strings. Plucking is a way of pulling and releasing the string in such a way as to give it an impulse that causes the string to vibrate. Plucking can be done with either a finger or a plectrum. Most plucked string instruments belong to the lute family (such as guitar, bass guitar, mandolin, banjo, balalaika, sitar, pipa, etc.), which generally consist of a resonating body, and a neck; the strings run along the neck and can be stopped at different pitches. The zither family (including the autoharp, kantele, gusli, kannel, kankles, kokles, koto, guqin, gu zheng and many others) does not have a neck, and the strings are stretched across the soundboard. In the harp family (including the lyre), the strings are perpendicular to the soundboard and do not run across it. The harpsichord does not fit any of these categories but is also a plucked string instrument, as its strings are struck with a plectrum when the keys are depressed. Bowed string instruments, such as the violin, can also be plucked in the technique known as pizzicato; however, as they are usually played with a bow, they are not included in this category. Struck string instruments (such as the piano) can be similarly plucked as an extended technique. Plucked string instruments are not a category in the Sachs-Hornbostel classification, aside from 335 and 336, as some of them are simple chordophones and others are composite (depending on whether the resonator is the removable part of the instrument).

He was a two-time winner of the NFL's \\"Fastest Man\\" competition. He played college football at Auburn University. ==Early years== Wright attended Albany High School, where he focused on track and field until his senior season, when he made the football team. He played at wide receiver and cornerback, where his athletic ability allowed him to cover opposing players one-on-one without any additional support. ==College career== He accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University. He was initially a defensive back, but because of his poor tackling and lack of run support abilities, he was moved to wide receiver as a sophomore. As a junior in his first start, he faced the University of Tennessee, tallying 3 receptions for 108 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown. In the season, he registered 12 receptions for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns. Wright developed slowly on the offensive side of the ball and didn't see much playing time, until becoming a starter as a senior after replacing the graduated Lawyer Tillman. In the season opener against the University of the Pacific, he registered single-game school records with 263 receiving yards (52.6 average) and 4 touchdowns. Against the University of Tennessee, he collected four receptions for 129 yards and one touchdown. He had an outstanding game against the University of Alabama, recording 7 receptions for 143 yards in a 30-20 victory over unbeaten Alabama, in the season finale and first Iron Bowl to be played at Jordan–Hare Stadium. After finishing the season with 30 receptions (led the team) for 714 yards (led the team) and 6 receiving touchdowns (led the team) in a ground oriented offense, he received the Shug Jordan Award as the team's outstanding senior football player. Wright finished in the school's all-time top ten career receiving list with 56 receptions for 1,320 yards and 11 touchdowns. He still holds the record with a career average of 23.57 yards per reception. One-out-of-five of his 56 receptions went for touchdown with an average distance of over 57 yards. Of his 11 touchdown receptions, 6 were longer than 50 yards. He also scored in 4 out of the 12 times he ran a reverse run. He also practiced track and field. In 1988, he won the Southeastern Conference title in both the 55 meters and the 200 meters, becoming only the second athlete in conference history to be named All-American in three events (55 meters, 200 meters and 4 × 100 metres relay). His time of 6.18 seconds in the 55 meters, at the time tied him with Bo Jackson as the sixth fastest sprinter in school history. ==Professional careerDallas Cowboys=== Wright was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (26th overall) of the 1990 NFL Draft, the first wide receiver to be chosen and the first pick of the round. Although he was considered a raw football player, he was also seen as a gifted athlete with elite speed. He was intended to become a deep threat wide receiver, to complement running back Emmitt Smith, chosen in the first round of the same draft. As well as Smith, he also had a long (40 days) rookie contract holdout, that forced him to miss most of training camp and the first two preseason games. In the second game against the New York Giants he returned a kickoff for a 90-yard touchdown. In 1991, he was a starter at wide receiver in the first 8 games, before being passed on the depth chart by rookie Alvin Harper. He displayed his talent on special teams as a kickoff returner, ranking third in the league and second in the NFC. Against the Phoenix Cardinals he had a 71-yard kickoff return. On December 22, 1991, he set the record for the longest play in Cowboys history, with a 102-yard kick off return against the Atlanta Falcons. , he and Mel Renfro are the only Cowboys with multiple kick return touchdowns. Wright was one of the fastest players in the league, winning the NFL's \\"Fastest Man\\" competition in 1992 and 1993. In May 1991, he was timed to have run the 40-yard dash in 4.14 seconds. He was also the strongest wide receiver on the team. He did not develop as well as expected, however, and when later asked about his performance, he admitted \\"I was never a polished package\\". At the end of the 1991 season, the Cowboys began looking for trade offers. On October 13, 1992, he was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick (#96-Ron Stone), when he still had no receptions following the first five games of the season. ===Los Angeles Raiders=== Wright was acquired to complement Tim Brown and Willie Gault in the team's speed-driven offense. In 1993, he became a full-time starter and had his most productive season, recording 27 receptions for 462 yards. During the final game of that season and with the Raiders trailing the Denver Broncos 23-30, he caught the game-tying touchdown pass from Jeff Hostetler and the Raiders went on to win the game 33-30, while earning a spot in the playoffs. In 1994, he was sidelined for most of training camp with a calf injury he suffered in the first week of activity, but still managed to keep his starting position. During his time with the Raiders, sportscaster Chris Berman nicknamed him “If Loving You Is Wrong I Don’t Want to Be” Wright. ===St. Louis Rams=== On March 22, 1995, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Rams. A bulging disk in his lower back forced him to miss the last 8 games of the season. The next year his back problems resurfaced and he was limited to 3 games. He retired after the 1996 season, due to health reasons related to his back. === Statistics === {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" !! colspan=\\"5\\" Receiving !! colspan=\\"5\\"Rushing !! colspan=\\"3\\"Fumbles - !

The Hood Baronetcy, of Catherington in the County of Hampshire, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 20 May 1778 for the naval commander Samuel Hood (1724-1816). In 1796, he was elevated to the Peerage of Great Britain as Viscount Hood.

The baronetcy was created with remainder to his nephew Alexander Hood (1793-1851) of Wootton House, Butleigh, Somerset, and the heirs male of his body. The 1st Baronet was the grandson of Alexander Hood (c.1675-1756) of Mosterton in Dorset (uncle of Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood and Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport) by his wife, Ann Way. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the 2nd Baronet, who represented Somerset West in the House of Commons. His son, the 3rd Baronet, in 1849 married Isabel Harriet Fuller-Palmer-Acland, daughter and heiress of Sir Peregrine Fuller-Palmer-Acland, 2nd Baronet (d.1871), of Fairfield in Somerset, and assumed by royal licence the additional surnames of Fuller and Acland. Sir Peregrine Fuller-Palmer-Acland bought the estate of St Audries in the parish of West Quantoxhead, West Somerset, for his daughter Isabel and her husband.A P Baggs, R J E Bush and M C Siraut, 'Parishes: West Quantoxhead', in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 5, ed.

His son, the fourth Baronet, succeeded in 1905 to the Bateman Baronetcy, of Hartington Hall, according to a special remainder in the letters patent. Fuller-Acland-Hood also represented Wellington, Somerset, in Parliament and held minor office from 1902 to 1905 in the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour. On 22 January 1911, he was created Baron St Audries, of St Audries in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son was Alexander Peregrine, the 2nd Baron, who in 1925 sold the estate of St Audries, though not the lordship of the manor, to W. A.

He was the son of the younger son of the third Baronet. However, he never successfully proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. Upon his death in 1990, the titles were considered to have become either extinct or dormant.

This connection maintains proper alignment between the metatarsal and the tarsal bones. In 20% of people there are two bands of this ligament (dorsal and plantar). Sometimes, lisfranc ligament refers specifically to the ligament that connects the superior, lateral surface of the medial cuneiform to the superior, medial surface of the base of the second metatarsal. It is injured or disrupted in the Lisfranc fracture. Trauma to the midfoot is caused by direct and indirect impact forces. Direct force involves an object landing on the surface on the foot while indirect force involves twisting of the foot, usually an impact to the heel while the foot is pointed down toward the ground. A mild form of this injury results in a widening of the gap between the first and second metatarsals. An extreme form of the a Lisfranc fracture causes a complete dislocation of the metatarsals from the tarsal bones. When the alignment of the midfoot is affected joint cartilage is quickly damaged.

It was the first hockey game to come from Acclaim Entertainment. The Nintendo 64 version has Rumble Pak support. It was followed by a sequel, NHL Breakaway 99, released the following year. ==Features== NHL Breakaway 98 has a momentum-based checking system. Players can out-skate and out-muscle each other, depending on a player's size and speed. Some players are small but fast, while others are slow but possess strength and size. If a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving at high speed, the power behind his check is greater than what someone like Pierre Turgeon could produce. ==Gameplay== Two players can compete in the Versus mode. If a player is edited, the name and number appear on the player's back. The game does not feature play-by-play announcers, but there is a public address announcer that only speaks when penalties are called, and when a player scores a goal, the name and number are said. ==Reception== The Nintendo 64 version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PlayStation version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Reviewers were split about the PlayStation version; GameSpot and IGN both hailed it as a strong entrance into the crowded hockey genre by Acclaim, while GamePro and Next Generation opined that though it has some good features (the management mode and its point system were almost uniformly praised by critics), it fails to effectively compete against established franchises from EA Sports (NHL) and Sony Computer Entertainment (NHL FaceOff). Where Next Generation said the graphics are rough and GamePro said the players move stiffly, GameSpot and IGN both said the graphics and animation are incredibly detailed and lifelike. And while GameSpot asserted that \\"Even my puck-head of a roommate who is still addicted to NHL 96 for the Sega Genesis could immediately play Breakaway without being intimidated by the control\\", GamePro maintained that \\"the unruly movements of your players make controlling them very frustrating\\", and Next Generation found that \\"The speed is so intense that it takes away from the control and strategy by making the game a bit random. Often a goal will happen and no one realizes it until the players start to celebrate.\\" IGN, which called the momentum-based checking \\"one of the most innovative features ever to appear in a hockey game\\", summarized that \\"Acclaim has definitely poured its hearts into its initial entry -- and it shows.\\" On the other side, Next Generation concluded that \\"Breakaway is a solid hockey game that would've been best a year ago.

Plomin, FBA (born 1948) is an American psychologist and geneticist best known for his work in twin studies and behavior genetics. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Plomin as the 71st most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He is the author of several books on genetics and psychology. == Biography == Plomin earned a B.A. in psychology from DePaul University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in psychology in 1974 from the University of Texas at Austin under personality psychologist Arnold Buss. He then worked at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. From 1986 until 1994 he worked at Pennsylvania State University, studying elderly twins reared apart and twins reared together to study aging and is currently at the Institute of Psychiatry (King's College London). He has been president of the Behavior Genetics Association. In 1987, Plomin married Judith Dunn, a British psychologist and academic. ==Honors and awards== In 2002, the Behavior Genetics Association awarded him the Dobzhansky Memorial Award for a Lifetime of Outstanding Scholarship in Behavior Genetics. He was awarded the William James Fellow Award by the Association for Psychological Science in 2004 and the 2011 Lifetime Achievement Award of the International Society for Intelligence Research. In 2017, Plomin received the APA Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions. Plomin was ranked among the 100 most eminent psychologists in the history of science. In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for humanities and social sciences. == Research == Plomin has shown the importance of non-shared environment, a term that he coined to refer to the environmental factors that reduce the similarity of individuals raised in the same family environment. In addition, he has shown that many environmental measures in psychology show genetic influence and that genetic factors can mediate associations between environmental measures and developmental outcomes. Plomin currently conducts the Twins Early Development Study of all twins born in England from 1994 to 1996, focusing on developmental delays in early childhood, their association with behavioural problems and educational attainment.Ghosh, Pallab (8 August 2000).

The Jurchen Later Jin had been waging war on the Ming for several years, and their leader Nurhaci had deemed Ningyuan to be a suitable target for his attack, in part due to advice from a Chinese defector, Li Yongfang. Later Jin failed to take the city and Nurhaci was wounded in the assault, dying eight months later. The Ming emerged victorious, marking a temporary resurgence of the Ming army after an eight-year-long series of defeats. ==Background== The Ming had suffered a series of defeats against the Jurchens prior to 1626 and lost the key city of Shenyang in 1621 and the port city of Lüshun in 1625. Part of the Ming army's new strategy of defense was to develop Ningyuan into a military stronghold. Yuan Chonghuan, with the support of Sun Chengzong, was assigned the task of conducting a major strengthening of Ningyuan's defenses in anticipation of a Jurchen attack. However, the defensive preparation was hindered when Sun Chengzong was replaced by a new commander due to Wei Zhongxian's purge of all Donglin movement (eastern forest) elements in the Ming court. Officials deemed to have any connection to the Donglin faction were removed, and in some cases faced arrest, torture, and execution. Sun Chengzong was replaced with the new commander Gao Di by the end of 1625. Gao Di ordered all Ming forces outside the Great Wall to retreat and abandon land outside Shanhai Pass. Yuan objected strongly and was thus left to command a lone army guarding Ningyuan. Yuan was left with only 20,000 men under his command. In 1626 Nurhaci received news of the Ming retreat and decided to advance towards Ningyuan on the advice of a Chinese defector, Li Yongfang. He personally led a force of 100,000-130,000 (at least 60,000) to take Ningyuan. Initially Nurhaci attempted to convince Ningyuan's defenders to simply surrender, and sent a letter boasting that he had an army of 200,000, but Yuan did not believe him, and retorted that he had perhaps 130,000. In addition Yuan declared that he and his commanders Man Gui, Zu Dashou, and He Kegang were ready to fight to death. He was said to have quoted an ancient maxim at that point, saying, \\"Those who seek life will die, but those who welcome death will live.\\" Yuan ordered everything outside Ningyuan to be burnt, including the houses, so that there would be nothing of use to the Jurchens. Heavy cannons were set up along the city walls and gunners from Fujian assigned to them. Lines of saltpeter were placed at the base of the walls to prevent sappers. The day before the battle Yuan personally walked along the walls inspecting their defenses and publicly declared his defiance against the Later Jin by conducting a blood pact with his remaining soldiers - a public notice of defiance was written in his blood. Yuan then sent orders to Shanhai Pass to execute any deserters they found, thus greatly boosting the city's morale. ==Course of battle== The Jin army arrived and set up camp around the city, but they had misjudged the range of Ming cannons, which opened fire on them, and they were forced to retreat. The battle began with Nurhaci personally leading an attack on the southwest corner of the city, which he deemed to be the most vulnerable. Ming cannons opened fire and inflicted heavy casualties on the Jin cavalry. Jin forces assaulted the city from another side using reinforced siege carts while archers provided cover fire, hoping to draw out the defenders so that their \\"iron cavalry\\" could flank them. However, in addition to regular cannon shots, the defenders also launched poisonous bombs which prevented the Jin forces from advancing, and their siege carts were shot to pieces. Some managed to reach the walls, but the lines of saltpeter that the Ming had previously set up were ignited, creating a protective barrier of fire around the city. Following up Yuan sent forth a squad of \\"expendables\\" who finished off the rest of the siege carts. Meanwhile, the Jin were attacking another corner of the city but were repulsed by burning oil and incendiary attacks. Bed sheets covered in gunpowder and oil were dropped on them. Jin forces retreated that night. Seeing that the siege was not going well, Nurhaci detailed a contingent of Mongol cavalry led by Manchu general Wunage () to attack the island of Juehua, which served as the primary granary of Ningyuan. Defenses at Juehua had been lax due to the belief that the Jin could not invade the island as they had no boats, and were poor sailors. However, the water around Juehua froze that year, and the Jin army was able to cross with their cavalry. The attack killed thousands and many grain stores were destroyed, but the island itself held for the time being. After several days of failed assaults, Ningyuan had still not fallen and instead inflicted heavy losses on the Jin forces. Nurhaci himself was wounded by a cannon shot and decided to withdraw to Mukden. ==Aftermath== Two hundred sixty nine heads were taken by Yuan Chonghuan's forces and delivered to Beijing as a token of their victory. Yuan was promoted to Censor-in-Chief of the Right Yuan promoted his strategy of fortifying key cities to retake lost land and began constructing defenses for Jinzhou further north of Ningyuan. The Tianqi Emperor dispatched 40,000 troops to aid in Yuan's construction projects. Nurhaci succumbed to his wounds and died in Mukden eight months later. His eighth son, the fourth Beile, Hong Taiji, assumed the title of the Great Khan of the Later Jin. Hong Taiji, like his father, was defeated in the Battle of Ning-Jin a year later. While the failure to take Ningyuan temporarily halted the Jurchen advance, the Later Jin increased pressure in the Bohai Gulf and the kingdom of Joseon. On the whole, the Jurchens were not able to break the defense of the Ningyuan garrison even after the death of Yuan Chonghuan. However, in 1644, the Ming emperor ordered the Ningyuan garrison to withdraw to Beijing to defend it against Li Zicheng's rebel army. The Ningyuan garrison was unable to reach Beijing before it fell and the Ming emperor committed suicide. Subsequently, the Manchus defeated the rebel army and captured Beijing. ==See also== *Timeline of the Ming dynasty *Timeline of the Qing dynasty ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Conflicts in 1626 Ninyuan 1626 Category:1626 in China Category:History of Liaoning Category:Huludao ","title":"Battle of Ningyuan"},{"id":"6216290","text":"Sandusky Township is one of the eighteen townships of Richland County, Ohio, United States.

This family was originally seated at Walden, Essex where William Strachey was living under the rule of Edward VI. Later they moved to Surrey and at last settled at Sutton Court, Somerset. The title was created on 15 June 1801 for the politician and civil servant Henry Strachey. Sir Henry was private secretary to Lord Clive during his last expedition to India in 1764. He also took part in negotiations for peace with North America where he assisted the kings commissioners at Paris. He died in 1809 and was succeeded by his eldest son Henry, the second Baronet Strachey. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, was a Liberal politician. On 3 November 1911 he was created Baron Strachie, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He later served as Paymaster-General. The peerage became extinct on the death of his son, the second Baron, in 1973. The late Baron was succeeded in the baronetcy by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of John Strachey, son and namesake of John Strachey, second son of the third Baronet. Strachey died January 2014 and did not use his title. Also, he had not successfully proven his succession and was therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant.Baronetcies to which no Succession has been proved , The Standing Council of the Baronetage.

The Canadian Payments Association was established by the Canadian Payments Act in 1980. Among other responsibilities, it regulates and maintains directories of bank routing numbers in Canada. == Services == Payments Canada is a corporation that: * Operates and maintains Canadian national systems for the clearing and settlement of payments and other arrangements for the making or exchange of payments; * Facilitates the interaction of Payments Canada's systems with others involved in the exchange, clearing and settlement of payments; and * Facilitates the development of new payment methods and technologies. == Clearing and settlement systems == Clearing and settlement systems are essential to the smooth functioning of the economy. These systems allow financial institutions to calculate how much is owed to each other as a result of their customer's transactions and to transfer those funds to settle those balances. Payments Canada operates three clearing and settlement systems. # The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is Canada's primary system for clearing and settling large value, time-critical Canadian dollar transactions. It provides participants and their customers with the certainty that, once a payment has passed the system's risk-control tests, the transactions are final and will settle on the books of the Bank of Canada the same day. # The Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS) is a system through which Canadian dollar cheques and electronic payment items, such as direct deposits, ATM withdrawals, point of sale transactions, online payments and pre-authorized debit and bill payments are cleared and settled. The system tracks the exchange of payment items and the resulting balances due to and from direct participants. # Payments Canada also operates the U.S. Dollar Bulk Exchange (USBE), a parallel system to the (ACSS) used for payment items in US dollars in Canada. == Statistics == In 2016, Payments Canada's systems cleared and settled 7.4 billion payments totaling over $50.8 trillion - $201.5 billion on average each business day. == Governance == The organization has 115 members including the Bank of Canada, chartered banks, trust and loan companies, credit union centrals, federations of caisses populaires and other financial institutions. The Minister of Finance has oversight responsibilities for Payments Canada. The Governor of the Bank of Canada has oversight responsibility for the LVTS and ACSS under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act. The 13-member Board of Directors consists of the President; three directors who are directors, officers or employees of members that, in the normal course of business, maintain a settlement account at the Bank of Canada; two directors who are directors, officers or employees of members other than those described previously); and seven directors who are independent of the association and of its members. A 20-person Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) provides advice and input to represent the diverse interests of users of the payments system. The SAC was established in 1996 on a voluntary basis and was formalized in the Canadian Payments Act in 2001. The SAC provides advice to the Payments Canada Board of Directors on payment, clearing, and settlement matters, and contributes input on proposed initiatives, including by-laws, policy statements, and rules that affect third parties. It also identifies issues that might concern payment system users and third-party service providers, and suggests how they could be addressed. Payments Canada's Member Advisory Council (MAC) serves as a consultative and engagement forum for Payment Canada's members. It was created in 2015, to ensure members continue to have a strong voice with the new majority- independent Board. Payments Canada is headquartered in Ottawa, with an office in Toronto. == Activities == Payments Canada ensures that significant rule changes follow an established public consultation process to seek input from key user groups. In 2010, it facilitated industry-wide innovation with frameworks for contactless debit payments. Payments Canada is leading the Canadian effort to adopt ISO 20022. In 2015, Payments Canada released a 5-year corporate strategic plan. The core purpose of this strategic plan is to underpin the Canadian financial system and economy by providing safe, efficient and effective clearing and settlement of payments. Payments Canada has identified three long-term desired outcomes that will lead the organization to attaining their vision, addressing payment trends and managing risks. The long-term desired outcomes are as follows: # Modernize: Payments Canada is undertaking a multi-year program to modernize the core payments systems, including the rules, standards and technology infrastructure in order to ensure safe, secure and innovative systems for the coming years. In May 2017, with the Bank of Canada and the R3 consortium, as well of some Canadian chartered banks, announced the results of a year-long trial of R3 consortium's DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) which will not be adopted at this time by Canada for reasons of transaction privacy and scalability.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob- commentary/could-dlt-underpin-an-entire-wholesale-payment- system/article35106771/ # Operate and Enhance: While driving the Modernization changes, Payments Canada is continuing to ensure that the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of its current systems are met through required enhancements to technology resilience and rules and through changes that respond to business needs. # Transition and Renewal: To be successful, Payments Canada must continue to build our organizational capacity and continue internal process improvements by focusing on leadership development, risk management, technology, operations and corporate administration. == Annual conference == Payments Canada holds Canada's largest payments conference, The Summit, on an annual basis. ==References * Category:Payment systems organizations Category:Banking in Canada Category:1980 establishments in Canada Category:Canadian federal departments and agencies ","title":"Payments Canada"},{"id":"6216357","text":"The Novi engine is an American dual overhead cam supercharged V8 engine used in racing cars in the Indianapolis 500 from 1941 to 1966. Designed by Bud Winfield and Leo Goossen, it was built by Fred Offenhauser in suburban Novi, Michigan, near Detroit. ==Early years== The Novi was first used in 1941 at the Indianapolis 500 under the \\"Winfield\\" name; it produced over , an amazing output for the time.http://www.studebaker-info.org/Indy/NOvi/novi1.html It was fitted to a 1935 frame built for a Miller engine, but its power made the vehicle very difficult to handle.Andy Granatelli recounts the difficulties and fatalities involved with the Novi in Karl Ludvigsen, Novi V-8: Indy Cars 1941 through 1965. After World War II, the Novi was used again in 1946 in the Indianapolis 500, developed with 510 horsepower and fitted in a more advanced Kurtis Kraft front-wheel-drive chassis. It performed well in a car driven by Ralph Hepburn, who set the track record and led the field for 44 laps. Drivers such as Paul Russo and Duke Nalon later drove cars powered by the engine at notable speeds, but did not win. In 1949, Nalon's Novi was involved in a spectacular crash; his car hit the wall in turn three, rupturing the gasoline tank and creating a wall of fire most of the way through the turn. The engine's crowd-pleasing sound was caused by its gear-driven centrifugal supercharger, which turned at more than five (5.35) times the crankshaft speed, giving it a scream at full power.Gordon Eliot White, Offenhauser: The Legendary Racing Engine and the Men Who Built It, Echo Point Books & Media, reprint 2015 The engine's four camshafts and oversized-valve design also contributed to an exhaust noise much louder than other engines of its period, resulting in a deep-bass roar. The whole Novi package became legendary; it was known for being dangerously powerful, especially after racing veterans Hepburn and Chet Miller both died, in 1948 and 1953, respectively, driving the vehicles powered by Novi engines in practice. ==Rise to competitiveness== After years of haggling, Frank Kurtis finally convinced Novi owner Lew Welch to switch to a rear-drive chassis design that would be much more competitive than the increasingly obsolete front-drive chassis. Kurtis designed the new Novi, which featured a prominent tail fin and has been described as the most beautiful roadster ever seen at Indianapolis. In 1956, Paul Russo qualified in eighth position. The second Novi car, driven by Jimmy Davies, failed to qualify due to technical complications on the last day. During the race, Russo quickly gained an early lead in the new finned Novi. Russo led the Indianapolis 500 for the first 21 laps. At that point, a tire blew in the south-west corner, throwing Russo and the Novi into the wall and out of the race. In 1957, a new sponsor financed two Novi-powered cars, now re-branded as the Automobile Air Conditioner specials. Driven by Russo and Tony Bettenhausen, both cars qualified. Russo finished fourth, and Bettenhausen finished fifteenth. The cars returned in 1958, driven by Russo and driver Bill Cheesbourg. During practice, Juan Manuel Fangio, a Grand Prix world champion driver, drove the Novi while he was classified as a \\"rookie\\" at the Brickyard.http://forums.autosport.com/index.php?showtopic=89087Autosport Speculation coursed through the pits that the world's most famous driver would drive the legendary Novi in the race, but he did not. In a later interview, Fangio described his experience with the Novi and its owner, > Mr. Welch wanted me to test the Novi and I liked to do it; and I found that > I could not be in conditions to drive any other new car (in spite of which > Mr. Welch offered him an important amount of money to qualify and race his > Novi). I did several laps at 135mph as an average, and I enjoyed them a lot, > especially when I noticed Paul Russo was also in the track at the same time, > with a similar car. Eyewitnesses to Fangio's Novi test noted that Fangio gained perceptibly on Russo, who could not pull away from the \\"rookie\\" driver on his first outing in a car that was deemed difficult to drive. Fangio described his shakedown cruise in the Novi, > I went out to the track only once with the Novi. I did about 10 laps and I > was glad to find that the other driver of the team (Russo) could not pass > me, nor even close the gap. The Novi was the only V8 engine in Indianapolis > by then. It had a mechanical turbine and the power came suddenly at high > revs, so being a difficult car to stop, like all the ones that used > compressors. Even if the BRM had a 16-cylinders engine, the Novi reminded me > of that one for sure. The high power at high revs was hard on the tires, and > it was very difficult to drive at Indianapolis because we had to accelerate > while turning. Following what he described as frustrations with the other car he had been offered (an Offenhauser-powered roadster) and the bureaucratic complications arising from sponsors and team contracts that prevented him from driving the Novi, Fangio left Indianapolis to drive in the French Grand Prix instead. Welch's failure to land Fangio as his driver meant the Novi lost what could have been its best chance for an outright win at Indianapolis that year. In the 500, Cheesbourg finished tenth overall and Russo finished eighteenth. In 1959 and 1960, two Novis were entered but their drivers failed to qualify. Russo and Dempsey Wilson were the drivers.Fox, Jack C., The Indianapolis 500, Cleveland: World Publishing, 1967, p.. ==Later years== Colorful car owner Andy Granatelli purchased the rights to the Novi before the 1961 racing season. Granatelli's team put the Novi's distinctive shriek back into action from 1961 to 1965, developing a four-wheel-drive version in 1964 in an attempt to effectively harness the extreme power of the notorious engine. Its notable drivers during this period were Jim Hurtubise, Art Malone, and Bobby Unser. The Novi engine was last used at Indy in 1966. Despite never powering a Championship Car race winner, few engines have become as famous in automobile racing as the Novi. The final STP-version of the Novi V8 had a revised two- stage centrifugal supercharger and was 2,741.29 cc (167.28 cid) with bore and stroke of 81.28 x 66.04 mm (3.2 x 2.6 in). At about 140 in Hg (~54 psi), an immense power output of 837 bhp (624.2 kW) at 8,200 rpm was achieved. This is equal to 305 bhp/liter (5.0 bhp/cu.in) and a brake mean effective pressure (bmep) of 483 lb/sq.in. ==References Sources == Karl Ludvigsen, Novi V-8: Indy Cars 1941 through 1965, Iconographix, 2001.

Michael Fox erected a large addition to the chapel-school providing accommodation for 400 pupils. Under the inspiration and guidance of the Rev. John Scannell, it was realised in 1904 that a modern school was needed to cope with the increasing roll. The foundation stone was laid on 7 October 1906 by Archbishop Maguire and the three storey, red sandstone building was formally dedicated and opened on Sunday 27 January 1907. By 1916 numbers had rapidly increased and once again classrooms in the old school had to be used. In May 1923 the school roll reached 1,819. Mossend Primary School Mossend Primary School in Calder Road was opened in the later part of 1880 as a single-storey building. In 1923 it was seriously damaged by underground mineral workings. In February 1924, a decision was made to demolish the building and build a new school on the same site in brick and roughcast with a stone base. During the rebuild, the pupils were taught on a part-time basis in the canteen of the former projectile works at Mossend Cross. In May 1926 the school was practically ready for occupation and was formally opened by HM Inspector William Robb. == Holy Family Roman Catholic Church == Holy Family R.C Church, Mossend One of the most striking buildings in Mossend is the church of the Holy Family, which was designed by architects Pugin and Pugin of Wesminister. It was built in 1884 to replace the smaller earlier Catholic church which remains standing beside it. The original Pugin designs envisaged a 124 ft high spire, which was never completed. The first church building - a chapel school - was completed in 1868 and could seat up to 500 parishioners, a chapel-house was soon added in 1872 and a large addition to the chapel-school in 1883. These buildings are still standing and form what is now the Parochial Hall. In 1883 work began on the erection of a new church which was formally opened on 16 November 1884. The church was at the time described in the Scottish Catholic Directory as \\"A very beautiful church designed by Messrs Pugin and Pugin, Westminster ... one of the neatest, most chaste and elegant in this part of the country... accommodating upwards of 800 worshipers.\\"http://www.holyfamilymossend.co.uk Holy Family Parish Website ==Namesake in West Lothian== In the 19th and early 20th century there was another Mossend located in West Lothian around east of the Lanarkshire settlement; this was a village just north of West Calder, associated with the shale oil industry and cleared when that declined. ==See also== *Mossend and Holytown (ward) == References == *Mossend Magic (dead link) ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Mossend Primary School *SCRAN image of Mossend Engineering Works, Mossend, Lanarkshire Category:Towns in North Lanarkshire Category:Transport in North Lanarkshire Category:Rail transport in Scotland Category:Rail yards in the United Kingdom Category:Bellshill ","title":"Mossend"},{"id":"6216423","text":"Laboulaye is a city in the southeast of the province of Córdoba, Argentina.

He is a multiple-time former world champion in three weight classes, having held the WBO flyweight title from 2001 to 2002, the WBO junior bantamweight title twice between 2002 and 2008, and the unified WBC and WBO bantamweight titles from 2010 to 2011. ==Early life== Fernando Montiel is the youngest child of Manuel Montiel Sr., a former professional boxer and Fernando's current trainer. Fernando has four brothers that are former professional boxers: Eduardo Montiel, Alejandro Felix Montiel, Pedro Montiel and Manuel Montiel Jr. Fernando learned the sport of boxing in his father's gym located in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico alongside fellow boxer, Jorge \\"Travieso\\" Arce. Regarding his nickname, Fernando has explained that one of his father's sister could not pronounce his father's name, Manuel de Jesus, when she was of younger age, so she called her brother \\"Cochul.\\" The nickname was later on passed to Fernando in diminutive form, since \\"Cochulito\\" roughly translates into \\"Little Cochul.\\" The nickname has no relation to a rooster, as many have argued. ==Professional careerEarly years at flyweight=== Montiel made his professional debut on December 6, 1996, at the age of 16. He accumulated a record of 20–0–1, which included a win over future champion Cruz Carbajal, before challenging WBO Flyweight Champion Isidro García. Montiel won the bout by seventh-round TKO to become champion at age 20. He defended the Flyweight title three times against Olympic medalist Zoltan Lunka, former champion Juan Domingo Córdoba and future champion Jose \\"Carita\\" Lopez. ===Super flyweight=== In his next bout, Montiel moved up to the super flyweight division and defeated WBO Champion Pedro Alcázar. He defended the super flyweight title against Roy Doliguez and also defeated former champion Ruben Sánchez León, but then lost the title to Mark Johnson by majority decision. Montiel won all three of his bouts in 2004 then regained the WBO title by knocking out champion Ivan Hernández, who had recently knocked out Johnson. Montiel defended his super flyweight title against Evert Briceno (21–2) and Pramuansak Posuwan (29–0–1). In his next bout, he moved up to the bantamweight division and challenged WBO Champion Jhonny Gonzalez, but lost the bout by split decision. Montiel returned to the super flyweight division and continued defending his title by defeating Z Gorres (26–1–1), Cecilio Santos (22–7–2), Luis Melendez (25–2–1), and former champion Martín Castillo (33–2–0). On May 31, 2008, in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, Montiel defeated Luis Maldonado by third-round technical knockout to successfully defend his WBO title for the eighth time. Montiel knocked Maldonado down in rounds one and three and the bout was stopped during Montiel's follow-up barrage. ===Bantamweight=== WBO champion In his next match, he moved up to the bantamweight division and defeated future champion Juan Alberto Rosas. On March 28, 2009, he defeated Diego Oscar Silva (24–1–3) by third round knock out to win the Interim WBO Bantamweight title. On April 25, Montiel became a three division champion after being elevated to full Bantamweight Champion.http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id;=19949 On September 12, 2009, Montiel faced fellow Mexican Alejandro Valdez (21–3–2) at the Palenque de la Feria in Tepic, Nayarit. The bout ended via technical draw at the 3rd round. On February 13, 2010, Montiel defeated Filipino prospect Ciso Morales (14–0) via KO at the 1st round, successfully defending his WBO Bantamweight title. Unified WBC and WBO champion On April 30, 2010, Montiel faced WBC Bantamweight Champion Hozumi Hasegawa in Tokyo, Japan. Montiel, who was a heavy underdog leading up to the bout, knocked out Hasegawa in the fourth round, putting an end to the Japanese fighter's 5-year title reign. With the win, Montiel unified the WBC and WBO Bantamweight titles. On October 30, 2010, Montiel successfully defended his titles against Rafael Concepción. Montiel dropped Concepcion to the canvas twice in the second round before knocking him out in the third round. Losing the titles to Donaire On October 4, 2010, promoter Bob Arum announced that Fernando Montiel and Nonito Donaire are on course for a February 19, 2011 bout. Before his bout with Donaire, Fernando had a 10-round non-title bout against fellow Mexican Jovanny Soto, on December 10, 2010 in Saltillo, Coahuila. Montiel defeated Soto via KO in the second round. On February 19, 2011, the fight against Nonito Donaire took place at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada. Montiel suffered his first TKO loss in the second round. Further setbacks Montiel announced in the Mexican media that he would return to the ring in the super bantamweight division, as he had difficulties making the 118 pound bantamweight limit during his fight against Donaire. He rebounded with wins over future champion Nehomar Cermeno and Alvaro Perez, then faced Victor Terrazas for the vacant WBC Silver Super Bantamweight title, but was defeated by 12 round decision in what was considered an upset. After putting together an 8 fight winning streak, during which he moved up to the Featherweight division and secured a win over former champion Cristobal Cruz, he faced Lee Selby for the IBF World Featherweight Title but lost a 12 round decision. In his following fight, Montiel suffered a first round knockout loss to Jorge Lara. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes -

A Prairie Home Companion auteur Garrison Keillor conceived of Pop Vultures as a way to educate public radio listeners about the world of pop music. The half-hour show featured Sullivan chatting with a rotating cast of friends, musicians and critics about all genres and manifestations of pop, from glam and hip-hop to Christian rock. Independent producer Jay Allison and This American Life host Ira Glass were among the show's champions. Glass said of Sullivan, \\"She is at the Sarah Vowell, David Sedaris level, in the way that she's utterly suited to radio. That's really, really hard to find.\\"Janssen, Mike, \\"With Vultures, Keillor Hips His Peers to Pop,\\" Current.org. Originally published in Current, June 21, 2004 Allison said: \\"Kate Sullivan and the team at Pop Vultures certainly appeal to the fabled Younger Demographic, but we like them because they sound alive and knowledgeable and profoundly into what they're doing and they're funny. Those qualities seem good ones for public radio to take forward.\\"Jay Allison, The Transom Review Volume 4/Issue 4 Pop Vultures was in development for more than two years; a pilot season of 22 episodes aired on public radio stations nationally, including KUOW-FM in Seattle, KNOW-FM in the Twin Cities, and WXPN-FM in Philadelphia. Pop Vultures was distributed through PRX, the Public Radio Exchange, winning its 2004 Zeitfunk Award for Most Licensed Series. After the pilot season was completed, the show was cancelled due to limited station carriage. Its cancellation was viewed by many as a sign that public radio program directors were not ready for Pop Vultures' irreverent approach to public radio. Others critiqued its producers for pulling the plug too soon on a fledgling show. KUOW Program Director Jeff Hansen said the PRX episodes were presented to the public radio system as pilots, and questioned Prairie Home Productions' marketing strategy. \\"It makes it look like Prairie Home Productions doesn't know what they're doing. They're basing pulling the plug on assumptions.\\"Janssen, Mike, \\"Seen as misfits with pubradio audience, Pop Vultures grounded,\\" Current.org.

Shapiro and colleagues at the State University of New York at Buffalo. SNePS is simultaneously a logic-based, frame-based, and network-based KRRA system. It uses an assertional model of knowledge, in that a SNePS knowledge base (KB) consists of a set of assertions (propositions) about various entities. Its intended model is of an intensional domain of mental entities—the entities conceived of by some agent, and the propositions believed by it. The intensionality is primarily accomplished by the absence of a built-in equality operator, since any two syntactically different terms might have slightly different Fregean senses. SNePS has three styles of inference: formula-based, derived from its logic-based personality; slot-based, derived from its frame-based personality; and path-based, derived from its network-based personality. However, all three are integrated, operating together. SNePS may be used as a stand-alone KRR system. It has also been used, along with its integrated acting component, to implement the mind of intelligent agents (cognitive robots), in accord with the GLAIR agent architecture (a layered cognitive architecture). The SNePS Research Group often calls its agents Cassie. ==SNePS as a Logic-Based System== As a logic- based system, a SNePS KB consists of a set of terms, and functions and formulas over those terms. The set of logical connectives and quantifiers extends the usual set used by first-order logics, all taking one or more arbitrarily-sized sets of arguments. In accord with the intended use of SNePS to represent the mind of a natural-language-competent intelligent agent, propositions are first-class entities of the intended domain, so formulas are actually proposition-denoting functional terms. SNePSLOG, the input-output language of the logic-based face of SNePS, looks like a naive logic in that function symbols (including \\"predicates\\"), and formulas (actually proposition- denoting terms) may be the arguments of functions and may be quantified over. The underlying SNePS, however, is a first order logic, with the user's function symbols and formulas reified. Formula-based inference is implemented as a natural-deduction-style inference engine in which there are introduction and elimination rules for the connectives and quantifiers. SNePS formula-based inference is sound but not complete, as rules of inference that are less useful for natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning have not been implemented. A proposition-denoting term in a SNePS KB might or might not be \\"asserted\\", that is, treated as true in the KB. The SNePS logic is a paraconsistent version of relevance logic, so that a contradiction does not imply anything whatsoever. Nevertheless, SNeBR, the SNePS Belief Revision subsystem, will notice any explicit contradiction and engage the user in a dialogue to repair it. SNeBR is an Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS), and removes the assertion status of any proposition whose support has been removed. ==SNePS as a Frame-Based System== As a frame-based system, every SNePS functional term (including proposition-valued terms) is represented by a frame with slots and fillers. Each slot may be filled by an arbitrarily-sized set of other terms. However, cycles cannot be constructed. SNePSUL, the SNePS User Language is an input-output language for interacting with SNePS in its guise as a frame-based system. SNePSLOG may be used in any of three modes. In two modes, the caseframe (set of slots) associated with each functional term is determined by the system. In mode 3, the user declares what caseframe is to be used for each function symbol. In slot-based inference, any proposition- valued frame is considered to imply the frame with any of its slots filled by a subset of its fillers. In the current implementation, this is not always sound. ==SNePS as a Network-Based System== As a network-based system, SNePS is a propositional semantic network, thus the original meaning of \\"SNePS\\" as \\"The Semantic Network Processing System\\". This view is obtained by considering every individual constant and every functional term to be a node of the network, and every slot to be a directed labeled arc from the frame-node it is in to every node in its filler. In the intended interpretation, every node denotes a mental entity, some of which are propositions, and every proposition represented in the network is represented by the node that denotes it. Some nodes are variables of the SNePS logic, and they range over nodes, and only over nodes. Path-based inference rules may be defined, although they, themselves, are not represented in SNePS. A path-based inference rule specifies that some labeled arc r may be inferred as present from some node n to some other node m just in case a given path exists from n to m. There is an extensive recursive set of path constructors available. ==Components== *SNIP, the SNePS Inference Package, provides the rules of inference with which SNePS deduces new assertions from an existing KB. *SNeBR, the SNePS Belief Revision package, is a component of SNePS that detects when the KB contains contradictory beliefs. When a contradiction is detected, the user is encouraged to unassert one of the contradictory beliefs by unasserting some underlying hypotheses that led to the contradiction. As a result, all propositions that had been inferred from the hypotheses that have been unasserted are also unasserted. *SNeRE, the SNePS Rational Engine, provides an acting executive and a set of frames for building up complex acts and plans from a set of system-defined and user-defined primitive actions. System- defined frames allow for the specification of sequences of acts, conditional acts, and iteration over acts, as well as believing and disbelieving propositions. SNeRE policies connect acting to inference, specifying, for example, that a certain act is to be done when a certain proposition is believed (asserted). *SNaLPS, the SNePS Natural Language Processing System, consists of a Generalized Augmented Transition Network Grammar interpreter and an English morphological analyzer and synthesizer so that natural language understanding and generation may be provided for SNePS-based agents. ==Applications== SNePS has been used for a variety of KRR tasks, for natural language understanding and generation, for commonsense reasoning, and for cognitive robotics. It has been used in several KR courses around the world. ==Availability== SNePS is implemented as a platform-independent system in Common Lisp and is freely available. ==External links== *SNePS Research Group (SNeRG) homepage *Essential SNePS Readings *Complete SNeRG Bibliography *SNePS Downloads Page Category:Knowledge representation software Category:Cognitive architecture Category:Artificial intelligence Category:Common Lisp (programming language) software ","title":"SNePS"},{"id":"6216529","text":"Olympic Hockey 98, known in Japan as is an ice hockey game for the Nintendo 64 that was released in 1998. It is a re-release of Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, but this time not endorsed by Wayne Gretzky and featuring the license for the 1998 Winter Olympics that were celebrated in Nagano, Japan. It is also a video game developer debut of Treyarch Besides the box art, in-game titles, and some minor graphic changes (such as team logos and colors), every single aspect of the game is practically identical to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.

While the gameplay is very similar to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, there are minor differences. The first difference is that the rink is bigger than the rink in the previous game (since its Olympic size). Some reviewers felt this created a learning curve to players who played previous NHL games. The other difference is that the game lists the names of the players below said players. ==Reception== The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. IGN gave it a very rare 0 score nearly two months before its release date, stating in its concise review: \\"We'll post a new review when Midway releases a new game.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"Imagine Midway took the tired Gretzky engine, added Olympic uniforms, replaced trading with 'defections,' and released it without tweaking anything but the default ring size.

Until the eleventh century, there is no record of a Christian theologian challenging the belief in the Real Presence, that is, the physical, personal reality of Jesus in the Eucharistic elements (the bread and wine believed to become the body and blood of Jesus). The first known challenge comes from Berengarius of Tours. Drawing upon the writings of Ratramnus of the ninth century who considered Jesus spiritually present in the Eucharist, Berengarius denied that the historical Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary was present in the Eucharistic elements. His teaching on the subject became known throughout Europe by around 1047. His position was condemned subsequently by several regional councils including Rome (1050), Verecelli (1050) where for reasons unclear he was imprisoned briefly by the King, Tours (1055), Rome (1059), Poitiers (1075), and St. Maixeut (1076). While Berengarius had signed several vague retractions, it was when summoned to the Council in Rome by Pope Gregory VII in 1078 that he was given the historically famous credo to affirm publicly. As a result, Berengarius was condemned by the Council with the Pope's consent. This credo has been considered by theologians through the centuries as the first succinct doctrinal definition by the Church on the Eucharist. It is credited with crystallizing the ancient teachings of the Church on the Eucharist and ushering in the \\"Eucharistic Renaissance\\" of the High Middle Ages typified by a flourishing of various Eucharistic devotions. ==Text of the Credo== The text of Gregory VII's Credo was quoted in it entirety in Pope Paul VI's encyclical letter, Mysterium fidei, published on September 3, 1965. > \\"I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine placed > upon the altar are, by the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the > Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and life-giving flesh and > blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the consecration, there is > present the true body of Christ which was born of the Virgin and offered up > for the salvation of the world, hung on the cross and now sits at the right > hand of the Father, and that there is present the true blood of Christ which > flowed from his side.

It is found among Hindu and Jain communities. ==History== Thurston mentions that the origin of the title Ballal is explained by a proverb which goes when a Bunt becomes powerful he becomes a Ballal and that it reflects a claim of descent from the Hoysala Ballal kings.Thurston, Edgar; K. Rangachari (1909). Castes and Tribes of Southern India Volume 1.Pg. 145 Madras: Government Press The Hoysalas had matrimonial relations with the Alupa royal family of coastal Karnataka. In the Book Prachina Tulunadu (Ancient Tulu nadu), The writers N.S. Kille and N.A Sheenappa Heggade state that following the decline of Alupas, the coastal region of Karnataka came under the sway of powerful local Bunt- Jain feudal families who established feudatory states or chiefdoms. These Feudal lords and petty kings were generally referred to as Bunt Ballals and later owed allegiance to the Vijayanagara Empire. Due to Brahmanization some small kings in the southern regions of erstwhile South Canara and North Kerala sought to establish their high prestige and separate royal identity from the castes of their origin. The Samantha and Varma Ballal kings were therefore descendants of the Bunt-Nadava caste. Various Ballal families are frequently mentioned in Tulu folk songs called Pardana. The Folk epic of Koti and Chennayya for example describes a battle between three Bunt Ballal princes namely the Ballal of Padumale, the Ballal of Panja and the Ballal of Yenmoor. Following the chaos that followed the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, The Nayakas of Keladi took control of the area and seem to have subdued a confederacy of the various Ballal families that held sway in the coastal region of Karnataka. The Ballals of Guedumardady, Manipary, Doltady, Kulur, Panambur, Pedanar, Mudibidri, Yerumal, Kapu, Katpadi, Nidambur, Chittupadi, Belor, Konnara, Mudradi, Hebri, Hiretor, Tomboso, Anaji, Tagrette, Herar, Gololer, Agumbe, Muttur, Malor, Modicar, Adolly, Muloly and Vitla were said to have been subdued and they were forced to pay annual tributes. The title Ballal in its feminine form Ballalthi also appears to have been born by females. This was possible as the matrilineal culture of the Bunts allowed women to take family titles and enjoy ownership of land. An inscription from 1673 C.E states that one Sankara Devi Ballalthi possessed ownership of a land called Kambala gadde in Sullia. Some women bearing the title are known to have established ancient temples as well. Ammu Devi Ballalthi was associated with establishing the Dharmasthala Temple and the Ballalthi of Moodubelle is said to have established the Mahalingeshwara temple in Belle, Udupi ==Notable people== *Ramabai Peshwa, wife of Madhavrao I *Ashish Kumar Ballal, former Indian National Hockey Team Captain * Dr H.

Mysterium Fidei was issued just as the closing session of the Second Vatican Council was beginning. Written in a stern and troubled tone, its purpose was to counter certain theological movements which Pope Paul perceived were gaining ground in the Roman Catholic Church. Using terminology such as \\"pastoral concern\\" and \\"anxiety\\", the letter sends a direct and unequivocal message to the church regarding the Eucharist. The Pope clearly feared that these novel teachings were threatening the Eucharistic piety which had marked the Catholic Church since the earliest centuries. To emphasize the centrality of the Eucharist in the church, the Pope echoed the words of Ignatius of Antioch, referring to the Blessed Sacrament the \\"medicine of immortality\\". The Pope acknowledged that there were many \\"real\\" presences of Christ, but that in the Communion bread this presence is real and \\"substantial\\". The letter, however, received little attention as the world's interest was focused at the time on the final works of the council fathers, particularly Lumen gentium, issued in November of the same year at the conclusion of the Council. ==Issues causing \\"pastoral anxiety\\"== Paul VI felt very strongly that certain theological currents were threatening several Catholic doctrines and practices including: * Masses celebrated in private * Doctrine of transubstantiation * Eucharistic devotions ==False teachings condemned== Pope Paul VI in the opening of the letter declares the following teachings are impermissible: *\\"to emphasize what is called the 'communal' Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private\\" *\\"to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ's presence in this sacrament\\" *\\"to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning ... the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called \\"transignification\\" and transfinalization\\" *\\"to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.\\" \\"These and similar opinions do great harm to the faith and devotion to the Divine Eucharist.

A professional vendor in New Orleans. A lemonade stand is a business that is commonly owned and operated by a child or children, to sell lemonade. The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations on the concept exist across media. The term may also be used to refer to stands that sell similar beverages like iced tea. In the United States, unlicensed lemonade stands have gotten in trouble with rules about permits. The stand may be a folding table, while the archetypical version is custom-made out of plywood or cardboard boxes. A paper sign on front advertises the lemonade stand. == Educational benefits == Lemonade stands are often viewed as a way for children to experience business at a young age. The ideas of profit, economic freedom, and teamwork are often attributed to traits lemonade stands can instill. However, unlike a real business, they benefit from free labor and rent, and may have a lack of expenses. == Legality == In some areas, lemonade stands are usually in technical violation of several laws, including operation without a business license or permit, lack of adherence to health codes, and sometimes child labor laws.Police in Ga. shut down girls' lemonade stand.

He bought a pair of reverse-looking mirrored glasses and trained with a local doctor and on April 15, 1931, facing west, set out east. Wingo had little money and depended on the kindness of strangers and the selling of signed postcards for twenty-five cents to anyone who stopped and asked him what he was doing walking backwards (he would return 18 months later with $4 to his name). He was often stopped by police but carried copies of local newspaper articles describing his stunt. In New York City, he agreed to walk around the top ledge of a 12-story building in return for money, but he was robbed by a partner. Wingo eventually found the thief, beat him up, and ended up in jail but the judge let him go on learning of the circumstances. Wingo walked to Boston where he took working passage on a ship to Germany under a cruel chief steward who worked Wingo mercilessly. From there he walked through Germany south to Turkey where he was told by authorities that he had to leave the country for his own safety. A wealthy Italian paid for his return to Santa Monica, California where he then walked backwards to Abilene. He wore-out 13 pairs of shoes on the trip. Although Wingo often made local newspapers on his journey, his fame quickly faded. Years later, he documented his voyage in the book Around the World Backwards. It was published in 1966 with a small publisher that did not sell many copies, but re-released it in 1982 under a new publisher and cover.Wingo, Plennie L. Around the world backwards Eakin Press, 1982. In July 1976 at the age of 81, he walked across the width of California, selling postcards for a dollar. In preparation Wingo managed to \\"talk his way\\" onto the Johnny Carson Show (July 20, 1976) which paid him $342 for the appearance. A biography of Wingo was published in 2018 by Ben Montgomery, titled The Man Who Walked Backward: An American Dreamer's Search for Meaning in the Great Depression. He remains the Guinness record holder for \\"greatest extent of reverse pedestrianism\\". He died at home age 98 and is buried in Wichita Falls, Texas. ==See also== * List of pedestrian circumnavigators ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Pedestrian circumnavigators of the globe ","title":"Plennie L.

The place is near Kunjarugiri Durga temple. The importance of Pajaka kshetra is also narrated in a small biographical poem called \\"Sampradaya Paddhati\\", whose author is Sri Madhvacharya's direct disciple Sri Hrushikesha, the mula yati of Sri Palimaru Mata. Sri Vadiraja swamy of the Sode Mata in his \\"Tirtha prabandha\\" explains Pajaka Kshetra as a very holy place, because it was here Sri Mukyaprana was born as Sri Madhvacharya and hence it has to be visited all wise men. There is an impression of Sri Madhvacharya's feet near his house. Sri Vadiraja swamy later installed an idol of Sri Madhvacharya there, which is now a temple and where he is worshipped by devotees till date. Pajaka Village The temple of Sri Madhvacharya where there is an impression of his feet in Pajaka ==Places to see== There are many interesting places to see at Pajaka. Perhaps the most important of all is the ancestral home and birthplace of Sri Madhva. There are many archaeological evidences of the life and times of Sri Madhva at this place. This includes the spot where his Aksharabhyasa (Initiation Ceremony) was performed, a banyan tree supposed to have been planted by him, the place where Sri Madhva (by virtue of being an avatar of Vayu) lifted two huge stones and placed them on pots, and a pond where Sri Madhva is supposed to have brought the water from 4 nearby ponds (Dhanus Theertha, Gada Theertha, Bana Theertha and Parashu Theertha). There is also a Madhva Mandira very close to the house. Lot of religious activities happen here and it is also a Vidyapeeta where students learn Vedas and Sanskrit. The entire complex is managed by Sri Kaniyooru Matha, one of the eight mathas Sri Madhva established. The Kunjaragiri Durga temple is also a fascinating place to visit. The temple is located on top of a hill and the hill offers some breathtaking sceneries of Udupi. There is also a Parashurama temple nearby. ==External links== *Photos of Pajaka and brief description *Photos of Pajaka *Comprehensive information on Udupi * Pajaka Category:Villages in Udupi district ","title":"Pajaka"},{"id":"6216674","text":"Unquillo is a city in the province of Córdoba, Argentina.

Further 28 civilians were severely injured as well. It was a notable mass murder of civilians since the resumption of armed conflict between rebel forces and Sri Lankan armed forces since April 1995 as part of the Sri Lankan civil war. The then government arrested number of soldiers and home guards who allegedly carried out the massacre and a court case was started on 2004. On 27 July 2016 the court acquitted six former army Corporals who were accused over the massacre, after they were found not guilty. ==Background information== During the British colonial period, approximately 60% civil service jobs were held by the minority Sri Lankan Tamils. They constituted approximately 15% of the population prior to 1948. This was due to the availability of Western style education as provided by the Protestant American missionaries, Hindu revivalists and local Catholic mission in the Tamil dominant Jaffna peninsula. After gaining independence from Britain in 1948, Sinhalese politicians made the apparent over representation a political issue. They initiated measures aimed at correcting the over representation by establishing ethnic quotas for University entrants. These measures, and a series of riots and pogroms starting from 1958 that targeted Sri Lankan Tamils and the resultant mass murder, displacements and refugees, led to the formation of rebel groups advocating independence for Sri Lankan Tamils. After the 1983 Black July pogrom, full scale civil war erupted between the government and the rebel groups. During the course of the civil war there were number of massacres of civilians, war rapes, torture and enforced disappearances attributed to both the government and allied groups as well as the various rebel formations. ==The Massacre== It took place at Kumarapuram, Trincomalee district, on February 11, 1996. According to several survivors interviewed by Amnesty International, 24 civilians, including 13 women and seven children below the age of 12, were killed by soldiers from the 58th mile post and Dehiwatte army camps, accompanied by Home Guards from Dehiwatte. Home guards are local civilians drafted as para-military by the government of Sri Lanka. The killings were in apparent reprisal for the killings by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) of two soldiers near a location called the 58th mile post on February 11, 1996 about half an hour earlier. According to one witness, a group of soldiers, some of whom were drunk, gathered at Dehiwatte junction and then proceeded towards Kumarapuram, shouting \\"death to the Tamils\\". The villagers of Kumarapuram had taken refuge inside their houses. The soldiers broke open the shutters and aimed their guns at the people hiding inside. One woman recounted how she pleaded with them not to shoot but to no avail. In her house, seven people were killed, including a six-year-old child. ===Rapes and murder=== Among the victims was 17-year-old Arumaithurai Tharmaletchumi. She was dragged from a boutique in the village and taken to the milk collection centre where she was raped before being shot. Antony Joseph, a 14-year-old boy, who tried to stop the soldiers from dragging her away, was shot between his legs. There were reports of one more rape and murder as well. In total two girls were raped and murdered as part of the massacre. ==Government Investigation== The trial of the Kumarapuram massacre has been pending at the Trincomalee High Court. All the accused have been released on bail while one of the accused soldiers died. All material evidence, including weapons allegedly used in the killing of Tamil civilians in the Kumarapuram massacre, were destroyed when the office of the Government Analyst in Colombo was gutted by fire in 2004., ==Notes== According to University Teachers for Human Rights (UTHR), there was another notable massacre in the same vicinity in 1985 and it is known as the Killiveddy massacre. Sometimes the Kumamarapuram massacre of 1996 is also referred to as Killiveddy massacre. ==References *UTHR Bulletin #10, details about the background and massacres in the region *AI report on Sri Lanka 1997 *Land grievances in the massacre area Category:1996 crimes in Sri Lanka Category:Attacks on civilians attributed to the Sri Lanka Army Category:Civilian massacres in Sri Lanka Category:Mass murder in 1996 Category:Mass murder of Sri Lankan Tamils Category:Sri Lankan government forces attacks in Eelam War III Category:Terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka in 1996 ","title":"Kumarapuram massacre"},{"id":"6216692","text":"Bone cements have been used very successfully to anchor artificial joints (hip joints, knee joints, shoulder and elbow joints) for more than half a century. Artificial joints (referred to as prostheses) are anchored with bone cement. The bone cement fills the free space between the prosthesis and the bone and plays the important role of an elastic zone. This is necessary because the human hip is acted on by approximately 10-12 times the body weight and therefore the bone cement must absorb the forces acting on the hips to ensure that the artificial implant remains in place over the long term. Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). PMMA was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in surgery. The excellent tissue compatibility of PMMA allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s. Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements - and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses. Hip and knee registers for artificial joint replacements such as those in Sweden and Norway clearly demonstrate the advantages of cemented-in anchorage. A similar register for endoprosthesis was introduced in Germany in 2010. ==Composition== Bone cements are provided as two-component materials. Bone cements consist of a powder (i.e., pre-polymerized PMMA and or PMMA or MMA co-polymer beads and or amorphous powder, radio-opacifier, initiator) and a liquid (MMA monomer, stabilizer, inhibitor). The two components are mixed and a free radical polymerization occurs of the monomer when the initiator is mixed with the accelerator. The bone cement viscosity changes over time from a runny liquid into a dough like state that can be safely applied and then finally hardens into solid hardened material. The set time can be tailored to help the physician safely apply the bone cement into the bone bed to either anchor metal or plastic prosthetic device to bone or used alone in the spine to treat osteoporotic compression fractures. During the exothermic free-radical polymerization process, the cement heats up. This polymerization heat reaches temperatures of around 82-86 °C in the body. This temperature is higher than the critical level for protein denaturation in the body. The cause of the low polymerization temperature in the body is the relatively thin cement coating, which should not exceed 5 mm, and the temperature dissipation via the large prosthesis surface and the flow of blood. The individual components of the bone cement are also known in the area of dental filler materials. Acrylate- based plastics are also used in these applications. While the individual components are not always perfectly safe as pharmaceutical additives and active substances per se, as bone cement the individual substances are either converted or fully enclosed in the cement matrix during the polymerization phase from the increase in viscosity to curing. From current knowledge, cured bone cement can now be classified as safe, as originally demonstrated during the early studies on compatibility with the body conducted in the 1950s. More recently bone cement has been use in the spine in either vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty procedures. The composition of these types of cement is mostly based on calcium phosphate and more recently magnesium phosphate. A novel biodegradable, non-exothermic, self-setting orthopedic cement composition based on amorphous magnesium phosphate (AMP) was developed. The occurrence of undesirable exothermic reactions was avoided through using AMP as the solid precursor Evaluation of amorphous magnesium phosphate (AMP) based non- exothermic orthopedic cements, Biomed. Mater. 11 (2016) 055010, https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-6041/11/5/055010. ==Important information for the use of bone cement== What is referred to as bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) is described in the literature.Br. J. Anaesth. (2009) 102 (1): 12-22. doi: 10.1093/bja/aen328 For a long time it was believed that the incompletely converted monomer released from bone cement was the cause of circulation reactions and embolism. However, it is now known that this monomer (residual monomer) is metabolized by the respiratory chain and split into carbon dioxide and water and excreted. Embolisms can always occur during anchorage of artificial joints when material is inserted into the previously cleared femoral canal. The result is intramedullary pressure increase, potentially driving fat into the circulation. If the patient is known to have any allergies to constituents of the bone cement, according to current knowledge bone cement should not be used to anchor the prosthesis. Anchorage without cement - cement-free implant placement - is the alternative. New bone cement formulations require characterization according to ASTM F451.ASTM F451: Standard Specification for Acrylic Bone Cement This standard describes the test methods to assess cure rate, residual monomer, mechanical strength, benzoyl peroxide concentration, and heat evolution during cure. ==Revisions== Revision is the replacement of a prosthesis. This means that a prosthesis previously implanted in the body is removed and replaced by a new prosthesis. Compared to the initial operation revisions are often more complex and more difficult, because every revision involves the loss of healthy bone substance. Revision operations are also more expensive for a satisfactory result. The most important goal is therefore to avoid revisions by using a good surgical procedure and using products with good (long-term) results. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to avoid revisions. There can also be different reasons for revisions and there is a distinction between septic or aseptic revision. If it is necessary to replace an implant without confirmation of an infection—for example, aseptic—the cement is not necessarily removed completely. However, if the implant has loosened for septic reasons, the cement must be fully removed to clear an infection. In the current state of knowledge it is easier to remove cement than to release a well-anchored cement-free prosthesis from the bone site. Ultimately it is important for the stability of the revised prosthesis to detect possible loosening of the initial implant early to be able to retain as much healthy bone as possible. A prosthesis fixed with bone cement offers very high primary stability combined with fast remobilization of patients. The cemented-in prosthesis can be fully loaded very soon after the operation because the PMMA gets most of its strength within 24 hours. The necessary rehabilitation is comparatively simple for patients who have had a cemented-in prosthesis implanted. The joints can be loaded again very soon after the operation, but the use of crutches is still required for a reasonable period for safety reasons. Bone cement has proven particularly useful because specific active substances, e.g. antibiotics, can be added to the powder component. The active substances are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much active substance is in the cement matrix but how much of the active substance is actually released locally. Too much active substance in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of active substance in the cement. The local active substance levels of industrially manufactured bone cements that are formed by the use of bone cements that contain active substances are approximate (assuming that there is no incompatibility) and are significantly below the clinical routine dosages for systemic single injections. ==See also== * Osteoplasty – use of bone cement to reduce pain ==References * Application note describing how to measure residual monomer in bone cement * A presentation on the rheology of bone cement Category:Orthopedic surgical procedures Category:Biomaterials Category:Adhesives Category:Medical treatments ","title":"Bone cement"},{"id":"6216693","text":"Dr. Richard Mitchell (April 26, 1929 - December 27, 2002) was a professor, first of English and later of classics,Sources are unclear on this subject.

Those listing English, which include the dust jackets of his first three books, all occur before 1985, while those listing classics, including the dust jacket of his final book, all occur in or after 1985, suggesting that his position changed during late 1984 or early 1985; however, no source provides clear details. In addition to his reputation as a masterful lecturer and extraordinary teacher, Mitchell was a prolific and well-known author. He first gained prominence as the writer, publisher, and printer of The Underground Grammarian, a newsletter that offered lively, witty, satiric, and often derisive essays on the misuse of the English language, particularly the misuse of written English on college campuses. He privately published the journal from 1977 to 1992. Although its circulation was limited, The Underground Grammarian was highly regarded, and, in addition to its academic audience, had a following outside academia that included George Will, Edwin Newman, and Johnny Carson, on whose The Tonight Show Mitchell appeared many times. Mitchell went on to publish four books: Less Than Words Can Say (1979), The Graves of Academe (1981), The Leaning Tower of Babel (1984), and The Gift of Fire (1987). Virtually all of his writings, including these books and The Underground Grammarian, are available online for free. Mitchell gave his permission that all of these works be made available on the Internet and be disseminated freely, without charge, especially to teachers for use in their classrooms. Mitchell's final book, The Psyche Papers, was left uncompleted. Mitchell published the four chapters he had completed in the final four issues of The Underground Grammarian (see below). Mitchell said in 2001 that he had \\"lost his faith.\\" Although he appreciated that his works would live beyond him, he could not help but note how little impact they had on changing education in America. John Simon said of Mitchell, \\"There exists in every age, in every society, a small, still choir of reason emanating from a few scattered thinkers ignored by the mainstream. Their collective voices, when duly discovered a century or so too late, reveal what was wrong with that society and age, and how it could have been corrected if only people had listened and acted accordingly. Richard Mitchell's is such a voice.\\"Mitchell 1987, as above. Simon's words are printed on the back of the dust jacket, along with praise from Thomas H. Middleton, Edwin Newman, and Clifton Fadiman. Mitchell retired in 1991, but continued to teach part-time until the fall of 2002. He died in his home of diabetes complications on December 27, 2002 at the age of 73, and was survived by his wife, Francis, daughters Amanda Merritt, Felicity Myers, Sonia Armstrong and Daphne Keller, as well as five grandchildren. ==The Underground Grammarian== In December 1976, the students, faculty, and administrators of Glassboro State College in New Jersey were greeted by a small, 4-page missive printed from hand-set type distributed on campus that proclaimed the following editorial policy: > The Underground Grammarian is an unauthorised journal devoted to the > protection of the Mother Tongue at Glassboro State College. Our language can > be written and even spoken correctly, even beautifully. We do not demand > beauty, but bad English cannot be excused or tolerated in a college. The > Underground Grammarian will expose and ridicule examples of jargon, faulty > syntax, redundancy, needless neologism, and any other kind of outrage > against English. Clear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought > is the most important benefit of education. We are neither peddlers nor > politicians that we should prosper by that use of language which carries the > least meaning. We cannot honorably accept the wages, confidence, or > licensure of the citizens who employ us as we darken counsel by words > without understanding. And so, to the whole college community, to students, > to teachers, and to administrators of every degree, The Underground > Grammarian gives WARNING! RAPE OF THE MOTHER TONGUE WILL BE PUNISHED! And so began the polemicist career of Richard Mitchell, launched with the January 1977 issue of The Underground Grammarian, wherein he exposed and ridiculed academics, educationists, school principals, and teachers who engaged in spreading mindlessness in the name of enlightenment. His maiden publication also asserted, under the heading \\"What Can We Do?\\", the following: > The Underground Grammarian does not advocate violence; it advocates > ridicule. Abusers of English are often pompous, and ridicule hurts them more > than violence. In every edition we will bring you practical advice for > ridiculing abusers of English. Regarding subscriptions, the editor stated rather tersely: > There are no subscriptions. We don't lack money, and we may attack you in > the next issue. No one is safe. We will print no letters to the editor. We > will give no space to opposing points of view. They are wrong. The > Underground Grammarian is at war and will give the enemy nothing but battle. By January 1979, The Underground Grammarian had garnered national attention and a circulation of 1800, with Mitchell receiving 12 to 15 letters per day from readers offering examples of bad writing, speaking, and teaching. Mitchell published The Underground Grammarian for 15 years. Mitchell eventually charged a modest annual subscription fee starting in September 1979: \\"U.S & Canada, $10; others, $14.\\" In February 1984 Mitchell raised subscription fees: \\"Persons in USA & Canada, $15US; Persons elsewhere, $20; Institutions, $25.\\" Institutional requests (i.e., libraries) seemed to have bothered Mitchell since before long he had replaced \\"Institution, $25\\" with \\"non-personal entities of any description, $25 or even more.\\" By the April 1990 issue, the subscription information included the subtle declaration, \\"No more libraries allowed!\\" After several years, Mitchell gave half-price discounts to retired teachers, stating that their \\"presence among our readers indicates that they must have been good teachers, and the same discount, or even more, applies to readers who happen to need it.\\" By then the request for back issues forced Mitchell to write, \\"We remind readers one and all that we approve when our readers make photocopies, however numerous. It just shows good judgment.\\" Mitchell always encouraged free distribution of his writings. In 1983 Mitchell pulled back from nine issues per year to eight. The amount of text had doubled by then. In 1990 he reduced the number of printed issues to five, and in 1991, the final year, he published only four, but these two years saw double-sized issues (16 half-pages). Mitchell started out using an ancient Gordon-Franklin press and within two years switched to a Chandler & Price press. By 1981, he had moved on to an elderly (circa 1935) cylinder letterpress, a Webendorfer \\"Little Giant.\\" In the March 1985 issue, Mitchell informed his readers that he had given up printing from hand-set type for a machine that could self-justify text on a line: the new Macintosh computer. Of hand-set type, Mitchell explained: > This method of composition is interesting and full of suspense, to be sure, > but it has certain disadvantages of which most writers have never even > dreamed....sometimes, when thirty or forty lines have been set, it becomes > obvious that the piece is just no good. That sort of catastrophe might mean > a delay of a week or more in what we don't even bother to call a \\"production > schedule.\\" Even one such false start, added to the fact that all the type > used to print the last edition has to be redistributed for the next edition, > can set us back for a month or more....We are a bit sentimental and sorry. > We'll miss the taste of lead. But the choice, although painful, was not > difficult. Our proper business is to get this thing out, and not to preserve > a fine and ancient craft. The first seven issues of The Underground Grammarian were published anonymously, simply referring to the author/editor as \\"The Grammarian.\\" The eighth issue announced that \\"R. Mitchell of our staff has been promoted to the post of Assistant Circulation Manager.\\" In the December 1986 issue, R. Mitchell was quietly promoted to Associate Circulation Manager, and then in the Spring 1991 issue, he was promoted to Full Circulation Manager, \\"with tenure,\\" the title he carried to the end. Mention was also made of \\"Central Control,\\" the real power behind the scenes. Central Control was Mitchell's title for his wife and apparently held the mailing list. Mitchell wrote in the March 1988 issue: \\"Every morning, the Associate Circulation Manager drives Central Control down to the post office. She sits there dearly hoping that you have not moved. She does not entirely approve of moving. And she has dark visions when your Grammarian comes back marked, Address Unknown, Not Even a Trace of You. She hopes that if you must move, a), that someone else is paying, and b), that you will send her your new address.\\" Mitchell did not announce to his readers that he was retiring The Underground Grammarian. The final newsletter was mailed early in 1992, still with subscription information, ten years before his death. Articles in the final issue included: \\"Running on Empty,\\" \\"Words, Words, Words,\\" and \\"Psyche in Darkness.\\" ==Books Less Than Words Can Say === In the summer of 1979, Little, Brown & Company published Richard Mitchell's first book, Less Than Words Can Say. Mitchell had originally submitted the title as The Worm in the Brain but his editors felt it too frightening and grisly. The book is a gloomy contemplation of the new illiteracy, its roots and consequences, and its prosperous practitioners. Clifton Fadiman called it \\"the wittiest, the most brilliant and probably the most penetrating discussion now available of our growing American illiteracy.\\" Josiah Mitchell Morse praised Mitchell for having \\"the courage to write well — an even rarer courage now that sloppy thought is equated with democratic virtue. His own prose illustrates the qualities and habits of mind our educationists don't want our children to develop: wit, clarity, precision, mastery of detail, intellectual self-respect, and contempt for charlatans.\\" What follows is a list of the chapters and pointed quotes from each: > Foreword \\"Words never fail. We hear them, we read them; they enter into the > mind and become part of us for as long as we shall live. Who speaks reason > to his fellow men bestows it upon them.

Mencken sound like a waffler.\\"Maddocks, as above. What follows is a list of the chapter titles and quotes from each chapter: > Foreword \\"Clear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the > most important benefit of education.\\" > Propositions Three and Seven \\"It was Jefferson's dream that civilization > could best perpetuate itself in which the citizens were 'educated,' whatever > he meant by that, and we do have some clue as to what he meant.\\" > Educated People \\"It is possible, of course, to keep educated people unfree > in a state of civilization, but it’s much easier to keep ignorant people > unfree in a state of civilization.

Middleton. In that Introduction, Middleton wrote: > I first met Richard Mitchell when he came from the East Coast out here to > Los Angeles to appear on the Johnny Carson show. We had had a bit of > correspondence, and I'd told him I'd like to meet him if he ever traveled to > the West. I planted myself at the bar of his hotel, the Sheraton Universal, > and he came in almost immediately.

THE UNDERGROUND GRAMMARIAN will have great appeal for > anyone who simply loves good writing, for the writing in these articles is > superb. Moreover, these pieces, articulate, intelligent, often wildly funny, > and frequently dazzling, spring from a splendid mind, tuned to just the > right pitch, and fired with an angry passion under the supernatural control > of Mitchell's muse. Before the publication of this book, Mitchell invited his readers to submit entries to the Amazing Blurb Contest. Three readers won, having their blurbs printed on the dustjacket of the book. ===The Gift of Fire=== > I suspect that those who have read some of my other works will be a little > surprised by this one. I am a little surprised by this one. Thus began the Introduction to Mitchell's final book, wherein he describes the turn he has taken from the \\"castigation of fools... an ancient and honorable task of writers\\" to writing a book \\"about how to live by a man who doesn't know how to live, but who has begun to learn that he doesn't know how.\\" Here are the chapter titles and selected quotes from this unusual book of philosophy: > 1\\\\. Who Is Socrates, Now That We Need Him? \\"Nevertheless, people do from > time to time come to know enough about Socrates to be drawn into his > company, and to agree, with rare exceptions, that it would indeed be a good > thing to imitate him.\\" > 2\\\\. The Square of the Hypotenuse \\"Who first called Reason sweet, I don't > know. I suspect that he was a man with very few responsibilities, no > children to rear, and no payroll to meet.\\" > 3\\\\. The Land of We All \\"It is an obvious but simple distinction — though > rarely made — that there are some things that we can do because we are > humanity, and some things that we can do because we are persons, and that > there is some radical and absolute difference between the two classes of > things. They do not overlap. A person can no more invade Normandy than an > army can play the violin.\\" > 4\\\\. The Right Little Thing \\"Although many of us seem to have misunderstood, > or even deliberately misconstrued, the nature of education for a very long > time, that nature is still recognized in some corner of almost every mind.\\" > 5\\\\. The Gift of Fire \\"So I imagined myself in conversation with Prometheus, > who had come back to find out what we mortals had managed to do with the > astounding powers that he had given to us alone of all creatures.\\" > 6\\\\. Children and Fish \\"If you should prefer to understand that children are > those human beings who have not yet found the grasp of their own minds, then > the task you have given yourself, that task of rearing a child wisely and > well, is suddenly transformed from indoctrination to education, in its > truest sense, and made not only possible but even likely — provided, to be > sure, one little prerequisite, which is that you are not a child, that you > have come into the grasp of your mind.\\" > 7\\\\. The Perils of Petronilla \\"Epictetus, who could neither read nor write, > supposed that education was an inner condition, easily — if temporarily — > reached, in nothing more than an afternoon of thoughtful discourse, but a > condition by virtue of which one could do everything that living requires, > and do it well.\\" > 8\\\\. Sad Stories of the Death of Kings \\"Any truthful literature will admit: > No, this is not life itself, it is only a serious sort of game, but it is > like life, and the mind that plays here is like yours, and this vision is > what you too can see, and consider, and find worthy, and by which you may > know yourself better.

Androcide refers to the systematic killing of men, boys, or males in general. ==Lexicology== Androcide is a coordinate term of femicide and a hyponym of gendercide. The etymological root of the hybrid word is derived from a combination of the Greek prefix andro meaning \\"man\\" or boy, with the Latin suffix cide, meaning killing. ==People== In the proactive scenario of human societies, androcide may be a deliberate goal, perhaps to degrade the offensive capabilities of an adversary. In a more passive scenario, androcide has been likened to misandry when society in general participate in or permit the effective passing of a death sentence on a significant proportion of men and boys, as a result of conscription for military service. An androcidal animosity towards males may be due to rivalry, a perception of a challenge to their dominance or a combination of the two. Some organizations that are critical of feminism as well as some publishers have argued that the targeting of men is a contemporary issue in war. Androcide has also been a feature of literature in ancient Greek mythology and in hypothetical situations wherein there is discord between the sexes. ==War== In general, military services will forcibly conscript boys and men to fight in wars, which when faced with men and boys on the opposing side will inevitably lead to androcide. During mass killings in and out of war, non-combatant men and boys make up a majority of the casualties in contrast to women.HSR (2005), \\"Assault on the vulnerable\\", in Citing Jones (2000), \\"Gendercide and genocide \\" p. 186. Gendercide Watch, an independent human rights group, documents multiple gendercides which were committed against males (both adults and children): The Anfal Campaign, (Iraqi Kurdistan), 1988 – Armenian Genocide (1915–17) – Rwanda, 1994. This practice frequently occurs because in war, soldiers believe that the men who are on the opposing side, fighting or otherwise, are their rivals and as a result, believe that their existence is a threat to their superiority. Alternatively, they are afraid that these men will attempt to fight back and kill them in self defense. Women and girls are treated differently due to gender roles and as a result, they are more likely to be sexually enslaved than killed. For the soldiers, women's roles in their society may influence how willing they are to treat enemy women the same way they treat men, but the widespread view of men as fighters still leads to Androcide in war. ==Plants== With regards to plants, androcide may refer to efforts to direct pollination through emasculating certain crops. ==Anfal Genocide== The Anfal Genocide was a genocide that killed between 50,000 to 182,000 Kurds and a couple thousand Assyrians at the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War. This act committed during the Anfal Campaign was led by Ali Hassan Al-Majid, under the orders of President Saddam Hussein. Anfal, which officially began in 1988, had eight stages in six geographical areas. Every stage followed the same patterns, steer civilians to points near the main road, where they were met by the jash forces and transported to temporary meeting points where they were then separated into three groups: teenage boys and men, women and children, and the elderly. The men and boys were never to be seen again. While women, children and the elderly were sent to camps, men were immediately stripped out of their clothes, only wearing a sharwal, and were executed.Lemarchand René, Choman Hardi. Forgotten Genocides: Oblivion, Denial, and Memory. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 These men have fallen victim of Iraq government barbarity. Many Kurd men and boys were killed in order to reduce the chance of ever fighting back. Men kill other men in order to stabilize their domains and ward off attacks.PAUL NATHANSON, and KATHERINE K.

Pollard is credited with being the man who killed the Frenchman who shot Nelson. In 1805, at the age of 18, Pollard was serving as a midshipman on HMS Victory, when she became entangled with the French ship Redoutable. Snipers from the Redoutable opened fire and wounded Nelson, who later died. During the battle, Pollard was stationed on the poop deck, where he was acting as a signaller, along with a quarter-master possibly called John King. At some point during the fight Pollard was joined by fellow midshipman Francis Edward Collingwood who had come up from the quarter-deck. Both men returned fire on the French ship and were supplied by the third man. At this point the story differs as to the exact turn of events. According to author Robert Southey both Pollard and Collingwood fired at the same time, killing a Frenchman, who had been identified by the quarter-master as having shot Nelson. The man fell into the mizzen-top and when they recovered him, he was found to have been shot in the head and chest.Southey, Robert, 1813. The Life of Horatio Lord Nelson , available as a Project Gutenberg eText (number 947) Pollard, in an 1863 letter to The Times, stated that Collingwood had left the poop deck prior to the death of the French sniper. Ship's surgeon Sir William Beatty, writing in a December 1805 edition of the Gibraltar Chronicle, stated that there were two men in the mizzen-top, one of whom was killed by a musket-ball and the other by Pollard. Pollard was later brought before Sir Thomas Hardy and congratulated as having been the man to avenge Nelson's death. Pollard was promoted to lieutenant in 1806 and continued to serve in the Royal Navy. He did not advance in rank beyond that and was later to join the Irish Coastguard. In 1852, at the age of 65, he obtained an officer's position at the Greenwich Hospital, where he stayed until his death at the age of 81 in 1868. He was buried with the rank of Commander but the grave was later moved and the exact site can't be pinpointed. Pollard was married in 1822 and had six children.

Paris, Imp. de David. 2 volumes (available in digital form Google books) contains the claim that it was he who shot Nelson. This claim is to this day believed and frequently repeated, although in October 1830 J.A. Lardier admitted in a letter to the editor of the Annales Maritimes that it was he who wrote the book, and that Guillemard is a fictitious character. ==References== *Beatty, William, 1807.

The transportation system is generally overseen by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, a cabinet- level agency of the state government. Additionally, regional governments such as the Metropolitan Council have authority over regional planning for the transportation system and local governments such as cities and counties oversee the local transportation network. ==Ground transportation== Minnesota State Highway 62 Almost all north–south through railroads and long-distance four-lane freeways in Minnesota have a connection to Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Most east–west through routes do also, except for a northern corridor from the North Dakota border to the port of Duluth/Superior comprising two BNSF rail routes and U.S. Route 2, and a corridor across southern Minnesota from South Dakota to the Mississippi River and Wisconsin including I-90, Minnesota State Highway 60, U.S. Route 14, and the DM&E; Railroad. ===Highway transportation=== Minnesota's major Interstate Highways are I-35, I-90, and I-94. I-535 is a spur route from Duluth to Superior, Wisconsin. In the Twin Cities I-35 splits into I-35W through Minneapolis and I-35E through St. Paul. I-94 has one spur, Interstate 394 from Minneapolis to the western suburbs, and two loop routes, Interstate 494 and Interstate 694, which form a beltway around the Twin Cities. The interstate highways are part of a class of routes known as interregional corridors, which also includes U.S. Routes 2, 8, 10, 14, 52, 53, 61, 63, 169, and 212 and Minnesota State Highways 23, 34, 36, 60, 210, and 371. Interregional corridors represent two percent of the state's highways but account for one-third of all vehicle miles traveled. Less heavily traveled regional corridors include U.S. Routes 12, 59, 71, and 75, and a number of state highways. The Minnesota Legislature identified many of the original trunk highways in the state in the state Constitution by constitutional amendment. A 1920 amendment laid out seventy routes connecting a number of cities. Today, these Constitutional Routes are made up of interstates, U.S. highways, and state highways. While these routes were identified by the legislature, many of the routes were vaguely described in law and effectively they cease to have major impact on the transportation system today. ===Bus services=== Transit buses An articulated bus in Minneapolis Regular route Bus transit systems exist in Rochester, Winona, Duluth, St. Cloud, East Grand Forks, Mankato (Mankato Transit System), Moorhead and the Minneapolis–St. Paul area. The last is served by the Metro Transit system, which has an extensive system with over 100 routes. Some portions of the Twin Cities region have opted out of service from Metro Transit and have created their own transit systems. SouthWest Transit and the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority are two major \\"opt out\\" transit providers that serve the southwestern and south-central portions of Scott, Dakota and Carver counties. Many rural areas and smaller towns also have rural bus service, though many of those are dial-a-ride services instead of using fixed routes. All but four Minnesota counties have some form of public transit service. Intercity bus lines Intercity bus service on a skeletal network of lines is provided by Jefferson Lines, Greyhound Lines, and Megabus. Jefferson Lines, which is based in Minneapolis, provides the largest number of intercity bus routes and serves the largest number of cities. The other providers focus on providing express service with limited numbers of stops. The number of intercity bus routes has declined significantly since the early 1990s, and several routes went away when Greyhound restructured in the mid-2000s decade. Greyhound was founded in Hibbing, Minnesota, but cutbacks have led that city to be cut out of the normal intercity bus route network. In addition to traditional intercity bus services, a network of independently operated long distance airport shuttles serving Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport has developed in recent years. Brainerd, Duluth, Mankato, Rochester, Saint Cloud, Eau Claire (WI), and La Crosse (WI) are all connected by daily scheduled shuttle service with the Minneapolis–Saint Paul airport. The shuttles provide transportation between area cities as well as serving airport passengers. ===Railroads=== Light rail A two-unit METRO Blue Line train approaches 46th Street station from the south. Decades before Metro Transit, the Twin City Rapid Transit Company operated streetcars in the Twin Cities area from the 1890s until 1954, when buses supplanted the streetcars. Light Rail in Minnesota currently consists of two lines, the Blue Line and Green Line, operated by Metro Transit. Completed in 2004, the Blue Line runs from the Mall of America, through the MSP airport via a tunnel, and along Hiawatha Avenue into downtown Minneapolis. The line has been very successful, receiving a 65% higher ridership than expected in its first year of service. The Green Line, which connects downtown Minneapolis to downtown St. Paul, opened to the public on June 14, 2014. In the future, other light rail lines may be built. The Southwest Corridor light rail (an extension of the Green Line) from downtown Minneapolis to the southwest metro, was approved by the FTA to begin preliminary engineering in September 2011. In 2006, a constitutional amendment was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40% dedicated to public transit. A few years later, a regional sales tax was implemented in several counties in the Twin Cities area. It supplies the Counties Transit Improvement Board with funds to help operate and expand the region's bus and rail transit network. Commuter and intercity rail The 82 mile (131 km) Northstar Corridor line, envisioned to connect Minneapolis with St. Cloud along the BNSF Railway, started service on the first to Big Lake in November 2009. The state is served by one intercity passenger rail line, Amtrak's Empire Builder, which stops daily in each direction at Winona, Red Wing, St. Paul, St. Cloud, Staples, and Detroit Lakes. The Northern Lights Express (NLX) is planned to restore service between Minneapolis and Duluth, which used to have train service until 1985. Other regional rail projects have been proposed including Zip Rail to Rochester, MN, Minnesota Valley Line to Mankato, the Spine Line between St. Paul and Albert Lea, and the Dan Patch Corridor between Minneapolis and Northfield. Freight rail Major freight railroads in Minnesota include BNSF Railway, Union Pacific Railroad, Canadian National Railway, and Canadian Pacific Railway and its Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad subsidiary. Principal ladings include coal from the Powder River Basin to ports and eastern power plants, grain and other agricultural products from farm to processors and ports, taconite (a form of iron ore) from the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota to Lake Superior ports or on all-rail routes to steel mills, timber and forest products, and intermodal traffic. Minnesota has had many more railroads and rail lines in the past, and reached a peak of over of rails around 1920. In 2007, there was almost exactly half as much track, . Most of the reduction occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. ===Bicycle trails=== Cedar Lake bike trail in Minneapolis A 2006 report stated that Minnesota had more miles of bike trails than any other state, and Metro Transit buses feature bike racks for combination commuters. A number of the bike trails are rail trails, utilizing the right-of-ways originally secured for railroads. ===Minneapolis MN Public Transportation Statistics=== The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 66 min. 19% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 14% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.3 km, while 20% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ==Water transportation== Stillwater Boats at Lock and Dam No. 2 on the Mississippi River near Hastings Much of Minnesota's early transportation followed the numerous rivers and lakes. Early European explorers and settlers followed the routes used by the voyageurs and coureurs des bois in the fur trading days, and later on steamboat services operated on the principal rivers. Commercial water transportation now is limited to the shipment of bulk commodities on two routes. Barges haul grain and other products down the Mississippi River system from the ports of Minneapolis (the head of navigation), St. Paul, Red Wing and Winona on the Mississippi, and Savage (on the Minnesota River), to downstream river ports, and to ports on the Gulf of Mexico for transshipment to ocean- going cargo ships. Cargo vessels known as lakers haul grain, coal, and iron ore from the Lake Superior ports of Duluth, Superior, Two Harbors, and Silver Bay, through Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes, while ocean-going ships referred to as salties operate from the Twin Ports through the St. Lawrence Seaway to the Atlantic Ocean. ==Air transportation== Minnesota’s principal airport is Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport (MSP), a major passenger and freight hub for Delta Air Lines. MSP is also a hub for Sun Country Airlines, and is served by most other domestic carriers. Large commercial jet service is also provided to and from Duluth International Airport and Rochester International Airport. Scheduled commuter service is available at Bemidji, Brainerd, Hibbing, International Falls, St. Cloud, and Thief River Falls. ==References== ","title":"Transportation in Minnesota"},{"id":"6216879","text":"St. Paul's High School is a private, co-educational school It was established in 1954. It is a missionary educational institution based in Hyderabad, India. It has classes from lower Kindergarten to 10th grade level. ==History== In 1954, All Saints High School, Hyderabad celebrated the completion of 100 years of education. Rev. Bro. John of God, the Rector of the school, decided to start a new school. A building was hired at King Koti Road, Hyderabad to accommodate the new St. Paul's High School, named after Bro. John of God's favourite saint. SPHS was lauded as the best school in the twin cities and one of the ten best schools in India according to a survey conducted by the Outlook magazine (2001 - 2002 & 2002 - 2003) consecutively.The school has also been ranked consistently among the ten best schools in India. The school was rated as the country's second best school for excellence in computer education by the Government of India and the award was received by Rev. Bro. Franky Noronha from the then president Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in an official ceremony. The school has alumni like V. V. S. Laxman, Arshad Ayub, Speaker of the Telangana Legislative Assembly, Suresh Reddy, Mithin Aachi,Dr. Mohd. Faheemuddin, Arvind Chenji, present Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana E.S.L. Narasimhan and Nandamuri Balakrishna. ==Admissions== Though the school is a Catholic Minority Institution, its admission is open to all students irrespective of caste, creed, religion or gender. For admission into Kindergarten, the school follows a joint admission policy together with Little Flower High School, Hyderabad and All Saints High School, Hyderabad, both of which are also run by the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. Every year in January, one of the three schools conducts the admissions procedure for Kindergarten. It involves an interview of student and parents. The number of students who apply for admission far exceeds the number of positions available and hence it is a very competitive process. Students are allowed to state their choice among the three schools but their choice is not guaranteed. A twenty-percent quota is generally reserved for economically backward students. ===Divisions=== The school has four academic divisions- Pre-primary, Primary, Middle and Senior. The pre-primary division has four sections each of lower and upper Kindergarten. The primary division has four sections each of Classes I to IV (Class IV is equivalent to the Fourth Grade as it is called in the USA, Canada and some other parts of the world. Note that the word \\"Class\\" is used instead of \\"Grade\\" and the year is written in Roman Numeral). The pre- primary and primary divisions are housed in one campus, commonly called the \\"Primary School\\". The Middle school has five sections each of Classes V to VI and the High School has five sections each of Classes VII to X. Both the Middle school and High School are housed in another building, commonly called the \\"High School Campus\\". The High School Campus and the Primary Campus are near one another on the same road. ===Exams=== The academic year starts mid- June and ends in early April and is divided into three quarters. Examinations are held at the end of every quarter and every month. At the end of Class X, the students take the State Government administered Secondary School Certificate Examination. == Houses == The school follows a house system. The student body is split into four houses with an aim to promote competition among the students. The houses are: * Bro. Montfort House (yellow) - named after St. Louis de Montfort, the Patron Saint of the school * Bro. Stanislaus House (blue) - named after Bro. Stanislaus who captained the school for 18 years * Saint Gabriel House (green)- named after the Messenger of God * John of God House (red) - named after Bro. John of God, the founder of the school ==Facilities== Infrastructure * Library – High School Campus * Library – Primary School Campus * Two auditoriums * Science Laboratories * Computer Laboratories * Auditorium * Dining hall (boys and girls) * Digital Library – High School Campus *Alphonso Hall Sports facilities * Basketball court * Table tennis rooms * Badminton courts (indoor) * Gymnasium * Cricket * Volleyball Clubs *Subject clubs *Ecology and Environmental club *HAM or Amateur radio *Interact club for social service *NCC *Dance *Music *Dramatics *Drawing *Robotics *Scouts and guides *English Language == Ceremonies and traditions == St. Paul's Feast Day * St. Paul's Feast Day is observed in a solemn ceremony on 29 June every year. The Principal leads a prayer service with a reading from the scriptures and a brief message for the staff remembering the life and message of St. Paul, the patron Saint of the school. Investiture ceremony * At the start of each academic year, the newly elected School Cabinet and Class leaders take the oath of office in a colourful Investiture ceremony. All students wear the colours of their houses and cheer as their newly elected leaders march past the dais. The Head Boy and the Head Girl make their maiden speech on this occasion. Teachers Day * 5 September of every year is celebrated as Teachers' Day all over India in the memory of former President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. In what is probably the most festive celebration of the year, students show their appreciation to their teachers. Sports and games are held for the teachers and prizes are given away. Every classroom has an individual celebration for about an hour before the whole school assembles to celebrate the event. The organization of the event in its entirety is taken up by the School Cabinet and the Class Leaders. :Teacher's Day is also marked as \\"Back to School Day\\" by the alumni of the school who make it a point to visit the school and greet their teachers. Retired teachers are also reunited on this occasion. Independence Day * Independence day is celebrated very grandly. There are inter-house cultural competitions and each house is given a topic to perform- usually related to the theme \\"India\\" and then the winners are declared. This is the day for the Cabinet to show off their abilities. Monfort Literary, Cultural and Sports competitions *The Monfort Literary and Cultural Festival (also known as the Mo-Li-Cul Fest) and the Monfort Sports Festivals are held alternate years. The competitions are held between all the Monfortian schools. Annual Day The most awaited event of the school, the annual day, is a very colourful and enthusiastic event. It is also called the prize night. The parents of the school head boy and head girl are invited as the guests of honour. The event starts with the prayer song by the school choir followed by a welcome dance. The head boy and head girl along with the other school cabinet present the annual report. Prizes in various fields are given to the students: *Academic Excellence: Toppers of class *General Proficiency: extraordinary participation in various competitions besides good performance in academics *Young Achievers: Students who won various competitions in various fields outside school and brought glory to school. *Best outgoing student: Excellent Participation in Inter-School Competitions *Best Science Student: Student of ninth standard who secured highest marks in science among all the sections is bestowed this award. *Best Student: A gold medal sponsored by Justice Subhashan Reddy is bestowed on the students (a boy and a girl) selected by the school Principal. == Principals == * Bro.

He was educated at Eton College and Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1824, and graduated B.A. in 1827. Murray spent several years travelling across Europe and America from 1835 and 1838, including several months with a Pawnee tribe in 1835. He described his experiences in his popular book Travels in North America (1839). There he fell in love with Elizabeth (Elise) Wadsworth, daughter of James Wadsworth who disapproved. He attempted to remain in the United States as Secretary of the British Legation, but failed to obtain the position. He returned to England, and wrote of his experiences in a novel, The Prairie-Bird (1844). On three occasions Murray stood as a Member of Parliament, but was unsuccessful each time. He obtained a position, from 1838 to 1844, as Master of the Household in the Court of the young Queen Victoria. He was removed in the Household reforms initiated by Albert, Prince Consort. ==Diplomatic career== Murray then became a diplomat in Naples. He was consul-general in Egypt from 1846 to 1853, on good terms with the Ottoman Viceroy, Mehmet Ali Pasha. While stationed there, he arranged the transport of Obaysch the hippopotamus to England in 1850. Obaysch was the first hippopotamus in England since prehistoric times, and the first in Europe since Roman times. For this later feat, and his clear affection for the beast at London Zoo, he was nicknamed \\"Hippopotamus Murray\\". He also pushed forward the construction of the railway to Alexandria. From 1853, Murray was for one year Minister Plenipotentiary to the Swiss Confederation. He was then appointed British ambassador to the Court of the Shah of Persia in 1854. The Shah, Nasser al-Din Shah, and Murray disliked each other immediately. Murray's heavy-handed attitude inflamed an existing dispute over Hashim Khan, one of the Shah's bodyguards and an officer in the Persian army, who took up a position as secretary in the British embassy against the wishes of the Shah and his prime minister. Hashim Khan's wife was the subject of widespread gossip relating to Murray and his predecessor as ambassador; she was also a sister of the Shah's principal wife, so the scandal was political dynamite. Hashim Khan's wife was taken into custody by her brother on 14 November 1855, to defend her honour. Murray took this as an insult to the British legation; after demanding her release, Murray broke off diplomatic relations on 20 November. Anglo-Persian relations were already strained as the young Shah sought to annex the city of Herat, a goal which had eluded the Qajar dynasty previously; and Britain for its part sought to deny such control, lest the city, considered the \\"Key to India,\\" fall under the influence of Persia's patron, Russia. Murray's departure marked a break in Anglo-Persian relations and thus contributed to the outbreak of the Anglo- Persian War of 1856/7. After the war, Murray remained ambassador until 1859. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1875. Elise Wadsworth by Thomas Sully ==Family== Elizabeth Wadsworth's father James Wadsworth died in 1844, and Murray married her on 12 December 1850 during a visit to Scotland. She died in childbirth in Cairo, Egypt on 8 December 1851, but their son Charles James Murray survived. Murray married a second time, on 1 November 1862, to the Honourable Edith Susan Esther FitzPatrick, daughter of John FitzPatrick, 1st Baron Castletown.

The population of this Civil Parish at the 2011 census was 292. It lies a few miles south of Ellesmere. ==Etymology== Hordley takes its name from the Hoord Family of whom Henry de Hoord (c.1170) is the first recorded member. \\"'In 1215, King John confirms to the Prior and Monks of Durham a gift which Henry de Hoord made to them.' It is thought that the name itself is of Scandinavian origin, there being a family name of Hord in Sweden. Furthermore, the arms of the Hoord family includes a raven, commonly associated with the Norse invaders of the time. ==History== The original medieval manor is thought to have occupied the site where today stands Hordley Manor, a much later building. Some stonework in the cellar of the current building is thought to date from the original building. Sir Roger Kynaston (c.1433 - 1495), founded the Kynaston of Hordley line. The Kynastons were lords of the manor for a time, and later Kynaston graves can be seen in Hordley Church. Within the parish boundaries is another small village - Bagley. To the south lies Baggy Moor, once a large area of peat bog, which was inclosed and drained in the late 18th century. Prior to that time Hordley would have been situated on the banks of a shallow mere, one of the largest in North Shropshire (1283 acres).Dodd, 'Salop. Agric.' 24–9, 54, 56, 128, 139–40; S.R.O. 671/1; Plymley, Agric. of Salop. 223 ==Agriculture== Hordley is set down to mainly arable crops, with some dairy farming. Towards the Lower Hordley end of the village is the factory of ABP, an abattoir which prepares, matures and packages beef. Towards the west, there are attractive views of many hills. The River Perry runs through it, joining the River Severn into Shrewsbury. It is generally a quiet, rural area. Within reach of this village are many easily accessible towns, including Ellesmere, Oswestry and Shrewsbury. On one day there is a post office set up in the village hall. It is usually taken that the village is split into two parts, Top and Lower Hordley. This is probably because of the long distance of road separating the two halves with nothing but field either side. Within the upper part there is St. Marys Church which is still in regular use, surrounding this is a small area of grave yards. There is also a farm and some small clusters of housing. Within Lower Hordley is a larger quantity of housing and farms, and the village hall. The Weston Lullingfields branch of the Ellesmere Canal passed around Top Hordley and through Lower Hordley until its closure in 1917. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Hordley == References  Category:Civil parishes in Shropshire Category:Villages in Shropshire ","title":"Hordley"},{"id":"6216917","text":"Exomvourgo () is a former municipality on the island of Tinos, in the Cyclades, Greece.

In 1961, Southwick became the professor of orthopaedic surgery, a position he held until his retirement. He is credited with much pioneering work in cervical spine surgery. He was an advocate of the now commonly used anterior cervical spine approach. A posterior cervical spine fixation technique also bears his name. He was also credited with an osteotomy (Southwick osteotomy) for the treatment of Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)or slipped upper femoral epithysis (SUFE) . He also has an angle measured on an SCFE named after him (Southwick angle). He has over 80 publications to his credit. He created a diverse atmosphere at the Yale Orthopaedics resident training program.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1977 to 1990 and was a former three-term mayor of the City of Waterloo. ==Background== Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and raised in Ontario, Epp studied political science and history and received his BA degree from Waterloo Lutheran University in 1961. He went on to receive a Master of Education degree from the University of Toronto in 1972. Epp worked as a teacher and guidance counsellor for fifteen years with the Waterloo County Board of Education and worked occasionally as a supply teacher after finishing his career in provincial politics. Along with teaching, Epp sold real estate starting in 1978 and maintained his realty licence through his 13 years at Queen's Park. During his absence from politics from 1990 to 2003, Epp returned to real estate and was an associate broker for ReMax Realty in Waterloo. Epp died February 25, 2013, at the age of 78. ==Political career== First Epp was successful in local politics, serving as an alderman in Waterloo from 1968 to 1974, and two terms as the city's mayor from 1975 to 1977. Epp ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1968 federal election as a Liberal candidate in the riding of Waterloo, finishing second to Max Saltsman of the NDP in a tight, three-way race. Starting in 1977, he was elected four times to the Ontario legislature, representing the constituency of Waterloo North, and winning each time by a healthy margin. Epp was re-elected in 1981, and again in 1985. The Liberals formed a minority government and Epp served as parliamentary assistant to the treasurer from 1985 to 1987. Epp was re-elected in 1987, defeating future Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Elizabeth Witmer. He served as chairman of the Liberal caucus from 1985 to 1987 and retired from the legislature in 1990. In 1996, he supported Dalton McGuinty's successful bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party.Windsor Star, December 2, 1996 Re-entering politics after a 13-year break, Epp was easily elected to a third term as mayor of Waterloo in November 2003, receiving double the number of votes cast for incumbent Lynne Woolstencroft. During his term, he helped oversee the continuing redevelopment of Waterloo Square, initiated by Mayor Joan McKinnon (1997–2000) and a multimillion-dollar library/YMCA project on University of Waterloo lands on the west side of the city. This 98 year land lease included lands which would favour multiple sports fields to serve primarily the youth of Waterloo. He ran for re-election in November 2006, but was defeated by political newcomer Brenda Halloran. ==References * Category:1934 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Mayors of Waterloo, Ontario Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:Politicians from Winnipeg ","title":"Herb Epp"},{"id":"6216925","text":"Peter Kingsley (born 1953) is the author of five books and numerous articles on ancient philosophy, including Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic, In the Dark Places of Wisdom, Reality, A Story Waiting to Pierce You: Mongolia, Tibet and the Destiny of the Western World, and Catafalque: Carl Jung and the End of Humanity. He has written extensively on the pre-Socratic philosophers Parmenides and Empedocles and the world they lived in. ==Biography== Peter Kingsley attended Highgate School, in north London, until 1971. He graduated with honours from the University of Lancaster in 1975, and went on to receive the degree of Master of Letters from the University of Cambridge after study at King's College; subsequently, he was awarded a PhD by the University of London. A former Fellow of the Warburg Institute in London, Kingsley has been made an honorary professor both at Simon Fraser University in Canada and at the University of New Mexico. He has lectured widely in North America. Kingsley has noted in public interviews that he is sometimes misunderstood as a scholar who gradually moved away from academic objectivity to a personal involvement with his subject matter. However, Kingsley himself has stated that he is, and always has been, a mystic, and that his spiritual experience stands in the background of his entire career, not just his most recent work.\\"Peter Kingsley and the Discomfort of Wisdom: An interview by Jeff Munnis,” Black Zinnias vol.1 (Winter 2003/Spring 2004) 20–26. ==Major themes== Kingsley's work argues that the writings of the presocratic philosophers Parmenides and Empedocles, usually seen as rational or scientific enterprises, were in fact expressions of a wider Greek mystical tradition that helped give rise to western philosophy and civilisation. This tradition, according to Kingsley, was a way of life leading to the direct experience of reality and the recognition of one's divinity. Yet, as Kingsley stresses, this was no \\"otherworldly\\" mysticism: its chief figures were also lawgivers, diplomats, physicians, and even military men. The texts produced by this tradition are seamless fabrics of what later thought would distinguish as the separate areas of mysticism, science, healing, and art.Kingsley, P. (1999). In the Dark Places of Wisdom. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Parmenides, most famous as the “father of western logic” and traditionally viewed as a rationalist, was a priest of Apollo and iatromantis (lit. healer- prophet).Kingsley, P. (1999). In the Dark Places of Wisdom. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Empedocles, who outlined an elaborate cosmology that introduced the enormously influential idea of the four elements into western philosophy and science, was a mystic and a magician.Kingsley, P. (1995). Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic. Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Kingsley reads the poems of Parmenides and Empedocles as esoteric, initiatory texts designed to lead the reader to a direct experience of the oneness of reality and the realisation of his or her own divinity. A significant implication of this reading is that western logic and science originally had a deeply spiritual purpose. Kingsley's reading of early Greek philosophy and, in particular, of Parmenides and Empedocles, is at odds with most of the established interpretations. However, Kingsley contends that later ancient philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus, among others, misinterpreted and distorted their predecessors; hence, conventional scholarship that uncritically accepts their misrepresentations of the presocratics is necessarily flawed. Kingsley's procedure is to read presocratic texts in historical and geographical context, giving particular attention to the Southern Italian and Sicilian backgrounds of Parmenides and Empedocles. Additionally, he reads the poems of Parmenides and Empedocles as esoteric and mystical texts, a hermeneutical perspective that, according to Kingsley, is both indicated by the textual and historical evidence and also provides the only way to solve many problems of interpretation and text criticism. In his more recent work, Kingsley argues that esoteric texts designed to record or induce mystical experiences can never be understood from an \\"outsider's perspective\\"; understanding must come from a reader's lived experience—or not at all. ==Parmenides and Empedocles== Parmenides. Empedocles in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy. Kingsley presents Parmenides and Empedocles as representatives of a mystical tradition that helped give rise to western philosophy and civilisation and that is still available to people today. Kingsley argues that this tradition is of profound importance and has something essential to offer, both inside the world of academic philosophy and beyond in the wider, contemporary West.Kingsley, P. (2010). A Story Waiting to Pierce You: Mongolia, Tibet and the Destiny of the Western World. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Though Parmenides and Empedocles are often viewed as philosophical antagonists, Kingsley argues that beneath the superficial or apparent differences, the two men are profoundly united by the common essence of this one tradition, a connection that finds expression in their intimately connected understandings of reality, the body and the senses, language, death, and divine consciousness. Parmenides and Empedocles are united by, among other things, a somewhat unorthodox mysticism with respect to the body and the senses. Empedocles' cosmology, both born out of and directed towards mystical experience, deeply influences the peculiarities of the spiritual path as he offered it. Empedocles described a cosmic cycle consisting of the uniting and separation of the four divine \\"roots,\\" or elements, of earth, aithêr or air, fire, and water. The divine power of Love (at times simply called Aphrodite), in Empedocles' cosmology, brought the elements together into one, while the divine power of Strife separated them out from each other. For Empedocles, then, there is nothing in the cosmos that is not divine. Thus, there is nothing to \\"leave behind\\" as one travels the spiritual path. His mysticism is not what one might anticipate—the ascetic strain of shutting out the senses or dissociation from the body. While many forms of mysticism reject and renounce the supposed crudity of matter and the senses for something higher or loftier, Empedocles does not, teaching instead the conscious use of the senses themselves as a path to recognising the divine in everything—including oneself.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Similarly, Kingsley argues that the imagery and wording of the proem, or introductory part, of Parmenides' poem record an initiate's descent to the underworld and indicate a mystical background connected to the ancient practice of healing and meditation known as incubation.Kingsley, P. (1999). In the Dark Places of Wisdom. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. More than just a medical technique, incubation was said to allow a human being to experience a fourth state of consciousness different from sleeping, dreaming, or ordinary waking: a state that Kingsley describes as \\"consciousness itself\\" and likens to the turiya or samadhi of the Indian yogic traditions.Kingsley, P. (1999). In the Dark Places of Wisdom. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Kingsley supports this reading of the proem with the archaeological evidence from the excavations of Parmenides' hometown of Velia, or Elea, in Southern Italy. This evidence, according to Kingsley, demonstrates that Parmenides was a practising priest of Apollo, and would therefore have used incubatory techniques as a matter of course for healing, prophecy, and meditation. As Kingsley notes, this physical evidence from Velia merely conforms to and confirms the incubatory context already suggested by the proem itself. In Kingsley's understanding of this mystical tradition, the descent to the underworld is deeply connected with the conscious experience of the body—it is, in reality, a conscious descent into the depths and darkness of the very sensation of the physical body. Thus, in contrast to mystical paths that hope to \\"transcend\\" the physical, embodied state, Parmenides and Empedocles both find the divine in and through the body and the senses. The deep sympathy between the teachings of Parmenides and Empedocles is also found in the central, logical part of Parmenides' poem, often referred to as \\"Fragment Eight\\" or \\"The Way of Truth.\\" As Kingsley notes, Parmenides' logic aims at demonstrating that reality is changeless, whole, unborn and immortal, and one—a description strikingly similar to the ways in which absolute reality is described in many mystical traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta, Zen, and Dzogchen. That this is no mere material or metaphysical monism is indicated by the initiatory motifs of the proem; the setting and hymnal language of Fragment Eight; the unnamed goddess as the speaker of these words; and the figure of the historical Parmenides as priest of Apollo. Kingsley reads Parmenides as saying that this \\"ultimate reality\\" is not on some supercelestial plane, but rather is very simply the reality of the world all around us. We live in an unborn and deathless world of oneness, wholeness, and changelessness—but we are unable to recognise it because mortal perception itself is dualistic. Thus, as in Empedocles, everything in Parmenides' cosmos is divine—and, importantly, the divine is not \\"somewhere else,\\" but rather, right here and now.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Language, too, plays a crucial role in the teachings of Parmenides and Empedocles, and there are deep affinities here as well. Parmenides' nameless goddess consistently mimics those mortal habits of duality responsible for our imperfect perception of reality in her elenchos, or spoken demonstration, caricaturing the \\"twin-headed\\" mortals to whom she is speaking, using divine logic to reveal unity. Thus, the \\"truth\\" of Fragment Eight is distinctly paradoxical and reflects the apparent duality and paradox of undivided reality. The goddess' cunning use of language, humour, and paradox to undermine what she calls \\"mortal opinion\\" and establish reality indicates the fundamental importance of the word in Parmenides' teaching. When Empedocles continues the line in his poetry, the same profound importance accorded to the word in Parmenides is very much in evidence. Empedocles tells his disciple that his words are actually living things with consciousness and will. His words are esoteric seeds that must be planted in the earth of the body and tended with good will, purity, and attention—since they possess the power, if treated properly, to germinate and grow into divine awareness. Empedocles' poetry contains what is needed for this organic process to take place.Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Parmenides and Empedocles are also united by a shared understanding of death and, in particular, its role in the mystical path. While all readings of Empedocles recognise that his cosmology involves the four roots of earth, air or aithêr, fire, and water, united by Love and separated by Strife, Kingsley differs radically from most readers of Empedocles, ancient and modern, with respect to the ordering and significance of the cycle. He argues that most readings of Empedocles are grossly incorrect and essentially backwards, noting that Empedocles begins each cycle with the elements in a state of separation, followed by a blending under the influence of Love, then finally a return to the original state of separation under Strife. This, however, is not some kind of cosmic pessimism, unless one misunderstands what Empedocles is really saying. According to Kingsley, if one follows Empedocles' words carefully, one sees that the elements, while separate, exist in a state of immortality and purity. When they are brought together by Love or Aphrodite they are essentially seduced into incarnate, mortal existence and mixture—and thus an existence foreign to their true natures of immortality and purity. Consequently, when they are separated again by Strife, this is not cause for lament: it is the liberation of the elements from the unnatural and forced condition brought about by Love and a return to immortality and purity. This reading of Empedocles is highly suggestive of similar Orphic and Pythagorean views of incarnation, divinisation, and death. Parmenides, in turn, travels to the depths of the underworld—the world of death—and meets a goddess whom Kingsley identifies as Persephone, the queen of the dead. It is only by making this journey that Parmenides is able to learn the truth about reality and mortal opinion and return to the world of the living with his prophetic message. Thus, both Empedocles and Parmenides, like other mystics, find wisdom, healing, and eternal life in what most people suppose to be the dark and grim reality of death. As Kingsley puts it, the essential requirement for travelling this spiritual path is that, \\"You have to die before you die.\\"Kingsley, P. (2003). Reality. Inverness, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing. Finally, both Parmenides and Empedocles stress the necessity of reaching divine stillness by embracing motion wholeheartedly. In Parmenides, the imperfect perception of reality as changing and moving ultimately gives way to a perception of its perfect stillness. In Empedocles, the eternal motion of the cosmic cycle gives way to motionlessness. However, for a human being actually to perceive the stillness of reality, a quality of supreme attentiveness, beyond anything mortals are capable of, must be cultivated. The Greeks, Parmenides and Empedocles included, called this divine attribute mêtis, a quality possessed by the gods and given by them, under special circumstances, to mortals who had earned their favour. The union of divine grace and conscious, human co-operation makes it possible for the divine quality of mêtis to be cultivated and eventually come into being—an outcome described by Kingsley as a \\"flowering of consciousness.” Kingsley continues to work to return the tradition of Parmenides and Empedocles to consciousness, inside the academic world and also beyond. Plato and Aristotle, who defined the parameters of western philosophy without being fully aware of or sympathetic to the esoteric context in which Empedocles and Parmenides spoke, continue to exert an enormous influence both over our understandings of Parmenides and Empedocles as well as our notions of what philosophy is. Kingsley aims to make the lost awareness of Parmenides and Empedocles, as well as the reality of their tradition, available again. ==Select bibliography== Books * Catafalque: Carl Jung and the End of Humanity (2 volumes, London: Catafalque Press, 2018) * A Story Waiting to Pierce You: Mongolia, Tibet and the Destiny of the Western World (Point Reyes, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing, 2010) * Reality (2nd ed., London: Catafalque Press, 2020) * In the Dark Places of Wisdom (Point Reyes, CA: Golden Sufi Center Publishing, 1999) * Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic.

The book fits specifically into the survival horror genre, which is marked by people doing whatever it takes to conquer their environment and stay alive. The novel was released on July 18, 2006 (). A film adaptation of the novel was released in the United States and Canada on April 4, 2008.The Ruins (2008) == Plot summary == Four American tourists — Eric, his girlfriend Stacy, her best friend and former roommate Amy, and Amy's boyfriend Jeff, a medical student — are vacationing in Mexico. They befriend a German tourist named Mathias, and a trio of Greeks who go by the Spanish nicknames Pablo, Juan, and Don Quixote. Jeff volunteers the group to accompany Mathias as he attempts to find his brother Heinrich, who went missing after having followed a girl he'd met to an archeological dig. As they leave the hotel, Pablo joins them, leaving a note and a map for Juan and Don Quixote. The six of them head down to the rural Yucatan in search of Heinrich. The driver of the pickup truck who takes them to the outskirts of Cabo tells Amy that the place to which they are going is \\"not good,\\" and offers to drive the group somewhere else. Amy does not quite get the message and leaves anyway. Near a Mayan village, they discover a disguised trail which leads to a large hill covered in vines and surrounded by bare earth. The group approach the hill, and are confronted by armed men from the village. Jeff attempts to communicate with them in Spanish, but they do not respond. After Amy steps on the vine-covered hill when attempting to take a picture of the entire group, the men force the group to stay on the vine-covered hill. At the top of the hill is an abandoned campsite with tents, and a makeshift windlass and rope leading down a mine shaft. Much of the camp is overgrown with the same vines that cover the hill. Believing they may be able to escape down the far side of the hill, Jeff and Mathias go down the other side to find more Mayans arriving and forming a perimeter around the hill, with bows and rifles ready to shoot them if they attempt to leave. They also discover Heinrich's body, killed by the Mayans and overgrown with vines. As they return to the camp, they realize the vines secrete an acidic sap, which burned their hands as they pulled the vines from Heinrich's body. Hearing the ring of a cell phone from the bottom of the shaft, they use the rope to lower Pablo down in an attempt to retrieve it. However, the acid from the vines has weakened the rope, which snaps, sending Pablo falling down the shaft. They lower Eric after him, and he jumps to the bottom when they realize the rope isn't long enough, injuring his leg in the process. As the group fashions makeshift rope from one of the tents, Eric discovers that Pablo's back is broken, paralyzing him from the waist down. The group fashions a makeshift spinal board, lowering it and Amy down into the mine shaft. Eric and Amy manage to get Pablo onto the board before the lamp goes out. The cell phone rings again, and Eric tries to find it, determining that the sound is coming from another shaft in the mine. While the group remains optimistic that Juan and Don Quixote will arrive, following Pablo's note, Jeff makes preparations to ration food and water. He also decides, before they go to sleep, that they should remain awake in shifts to watch over Pablo. As night falls, Jeff ventures back down the hill to find the Mayans are still there, but notices a gap that he may be able to slip through. As he moves closer to the base of the hill, he hears a flock of birds nearby which alert the Mayans to his position. The next morning, the group awaken to find that the vine has wrapped around Eric's injured leg and pushed itself into his wound, and that they have wrapped themselves around Pablo's legs. As they pull the vines off of Pablo, they discover that the vines have eaten his lower legs down to the bone. This causes Amy to vomit, and she and Stacy watch in terror as a vine emerges from the hill to drink the puddle of vomit. Jeff decides to put up signs around the base of the hill, warning the remaining Greeks to stay away and get help if they should arrive. As he makes his way around the hill, he finds the corpses of others who have died there. He also realizes that the vines only consume organic material, as the victims' passports, jewelry, and the Mayans' arrowheads and bullets are intact. Further, he finds that the Mayans are apparently afraid of the vines, having salted the earth around the hill to keep them at bay, and will kill them if they attempt to leave the hill to prevent the vines from spreading through the spores in the group's clothing. Returning to where he placed his first sign, he finds that it has been removed. Initially suspecting the Mayans, he discovers that the vines took it down, along with another warning sign left by a previous victim of the hill. Jeff returns to camp to share this new information with the others. He also decides that they should have someone wait at the bottom of the hill in case Juan and Don Quixote arrive. Meanwhile, Pablo's condition has severely worsened with the flesh being eaten away from his legs, and Jeff fears he will soon die of infection. While Amy keeps watch for the Greeks, the rest of the group vote - reluctantly - to amputate Pablo's legs. With their resources dwindling, Jeff decides to return to the mine shaft to find the cell phone, taking Amy with him. In the mine, he fashions a torch and they search for the phone, following the sound down the other shaft in the mine. Jeff realizes that there is no phone: the vines can imitate sounds they hear, and have been attempting to lure him and Amy into falling down another shaft to their deaths. As Amy is lifted out of the mine, the group hears the vines laughing. Meanwhile, Eric grows increasingly disturbed, believing that the vine is growing inside of him, though the others do not believe him. Later on, Eric, Amy, and Stacy get drunk on the tequila that Pablo brought along, eventually getting into a heated argument. They realize in horror that the vines can imitate voices, as well, repeating their criticisms of each other, Jeff, and Mathias. Pablo wakes up and asks for water, which Amy gives him, along with a grape from the group's rations. Jeff returns, infuriated that they drank alcohol with so little water between them, and that Eric has once again cut himself attempting to remove the vine from inside his body. After Jeff and Amy get into a heated argument, she leaves him alone as he watches over Pablo. Jeff hears her calling out to him and vomiting, but believes she is drunk and ignores her. The next morning they discover that Amy is dead, the vines having grown down her throat and forcing her to drown in her own vomit. The vines have again wrapped around Eric's leg, inserting themselves into the initial cuts on his leg, and the cut he made on his abdomen the day before. They place Amy's body in a sleeping bag, and Jeff suggests that they consider preserving her body in order to cannibalize her if the Greeks do not arrive before their food runs out. Stacy is appalled and talks him out of it, and they all agree to bury Amy. Later, they hear Amy calling for Jeff. When they open the sleeping bag, they realize the vines had been imitating her voice, and have already eaten her down to the bone. That night, while Jeff is on lookout for the Greeks, it begins to rain heavily, forcing the Mayans to take cover in the trees. He sees this as an opportunity to escape and get help, but is shot dead by the Mayans. As he dies, he feels the vines pull his body back toward the hill. During the storm, Stacy takes advantage of the rain to bathe herself while Mathias watches over Pablo and Eric rests in the tent. Later, the vines imitate the sounds of Stacy and Mathias having sex, which infuriates Eric, as Stacy has had numerous affairs in the past. Stacy insists that the vines are lying, and Mathias declines to respond. Mathias discovers that, during their argument, the vines have smothered Pablo to death, and left Jeff's hat on his skull. The vines taunt Mathias in Heinrich's voice - speaking in German - that Heinrich and Jeff are both dead. In the morning, Eric's fears about the vines growing inside him appear to be justified, as Mathias removes vines from his chest and leg. While Stacy and Mathias go to look for Jeff, Eric is alone with the knife, and begins his attempts to excise the vines on his own. The vines later taunt Stacy and Mathias that Eric is dead. They return to camp to find him alive, but heavily injured, having cut off his own ear and flayed much of his skin in an effort to remove the vine. Mathias attempts to take the knife from Eric, but is accidentally stabbed through the heart. The vines pull his body into them. Stacy realizes they have not done the same to Eric in order to torment her by watching him die. Eric begs her to kill him, as he is too weak to do so himself, and, after pleading with each other, she stabs him in the heart. Stacy, now alone, goes to the bottom of the path up the hill to wait for Juan and Don Quixote. The Mayans have determined that she is the last one left, and have begun breaking down their camps. When the Greeks do not arrive by nightfall, she calmly slits her wrists, hoping that her body will be a warning to them when they arrive. As she bleeds out, the vines pull her back into the underbrush. Three days later, the other two Greeks, with some Brazilian tourists in tow, find the trail. A little girl, who is acting as a sentinel, as the little boy on the bike was, runs back to the village, but the new tourists are already halfway up the hill, calling for Pablo, before the Mayans arrive. == Publication history == According to an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the book started as a trial run after a period when the novelist had concentrated on writing the screenplay for A Simple Plan. \\"It went in stops and starts,\\" Smith told journalist Regis Behe. \\"I would give up on it, thinking it wouldn't work...With The Ruins I really just started writing. I had a general sense of the story. I knew how I wanted it to end, but all the steps to get there... I just wrote it. I didn't plan it, and, obviously, that had major repercussions that carried through the story.\\" Smith added that he never traveled to Mexico, where the book is set; he merely read a few travel books and did some Internet research. ==Critical reception== Entertainment Weekly reviewer Gillian Flynn gave The Ruins an A−, calling it \\"Thomas Harris meets Poe in a decidedly timely story,\\" continuing, \\"Smith has tapped into our anxieties about global warming, lethal weather, supergerms—our collective fear that nature is finally fighting back—and given us a decidedly organic nightmare.\\" Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times, said, \\"As in his debut novel, A Simple Plan (Knopf, 1993), Mr. Smith is concerned with what happens to a group of ordinary people when they are suddenly placed in a decidedly extraordinary situation. In that earlier book, evil turns out to be something that lurks deep within his heroes' greedy hearts. In The Ruins, evil is something randomly stumbled upon in the jungle.\\" Kakutani was unimpressed, comparing the novel unfavorably with Little Shop of Horrors and saying, \\"The Ruins, however, isn't a comedy or a musical. It seems meant to be a straight-ahead thriller, with some bloody set pieces lifted from the horror genre thrown in for extra chills: you know, grisly, up-close shots of people having their legs chewed up or being choked to death by demonic forces. Whatever humor is produced by the story's Cruel Talking Plants appears to be entirely inadvertent.\\" In Salon, Laura Miller warned, \\"Don't start this book if you're especially weak of stomach or nerves, and above all don't pick it up if you're not willing to tolerate some deviation from the usual conventions of thrillers and horror stories. Not everything will be explained to you, and not everything will turn out in the tidy, reassuring ways to which we've all become accustomed. The Ruins is like all great genre fiction in its irresistible storytelling momentum, but in its lack of mercy, it's more like real life.\\" Reviewer Tony Buchsbaum found himself \\"blown away by the author's crisp, clearly-focused way with a scene. He paints each one like a great artist, yet also holds back, sharing only the bits and pieces of detail that you need to make the scene your own.\\" He adds, Stephen King made the comment in a column for Entertainment Weekly, writing, \\"The Book of the Summer: That would be The Ruins, by Scott Smith, last heard from in 1993 (A Simple Plan, later filmed by Sam Raimi from Smith's script). No quietly building, Ruth Rendell-style suspense here; Smith intends to scare the bejabbers out of you, and succeeds. There are no chapters and no cutaways—The Ruins is your basic long scream of horror. It does for Mexican vacations what Jaws did for New England beaches in 1975.\\" The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said that the novel \\"is, superficially, the perfect summertime beach read. Between the lines of The Ruins, however, is a dark, sometimes scathing, social commentary.\\" The reviewer added that it \\"has a strange duality in that it directly pays homage to Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, and indirectly to The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen. The story of four young Americans caught in a deadly situation on a trip to Mayan ruins in Mexico, it builds a tension that Serling excelled at, created from knowing that a situation is spinning out of control in ways beyond the characters' comprehension.\\" ==References== Category:2006 American novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:American horror novels Category:Novels set in Mexico ","title":"The Ruins (novel)"},{"id":"6216986","text":"Sir William Hillary, 1st Baronet (4 January 1771 - 5 January 1847) was a British militia officer, author and philanthropist, best known as the founder, in 1824, of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.. ==Life== Hillary's background was Quaker, from a Yorkshire family: he was the son of the merchant Richard Hillary and his wife, Hannah Wynne.For an account of his family background, see Journal of the Friends Historical Society vol. 60, No.3 pp. 157–179 \\"Quakers of Countersett and their legacy\\" by Christopher Booth He left Liverpool at age 26, and travelled to Italy.

Sinéad Agnew, 2004; online edn, May 2005 accessed 8 June 2007 While Hillary was in Naples, the Prince and Sir William Hamilton sent him on a mission to Malta. There Hillary saw the election (July 1797) of the last of the Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta, Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. On this trip he also sailed round Malta and Sicily in an open boat. Hillary then travelled north with the incognito Prince, heading for Berlin. After a period there, he left the Prince's employ and returned to London in the autumn of 1799. Back in England, Hillary married in 1800. He had departed from Quaker beliefs, and his wife was not a Quaker. He had been left property by John Scott, his father's business partner and nephew; and then inherited West Indian estates from his elder brother Richard, who died in 1803. He quickly dissipated a large fortune, and had to sell properties including the old Yorkshire home of Rigg House.\\"Quakers of Countersett and their legacy\\", p. 167 Hillary spent some £20,000, on creating the First Essex Legion of infantry and cavalry, recruited largely from the Dengie Hundred and present-day Maldon District areas in Essex, after the end in 1803 of the Peace of Amiens, and was given the title Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant. The force numbered 1,400. He was rewarded with a baronetcy in 1805. After experiencing financial troubles, Hillary settled at Fort Anne near Douglas, Isle of Man in 1808. ==Family== The Hillary twins, double portrait by J. T. Mitchell ===First marriage=== Hillary married heiress Frances Elizabeth Disney Fytche on 21 February 1800; she was the daughter of Lewis Disney Fytche (originally Lewis Disney) of Danbury Place, Essex, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of William Fytche. In the same year, their twins were born: a son Augustus William Hillary (d. 30 December 1855), and a daughter Elizabeth Mary. ===Circumstances of second marriage=== In 1813, Hillary married a local Manx woman, Emma Tobin, daughter of Patrick Tobin, or Amelia Toben of Kirk Braddan, his first wife having died, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which is however contradicted by other sources. Lady Hillary obtained a Scottish divorce from Sir William in 1812. Hillary's second marriage took place in Scotland, at Whithorn, then in Wigtonshire. ===After 1813=== Of the twin children: *Elizabeth Mary married Christopher Richard Preston, of Jericho House, Blackmore, Essex, in 1818. Their son hyphenated his last name, becoming Charles Ernest Richard Preston- Hillary. *Augustus William joined the 6th Dragoon Guards, and became 2nd Baronet on his father's death. In 1829 he married Susan Curwen Christian, the eldest daughter of John Christian of Ewanrigg or Unnerigg Hall, Cumberland. Elizabeth Mary in later life stayed with her mother. Augustus William spent time with his father; he was childless. According to Mary Hopkirk, writing in the Essex Review, Lady Hillary continued to live at Danbury Place until her father's death, in 1823; at which point she moved to Boulogne. She met Frances D'Arblay in Paris in 1817, while on a continental voyage with her children. From Boulogne she moved to Blackmore, where she had property from her marriage settlement from her uncle Thomas Fytche, and a married daughter. She died in 1828. Emma Tobin died in 1845. ==Lifeboat promoter== Hillary witnessed the wreck of HMS Racehorse, in 1822, only two months after he had been a participant in the rescue of HMS Vigilant. He drew up plans for a lifeboat service crewed by trained people, intended not only for the Isle of Man, but for all of the British coast. In February 1823 he published a pamphlet entitled An Appeal To The British Navy On The Humanity And Policy Of Forming A National Institution For The Preservation Of Lives And Property From Shipwreck. He proposed a national and voluntary organisation, and pointed out the potential of new techniques such as those introduced by William Congreve (rockets), Charles Cornwallis Dansey of the Royal Artillery (kites), Frederick Marryat (signal codes), and George William Manby (life-saving apparatus). 12 Austin Friars, where the first London office of the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was set up in 1824 Initially Hillary received little response from the Admiralty. He appealed to London philanthropists including Thomas Wilson (MP for the ) and George Hibbert of the West Indies merchants, and his plans were adopted. The National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded on 4 March 1824 at a second meeting in the London Tavern, Bishopsgate Street, London, with the king as Patron. Office premises were taken at 12 Austin Friars, in the City of London, and then moved in the same area. The first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas. ===St. George rescue and legacy=== At the age of 60, Hillary took part in the rescue, in 1830, of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas harbour. He commanded the lifeboat, was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. Following the heroic rescue, the Master of the St George, Lieut. John Tudor (RN), wrote to Sir William expressing the gratitude of himself and his crew.Manks Advertiser. Tuesday 23 November 1830 At a Meeting of the Committee of the Isle of Man District Association of the Royal National Institution, for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, held at the Courthouse, Douglas, 27 November 1830, presided over by the Chairman, High Bailiff James Quirk Esq, it was agreed unanimously that the following report be transmitted to the Secretary of the Royal National Institution:Manks Advetiser.

The structure, designed by architect John Welch, was completed in 1832 and still stands at the entrance to Douglas harbour; it was the subject of a poem by William Wordsworth.Complete Poetry of William Wordsworth; full-text poems of William Wordsworth, at everypoet.com ===Douglas Breakwater=== As well as the Tower of Refuge, Hillary was instrumental in recommendations for the construction of a Breakwater at Douglas, to afford the harbour greater shelter and to provide a haven to ships plying the Irish Sea.Manx Sun.

Douglas Head, Isle of Man ==Knight Hospitaller== Hillary belonged to the precursor in the United Kingdom of the Order of Saint John, created a Knight (K.J.J.) in 1838. This group has been described by Jonathan Riley-Smith as consisting of \\"romantics and fraudsters\\". It failed to obtain recognition from the Order of Malta (the \\"Sovereign Order\\" of which it was putatively a part, or langue), leading to a break in relations in 1858. A fresh start was made in 1871, and a Royal Charter for the new group was obtained in 1888. Hillary was one of the founders of the Order, and pressed for Sir Sidney Smith to be given a major post. After Smith died in 1840 he took on the roles himself. He became a Knight Grand Cross (G.C.J.J.) of the order, and at the time of his death held the position of Lieutenant Turcopolier. What Hillary envisaged was a Christian reoccupation of Palestine, led by the Order of Malta. The background was of a revolt in Syria against Ibrahim Pasha, and a British naval intervention under Charles Napier on behalf of the Ottoman Empire in 1840, leading to the occupation of Beirut and Acre. Illness confined Hillary to his home on the Isle of Man, and in 1841 he began to sell off his possession; but he kept up a correspondence on his ideas with Sir Richard Broun, 8th Baronet, secretary of the order. Hillary wrote on the project in the Morning Herald for 25 November 1841, as an \\"Address\\", published also as a pamphlet. Hopes were placed in a German translation of the pamphlet by Robert Lucas Pearsall of the Order, in Karlsruhe. When Frederick William IV of Prussia indicated that the concept of a sovereign state under the order was unacceptable, the idea had to be dropped, though a similar plan in Algeria was mooted in 1846. ==Death and burial== Tomb of Sir William Hillary, St George's Churchyard, Douglas, Isle of ManHillary died at Woodville, near Douglas, Isle of Man, on 5 January 1847.

In his lifetime, Hillary was awarded a Gold Medal by the Institution he had founded, in 1824. In 1825, he suggested his part in the wreck of the City of Glasgow (see List of shipwrecks in 1825) merited a further award; but was rebuffed. Further awards were made to him in 1828, for aid to the Fortrondoert, and in 1830. In 1938, the king, George VI, asked for a modification of the original RNLI medal by William Wyon, from 1824. The obverse from that time onwards had shown the head of the sovereign; but it was then replaced by Hillary's head, as founder, engraved by Allan G. Wyon. ==Works== *Appeal to the British nation, on the humanity and policy of forming a national institution, for the preservation of lives and property from shipwreck (1823) *Plan for the construction of a steam life boat: also for the extinguishment of fire at sea, &c.; (1825) *Suggestions for the improvement and embellishment of the metropolis (1825), proposing a metropolitan board for London *A Sketch of Ireland in 1824 (2nd edition 1825) *The National Importance of a Great Central Harbour for the Irish Sea, accessible at all times to the largest vessels proposed to be constructed at Douglas, Isle of Man (1826) * A Letter to the Trustees of the Academic Fund (1830) *Observations on the Proposed Changes in the Fiscal and Navigation Laws of the Isle of Man addressed to the Delegates from that Island to His Majesty's Government (1837) *The Naval Ascendancy of Britain (1838) *A Letter to the Shipping and Commercial Interests of Liverpool on Steam Life and Pilot Boats (1839) *Suggestions for the Christian Occupation of the Holy Land, as a Sovereign State, by the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (1840) *An Address to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, on the Christian Occupation of the Holy Land, as a Sovereign State under their Dominion (1841) *A Letter to the Right Honourable Lord John Russell, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department, on the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (1842) *A Report of Proceedings at a Public Meeting held at the Court House, Douglas (1842) *The National Importance of a Great Central Harbour of Refuge for the Irish Sea, proposed to be constructed at Douglas Bay, Isle of Man (4th edition 1842) ==Notes and referencesFurther reading== *R.

Winzer Professor of Cell Biology, Emeritus, at the Stanford University School of Medicine. His research over more than four decades has been centered on the interplay of light and life. In 2007 he received the National Medal of Science from President Bush at a ceremony at the White House for elucidating the biochemical basis of signal amplification in vision, pioneering the development of high density microarrays for genetic analysis, and authoring the standard undergraduate biochemistry textbook, Biochemistry. It is now in its eighth edition and also edited by Jeremy Berg, John L. Tymoczko and Gregory J. Gatto, Jr. Stryer received his B.S. degree from the University of Chicago in 1957 and his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School. He was a Helen Hay Whitney Research Fellow in the Department of Physics at Harvard and then at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, before joining the faculty of the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford in 1963. In 1969 he moved to Yale to become Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, and in 1976, he returned to Stanford to head a new Department of Structural Biology. ==Research profile== Stryer and coworkers pioneered the use of fluorescence spectroscopy, particularly Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), to monitor the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. In 1967, Stryer and Haugland showed that the efficiency of energy transfer depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor,Lakowicz, J.R., 2006. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Springer, 3rd ed., p. 449) as predicted by Förster's theory. They proposed that energy transfer can serve as a spectroscopic ruler to reveal proximity relationships in biological macromolecules. A second contribution was Stryer's discovery of the primary stage of amplification in visual excitation. Stryer, together with Fung and Hurley, showed that a single photoexcited rhodopsin molecule activates many molecules of transducin, which in turn activate many molecules of a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Stryer's laboratory has also contributed to our understanding of the role of calcium in visual recovery and adaptation. Stryer participated in developing light- directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical synthesis for the synthesis of peptides and polynucleotides.Fodor, S.P.A., Pirrung, M.C., Read, J.L., and Stryer, L., Array of oligonucleotides on a solid substrate. U.S. Patent No. 5,445,934.

He is a partner of the law firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf, which was founded by his parents in 1945. He looks for cases that are in the public interest. Notably, he represented the family of Amadou Diallo in a case that spurred reform of the New York City Police Department. ==Background== In 1971 Gair received his Bachelor of Arts from Long Island University. In 1980 he graduated cum laude with a J.D. from Thomas M. Cooley Law School, and received his Master of Laws from New York University School of Law in 1985. He was admitted in 1980 to practice in New York, U.S. District Court, and the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.Martindale-Hubbel practice profiles, Anthony H. Gair, Marhub NY 470338. ==Amadou Diallo case== Anthony Gair represented the mother of Amadou Diallo, who was shot 41 times by officers of the New York Police Department's Street Crimes Unit. The city of New York agreed to pay $3 million to the family of Amadou Diallo. This amount is the largest amount that has ever been paid by the city of New York in a wrongful-death action for the death of a single individual with no dependents.TRAGIC DIALLO KIN GET RECORD SETTLEMENT FROM CITY, The New York Post, January 7, [2004]Daniel Wise, New York Law Journal, New York City to Pay $3 Million to Settle Shooting Death Claim, January 7, 2004 ===Early problems with calculating a remuneration=== The financial calculation for remuneration of Diallo's death would be complicated: He had no wife nor any children; he was killed instantly (and thus ineligible for pain and suffering compensation); lastly, he was a street vendor earning $10,000 a year.Amy Waldman, Diallo's Family Present and Former Legal Teams at Odds, The New York Times, December 28, 1999, Section B, Page 3. But the city was eager to dispense with the high-profile case, which had inspired protests led by Al Sharpton. The NYPD and the city had come under heavy criticism for their handling of the investigation and their perceived insensitivity. Along with the rape of Abner Louima, the Amadou Diallo case came to symbolize a police department in need of reform. ===First legal team led by Barry Scheck=== Diallo's estate first hired Barry Scheck, Johnnie Cochran and Peter Neufeld to represent their interests; however, in 1999 both of Mr. Diallo's parents ordered them replaced. In their stead Kadiadou Diallo hired Gair. An issue arose between the new legal team, headed by Gair, and the Scheck team, which asserted $40,000 of legal fees. Gair agreed to reimburse those fees; however, in order to move forward with suit the Sheck's files needed to be transferred to Gair. The Gair team turned asked the court to order them moved, which the Scheck team felt a heavy-handed tactic. The real battle revolved around not the amount of the Scheck team's fees, but how they would be compensated. The manner of calculation would be the ultimate determiner of the amount. $40,000 was only a starting point upon which both parties agreed. A Scheck spokesperson felt, however, that they should be paid by a percentage of the judgment or settlement. But the Gair team felt the compensation should be paid on quantum meruit, meaning a percentage calculated by determining the percentage of work each firm put into winning the final sum. ===Gair firm takes lead of the case=== Judge Lee Holzman held that Gair's counsel would be lead, which would put him in a more lucrative position relative to the other firms. His firm received 62.5 percent of the lawyers' fees (typically equal to a third of the settlement, which remained uncertain).Id. ===Resolution for all parties=== The case eventually led to a federal investigation and the disbandment of the NYPD's Street Crimes Unit. On January 6, 2004, Diallo's family agreed to a $3 million settlement. Neither the NYPD nor the city admitted any wrongdoing, but they expressed with deep \\"regret what occurred and extend [our] sympathies to the Diallo family.\\"Alan Feuer, $3 Million Deal In Police Killing Of Diallo in '99, The New York Times, January 7, 2004; Section A, pg. 1. Mrs. Diallo originally sought $20 million in compensatory damages and $41 million in punitive damages. All parties reportedly agreed the settlement was just, including the officers, the city, the NYPD, and Diallo's estate. \\"What we lost cannot be replaced, but we agreed to join hands with the city and accept this closure,\\" said Kadiadou Diallo.Id. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: \\"It's just not a substitute for a human life.

Sales began in November 1970, when it was the flagship hardtop variant of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries's then-new Colt Galant sedan. The nameplate was revived in 1990 for the Mitsubishi GTO, although this name was only used in the Japanese domestic market. ==History== The Colt Galant GTO exterior was penned by Hiroaki Kamisago, who had previously been sent by Mitsubishi to study at the Art Center College of Design, then located in Los Angeles, California. The design incorporates a number of stylistic cues from contemporary American muscle cars such as the Mustang, Firebird and Cougar, including a long hood, raised cut- off ducktail rear, and rounded quad-headlamps and tail-lamps. The GTO was Mitsubishi's second production car to have full, roll down, side windows and a pillarless design and after the Toyota T40 series Corona of 1966 and Mitsubishi's own Galant Hardtop launched earlier in 1970; the GTO was the third such Japanese car. Mitsubishi Racing Development (AKA Colt Speed) intended for the Colt Galant GTO to compete in the prestigious JCCA Grand Prix circuit. However, the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 sounded the demise of GP racing, so the GTO race program was mothballed. Nevertheless, GTO's were successful in rallying, including the famous Japanese Alpine Rally. Initially, there were three Colt Galant GTO (A53C) models offered, all powered by the Saturn engine: the M1 (1600 cc SOHC, 4-speed single carb), the M2 (1600 cc SOHC, 4-speed, using twin Mikuni-built Solex carburetors for a total of 110 hp)(SAE).and the top-spec MR (1600 cc twin-carb, DOHC five-speed), a version only available in Japan. 1970 Galant GTO MR, the top of the line version In February 1972 Mitsubishi upgraded the power plants, replacing the lower powered versions with a somewhat larger (1.7 litre) version of the Saturn engine. These cars received the A55C chassis code, while the twin-cam MR continued to use the smaller but more powerful 4G32 engine until January 1973, when stricter emissions standards made it obsolete. The higher-end versions then received Mitsubishi's all new Astron engine, with either , along with a new A57C chassis code. The range now consisted of the SL (2000 cc single-carb, four- or five-speed manual or automatic transmission), GS-5 (2000 cc twin- carb, 5-speed manual) and GSR (2000 cc twin-carb, five-speed manual). The lowest priced 1700 SL model remained with the 1.7, with .Automobile Guide Book 1973/1974, p. 101 The lineup was also given a mild facelift to signal the changes, comprising a one-piece slats-type grille with a central dividing molding and three-piece tail lights. Additionally, the more sporting GSR had wider 185-section tires, flared guards and a black-painted rear panel between the lights. 1975 Galant GTO GS; this new grille arrived in 1975 There were some minor adjustments to safety equipment in October 1973, and the automatic transmissions were dropped in August 1974. This was followed by a second styling tweak in February 1975 when the car gained a honeycomb-style front grille, enough to be labelled the \\"New Galant GTO\\" in promotional material. Two-litre GTOs built after this date also gained the Astron 80 engine with Mitsubishi's Silent Shaft system, while the four-speed manual transmission was now only available with the smallest engine. In October 1975 the engines were updated with Mitsubishi's MCA emissions control system with an exhaust gas recirculation valve and a thermal reactor, all to pass the upcoming 1976 emissions standards. The four-speed transmission was discontinued entirely at this time, leaving only five-speed manuals. Power was now for the 1700 SL-5 and for the 2000 SL-5.Automobile Guide Book 1976/1977, p. 129 The GSR was briefly unavailable after the late 1975 change, but was revived with a cleaner MCA-80 engine in February 1976, with power now down to . Three months later the entire range received some minor exterior modifications, with the GSR receiving a new, large front air dam with a mirrored \\"GSR\\" script.Automobile Guide Book 1976/1977, p. 86 After a relatively long production run, the GTO was finally replaced by Galant Lambda/Sapporo in December 1976, although production continued into 1977. ==Export== Mitsubishi chose not to aggressively export the Colt Galant GTO. Besides the home market of Japan, few examples (all right hand drive) were sold abroad. Most were distributed to New Zealand, and smaller numbers ended up in various Asian countries, it was also exported to the United Kingdom and Ireland between Jan 1975 and late 1976. Retailing at almost £3,000 (£600 more than a Celica GT coupe) it failed make a UK market impact. At the time, Mitsubishi rarely used their own brand name abroad, so all were sold simply as the \\"Colt Galant GTO\\". Some are still imported from Japan to various countries for restoration via online auction. In Japan however, the few remaining good examples are starting to reach \\"collector\\" money status, recent examples at auction have commanded over ¥1,000,000, with MR variants reaching almost twice that amount. ==GTO name revived== After Colt Galant GTO production ceased in 1977, the name lay dormant for 13 years, but it retained sufficient cachet that Mitsubishi resurrected it for their flagship Mitsubishi GTO sports GT in 1990. However, in order to avoid offending automotive connoisseurs, who might have objected to the evocative nameplate from the highly regarded Ferrari 250 GTO (1962), and Pontiac GTO being used on a Japanese vehicle, it was sold as the Mitsubishi 3000GT in overseas markets. ==Link== Galant GTO NETWORK(Japan) ==References== Category:Coupés Galant GTO Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1970 ","title":"Mitsubishi Galant GTO"},{"id":"6217073","text":"Yuri Georgy Aleksandrovich Zhukov (; also Георгий Александрович Жуков; 1908-1991) was a prominent journalist and political figure in the Soviet Union.

But when his brother Kerin, youngest son of Evor the Clockmaker, commits an indiscretion with Adeliza, a neighbor's daughter, he is packed off on a hasty quest to uncover the secret of an advanced clock escapement for the family firm. A pragmatic, cautious sort, he preps for his journey with a crash course from his experienced brother in useful skills — swordsmanship and foreign tongues, of course, but also lying and burglary. He is hampered and sometimes aided by the sprite Belinka, commissioned by the calculating Adeliza to ensure Kerin's faithfulness. Kerin's goal takes him east across the Inner Sea, the Sea of Sikhon and the Eastern Ocean to the empire of Kuromon, where he is promised the secret in return for a magical fan lost centuries before. It has the property of making whatever it is waved at disappear without a trace. Along the way he must contend with a treacherous sea captain and his suspicious navigator, the duplicitous sorcerer Pwana, and the pirate crew of Malgo, who has a grudge against Kerin's family. A more pleasant complication is Nogiri, a princess of the island empire of Salimor, whom Kerin has liberated (much to the displeasure of Belinka) from the pirates. Kerin returns her to Salimor only to lose her to the nefarious designs of Pwana, and a dire fate from which she can only be preserved by a daring rescue on roller skates. Finally Kuromon is reached and negotiations are concluded satisfactorily, but only at the cost of an unexpected regime change. ==Setting== As with the rest of the parallel world in which Novaria is located, de Camp bases the countries visited on Medieval realms of our own world. Thus Kuromon combines elements of ancient Japan and China, while the eastern islands are reminiscent of both Japan and Southeast Asia. ==References== Category:American fantasy novels Category:1989 American novels Category:1989 fantasy novels Category:Novels by L.

Since the rucksack was the first component of the program to be issued to Marines, the rucksack is commonly referred to as simply the ILBE. The ILBE rucksack was designed to replace the long existing All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE) and newer Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) packs. ==Design== The ILBE was designed during the Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF) program by Arc'teryx, and later manufactured by Propper. The backpack is made from 725 Denier Cordura material (725 D), with the MARPAT camouflage pattern printed onto it. The pack is also covered with a wide grid of the Pouch Attachment Ladder System (PALS), for the attachment of smaller modular pouches. It includes a main pack, a detachable assault pack and a 100-ounce (3 litre) water reservoir as part of the hydration system. The ILBE can hold up to 120 pounds (54 kg) of weight, and has room for both 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds outside the main pack. Specialized bags and pouches for corpsmen and reconnaissance units are also available. The ILBE system includes 6 types of packs: *Main Pack (75L) *Recon Main Pack (90L) *Assault Pack (27L) *Corpsman Assault Pack (39L) *Recon Assault Pack (39L) *Recon Accessory Pouch (5L) *Hydration System (3L) These packs are paired with waterproofing bags in 56L, 65L, and 9L capacities. The assault packs, with their smaller volume and lower weight capacities, are intended for wear in combat, while the larger main packs are intended to carry everything needed by a unit on the march. A set of packs typically consists of a main pack, an assault pack, and a hydration system. These three items together cost more than $600 when the ILBE system was first fielded, making it the most expensive single soldier pack system used by the US armed forces. ==Criticism== Because the ILBE was fielded before the creation of the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV), the pack did not integrate well with the fighting system at the time (such as the Interceptor Body Armor), and excessive stress in conjunction with the wearing of body armor could cause discomfort and injury. ==Future== The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) announced that a replacement was forthcoming in 2009, with possible replacements, including two entries from Mystery Ranch, Granite Gear, and the United States Army improved variant of MOLLE. In the year 2011, the Corps had finished testing and evaluation, releasing a solicitation for prototypes under the designation Family of Improved Load Bearing Equipment (FILBE), outlining design requirements that are similar to the improved MOLLE system. ==See also== *Family of Improved Load Bearing Equipment *MOLLE *All- purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment *Modular Tactical Vest *Interceptor Body Armor *Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform ==References * Olive-drab.com: \\"ILBE Improved Load Bearing Equipment\\" article describing ILBE Category:Personal military carrying equipment Category:United States Marine Corps equipment ","title":"Improved Load Bearing Equipment"},{"id":"6217114","text":"Little Six Casino is owned and operated by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community in Prior Lake, Minnesota, southwest of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area.

He is the former Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 2008 to 2014, and former Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain from 2002 to 2008. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2006. He was appointed Archbishop of Valencia in August 2014, a move which removed him from the Congregation. ==Early life== Antonio Cañizares was born in Utiel, and studied at the minor and major seminaries in Valencia and at the Pontifical University of Salamanca, from where he obtained his doctorate in theology, specializing in catechesis. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop José García Lahiguera on 21 June 1970, and then served as assistant pastor and delegate for catechesis in the Archdiocese of Valencia. Following his transfer to the Archdiocese of Madrid, Cañizares taught catechetical theology at the University of Salamanca and fundamental theology at the Conciliar Seminary of Madrid. He later became the director and a professor of the Institute of Religious Science and Catechesis in Madrid, and sat on several commissions and secretariats of the Spanish Episcopal Conference as well. From 1985 to 1992, Cañizares served as director of the Secretariat of the Episcopal Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith. He also founded and was the first president of Asociación Española de Catequistas, and was Director of the review Teología y Catequesis. ==Episcopal career== On 6 March 1992, Cañizares was appointed as Bishop of Ávila by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 April from Archbishop Mario Tagliaferri, with Cardinals Ángel Suquía Goicoechea and Marcelo González Martín serving as co- consecrators, in the Cathedral of Ávila. Cañizares Llovera later became a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Roman Curia on 10 November 1996, and was named Archbishop of Granada on 10 December of that same year. In addition to his duties in Granada, he was Apostolic Administrator of Cartagena from January to October 1998, and was elected President of the Episcopal Commission of Education and Catechesis in 1999. Cañizares Llovera was promoted to Archbishop of Toledo, and thus Primate of Spain, on 24 October 2002 by Pope John Paul II. He was elected Vice-President of the Spanish Episcopal Conference as well. Pope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Priest of San Pancrazio in the consistory of 24 March 2006. The Spanish primate was awarded a doctorate honoris causa from the Catholic Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera on that same date. He will remain eligible to participate in papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty on 10 October 2025. ===Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments=== On 9 December 2008, Pope Benedict appointed him Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. On 4 March 2010, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses.Press Office of the Holy See He is also a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Congregation for Bishops as well as the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. On 5 March he was appointed a members of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday. Cañizares was elected to medalla nº 16 of the Real Academia de la Historia on 1 December 2006 and he took up his seat on 24 February 2008. Cañizares is sometimes known by his nickname of \\"Little Ratzinger,\\"Zenit. The \\"Little Ratzinger\\" on His Upcoming Duty 1 March 2006 referring to the similar beliefs and opinions between him and Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger, who himself is aware of and \\"very amused by this expression.\\" In 2013 it was reported that the Congregation is preparing a booklet to help priests celebrate the Mass properly and the faithful to participate better. Cardinal Canizares Llovera confirmed this at an address at the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See on \\"Catholic Liturgy since Vatican II: Continuity and Evolution.\\" \\"We are preparing it; it will help to celebrate well and to participate well. During his talk the cardinal reiterated the importance Vatican II gave to the liturgy, \\"whose renewal must be understood in continuity with the Tradition of the Church and not as a break or discontinuity.\\" A break either because of innovations that do not respect continuity or because of an immobility that freezes everything at Pius XII, he said. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. ===Archbishop of Valencia=== On 28 August 2014, Pope Francis appointed Cañizares Archbishop of Valencia and removed him from his role as Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the SacramentsPress Office of the Holy See He was installed on 4 October in a ceremony at the cathedral church. ==ViewsOn receiving Holy Communion=== In an interview in December 2008 Cañizares Llovera discussed the best way to receive the Eucharist: \\"What does it mean to receive communion in the mouth? What does it mean to kneel before the Most Holy Sacrament? What does it mean to kneel during the consecration at Mass? It means adoration, it means recognizing the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist; it means respect and an attitude of faith of a man who prostrates before God because he knows that everything comes from Him, and we feel speechless, dumbfounded, before the wondrousness, his goodness, and his mercy. That is why it is not the same to place the hand, and to receive communion in any fashion, than doing it in a respectful way; it is not the same to receive communion kneeling or standing up, because all these signs indicate a profound meaning.\\" In August 2010, he said that, due to the impact of earlier cultural impact and formation in children who learn at an earlier age, who are faced with mature issues earlier, and who are enormously influenced by modern morality, ethical systems, and the mass communications media, it might be preferable to start preparations for receiving the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist at an earlier age, which could also lead to lowering the age of reception for those sacraments (which is now about 7 or 8, the age of reason, where young children begin to be held responsible for their actions and belief systems). ===On Summorum Pontificum and Tridentine Mass=== In regard to the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, Cañizares Llovera said that \\"[The] intention of the Pope has not only been to satisfy the followers of Monsignor Lefevbre, nor to confine himself to respond to the just wishes of the faithful who feel attached...to the liturgical heritage represented by the Roman Rite, but also, and in a special way, to open the liturgical richness of the Church to all the faithful, thus making possible the discovery of the treasures of the liturgical patrimony of the Church to those who still do not know it... even if there were not a single 'traditionalist' whom to satisfy, this 'discovery' would have been enough to justify the provisions of the Pope.\\" ===Abortion and child abuse=== Speaking in the context of an abortion debate prompted by a Spanish government proposal, he said child abuse on the part of Catholic priests \\"cannot be compared with the millions of lives that have been destroyed by abortion. It has legally destroyed 40 million human lives.\\" == References  * *Catholic-Hierarchy *Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - - - - - Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Requena-Utiel Category:Spanish cardinals Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops of Toledo Category:Roman Catholic primates Category:Pontifical University of Salamanca alumni Category:Knights Grand Cross of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George Category:Members of the Congregation for Bishops Category:Members of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Category:Members of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments Category:Members of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples Category:Members of the Real Academia de la Historia Category:Cardinals created by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Archbishops of Granada ","title":"Antonio Cañizares Llovera"},{"id":"6217148","text":"Korthio () is a former municipality on the island of Andros, in the Cyclades, Greece.

Located at around 750 m above sea level, it is between 4 and 7 km wide and 18 km long. The bottom of the Chepino Valley is comparatively flat, although hills can also be met. The valley's fault structure is the reason for the frequent earthquakes in the area, as well as for the high number of mineral springs, numbering more than 80 and making the Chepino Valley an important tourist destination in the Rhodopes. Due to its geographic location, the valley has a considerably milder climate than that in other parts of Bulgaria. The slopes that surround the valley are covered with venerable coniferous forests, mainly of spruce. The second highest peak of the Rhodopes, Golyama Syutkya, is located nearby, and an important city in the valley is Velingrad. The valley takes its name from the medieval Bulgarian fortress of Tsepina, the capital of Despot Slav's domain in the 13th century, which was excavated near the village of Dorkovo.

It is most commonly identified by the vaguely skull-shaped pattern adorning the thorax, the characteristic from which its common and scientific names are derived. The species was first given its scientific name by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Death's-head hawk moths are large, ranging from 3.5 to 5 inches (80-120 mm) as adults. The upper wings are dark, creating a stark contrast between them and the lower wings, which range from a bright yellow to a light cream, yellow being the more common. A. atropos appears in popular media, including the films The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Dracula (1958). It is commonly found in the southern part of Europe and throughout much of Africa, from where it is considered to be a native species. Annually, A. atropus migrates to parts of Britain, most numerously to the British Isles, where it is less commonly seen than in its native place of residency. ==Appearance== Acherontia atropos is a large hawk moth with a wingspan of approximately 80–120 mm (about 3.5 to 5 inches), making it the largest moth in a number of the regions in which it resides. An adult A. atropos has the typical wing and body structure seen in the family Sphingidae. The upper set of wings are brown with hints of yellow, amber, charcoal and cream; the lower wings are yellow with two brown stripes fashioned in waves extending diagonally across the surface. At rest, the wings of the moth fold downwards, concealing the hindwings behind the forewings. The abdomen of A. atropos is robust and is covered in brown, feathery down. Yellow striping that highly resembles the colour patterns of a hornet extends part way across each abdominal segment. The intensity and distribution of colour can vary widely in individual specimens, with some individuals occasionally found expressing an indistinguishable \\"skull-like\\" pattern on the thorax. Sexual dimorphism Like in most Lepidoptera, female moths of this species tend to be larger than males, appearing bulkier and sporting larger, more robust abdomens. The abdomen of a male Acherotia atropos is less broad, with a pointed distal (lower) abdominal segment. In contrast, the females of the species have a distal abdominal segment that is rounded off at the tip. Antennae seen on a male are thinner and shorter than the antennae seen on a female. There are no pattern or colour changes related to the sex of an A. atropos. == Behaviour == This species displays a number of behaviours not normally seen in Lepidoptera. Unlike most moths, which generate noise by rubbing external body parts together, all three species within the genus Acherontia are capable of producing a \\"squeak\\" from the pharynx, a response triggered by external agitation. The moth sucks in air, causing an internal flap between the mouth and throat to vibrate at a rapid speed. The \\"squeak\\" described is produced upon the exhalation when the flap is open. Each cycle of inhalation and exhalation takes approximately one fifth of a second. It is unclear exactly why the moth emits this sound. One thought is that the squeak may be used to deter potential predators. Due to its unusual method of producing sound, the squeak created by Acherontia atropos is especially startling. Another hypothesis suggests that the squeak relates to the moth's honey bee hive raiding habits. The squeak produced from this moth mimics the piping noise produced from a honey bee hive's queen, a noise in which she utilizes to signal the worker bees to stop moving. Sound produced by an adult == Etymology == Acherontia atropos receives both its species and genus names from bodies relating to death or dark subjects. The species name atropos relates to death, and is named after the Greek goddess Atropos. Atropos was one of the three Moirai, goddesses of fate and destiny. According to Greek mythology, the three Moirai decide the fate of humans, making them a lesser symbol of death. The genus name Acherontia is in relation to Acheron, a river located in Epirus, Greece. In mythology, Acheron was thought to be a pathway that lead to Hades due to the large, dark gorges it flowed through. In Greek mythology, Acheron is a river in Hades, and the name itself occasionally refers directly to the underworld. ==Distribution== Acherontia atropos occurs throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, much of Africa down to the southern tip, and increasingly as far north as southern Great Britain due to recently mild British winters. It occurs as far east as India and western Saudi Arabia, and as far west as the Canary Islands and Azores. It invades western Eurasia frequently, although few individuals successfully overwinter.Pittaway, A. R. (1993). The Hawkmoths of the Western Palaearctic. Harley Books, London. ==Development== There are several generations of Acherontia atropos per year, with continuous broods in Africa. In the northern parts of its range the species overwinters in the pupal stage. Eggs are laid singly under old leaves of Solanaceae: potato especially, but also Physalis and other nightshades. However it also has been recorded on members of the Verbenaceae, e.g. Lantana, and on members of the families Cannabaceae, Oleaceae, Pedaliaceae and others. The larvae are stout with a posterior horn, as is typical of larvae of the Sphingidae. Most sphingid larvae however, have fairly smooth posterior horns, possibly with a simple curve, either upward or downward. In contrast, Acherontia species and certain relatives bear a posterior horn embossed with round projections about the thicker part. The horn itself bends downwards near the base, but curls upwards towards the tip. The newly hatched larva starts out light green with yellow stripes diagonally on the sides, but darken after feeding. In the second instar, it has thorn-like horns on the back. In the third instar, purple or blue edging develops on the yellow stripes and the tail horn turns from black to yellow. In the final instar, the thorns disappear and the larva may adopt one of three colour morphs: green, brown or yellow. Larvae do not move much, and will click their mandibles or even bite if threatened, though the bite is effectively harmless to human skin. The larva grows to about 120–130 mm, and pupates in an underground chamber. The pupa is smooth and glossy with the proboscis fused to the body, as in most Lepidoptera. ==Folklore== Detail of the Acherontia atropos skull In spite of the fact that Acherontia atropos is perfectly harmless except as a minor pest to crops and to beehives,Smit, Bernard (1964). Insects in South Africa: How to Control Them. Oxford University Press, Cape Town. the fancied skull pattern has burdened the moth with a negative reputation, such as associations with the supernatural and evil. There are numerous superstitions to the effect that the moth brings bad luck to the house into which it flies, and that death or misfortune may be expected to follow. More prosaically, in South Africa at least, uninformed people have claimed that the moth has a poisonous, often fatal, sting (possibly referring mainly to the proboscis, but sometimes to the horn on the posterior of the larva). It appeared in The Hireling Shepherd, in Bram Stoker's Dracula and in films such as Un Chien Andalou and the promotional marquee posters for The Silence of the Lambs. In the latter film, the moth is used as a calling card by the serial killer Buffalo Bill, and though the movie script refers to Acherontia styx, the moths that appear in the film are Acherontia atropos. This moth is referred to in The Mothman Prophecies. It also appears in the music video to Massive Attack's single, \\"Butterfly Caught\\". The death's-head moth is mentioned in Susan Hill's Gothic horror novel I'm the King of the Castle, as it is used to instill fear in one of the young protagonists. John Keats mentioned the moth as a symbol of death in his \\"Ode to Melancholy\\": \\"Make not your rosary of yew-berries, / Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be / Your mournful Psyche\\". In José Saramago's novel Death with Interruptions, Acherontia atropos appears on the American edition's cover, and is a topic that two characters mull over. ==References * \\"69.005 BF1973 Death's-head Hawk-moth Acherontia atropos (Linnaeus, 1758)\\".

This includes any break of the sacrum, hip bones (ischium, pubis, ilium), or tailbone. Symptoms include pain, particularly with movement. Complications may include internal bleeding, injury to the bladder, or vaginal trauma. Common causes include falls, motor vehicle collisions, a vehicle hitting a pedestrian, or a direct crush injury. In younger people significant trauma is typically required while in older people less significant trauma can result in a fracture. They are divided into two types: stable and unstable. Unstable fractures are further divided into anterior posterior compression, lateral compression, vertical shear, and combined mechanism fractures. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and examination with confirmation by X-rays or CT scan. If a person is fully awake and has no pain of the pelvis medical imaging is not needed. Emergency treatment generally follows advanced trauma life support. This begins with efforts to stop bleeding and replace fluids. Bleeding control may be achieved by using a pelvic binder or bed-sheet to support the pelvis. Other efforts may include angiographic embolization or preperitoneal packing. After stabilization, the pelvis may require surgical reconstruction. Pelvic fractures make up around 3% of adult fractures. Stable fractures generally have a good outcome. The risk of death with an unstable fracture is about 15%, while those who also have low blood pressure have a risk of death approaching 50%. Unstable fractures are often associated with injuries to other parts of the body. ==Signs and symptoms== Symptoms include pain, particularly with movement. ===Complications=== Complications are likely to result in cases of excess blood loss or punctures to certain organs, possibly leading to shock. Swelling and bruising may result, more so in high- impact injuries. Pain in the affected areas may differ where severity of impact increases its likelihood and may radiate if symptoms are aggravated when one moves around. ==Causes== Common causes include falls, motor vehicle collisions, a vehicle hitting a pedestrian, or a direct crush injury. In younger people significant trauma is typically required while in older people less significant trauma can result in a fracture. ==Pathophysiology== The bony pelvis consists of the ilium (i.e., iliac wings), ischium, and pubis, which form an anatomic ring with the sacrum. Disruption of this ring requires significant energy. When it comes to the stability and the structure of the pelvis, or pelvic girdle, understanding its function as support for the trunk and legs helps to recognize the effect a pelvic fracture has on someone. The pubic bone, the ischium and the ilium make up the pelvic girdle, fused together as one unit. They attach to both sides of the spine and circle around to create a ring and sockets to place hip joints. Attachment to the spine is important to direct force into the trunk from the legs as movement occurs, extending to one's back. This requires the pelvis to be strong enough to withstand pressure and energy. Various muscles play important roles in pelvic stability. Because of the forces involved, pelvic fractures frequently involve injury to organs contained within the bony pelvis. In addition, trauma to extra-pelvic organs is common. Pelvic fractures are often associated with severe hemorrhage due to the extensive blood supply to the region. The veins of the presacral pelvic plexus are particularly vulnerable. Greater than 85 percent of bleeding due to pelvic fractures is venous or from the open surfaces of the bone. ==Diagnosis== If a person is fully awake and has no pain of the pelvis medical imaging of the pelvis is not needed. ===Classification=== Fractures of the superior (in two places) and inferior pubic rami on the person's right, in a person who has had prior hip replacements Pelvic fractures are most commonly described using one of two classification systems. The different forces on the pelvis result in different fractures. Sometimes they are determined based on stability or instability. Tile classification The Tile classification system is based on the integrity of the posterior sacroiliac complex. In type A injuries, the sacroiliac complex is intact. The pelvic ring has a stable fracture that can be managed nonoperatively. Type B injuries are caused by either external or internal rotational forces resulting in partial disruption of the posterior sacroiliac complex. These are often unstable. Type C injuries are characterized by complete disruption of the posterior sacroiliac complex and are both rotationally and vertically unstable. These injuries are the result of great force, usually from a motor vehicle crash, fall from a height, or severe compression. Young-Burgess classification Pelvic Fracture Young-Burgess Classificationright300pxSuperior view, Pelvic Fracture Types (2006). Force and break are shown by matching color: Anteroposterior compression type I (orange), Anteroposterior compression type II (green), Anteroposterior compression type III (blue); Lateral compression type I (red), Lateral compression type II (purple), F. Lateral compression type III (black). Increased force and breaks are shown by increasing size. This fracture is best viewed anteriorly, while the other fractures are viewed superiorly. The arrow indicates where the force is coming from, and the colored lines indicate where the break occurs. The Young-Burgess classification system is based on mechanism of injury: anteroposterior compression type I, II and III, lateral compression types I, II and III, and vertical shear, or a combination of forces. Lateral compression (LC) fractures involve transverse fractures of the pubic rami, either ipsilateral or contralateral to a posterior injury. *Grade I – Associated sacral compression on side of impact *Grade II – Associated posterior iliac (\\"crescent\\") fracture on side of impact *Grade III – Associated contralateral sacroiliac joint injury The most common force type, lateral compression (LC) forces, from side-impact automobile accidents and pedestrian injuries, can result in an internal rotation. The superior and inferior pubic rami may fracture anteriorly, for example. Injuries from shear forces, like falls from above, can result in disruption of ligaments or bones. When multiple forces occur, it is called combined mechanical injury (CMI). The best imaging modality to use for this classification is probably a pelvic CT scan. ===Open book fracture=== One specific kind of pelvic fracture is known as an 'open book' fracture. This is often the result from a heavy impact to the groin (pubis), a common motorcycling accident injury. In this kind of injury, the left and right halves of the pelvis are separated at front and rear, the front opening more than the rear, i.e. like an open book that falls to the ground and splits in the middle. Depending on the severity, this may require surgical reconstruction before rehabilitation. Forces from an anterior or posterior direction, like head-on car accidents, usually cause external rotation of the hemipelvis, an “open-book” injury. Open fractures have increased risk of infection and hemorrhaging from vessel injury, leading to higher mortality. ==Prevention== As the human body ages, the bones become more weak and brittle and are therefore more susceptible to fractures. Certain precautions are crucial in order to lower the risk of getting pelvic fractures. The most damaging is one from a car accident, cycling accident, or falling from a high building which can result in a high energy injury. This can be very dangerous because the pelvis supports many internal organs and can damage these organs. Falling is one of the most common causes of a pelvic fracture. Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to prevent this from happening. ==Treatment== An example of pelvic binding using a sheet and cable ties A pelvic fracture is often complicated and treatment can be a long and painful process. Depending on the severity, pelvic fractures can be treated with or without surgery. ===Initial=== A high index of suspicion should be held for pelvic injuries in any one with major trauma. The pelvis should be stabilized with a pelvic binder. This can be a purpose made device, but improvised pelvic binders have also been used around the world to good effect. Stabilisation of the pelvic ring reduces blood loss from the pelvic vessels and reduced the risk of death. ===Surgery=== Surgery is often required for pelvic fractures. Many methods of pelvic stabilization are used including external fixation or internal fixation and traction. There are often other injuries associated with a pelvic fracture so the type of surgery involved must be thoroughly planned. ===Rehabilitation=== Pelvic fractures that are treatable without surgery are treated with bed rest. Once the fracture has healed enough, rehabilitation can be started with first standing upright with the help of a physical therapist, followed by starting to walk using a walker and eventually progressing to a cane. ==Prognosis== Mortality rates in people with pelvic fractures are between 10 and 16 percent. However, death is typically due to associated trauma affecting other organs, such as the brain. Death rates due to complications directly related to pelvic fractures, such as bleeding, are relatively low. ==Epidemiology== About 10 percent of people that seek treatment at a level 1 trauma center after a blunt force injury have a pelvic fracture. Motorcycle injuries are the most common cause of pelvic fractures, followed by injuries to pedestrians caused by motor vehicles, large falls (over 15 feet), and motor vehicle crashes. ==See also== * Coopernail sign ==References External links == * Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics: Pelvic fractures Category:Bone fractures Category:Pelvis Category:Medical emergencies Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Pelvic fracture"},{"id":"6217280","text":"Happy Daze, an album by The Battlefield Band, was released in 2001 on the Temple Records label. ==Track listing== # \\"The Devil's Courtship / An Dro\\" – 3:47 # \\"Medium Man / Floating Candles / Nighean Cailleach nan Cearc\\" – 3:58 # \\"The Banks of Red Roses\\" – 5:17 # \\"Tiny Wee Vin / The Road to the Aisle\\" – 4:14 # \\"The Riccarton Tollman's Daughter\\" – 4:15 # \\"Shepherd Lad\\" – 3:53 # \\"The Merry Macs / Dr. Iain Mac Aonghais\\" – 4:24 # \\"Happy Days\\" – 4:55 # \\"Whaur Will We Gang? / March of the Ceili Man\\" – 3:21 # \\"A Mile Down the Road /Johnny's Jig / Boys of the Puddle\\" – 4:30 # \\"Start It All over Again\\" – 5:05 # \\"Wee Michael's March / Oot B'est da Vong\\" – 4:03 # \\"Love No More\\" – 3:38 # \\"Blue Bonnets over the Border / Khazi\\" – 3:52 # \\"The 24th Guards Brigade at Anzio / The Melbourne Sleeper / MacRae's of Linn\\" – 3:51 ==PersonnelBattlefield Band=== * Alan Reid (keyboards, vocals) * Karine Polwart (lead vocals, guitar) * John McCusker (fiddle, whistle, cittern) * Mike Katz (Highland pipes, small pipes, various whistles...) ==References== Category:Battlefield Band albums Category:2001 albums ","title":"Happy Daze (Battlefield Band album)"},{"id":"6217294","text":"The Nechako Plateau is the northernmost subdivision of the Interior Plateau, one of the main geographic regions of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It spans the basin of the Nechako River and its tributaries the Stuart River and Endako Rivers, and is bounded on the south by the West Road River (Blackwater River), south of which is the Chilcotin Plateau and on the north by the Nation River and the valleys of Babine and Takla Lakes, beyond which are the Omineca Mountains (N) and Skeena Mountains (NW). To the west, it abuts the various ranges of the Hazelton Mountains while on its east it is bounded by the pass between Prince George, British Columbia and the Parsnip Arm of Williston Lake, beyond which is the McGregor Plateau, which skirts the Northern Rockies. Some classification systems include the plateau area on the east bank of the Fraser River beyond the city of Prince George; this area neighbours the northernmost reaches of the Quesnel Highland and Cariboo Mountains. ==Sub-ranges== The Nechako Plateau has four official subranges: *Fawnie Range *Nechako Range *Quanchus Range *Telegraph Range The Fawnie, Nechako and Telegraph Ranges are low ranges of hills, but the Quanchus Range is a very mountainous near-island within the arms of the Nechako Reservoir (formerly a chain of lakes). Much of this area of the plateau is in Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area. ==Geology== The Nechako Plateau was created by lava flowing over older volcanic and sedimentary rock. Large ice sheets then carved the bedrock into rolling hills. The Nechako Canyon, also called the Grand Canyon of the Nechako, is now in a provincial protected area due to its striking landscape, formed by the course of the Nechako River carving into the plateau's lava and lined with pinnacles and overhanging cliff. It begins at the outlet of the Nechako Reservoir at Kenny Dam and ends at Cheslatta Falls, an 18m drop which is the last leg of the Cheslatta River. ==Climate and ecology== The area is populated with white spruce, subalpine fir, and (at higher elevations) Engelmann spruce trees. The plateau is protected from the Pacific weather systems by the Coast Mountains and Hazelton Mountains, resulting in dry, warm summers and dry, cold winters. ==References== * *S.

He had some involvement with Soviet intelligence Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, active in the 1960s, who had more direct relations with British MI-6. == Early life == George Kisevalter was born on 4 April 1910, in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire, the son of an Imperial Russian Army munitions expert and his wife, and grandson of a Russian deputy finance minister. In 1915, Kisevalter's father, accompanied by his family, was sent to the United States in order to purchase weapons for the Russian military. They were still out of the Russian Empire on this extensive trip when the Bolshevik Revolution occurred two years later. The Kisevalters remained in the United States. There they eventually became naturalized and settled in New York City, where there developed a sizeable Russian emigre community. The young George attended Stuyvesant High School. == Education == In 1926 Kisevalter attended Dartmouth College to study engineering. Among his classmates was Nelson Rockefeller. == Career  Military === Kisevalter spent much of World War II as an army officer involved in supporting the Soviet war effort through the Lend-Lease program. His first experience with intelligence came in 1944 when, as a fluent Russian speaker, he was assigned to military intelligence in order to work on Soviet intelligence projects. Due to Kisevalter's growing expertise in Soviet matters, as well as his German language skill, he was one of the officers who interviewed Major General Reinhard Gehlen, after Gehlen had surrendered to the US military. Gehlen had been Nazi Germany's chief of intelligence for the Eastern Front, and was also well versed in Soviet military and political affairs. === Military Intelligence === Kisevalter had a brief civilian career before joining the CIA, which was the civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government. By 1953, Kisevalter was a branch chief in the Soviet Division of the Directorate of Operations. That year Major Pyotr Semyonovich Popov of GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of the Soviet Army, contacted American intelligence in Vienna, Austria, and offered to spy for the United States. Kisevalter was selected as Popov's handler, and spent the next five years in Vienna handling Popov, who provided the United States with detailed information on Soviet military plans and capabilities. During the period when he spied for the United States, Popov was considered to be \\"the CIA's most important agent.\\" He was arrested by the Soviets and subsequently executed in 1959. In 1961, Kisevalter was assigned to handle another GRU member, Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, who had also volunteered to spy. For almost two years Kisevalter and the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) jointly handled Penkovsky, who provided them with vital information on Soviet missile capabilities. Penkovsky's information was critical to the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In October 1962, Penkovsky and his British courier, Greville Wynne, were arrested by the Soviet KGB and convicted of espionage. Penkovsky was executed in 1963. Kisevalter continued to be involved in agent recruitment and handling, including the cases of KGB walk-ins Anatoliy Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko. Golitsyn's information precipitated a mole hunt by the CIA's counterintelligence chief, James Jesus Angleton. Golitsyn claimed that Yuri Nosenko was a KGB plant, which led to Nosenko's incarceration in solitary confinement for several years. Kisevalter apparently \\"never accepted the case for a mole in the CIA or the argument that Nosenko was planted by the KGB\\". Kisevalter's final assignment before his retirement in 1970 was training new CIA operations officers. He received the CIA's highest award, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. In 1997, when the CIA celebrated its 50th anniversary, Kisevalter was designated as one of its 50 Trailblazers. == Personal life == In October 1997, Kisevalter died.

A frame is two words with a linking word missing in between. The object of the game is to guess a word that is the missing link between the two words. Example: LITTLE-<>-SIMMONS Answer: \\"Richard\\" - LITTLE-RICHARD-SIMMONS ==Gameplay== In each round, the couples were shown up to three frames each worth a decreasing number of points. The first was worth 30 points, the second was worth 20 points, and the last was worth 10 points. As soon as a couple knows the word they can buzz-in, if they're right, they score the points attached to the frame, if they're wrong or if nobody knows however, another frame with the same missing link was shown. An unlimited number of frames were played according to time. The losing couples went away with a portable colour television. Two new couples competed in the first two rounds with the winners of each round playing the super final round for the right to play the bonus round for big prizes. In series 2 the format was changed where 3 couples competed in 2 rounds instead of the 2 heats and at the end of the 2 rounds the couple with the lowest score was eliminated while the 2 remaining couples played each other for the right to play for the big prizes. ===Final Round=== In the final round, while one member of the winning couple was isolated, the other was shown five middle words, and constructed a frame for each word by giving two connecting words before & after each word. When the giving player was finished, the guessing player returned and had 45 seconds within which to complete the frames.

His father came to Brooklyn at a young age in the mid-late 1930s with his cousins, also with the surname Masella. His parents were \\"Alex\\" and Mary. \\"Alex\\" died when Joey was young. He was electrocuted while working on the tracks with his cousins, and Joey grew up without a father figure. He was raised mainly in Brooklyn and became friends with John D'Amato, Charles Majuri and Vincent Palermo. As Vincent rose in the mob ranks he took Masella under his wing and gave him guidance to be a protege. He had a small crew of associates that served under him including James Gallo and Anthony Capo. He oversaw a lucrative illegal gambling empire as a lieutenant, although he was reputedly a pathological gambler and, over the years, owed a lot of money to many mobsters, including members of the Gambino crime family. He eventually moved with his first wife to Staten Island from Brooklyn. ==Married life== He had marital problems with both his first wife (Donna) and second wife (Roseanne). Rumor has it that the problems with his first wife started his gambling problem. In the 1990s his maternal grandmother in Brooklyn was called by a committee hearing by the attorney general to testify on organized crime in New Jersey and on her grandson Joseph. He ran his own illegal gambling business but had terrible luck with it. He was always desperate for cash and constantly trying to think up ways to make money or be given money throughout his adult years toward his gambling. Because of this, later on in life, he started to suffer from paranoia of being attacked if he left his Staten Island home, which he shared with his second wife, with the threat of being viciously beaten with a baseball bat. Prior to this he lived in Brooklyn for a few years with his maternal grandmother after he divorced his first wife Donna. He returned to Staten Island when he met and then married his second wife. Through those years, he had to remain reclusive to avoid the attention of the loansharks that he became indebted to in a huge way over the years. ==Gambling debts== The FBI stated that he owed $450,000 to many individuals including mobsters in other crime families. Vincent Palermo became enraged at Masella and thought of him as an embarrassment. Vincent Palermo received information that Masella was trying to ingratiate himself with the Scarfo crime family. Vincent wanted Joseph to murder his fellow DeCavalcante capo Frank Majuri who was on the three-man council of the crime family. After spending hours outside Majuri's home where they were surveilled by Majuri's state trooper neighbor, he flew to Florida and refused the contract murder. Authorities have speculated Masella's possible involvement in the failed Brinks bank robbery of $1.6 million from the World Trade Center may have been a possible reason for his killing . There are many similarities between Joseph and fictional New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano of the crime drama The Sopranos. Like the fictional Soprano, Joseph was said to have had a demonic mother like Livia, a wife like Carmela who lectured him continuously, had children who ignored him and always asked for money, and he was under constant surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This, in no doubt, gave his mob superiors worry about whether he could handle the situation reasonably if criminal indictments were handed down in the future against him, and if he would become an informant or a cooperating witness for the FBI. He never did do this, and the main reason his death was ordered was for moneys owed ranging in the hundred thousands. In October 1998, Masella received a call from a bookmaker named 'Steve'. Steve reportedly had $10,000 to deliver to him on an outstanding debt. When Masella arrived at the designated place, he was told instead to go to the Dyker Beach Golf Course parking lot in Brooklyn, New York. When he arrived at the parking lot and entered the golf course with Steve and others, he was shot several times while sitting in his car. Joseph Masella died of his wounds in the hospital soon after. When a DeCavalcante member, who turned informant, spoke about the facts surrounding his death, his murder was reported in the New York Daily News. His killer, Anthony Greco, was quoted as asking him \\"You know what's about to happen, right?\\" before shooting Masella several times. At the end of 1999, the FBI raided the DeCavalcante crime family headquarter. Agents were working off information obtained by wire from Ralph Guarino, a DeCavalcante associate. Had Masella lived, he probably would have been indicted on numerous counts of racketeering. After the FBI raid, a DeCavalcante member, Anthony Greco, was charged in relation to Masella's murder. Those charges were dropped and Greco now lives in Pahrump, Nevada. ==References== *Smith, Greg B. Made Men: The True Rise and Fall Story of a New Jersey Mob Family.

As a player, he was a defender from 1993 to 2008, notably playing his entire career at Rotherham United, bar a brief loan spell with Burton Albion in his final year as a player. After retiring from the playing side of the sport in 2008, he became joint manager with former teammate Rob Scott at Ilkeston Town, then Boston United before joining Grimsby Town in 2011. In the 2015–16 National League, he led Grimsby to promotion via the play-offs. Hurst moved on to become manager of Shrewsbury Town in October 2016, and saved the club from relegation from League One in his first season, while taking them to the EFL Trophy and League One play-off finals in 2018. He left to join Ipswich Town in May 2018, but was sacked in October after a poor start to the season. He joined Scunthorpe United in May 2019 but was sacked in January 2020. ==Playing career== During his time at Rotherham, Hurst featured regularly on the left side of the back four. He played over 430 league matches for Rotherham United. He featured in the team that became champions of the Football League Trophy in April 1996, which resulted in a 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town at Wembley Stadium. Hurst signed a new two-year contract at Rotherham in 2004, keeping him at the club until June 2006. On 15 February 2008, Hurst joined Conference National side Burton Albion on a one-month loan to regain his fitness after injury and extended the loan for a second month. He was released by Rotherham after 15 years at the club, at the end of the 2007–08 season. In 2008, Hurst stated that he wanted to return to Rotherham as part of the backroom staff in the future.Hurst Could Return to Millmoor MillersMad, 13 May 2008 Hurst had a trial at Mansfield Town but turned down a move before moving into management. ==Management careerIlkeston Town=== Hurst and former Rotherham teammate Rob Scott were appointed joint managers of Northern Premier League Premier Division outfit Ilkeston Town in January 2009 following the departure of David Holdsworth to Mansfield Town. The pair led Ilkeston from 9th in the league to 2nd, and ultimately promotion to the Conference North via the play-offs following a 2–1 victory over Nantwich Town in the final. Afterwards, uncertainty surrounded whether or not they would remain at the helm of the Derbyshire club due to the club's worrying financial position. ===Boston United=== In May 2009, Hurst and Scott moved to York Street to sign as joint managers of Boston United. In their first season they gained a second successive promotion to the Conference North at the Horsfall Stadium with a 2–1 play-off final victory over Bradford Park Avenue. This completed a treble of trophies in the 2009–10 season as they had already collected the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup and Lincolnshire Senior Shield. ===Grimsby Town=== On 22 March 2011, both Hurst and Scott resigned from Boston. The following morning they were both announced as the new management team of Grimsby Town, replacing the sacked Neil Woods. Grimsby, who had suffered relegation from the Football League in the previous season, had hoped for an instant return, but following a mid-season slump this led to the sacking of the previous manager. Hurst and Scott could only salvage an 11th- place finish at the end of the 2010–11 campaign. During the summer months the duo bolstered Grimsby's ranks in order for a promotion push, but were hit by a blow, as previous season's top scorer and Player of the Year Alan Connell left to join Swindon Town. The eventual signing of Liam Hearn was a suitable replacement as he scored 32 times during the 2011–12 season, a year which saw 'The Mariners' slide away out of contention for a play-off spot in the final few months of the season. Grimsby finished 11th in the Conference National. The 2012–13 season started slowly but by Christmas, Grimsby were top of the league and leading a closely contested pack of Newport County, Wrexham and Forest Green Rovers. On 6 January 2013, speculation about the future of Hurst and Scott at Blundell Park came into light when rumours circulating a potential move to League One side Doncaster Rovers surfaced, Rovers who had lost manager Dean Saunders earlier that day to Wolverhampton Wanderers were rumoured to have placed Hurst and Scott on their managerial shortlist; the rumour was quashed the following day, with Hurst saying that the pair were focused on earning promotion with Grimsby. Grimsby went on to reach the final of the FA Trophy, but were defeated on a penalty shootout after drawing 1–1 with Wrexham at Wembley Stadium. Despite leading the Conference for part of the season, Grimsby dropped off towards the end of the campaign and had to settle for 4th place, eventually losing to Newport County in the play-off semi-finals. On 6 September 2013, joint manager Rob Scott was suspended due to reasons not revealed by the club, leaving Hurst in sole charge. On 19 September 2013, Grimsby confirmed Scott had been sacked for gross misconduct and that Hurst would remain in sole permanent charge. On 7 January 2014, Hurst signed an improved deal reflecting the fact that he was now sole manager. Hurst oversaw an overhaul of his squad in the 2014–15 season. In his first full season in charge as sole manager, Hurst signed 7 players on free transfers, along with a total of 10 players on short term (4) and long term (6) loans. Grimsby started the season inconsistently, reaching 11th position with 15 matches played, but after much improvement they ended the campaign in 3rd place, six points behind Conference National champions Barnet. Hurst clinched promotion with Grimsby in their 3–1 victory over Forest Green Rovers in the 2016 National League play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, seeing Grimsby promoted to League Two after a six-year absence from the Football League. Hurst made his League Two managerial debut with the club on 6 August 2016 in the opening match of the 2016–17 season in Grimsby's 2–0 home victory against Morecambe; the performance led to Hurst winning the Sky Bet EFL Manager of the Week award. ===Shrewsbury Town=== On 24 October 2016, Shrewsbury Town announced that Hurst and Chris Doig were to take over the manager and assistant manager roles at the club following the departure of Micky Mellon to Tranmere Rovers. Hurst was selected from a field of over 100 candidates, and tasked with steering the club clear from the relegation places, with Shrewsbury sitting bottom of the League One table. His first match in charge was a 1−1 draw away at Southend United, ending a run of four consecutive defeats. A week later, Hurst picked up his first victory as Shrewsbury manager, defeating League Two side Barnet 3−0 in the FA Cup first round at New Meadow in his second match in charge. A point earned in a 1−1 draw away at Swindon Town lifted the club out of the League One relegation places, albeit on goal difference only, for the first time since Hurst was appointed on 7 January 2017. Shrewsbury finished the campaign in 18th place, three places and two points clear of the final relegation place occupied by local rivals Port Vale. ===Ipswich Town=== On 30 May 2018, Hurst was announced as manager of Ipswich Town. Hurst and his assistant Chris Doig signed three-year contracts. Upon his appointment, Hurst was keen to stress that he could work within Ipswich's £3m transfer budget as outlined in the owner's five point plan, and the club's wage bill which was the sixth lowest in the English Championship.https://scontent.fltn1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/34178157_1666209170122760_2065133538499362816_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeGM8mTr_uctOzsBfk-7RUK1q0EN4A6LssFbtH2RXppDjwznPx4KfyUQ67STIfPRm- zpBkTmCky4noWZXScWjWcycku3ms3gAsED6_cc9Z7KJQ&oh;=9842e2e0587b37322b86092e64b8d9ab&oe;=5B792CD0 Under Hurst, Ipswich made a very poor start to the season, winning just one of their opening 14 games and losing on penalties to League Two side Exeter City in the EFL Cup. Hurst was sacked on 25 October 2018 following a 2–0 defeat at Leeds United with Ipswich bottom of the table. He had been in charge for just under five months, the shortest reign of any manager in the club's history. ===Scunthorpe United=== On 13 May 2019, Hurst was announced as manager of Scunthorpe United. Hurst was sacked by Scunthorpe on 29 January 2020 after eight months in charge. ==Broadcasting career== In the summer of 2008, Hurst graduated from Staffordshire University with a degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting. Hurst worked for Rotherham United's Community Sports Trust as Participation Officer. ==Personal life== Hurst previously worked as a Professional Support Assistant at Rawmarsh Community School in 2010, combining this with his role as joint manager of Boston Utd. Hurst completed his UEFA 'A' Coaching Licence in January 2014, which is widely regarded as one of the highest coaching qualifications in the game. He is married to Melanie and has a daughter Millie and a son Zach. ==Managerial statistics== { class= style=text-align:center + Managerial record by team and tenure - !rowspan=2Team !rowspan=2From !rowspan=2To !colspan=5Record - !!!!!!!!! - align=leftIlkeston Town (joint with Rob Scott) align=left15 January 2009 align=left14 May 2009 - align=leftBoston United (joint with Rob Scott) align=left14 May 2009 align=left22 March 2011 - align=leftGrimsby Town (joint with Rob Scott) align=left23 March 2011 align=left19 September 2013 - align=leftGrimsby Town align=left19 September 2013 align=left24 October 2016 - align=leftShrewsbury Town align=left24 October 2016 align=left30 May 2018 - align=leftIpswich Town align=left30 May 2018 align=left25 October 2018 - align=leftScunthorpe United align=left13 May 2019 align=left29 January 2020 - !colspan=3Total } ==HonoursAs a player=== Rotherham United *Football League Trophy: 1995–96 *Football League Third Division second-place promotion: 1999–00 *Football League Second Division second-place promotion: 2000–01 ===As a joint manager=== Ilkeston Town F.C.

Sprague de Camp, the first book of both his Novarian series and the \\"Reluctant King\\" trilogy featuring King Jorian of Xylar. It is not to be confused with the collection of poetry by the same title by Frank Belknap Long. De Camp's novel was first published as a paperback by Pyramid Books in 1968. It was reprinted by Del Rey Books in December 1983, July 1987, and July 1989. It was later gathered together with its sequels The Clocks of Iraz (1971) and The Unbeheaded King (1983) into the omnibus collection The Reluctant King (Nelson Doubleday/SFBC, February 1985). The first independent hardbound edition was issued by HarperCollins in 1987. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition The novel has been translated into French, Italian and German. ==Plot summary== The Kingdom of Xylar, one of the twelve city-states of Novaria, has a peculiar custom for choosing its kings, each of whom serves for a five-year term. At the end of that period he is beheaded in the public square before an assembly of foreigners, and his head cast into the crowd. The man who catches the head is drafted as the next king. The latest beneficiary/victim of this arrangement is Jorian of Kortoli, a powerful and intelligent man who has trained extensively for a life of adventure, but who is hampered by garrulousness and a weakness for drink and women. Having served out his term as king in a reign characterized by both great accomplishments and increasing despair, he ultimately appears resigned to his fate, though in fact he is determined to cheat it. He successfully escapes his beheading with the aid of a Mulvanian magician, the saintly Dr. Karadur, who provides a spell granting physical access to the plane of the Novarian afterlife. This turns out to be our own world, in which the souls of Novarians are reincarnated. Jorian's brief excursion there is a satirical romp in which he is frightened by a passing giant truck, has a mutually uncomprehending encounter with a police officer in a patrol car, and is very glad to get back to the familiar dangers of his own world. These include an encounter with a homicidal wizard and his giant squirrel familiar, along with the succor of a distressed damsel who proves more trouble than she is worth. Linking back up with Karadur, Jorian is confronted with the price of the sorcerer's aid; securing for him the Kist of Avlen, a legendary repository of ancient magical manuscripts. The novel follows his adventures as he attempts to both fulfill his service and avoid the agents of Xylar, duty-bound to abduct him back to Xylar for the beheading ceremony. Jorian's quest takes him through much of the known world, including the exotic lands of Mulvan, Komilakh and Shven, before ultimately returning to Novaria. Included in his adventures' bill of fare are the rescue a consignment of maidens destined for the block from a fortress full of homicidal retired executioners, romancing the centuries-old serpent princess Yargali guarding the Kist in order to steal it, matching wits with an unreliable and ineffectual god who appears to his worshipers in dreams, escaping sacrifice by a horde of angry beast men to their tiger god, enslavement and sale by treacherous nomads, and abetting a revolution in the priest-ruled city-state of Tarxia, during which a huge frog statue is brought to life. The ultimate challenge comes at a great symposium of Karadur's guild of magicians hosted by the city-state of Metouro - the depiction of which provides de Camp with the opportunity to poke some fun at academic conferences and symposiums before getting on with the plot. The meeting is held in the fabled Goblin Tower, constructed from actual goblins transformed to stone. There Jorian becomes enmeshed in sorcerous politics as his patron Karadur naively presents the Kist of Avlen to the heads of his own faction, hoping thereby to advance its cause. Unfortunately, its use by these unscrupulous leaders cancels the spell binding the building's fabric together, freeing the goblins and bringing the tower crashing down. The protagonists escape but are left without resource. The outcome is particularly frustrating to Jorian; he had counted on Karadur's assistance in achieving his ultimate objective, the rescue from Xylar of Estrildis, his favorite among the wives he had as king, with whom he had hoped to settle down in peaceful obscurity in his home state of Kortoli. The end of the novel finds him starting from scratch to recoup his fortunes by telling stories on a street corner. The Goblin Tower by L. Sprague de Camp, Del Rey Books, 1983 ==Setting== The world of which Novaria is part is a parallel world to Earth, a plane of existence related to ours in that ours constitutes its afterlife. Culturally it bears resemblances to the eras of both Classical Greece and Medieval Europe. The states of Novaria itself are split between competing systems of government, some of them unique, which allows the author to explore various pros and cons of different styles of governance as his hero tours the country. ==Innovative features== The Goblin Tower is one of de Camp's most innovative fantasies, and not only in its use of politics. It inverts the \\"rags to royalty\\" pattern characteristic of much heroic fantasy by featuring a protagonist fleeing an unwanted crown. Another singular feature of the novel is its frequent use of folk tales integrated into the plot (Jorian is a skilled storyteller) to painlessly convey something of the background and history of the invented world. This device obviates the need for lengthy appendices, as in The Lord of the Rings. While each book in the trilogy makes use of the device, its use is heaviest in The Goblin Tower. ==Relation to other works== The method of dragon hunting employed in the inset tale \\"King Fusinian the Fox and the Teeth of Grimnor\\" is echoed in the late de Camp novel The Pixilated Peeress (1991). ==References== Category:American fantasy novels Category:1968 American novels Category:1968 fantasy novels Category:Novels by L.
