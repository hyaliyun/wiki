He organized the Romanian firefighter units after World War I and extended their role to cover other activities related to civil defense. Reorganization of firefighter units The Romanian firefighter units were subordinated to the artillery regiments of the Romanian Army according to the provisions of Royal Decree No. 702 of 1874. In 1912, by Royal Decree No. 2222 of 1912 the ‚ÄúInspectorate for Military Firefighters‚Äù (Inspectoratul Pompierilor Military) was created. Further reform was however stopped due to World War 1. Gheorghe Pohrib, an artillery officer, who had been assigned to the firefighters battalion of Bucharest in 1907, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel (consequently colonel) and appointed inspector general of the firefighters in 1920. He had the responsibility of reorganizing the firefighter units and of unifying the structures in the newly gained provinces. As a result of colonel Pohrib‚Äôs endeavours, by 1929 the Romanian firefighters included following units: * The Firefighters Command (formally established on August 2, 1929) * The School of Firefighting non-commissioned officers; * A training center for the personnel and instructors of the military firefighters units as well as of the commanders of the volunteer firefighters units. * Workshops for maintaining and repairing firefighting equipment and storage of intervention materials. * Firefighter units located in 30 cities (companies and sections). At the same time Gheorghe Pohrib established the ‚ÄúRomanian Firefighters Newsletter‚Äù (Buletinul Pompierilor Rom√¢ni) which is still published, at present under the name ‚ÄúRevista Pompierii Rom√¢ni‚Äù http://revista.pompieri.go.ro/noi.htm Revista Pompierii Rom√¢ni Integration of firefighters into the civil defense structures Gheorghe Pohrib expanded the responsibility of the firefighters to other types of rescue operations. In 1928, the International Committee of the Red Cross raised for the first time the issue of creating structures in charge of the protection of civilian population against chemical attacks and of preparing regulations to deal with such events. A special commission for the study and proposal of measures for civil defense was instituted by order No. 513 of June 21, 1928 of the Ministry of War. The commission included colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, head of the firefighter department, colonel George E. Popescu, head of the department of defense against chemical warfare as well as representatives of various concerned ministries. After one year the commission presented its conclusions to the Council of Ministers who, on October 25, 1929, approved the proposed instructions, to which colonel Gheorghe Pohrib had contributed to a significant extent. This is the first legislation in Romania which created an organization for the protection of the civilian population in case of an armed conflict. Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib had an essential contribution in preparing the legislation for civil defense (called ‚Äúpassive defense‚Äù at that time). Law No. 1245 of 1933 and Royal Decree 468 of February 28, 1933 defined the responsibilities of the firefighters in preparation, mitigation and response in civil defense operations. As a result, the military firefighter unit were provided with special machinery, equipment, accessories and materials required for saving people trapped under wrecked buildings, for decontamination of poisonous gases, for the destruction of unexploded bombs, for alerting the population and for medical first aid. The day of promulgation of the Decree, February 28, has since been declared the ‚ÄúDay of Civil Defense‚Äù. Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib continued his efforts to ensure the legal provisions required for the activities of the firefighters and was able to convince the authorities to approve Law 815 of April 3, 1936 for the Organization of the Corps of Military Firefighters. Pohrib retired in 1937 after having been commander of the Romanian military firefighters for over 17 years, the longest interval any firefighter chief ever held the position. The organization he set was to be tested and to prove its efficiency a few years after his retirement, in the years of World War II.28 februarie - Ziua Protec≈£iei Civile International activity Due to World War I, the activities of the International Technical Committee for the Prevention and Extinction of Fire ‚Äì CNIF, which had been established in 1900, had practically been halted. An International Congress of Firefighters was organized on July 5, 1928 in Czechoslovakia with the objective of reorganizing the Committee. The discussions were continued the following year, on June 24, 1929, in Paris, where the congress approved the new bylaws of the organization and elected as chairman colonel Paul Pouderoux, commander of the Firefighters Regiment of Paris. In both congresses, Romania was represented by Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib. The following congress was organized in Paris on July 1‚Äì5, 1931, at the same time as the ‚ÄúFirst International Exhibition of Firefighting‚Äù. Romania was represented by colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, Commander of the Military Firefighters Corps and by Professor Valeriu Zaharescu, the chemical expert of the firefighters. Other reunions of the organization, which Gheorghe Pohrib attended, were organized on July 1, 1934 in Paris and on July 8, 1936 in Vienna. In recognition of Gheorghe Pohrib‚Äôs contributions, on December 31, 1935, Paul Pouderoux, who had been advanced to the rank of general, awarded him an honor diploma of the CNIF. Study of the history of Romanian firefighters In 1935 colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, in cooperation with lieutenant colonel N. Lupa≈ücu and captain P.V. PetƒÉleanu published an extensive history of the Romanian firefighters, to commemorate 100 years since the creation of the first units of military firefighters in the Romanian Principalities. The volume presents the first firefighter units in Moldavia and Wallachia. It then emphasizes the battle of Dealul Spirii, during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, when the firemen opposed the Ottoman army. He then presents the activities of the firefighters until 1935. The volume presents documents related to the organization of firefighters in Romania and also the most important fires in major Romanian cities in which the intervention of the firefighters was required.

History The Caterham Graduates Championship was started in 1998 by competitors from the 1997 Caterham Scholarship (subsequently Caterham Academy). For the first year it was called the Graduate 797 series (the first \\"7\\" for Caterham Seven, and \\"97\\" from the year that most drivers started competing). In its first two years, it was a multi-discipline series, with the rounds being made up of sprints (single car on track, against the clock), hillclimbs, and circuit races, similar to the Caterham Scholarship format. The emphasis moved more and more towards circuit races, and from 2000-on the series has been entirely circuit races.Nick Frost, Chairman, Caterham Graduates Racing Club In 2001, following the Caterham Academy's change to Rover-engined cars, the championship launched a second class named Super Graduates, based upon an uprated K-Series Academy car. In 2003, the Super Graduates class was further upgraded and renamed the Mega Graduates. A replacement Super Graduates class was created to accommodate standard ex-Academy cars with Rover K-series engines. In 2007, the \\"Graduates\\" class was rebranded \\"Classic Graduates\\". In 2010, Ford Sigma-engined cars were introduced as a sub-class of Super Graduates. From 2011 onwards, the Sigma cars have been a separate, 4th championship class. In 2013, a 5th championship class was introduced for variants of the Ford Sigma-engined cars - SigMax. This allows suspension and engine upgrades in line with the Caterham Tracksport and Supersport series. The series is one of the largest in the UK, if not the largest, with well over 100 registered competitors. The competitors come from a variety of backgrounds - a number have \\"graduated\\" from the novice Caterham Scholarship and Academy series, whilst many others have made it their first foray into motorsport. Racing The Caterham Graduates race series takes place over a number of races meeting each year at UK and European motor racing circuits. The races are usually run over 20‚Äì30 minutes and the leading car across the line after the time has expired is the winner. Wherever possible, each class starts on its own grids, but on larger grids it is usually necessary to combine two or more classes. The events are typified by close wheel to wheel racing, often having several lead changes on the same lap. In Super Graduates and Mega Graduates, points are awarded thus: 40 for a win, 39 for 2nd place, 38 for 3rd place, right down to 2 points for finishing 39th or lower. It is 30 points for a win in Classic Graduates and Sigma Graduates, as they generally have slightly smaller grids. And even a driver who fails to finish will still earn one point. At the end of the season, drivers drop their lowest three scores, to allow for missing a race or two, or a \\"DNF\\" (did not finish). In addition to the standard MSA motorsport rules, the club operates a Driving Standards function which ensures that the close racing is fair and safe for all. The club's racing is organised through the BARC. Car Specifications The cars in the series are genuinely road-going, although Mega and SigMax Graduates spec is moving away from this with the deletion of lights, and indeed a few are driven to and (hopefully) from races. Many are used by drivers mid-week for transport to work and for shopping, needing no more than the covering up of competition numbers to make them road- legal. No changes from the standard specification are allowed, putting the emphasis firmly on driving ability rather than car development and set-up. Along with low consumable costs, this keeps the costs of running a car very much under control, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to go racing. The large grid sizes are a testament to this low-cost formula. Current classes are: Classic Graduate 1600cc Ford or Vauxhall engined Caterham Sevens with a live axle, from the Caterham Scholarship or Academy 1995 - 2000. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 100 bhp. SigMax Graduate Uprated 1600cc Ford Sigma-engined cars from the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. No lights or windscreen, widetrack suspension, controlled engine upgrades and lightened flywheel. Mega Graduate Uprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent (DeDion) rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with controlled modifications produce around 140 bhp. All classes run on Yokohama road legal tyres. Classic Graduates race on MSA list 1A A539s, whilst Sigmas, Supers, Sigmax and Megas use the stickier list 1B A048R (medium compound) Affordability and Technical Support Affordability is a key ingredient to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications and work on the sealed engines is limited to nominated engine builders - McMillan Motorsport and - for Sigmas and K-series only - Caterham Cars. Other ways the club promotes affordability include limiting the amount of tyres the drivers can use through the season, providing race-day catering as part of the drivers' membership fees, and encouraging drivers either to stay on-site at the circuits or in budget hotels locally. Race Numbers Race numbers 1 - 49 go to Mega Graduates, 51 - 69 to Sigma Graduates, 71 - 99 to Classic Graduates, 101 - 149 to Super Graduates and 151-199 to Sigmax Graduate cars. The lower race numbers represent a driver's performance in the previous season, as the first ten numbers in each class are reserved for those finishing in the previous year's top ten.

Gundlach (September 7, 1926 ‚Äì August 18, 2010) was an American physicist. He is most noted for his prolific contributions to the field of xerography, specifically the development of the modern photocopier. Gundlach helped transform the Haloid Company, a small photographic firm, into the thriving Xerox Corporation. Over the course of his 42 year career with the company, he contributed over 155 patents, making photocopying technology more affordable and practical.\\"Buffalo native achieves 155th patent for Xerox Corp.\\" 9 Aug. 2002. BNET. 18 Nov. 2008 . In 1966 Gundlach was named Xerox‚Äôs first Research Fellow, the highest non-managerial that could be achieved by a Xerox scientist. After his retirement in 1995, he was granted several patents associated with his hobbies, including a snow-making system and a special backpack. Biography Early years Robert Gundlach was born in 1926 in a small town several miles outside Buffalo. He worked on a farm across the street from his house for twelve and a half cents an hour ‚Äì a dollar a day for eight hours of work.Owen, David. Copies In Seconds. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster, 2004. 161+. His father, Emanuel Gundlach, was a chemist responsible for inventing Wildroot Cream-Oil, a hair preparation. Emanuel‚Äôs first batch of Cream-Oil was rejected by Wildroot executives, but after a few modifications, the invention was a success. Bob spent one summer of his teenage years working for Wildroot, mixing Cream-Oil at a factory in Buffalo. Bob‚Äôs grandfather was a minister in the German Reformed Church, and preached in German in upstate New York. Emanuel and his family instead became involved with the Quaker-like pacifist organization called the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Education Gundlach attended the University at Buffalo, but was drafted just after the end of World War II following his freshman year. He spent a year in conscientious objector camps, and promptly returned to school. Back at the University at Buffalo, he switched his initial chemistry major to graduate with a physics degree in 1949. Gundlach spent two years in graduate school, but never completed his PhD. Early career Although he was a successful physicist, Gundlach experienced difficulties finding a job due to his pacifistic beliefs. Companies he applied for weren‚Äôt interested in physicists who did not do war work. He was briefly hired at Durez Plastics and Chemicals, where he worked in the plastic company‚Äôs physical testing laboratory. In 1952, Gundlach learned from an old University at Buffalo classmate of his that a small photographic firm in Rochester was hiring. He applied for a job with the Haloid Company, and was hired after receiving an exceptional score on a written physics test. After Joe Wilson, the firm‚Äôs president, promised that work on military projects would never be required, Robert readily accepted the job. He would go on to devote many years of hard work and passion into the company, contributing countless ideas and helping the small firm grow into a corporate giant. Haloid Company The fairly new Haloid Company originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment. When Robert Gundlach joined, he discovered that much of their xerographic research was accident based. Instead of working in a modern laboratory, Gundlach experimented in the cramped attic of an old house in a working-class neighborhood. There were very few titles and little organizational structure within the physicists. Gundlach made his impact within the company quickly, coming up with three patentable ideas in his first year with Haloid.\\"Robert Gundlach Biography (1926-).\\" MadeHow.com. 10 Feb. 2005. Net Industries. 18 Nov. 2008 . Before Robert joined the company, xerography was good at copying thin lines and characters, but could not successfully reproduce large, solid black areas. Solid areas came out looking washed-out because of a difference in electric potential between exposed and unexposed surface areas on a photoreceptor. Along edges, the potential difference was high and allowed excellent image reproduction, but in solid areas, the low potential difference caused faded images. Gundlach invented the Tone Tray, a grounded metal plate placed directly above the photoreceptor to create a constant potential difference between the plate and every part of an image. This invention alone brought the company enough profits in one year to pay all the salaries in the physics department. Gundlach continued his research and experimentation in the field of xerography, developing a process that allowed many copies to be produced from a single image. Early photocopiers were slow and impractical, requiring several minutes to copy and reproduce a single document. Gunchlach‚Äôs process significantly increased the speed of the photocopier and paved the way for its commercial success. In 1955, Haloid transformed its photo-paper warehouses into showrooms for its Xerox machines and hired several hundred sales and service people. In 1956, the president of the company formed an overseas partnership with a British film company called the Rank Organization. This partnership would become Rank Xerox, expanding the market of photocopiers overseas to Europe. In 1960, the Xerox 914 copier was introduced to the market and became an instant hit, propelling the company to unsurpassed heights. Xerox Corporation The Xerox 914 was the first marketable automatic and plain-paper copier. This machine could produce a good quality copy in under a minute. Although it was large and weighed 650 pounds, businesses had high demand for the efficient copier. Small businesses could lease it on a monthly basis, making xerography affordable to startup companies. The 914 was a huge success, exceeding Haloid‚Äôs most optimistic projections, and creating a huge market demand for the product. In 1961 Haloid was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and changed its name to the Xerox Corporation.\\"Xerox Corporation.\\" Xerox Corporation -- Company History. Funding Universe. 18 Nov. 2008 . Xerography accounted for most of the company‚Äôs profits, and photography operations were placed under the new Haloid photo division. The Xerox Corporation expanded internationally, opening subsidiaries in Mexico, continental Europe, Japan, and Australia. By 1968, the Xerox 914 led the company to over $1 billion in sales. With the debut of the 914, Xerox was granted 15-year exclusive patent rights to xerography. These rights, along with millions of dollars spent for product development, allowed Robert Gundach to refine photocopiers undisturbed. He developed more improvements and was quickly promoted within the company. In 1963, Gundlach was one of the company‚Äôs first four Senior Scientists. In 1966, he was named Xerox‚Äôs first Research Fellow, and in 1978, he was appointed Senior Research Fellow. One of his most significant inventions was tri-level xerography, a process that allows the printing of two colors in a single pass, achieving perfect registration and greater speed than earlier methods. Later years After his retirement from the Xerox Corporation in 1995, Gundlach concentrated on his hobbies. His house contained a self-invented heating and cooling system which only costs about $600 per year to operate. He also held patents for a shadowless sundial, a snowmaking process, an extremely comfortable backpack, and a cheap 20,000 Volt electrostatic generator. Gundlach continued to invent, and his lifetime contributions were recognized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame when he was inducted in 2005.Pings, Gregory R. \\"Serendipity, Synergy and Innovation: A Conversation with Bob Gundlach.\\" Xerox.

Launched in 1806, she saw service during the Napoleonic Wars, escorting merchant convoys to France's besieged Caribbean colonies. In February 1809 she was captured at sea after a fierce engagement with four Royal Navy vessels. Recommissioned as HMS Junon, she served as part of the British blockade of French ports in the Caribbean. French frigates recaptured her in December 1809 off the French colony of Guadeloupe. The engagement so damaged Junon that her captors scuttled her.  Capture by Britain  On 10 November 1808, under capitaine de fr√©gate Rousseau, Junon departed for Martinique, along with V√©nus, Amphitrite, Cygne and Papillon. The squadron broke apart the next day, and she found herself isolated. On 10 February 1809 she ran across a British squadron composed of the frigates and , the brig , and the schooner ; Junon surrendered after a lengthy resistance that left the ship entirely dismasted and with more than half her crew killed. The British towed her to Halifax, Nova Scotia for repair. There she was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy as the 38-gun HMS Junon.James & Chamier (1837), Vol. 5, pp. 150‚Äì152.  Recapture by France  Her repairs completed, Junon returned to the Caribbean in September 1809 under the command of Captain John Shortland, under orders to enforce a naval blockade of French-controlled Guadeloupe.Jenkins (2013), pp. 34‚Äì37. At 2.15pm on 13 December, Junon was in company with the 14-gun sloop- of-war HMS Observateur when her crew sighted four unknown ships heading west towards the French colony. Both British vessels turned to intercept, with Observateur in the lead. The four unknown vessels were swiftly identified as frigates rather than merchantmen. Commander Wetherall of Observateur signaled this information to Junon and ordered his own ship cleared for action. By sunset, the two British ships were within long range of the unknown ships. Observateur fired a warning shot in their direction and both she and Junon moved to close with the lead frigate preparatory to engaging them. However, as the British ships approached, the lead frigate ran up a Spanish flag, shortly followed by the British Red Ensign. Believing the unknown ships to be Spanish allies, Wetherall and Shortland reduced sail and Junon moved to come alongside the lead frigate to permit Captain Shortland to exchange greetings with her captain. At 5.50pm, when Junon was \\"within Half Pistol Shott\\"Captain's log, HM Sloop Observateur, 13/14 December 1809. Cited in Jenkins 2013, p.38 of the lead frigate, that vessel suddenly hauled down its Spanish and British flags and raised the French ensign. The following three vessels followed suit, and all four vessels opened fire on Junon at short range. Junons crew were taken by surprise; a ragged retaliatory broadside struck two of the French ships but caused little damage. Junon herself received broadsides to her port, starboard, and stern and quickly became indefensible; her crew surrendered at 7pm when French soldiers boarded their ship. A total of 15 British sailors were killed and 44 wounded, including Shortland, who was hit by musket fire and then struck through the body by wood splinters torn from the deck by cannon fire.Jenkins 2013, pp. 35‚Äì36 The British sloop Observateur had fired upon the French when the engagement began but Junons capture was too swift for her to directly assist her sister ship. Instead, as Junon seemed lost Wetherall ordered that Observateur make sail and escape to the west. The French vessels were the frigates Clorinde and Renomm√©e, and the lightly armed fl√ªtes Loire and Seine, en route to Guadeloupe with supplies and reinforcements for the colony. Overall command rested with Captain Dominque Roquebert aboard Clorinde. Roquebert's logs indicate he had not initially intended to engage the British, and had raised the Spanish flag in the hope that they would leave his ships alone. However, when Junon and Observateur drew near, Roquebert decide to continue with the ruse of the false flag to lure the British into range of all four French vessels at the same time. The French suffered 80 casualties, including 34 killed. All casualties were from among the crews of Clorinde and Renomm√©e which had come alongside Junon during the battle. Loire and Seine had engaged the British ship from the rear and had not come under fire from either Junon or Observateur.  Fate  Junon remained afloat following her battle with Roquebert's ships, but her condition was unsalvageable. On 14 December Roquebert ordered that the surviving British crew be brought aboard the French vessels as prisoners. Later that day her captors set fire to Junon and she sank in waters east of Guadeloupe. Roquebert had Junons erstwhile captain, John Shortland, conveyed to a hospital in Guadeloupe for medical care. He underwent several operations and the amputation of his right leg and part of one hand, but died of his wounds on 21 January 1810. He was buried with military honours in the French cemetery at Basse-Terre.Brenton 1823, p. 392James & Chamier 1837, p. 191  Notes, citations, and references  ;Notes ;Citations ;References * * *  External links  * Les b√¢timents ayant port√© le nom de Junon Category:Frigates of the Royal Navy Category:Age of Sail frigates of France Category:1806 ships Category:Captured ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1809 Category:1800s in Guadeloupe Category:1809 in the Caribbean Category:Gloire-class frigates Category:Ships built in France Category:Shipwrecks in the Caribbean Sea Category:Scuttled vessels ","title":"French frigate Junon (1806)"},{"id":"20299650","text":"Carl Frederick Hovde (pronounced HUV-dee; October 11, 1926 - September 5, 2009) was an American educator who from 1968 until 1972 was the Dean of Columbia College, the undergraduate division of Columbia University. In that position, he served an important role in restoring order and calm on the campus after the six-week-long student protests in spring 1968 that had been led by the Students for a Democratic Society. Early life and education Hovde was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania on October 11, 1926. His father, Bryn Hovde, was president of the New School for Social Research from 1945 to 1950. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1944 after graduating from high school and served in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. After completing his military service, he attended Columbia College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1950. He received a Ph.D. in English from Princeton University in 1955 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"The writing of Henry D. Thoreau's A week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers: a study in textual materials and technique.\\" He began his academic career with a position at The Ohio State University.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Carl F. Hovde, Former Columbia Dean, Dies at 82\\", The New York Times, September 10, 2009. Accessed September 11, 2009. Columbia University Hovde joined the Columbia University faculty in 1960 as a professor of comparative English literature. He was appointed as the dean of Columbia College in July 1968 under a process designed to assuage students in the wake of the recent protests, in which he was approved by Columbia President Grayson L. Kirk after being nominated by a committee composed of administrators and faculty members. The students protests had begun in April 1968 in response to plans by Columbia to construct a gym in Morningside Park that was opposed by Harlem residents and by disclosures of university ties to the Institute for Defense Analyses, a weapons research think-tank connected with the United States Department of Defense. Several buildings on the campus were taken over, with windows damaged and files destroyed by student protesters. Police cleared out and arrested on charges of criminal trespassing a group of 700 students, but the protests persisted for weeks. At the start of the protests, Hovde served on a faculty group that established a joint committee composed of administrators, faculty and students that established recommendations for addressing disciplinary action for the students involved in the protests. Once he was appointed as dean, Hovde stated that he felt that the \\"sit-ins and the demonstrations were not without cause\\" and opposed criminal charges being filed against the students by the university, though he did agree that the protesters \\"were acting with insufficient cause\\". Hovde served as dean when the core curriculum underwent fundamental changes. Following his tenure as dean, the Columbia Daily Spectator credited Hovde with having \\"sought to quietly guide the college, not to rule it; to use the force of persuasion and reason, not the blunt power of authority\\". He later was a professor of English emeritus after a career as a longtime teacher of literature humanities. He received the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 1975. After his retirement in 1995 he served as chair of the Friends of the Heyman Center and also is a member of the Society of Senior Scholars. Professor Hovde received the Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum in 1997-1998.Carl Hovde at WikiCU under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

He was the brother of Jos√© Mar√≠a Viesca, also a governor of Coahuila y Tejas during 1827-1831.Winifred W. Vigness, \\"VIESCA, JOSE MARIA,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed August 24, 2011.  Administration in Texas  As Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna began consolidating power in early 1835, the state government of Coahuila y Tejas defied his orders. In May, the army, which supported the government's new centralist policies, invaded the capital, Saltillo, and dissolved the state government. As their last official act, the legislature authorized the governor to temporarily appoint any other city in the state as the capital. Viesca immediately designated San Antonio de Bexar as the focus of the state government and issued a proclamation asking the people of Mexican Texas to arm themselves in support of the now overthrown Constitution of 1824.Huson (1974), p. 113. Viesca and members of the government gathered important documents from the state archives and began the journey overland to San Antonio. They were caught and arrested near the Rio Grande.Huson (1974), p. 115. Later in the year, Viesca and his party were liberated by rebels under Colonel Jose Maria Gonzales. The group continued their journey into Texas, but rather than travel directly to San Antonio they took a coastal route towards Goliad, where Texians had recently gained control of Presidio La Bahia.Huson (1974), p. 116. After leaving San Patricio, Viesca met Texian troops led by Ira Westover, who had recently defeated another Mexican force at the Battle of Lipantitlan.Huson (1974), p. 118. Westover escorted Viesca and his party to Presidio La Bahia. At that time that he arrived, the Texians had just convened the Consultation, a provisional government that was trying to determine if the Texians were fighting for the reinstatement of the Constitution of 1824 or for independence from Mexico. Although Viesca assumed that he would resume his position as leader of the area, La Bahia commander Philip Dimmitt was unsure how to receive the governor. Dimmitt sent a military escort to escort the party in with military honors and offered an official reception inside the fort. However, he wrote to Texian Army commander Stephen F. Austin that as \\"I did not conceived myself duly authorized to receive this gentleman in an official capacity, no such reception was either given or intended.\\"Huson (1974), p. 119. Austin was very angry with Dimmitt's actions and on November 18 ordered Dimmitt removed from his command with no hearing.Huson (1974), p. 122. Viesca and his men journeyed to San Felipe de Austin, where the Consultation also refused to recognize his authority.Huson (1974), p. 123.

Brooklyn Museum was a designer of ukiyo-e style Japanese woodblock prints. He first studied with his father, Eiji, a minor painter of the Kan≈ç school. He then studied with Suzuki Nanrei (1775‚Äì1844), an artist of the Shij≈ç school. He is believed to have also studied with the ukiyo-e artist Totoya Hokkei (1790‚Äì1850). He produced numerous woodblock prints of beautiful women in the 1830s, but then abandoned printmaking in favor of painting. This artist should not be confused with Harukawa Eizan, an ukiyo-e print designer who was active in the 1790s. Eizan was the most prolific, longest-lived and ultimately the best of the late followers of Utamaro, who attempted to carry on the master's bijin style after his death in 1806. Along with Kikumaro, Tsukimaro and Utamaro II, Eizan has generally been dismissed by connoisseurs as a plagiarist of Utamaro's late style, but his work in fact develops, like that of most ukiyo-e artists, from a close identification with a leading master to a studied independence, and contains pieces of remarkable beauty and interest. ukiyo-e artists with whom he is often associated, Eizan was not an actual pupil of Kitagawa Utamaro, but studied originally with his father, Kikugawa Eiji, a Kano style painter and fan maker, and later with the Shijo artist Suzuki Nanrei and the Hokusai pupil Hokkei. Few traces of this eclectic training can be seen in Eizan's early work, produced shortly after the death of Utamaro and for the most part in that master's style. In the following decade, however, as Eizan reached artistic maturity, he began to develop his own figural style, still focused for the most part on prints of beautiful women (bijin-ga). Eizan's work retains the sensitivities and lyricism that marks the Utamaro style, however, not following the earthier realism and more overt sensuality of Kunisada and Ikeda Eisen . Eizan, like Toyokuni I in actor prints, is the last manifestation of the classical ukiyo-e style in bijin work, with harmonious colors and graceful lines and subjects. After him, one senses the introduction of a different aesthetic, with harsher colors, angular lines and less ethereal material, more of an emphasis, in sum, on the material weight of earthly life, rather than its transformation into something of elegance. With Eizan, the alchemy of elegance is still alive, and in his best work, properly produced, he can cast a magic glow over the forms of the world and create lightness and grace. He is also left-handed, which was strange at such a time in Japan. References * Lane, Richard. (1978). Images from the Floating World, The Japanese Print.

It can also be understood as a form of digital puppetry. It is the first open source platform designed specifically for avatar performances. History and context Screengrab from \\"Indigenous Maniacs\\", a performance created by UpStage workshop participants at the Computing Women's Congress, Waikato University (NZ), February 2006.UpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer Douglas Bagnall, to realise the vision of cyberformance troupe Avatar Body Collision; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of Creative New Zealand and the NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology; it was launched on 9 January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body Collision. In 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the Auckland University of Technology began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software. Also in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the New Zealand Film Archive and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12-hour period on 7 July 2007. A second festival was held on 080808 (8‚Äì9 August 2008), this time covering an 18-hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online. Following this, festivals were held annually on the successive monthly dates until 121212 (12 December 2012) when the festival extended over a period of one week and included cyberformance in UpStage and other online platforms. A number of works from previous festivals were restaged as a retrospective programme within the festival. Although \\"131313\\" was not possible, the tenth birthday of UpStage was celebrated 13 months after 121212, with a mini- festival of three performances and a meeting to discuss the future of UpStage. At this point, UpStage was unfunded and sustained by volunteers and the (also voluntary) work of the AUT student team. The meeting took place physically in Wellington, New Zealand, and online participants joined via UpStage. Everyone agreed that the project should continue - somehow - and also agreed that the software itself needs to be completely redeveloped, in order to take advantage of newer technologies and be more easily developed and maintained by globally dispersed open source developers. Features of UpStage Screengrab from the cyberformance \\"We have a situation - Peopoly\\", performed online in UpStage and at De Bibliotheek Eindhoven on 18 April 2013.As a web-based server-side application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind firewalls may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the Flash player plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser. \\"Players\\" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a \\"workshop\\" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create \\"stages\\", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using text2speech), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance. Audience members (also known as \\"chatters\\") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud. Newcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible. The chat interface encourages playful banter and audience members contribute to and embellish the performance via the chat. The media used in UpStage performances is created outside of UpStage, using graphic or audio software. Once optimised for Upstage, it is then uploaded via the web interface known as the Workshop and becomes available to everyone who has a log in for that particular UpStage server. UpStage is an open source project; it can be downloaded from the GitHub site and installed on a web server, giving control over who has log-in access. The interface can also be customised.

The words of the poem have since been adopted as a Christian hymn. Origin and authorship Montgomery wrote \\"The Stranger and His Friend\\" in December 1826 while travelling in England on extended trips in horse-drawn carriages. Montgomery did not write the poem with the intention of it being set to music. New York City preacher George Coles set the poem to music he wrote. The hymn was adopted by some Christian congregations in the United States and the United Kingdom. Historical connection with Latter Day Saints \\"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief\\" was a favorite hymn of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The hymn was introduced in the church by apostle John Taylor, who learned the hymn in 1840 as a missionary in England. Taylor included the hymn in the Latter Day Saints' Manchester Hymnal, which was used in England from 1840 to 1912. The hymn was also included in the church's 1841 hymnal published in Nauvoo, Illinois. Unlike the version in the Manchester Hymnal, the hymn in the Nauvoo hymnal included music composed by Taylor. The hymn was originally written as a Christmas hymn. On the afternoon that Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob in prison in Carthage, Illinois, the Smiths requested Taylor sing the hymn twice.B. H. Roberts (ed., 1902). History of the Church, vol. 6, pp. 614‚Äì615; vol. 7, p. 101. After he became president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Taylor asked Ebenezer Beesley to compose new music for the hymn. The results were published in the church's 1889 hymnal, and the hymn has been included in every subsequent edition of the church's hymnal. In the LDS Church's 1985 English-language hymnal, it is hymn number 29.\\"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief\\", Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1985), no. 29. The original tune Taylor sang before the martyrdom became lost in the years following Taylor's death. In 2008, a descendant of Taylor found the original tune in the notebook of Beesley, and then shared his findings with historian Jeffrey N. Walker. Walker then published his arrangement of the hymn with the tune as it was sung to Beesley.

The church building is located in Station Road, Banchory, Kincardineshire, Scotland. The church today serves the east parish of the town of Banchory in Royal Deeside. History Over 1,500 years ago, Saint Ternan brought Christianity to Banchory with the erection of a monastery. As well as preaching the Christian gospel, he and his followers taught the local people farming, arts, and crafts. In AD 1143, the Abbot of Arbroath received a grant of land from William the Lion which extended as far as Banchory. A new settlement was created near the churchyard, and a church, school, and houses were built.About Banchory - A New Descriptive and Historical Guide, Dr Gordon Walkden, 1987 From that period there was a continuous Christian presence in Banchory with several churches being built in succession. One such church was opened in 1664/65; the bell from this church now hangs in the old Watchtower in the graveyard. That church was demolished and a new one built in 1775, but it proved to be too small for the growing congregation and was dismantled in 1824. The stones were used in the construction of the present church in 1825.Banchory Ternan East Parish Church 175th Anniversary Booklet The 1825 church John Smith was the architect of Banchory Ternan East Church, and his 1825 plans showing the seating arrangements for the heritors and their tenants are held by the congregation. The style of the building is very typical of his work: the ogee profile of the coping stones on the front boundary wall is his personal \\"trade mark\\" being found on most of his buildings. John Smith (1781‚Äì1852), known as \\"Tudor Johnie\\", was Aberdeen's first city architect. Most of his churches are in the Perpendicular Gothic style; Udny and Nigg are not unlike Banchory, while Aberdeen South in Belmont Street (now a theme pub), St Clement's in Footdee (closed), and Fourdon (=Auchenblae) Parish Church are more grandiose exercise of the same genre. The most interesting features of Banchory Ternan are its tower and the windows of the main church building. Like most towers built by Smith, it comprises four storeys entrance porch, gallery, belfry and clock stage, all surmounted by a castellated parapet with corner pinnacles. In Banchory, Smith has placed the clock stage topmost ‚Äî it usually appears between the gallery and belfry levels ‚Äî the restricted height of the tower may have dictated this. Here too, the pinnacles are small, purely decorative unlike the larger, structural and often highly decorated examples quoted above. The windows of the sanctuary are in a Georgian Gothic style having the main outlines of the Perpendicular form but infilled with clear glazed casements in the Georgian manner. Substantial buttresses (to withstand the outward pressure of the side galleries) and corner pinnacles strengthen and enhance the otherwise plain exterior. Internally, little of Smith's influence remains ‚Äî the removal of the side galleries gives the church a squarish rather than an elongated Gothic \\"feel\\". However the four iron pillars supporting the remaining back gallery are identical with those in Fordoun Church, and seem original. The Chancel, an addition of 1928‚Äì30, echoes Smith's style in a somewhat lighter vein. The finely moulded chancel arch contains and sets off the excellent stained glass and the crisply detailed woodwork of the organ case and wall panels.Architectural notes prepared by Mr Norman Marr C.St J., FRIAS, ARIBA  Ministers  *Robert Stainforth 1262 *Sir Alexander Symnson 1484 *Sir Andrew Symson 1497 ‚Äî was minister in the diocese of Brechin and was presented with \\"the perpetual vicarage of the Parish of Banchory St Ternan\\" by the monastery of Arbroath *Rev James Reid (1567‚Äì1602) ‚Äî His charge included Banchory and Strachen.

History  With the constitution of the Israelitsche Cultus-Gemeinde (official Jewish Community) in 1852, the shul was established. The first rabbi was Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Spitzer (d. 1894) who was elected in 1852. He was a son in law of the Chasam Sofer 1763-1839 (Rabbi Moshe Sofer). As such, the community had a direct connection to the Pressburg Orthodox Community. As the liberal contingent grew in influence Rabbi Spitzer led the observant Orthodox secessionist congregation to a new location, which was built from 1858 to 1864. The new synagogue counted 750 seats (500 for men, 250 for women). Rabbi Yeshaya Fuerst (d. 1943), succeeded Rabbi Spitzer in 1894. He was a disciple of the Ksav Sofer 1815-1872 (Rabbi Avrohom Shmuel Binyamin Sofer) and he too had close ties to the Pressburg Orthodox Community. The Cantor of the shul prior to the Holocaust was Avrohom Braun, who was hired in 1922.http://www.ajn.com.au/news/news.asp?pgID=6245 The shamash (sexton) was Reb Hersh Lipschutz, who immigrated to the US, where he was active in the Vienner Shul.Interview on June 7, 2009, in Brooklyn, New York, with Rabbi Hersh M. Ginsberg, who lived in Vienna as a child before the Holocaust With the approach of the Holocaust and the Anschluss, on March 1938, Rabbi Fuerst fled for his life from Vienna and died in England in 1943.http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/31737/Rabbi_Gershon_Tannenbaum_My_Machberes.html Some members of the persecuted community succeeded in reaching America and settled in Williamsburg. These refugees reestablished a kernel of the Vienner community in the then Agudath Israel headquarters on Bedford Avenue on May 15, 1941. They named the new congregation Khal Adas Yereim and invested great energy in its development. Like its antecedent, the Congregation prayed in Nusach Ashkenaz. In 1948 the Vienner Shul moved to a new building on Rodney and South 5th Street, and appointed Rabbi Yonasan Steif as its Rabbi. Due to the community's growth they moved in the mid 50s to a larger building on 27 Lee Avenue.http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/31737/Rabbi_Gershon_Tannenbaum_My_Machberes.html Today the Williamsburg congregation bears little resemblance to its predessor due to the mostly Chassidic nature of the community.

The namesake of his landowner father, he was the younger brother of Stephen of Thornham. Robert made his reputation in connection with the conquest of Cyprus in 1191 during the Third Crusade. On order of King Richard I, he led half the fleet in that battle. Subsequently, he was responsible for controlling the island when the Crusaders moved on, first jointly with Richard de Camville and then independently, when he defeated a group of Cypriot rebels.Gillingham, 152. After he left Cyprus, Robert became more closely identified with Richard I. As the king's familiaris, he carried Richard's equipment from the Holy Land to England. When Richard I was captured in 1192 in Vienna, among the terms of his release was the presentation of men to stand as \\"pledges\\" that the ransom would be paid. Robert was among these hostages,Gillingham, 248. though evidently not for long, as he was back by the king's side in 1194 at Poitiers. Appointed Seneschal of Anjou,Sources do not agree on the date of this appointment. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, cited below, estimates this appointment ca. 1194. The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England states the appointment had been made by Henry II, who died in 1189, a view echoed by Sidney Painter in The Reign of King John. ; . he served in France with Richard I, primarily in Anjou and Normandy, throughout the rest of Richard's reign. At around the same time, he was also appointed High Sheriff of Surrey, but he did not return to England until after Richard's death. In 1196, he led troops at Richard's behest into Brittany on an unsuccessful attempt to capture the child Duke of Brittany Arthur, whose mother Constance was resistant to Richard's control. In 1197, King Richard arranged for Robert to marry Isabella Fossard, daughter and heiress of the powerful Yorkshire baron William Fossard. The Fossard inheritance included the castle, honor, and lordship of Mulgrave with 34.5 attached knight's fees. Robert was not with Richard at the siege of Ch√¢teau de Chalus-Chabrol in 1199, where Richard died, and after Richard's death became an important source of information about the activities of the king.Gillingham, 82, 329. After Richard's death, Robert ceremonially transferred Chinon castle to the new king, Richard's brother John.Gillingham, 335. He traveled with John in Normandy and England for several years before he was appointed the Seneschal of Anjou and of Gascony in 1201. For the next several years he was troubled by conflict with the French and by rebellious barons in Poitou, which caused him to limit his efforts to his northern territories. In 1203, he made an effort to regain the city of Angers from the French, but though he partially destroyed the city he was unsuccessful and was captured. Ransomed in 1205, he continued to serve John, travelling with him during the Anjou campaign of 1206. From 1205 to 1207 he focused on his service as High Sheriff of Surrey before returning in 1207 to France as Seneschal of Poitou. He died on 26 April 1211 with the Bishop of Winchester at his deathbed.

In 2005, she became tenured as a full-time professor where she is now the manager of Accounting Studies as well as the section coordinator for Accounting, Finance and Information Systems. She is also the Secretary-Treasurer for the Association of Professors at the University of Ottawa and VP Communications for the Canadian Academic Accounting Association. Bujaki's primary activities are accounting and organizational behavior research. Education Queen's University Douglas Library In 1985, Bujaki graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree majoring in Psychology. In 1988, she received her Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from Queen's University with a specialization in Accounting. In 1996, Bujaki graduated with her PhD degree with a dissertation topic related to Accounting and Organizational Behavior. She obtained her PhD from Queen's University. Although Bujaki spends a great deal of her time in research, some of her teaching interests include Auditing, Financial Statement Analysis, Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting and Gender Issues in Management. Work experience Telfer School of Management Desmarais Building After graduating from her MBA program, Bujaki joined the Toronto office of international accounting firm Price Waterhouse. From 1988-1991, Bujaki worked in the Toronto office with Independent Business Service and the Mississauga office with general audit and assurance services. In 1989, she passed her Uniform Evaluation (UFE) and obtained her Chartered Accountant designation one year later. Throughout her academic career, she has worked on consulting projects for the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). She has also served as a seminar leader and case reviewer for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario (ICAO) School of Accountancy. Research Interests and Publications Dr.Bujaki's research interests are primarily concentrated in four areas. They include measurement and validity issues in accounting research, annual report disclosures, women in management and the work-family interface. Bujaki's articles have been published in many journals, including the Journal of Accounting Literature, Canadian Accounting Perspectives, Women in Management Review and Applied Psychology: An International Review. She has also published articles in profession-based periodicals such as CA Magazine and CMA Magazine. Currently, she is focused on researching accounting and managerial perspectives for the development of the Rideau Canal. Disclosure Practices Bujaki and fellow researcher, Bruce McConomy, have found that most public companies will voluntary disclose their governance practices based on strategic factors. These strategic factors will affect the choice of disclosure medium (annual report vs management information circular) as well as extent of the disclosure. Some strategic factors include cost-benefit considerations, firm risk, and the number of external directors in a firm's board of directors.Bujaki, M. and McConomy, B. (2002). Corporate Governance: Factors Influencing Voluntary Disclosure by Publicly Traded Canadian Firms. Canadian Accounting Perspectives, 29(1): 105-139 Bujaki and McConomy have also found that extensive disclosures are made after a governance failure, implying that disclosure practices are based on a reactive approach rather than proactive approach. Women in Management Bujaki and fellow researcher, Carol McKeen, published an insightful article entitled Hours Spent on Household Tasks by Business School Graduates. Bujaki and McKeen's findings suggest that household and family responsibilities negatively affect a woman's career success more than a male's career success. They also notice that the presence of children significantly increases time spent on household activities. With children, household tasks grows from 3 hours a week to 10 hours a week for male graduates while for female graduates it grows from 10 hours a week to 20 hours a week.Bujaki, M. and McKeen, C. (1998). Hours Spent on Household Tasks by Business School Graduates. Women in Management Review, 13(3): 105-114 Bujaki and McKeen suggest that organizational initiatives and changes in expectations within family and society are needed to effectively accommodate a graduates career success and their household responsibilities. Rideau Canal In 2007, Bujaki received a $27,886 Research Development Initiatives grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). This grant was given for her research program of the accounting and management history of the Rideau Canal. The report program is entitled The Rideau Waterway: Management, Accounting, Governance and Accountability and will study the evolution of management practices over the life of the canal.

It is managed under a Deed of Grant in Trust under the Local Government (Community Government Areas) Act 2004. History The area originally was set up as the Mitchell River Mission in 1916. Aboriginal people from the region were gradually drawn from their traditional lands into the mission settlement. Language groups associated with countries in the Kowanyama region are Yir- Yoront, Yirrk Thangalkl, Koko Bera and Kunjen (Uw Oykangand and Olkola dialects). Kunjen (also known as Koko Wanggara, Ngundjan and Olkola) is a language of Western Cape York. The Kunjen language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Kowanyama Community Council and Cook Shire Council. Yir Yiront (also known as Yiront, Jirjoront, Yir-yiront, and Kokomindjan) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is in Western Cape York within the local government areas of Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama and Shire of Cook, in the catchments of the Coleman River and Mitchell River. Following the removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, it is also spoken in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama. In 1967 the Anglican church were no longer able to sustain their activities in the area as a Church Mission. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a government department, under the Act continued running the affairs of the community. On 23 July 1987, under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984, a Deed of Grant in Trust was given to the Kowanyama community over the lands in the Mitchell River delta. Like other DOGIT communities of the time, Kowanyama had a town Council elected by Aboriginal people living in the community. The newly formed Kowanyama Council assumed responsibility for implementing certain conditions of the DOGIT. Seven elected Aboriginal residents hold three year terms in office. Responsibilities As the Shire operates under the Local Government Act 2009, the Shire Council's responsibilities are the generally the same as other local government in remote Queensand including for fisheries, alcohol management and even operation of some commercial enterprises.

The name \\"Raymerville\\" came from the community's major collector road, Raymerville Drive. The name \\"Markville\\" came from the local major shopping mall, Markville Shopping Centre. The community is referred to as \\"Markville East\\" because it is located immediately east of Markville Shopping Centre. It is also one of the very few communities in Markham that has a declined population when compared to the population in the 2001 census. Demography For areas west of Springdale Park, For areas east of Springdale Park, History The first family who settled in the area was the Ramer family.cf. Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793-1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), 50-52. They farmed the land around the school built in 1986 known as Ramer Wood Public School which was named after them. From this, the naming of the street \\"Raymerville Drive\\" came to be. The land is known for the Neilson milk company (formerly Nelson). Boundaries The northern boundary of the community is located at 16th Avenue. The southern boundary is at Bullock Drive. Its western boundary is at McCowan Road. The eastern boundary is at Robinson river. Education This region is home to Ramer Wood Public School and Saint Edwards Catholic School. Although there are no secondary schools in the area, students in Raymerville - Markville East generally attend either Markville Secondary School or Brother Andre Catholic High School. Transportation Public transit The area is serviced by York Region Transit (YRT) Route 41 Markham Local, Route 45 Mingay and Route 301 Markham Express, providing easy access to Finch GO Bus Terminal. Centennial and Markham GO Stations serve the community, though geographically they are not located within the community's boundaries. Also the community is serviced on the boundary by Route 129A McCowan Road North and Route 85 16th Ave. Raymerville Drive Raymerville Drive is a major collector contour-shaped road that forms the backbone of the community. Most of the community residents rely on Raymerville Drive to get them to major arterial roads such as McCowan Road and Main Street Markham. Raymerville Drive forms an U-shape, spanning across the community's eastern end to its western end. The road connects to Carlton Road on its southwestern end, and Manhattan Drive on its northwestern end. The Carlton- Raymerville corridor is one of the most important road corridors in Markham as this corridor spans large portions of the city, including the communities of Unionville and Raymerville - Markville East, and consequently, serves a large population within the city. Raymerville Drive has two lanes throughout its entire route, and is part of the Neighbourhood Traffic Calming Zone program. The program is put in effect to discourage heavy traffic utilizing the corridor to connect from McCowan Road to Main Street. Parks The community is home to 4 parks: Raymerville Woodlot Park, Raybeck Park, Springdale Park, and Stargell Park. In November 2010 the soccer field at Raybeck park has been under construction for a sprinkler system. Many of the community are upset that the city started construction on this project so close to winter. Construction was put on hold a week after started due to the first snowfall of the winter. Roads Raymerville-Markville East consists mainly of suburban streets, many of which have speed humps, which is a part of Markham's plan to calm traffic. The main roads that connect the people that live in the community to the rest of Markham are Raymerville Drive and Cairns Drive. The roads in the community consists of Adrian Crescent, Beck Drive, Bendamere Crescent, Black Cherry Drive, Brookbank Court, Burwell Crescent, Crandall Drive, Graham Crescent, Hemlock Drive, Hickory Drive, Higginson Street, Mercer Crescent, Stargell Crescent, Strathmore Crescent, Sunway Square, Tunney Crescent, and White Ash Drive. Shopping There is a small community shopping centre located at the corner of Raymerville Drive and McCowan Road. The shopping centre is named Raymerville Square (Traditional Chinese: Ê¶ÆÂà©‰∏≠ÂøÉ). This shopping centre is also home to the Raymerville Bakery with its Italian influences reminiscent of the old demographic which lived in Rayerville- Markville East. Controversy The community is not formally known as Raymerville - Markville East. It is not referenced on atlases or maps of the City of Markham, for example, the MapArt Atlas does not illustrate the community's name. The community is often known as part of the community of Markham Village.

It is similar in appearance to Bombus muscorum, and is replacing the species in Northern Britain.  Description  The thorax of the common carder bee is either yellowish or reddish-brown in color. The hair of the first four abdominal segments are gray in color, while the hair of the fifth and sixth terga are yellowish or reddish-brown in color. The body length of queens ranges from 15 to 18 mm (0.59 to 0.71 in) in length. The body length of female workers ranges from 9 to 15 mm (0.35 to 0.59 in) in length. The body length of males range from 12 to 14 mm (0.47 to 0.55 in) in length. Queens measure 28 to 32 mm (1.1 to 1.3 in) from wing to wing. Workers measure 24 to 27 mm (0.94 to 1.06 in) from wing to wing. Drones measure 24 to 27 mm (0.94 to 1.06 in) from wing to wing. The head of the common carder bee is of medium length and the snout is long compared to other species of bumblebee. The snout of the queen ranges between 13 and 15 mm (0.51 to 0.59 in) in length. The snout of workers range from 12 to 13 mm (0.47 and 0.51 in) in length. The snout of drones range from 10 to 11 mm (0.39 to 0.43 in) in length.  Colony cycle  Queens appear between early April and mid-May, and workers appear at the end of April/early May to mid-October. Young queens and drones can be found from mid-August to late October. When queens search for suitable places to nest, they fly just above the vegetation, for example on forest edges, investigating cavities such as holes in the ground or niches in dead wood and grass. The nests can be constructed above or under ground, preferably in old mouse nests, but also in bird nests, barns, and sheds. Nest-building proceeds as follows. The queen collects moss and grass to form a small, hollow sphere whose walls are partly bonded with wax and sealed off. Within this is formed a large bowl of brown wax of about 5 mm in diameter, which is filled with pollen. Thereafter, five to 15 eggs are deposited, and the cell closed. Another 20-mm-high cup is then filled with nectar, thus serving as its own food reserve for bad weather days. After three to five days, the larvae hatch to feed on the pollen. After about a week, the larvae are mature. The adult worker bees, owing to the initially poor supply situation, are relatively small, reaching only about half the body length of the queen and lacking functioning ovaries. Later-hatching bees are much larger. The additional nesting and brood care is dedicated solely to the queen, which no longer leaves the nest. From August, rarely before, the first fully developed females, together with drones, are ready. Drones hatch from unfertilized eggs. In August the B. pascuorum nest, with a diameter of up to , reaches a maximum population size from 60 to 150 individuals. Shortly after this peak, the population quickly decreases. With the queen the entire nest dies, usually in September. Occasionally, individuals survive until October/November. Only the last-hatched females survive, to mate with males. Then they fly in search of a safe place for hibernation.  Foraging  The common carder bee is polylectic, feeding on a variety of wild flowers, including nettles (Urticaceae), genuine motherwort (Lamiaceae), Himalayan balsam (Balsaminaceae), cabbage thistle, knapweed (Asteraceae), vetches, red and white clover (Fabaceae), monkshood (Ranunculaceae), fruit trees, etc. Gallery File:Bombus_pascuorum_Zurich_front.jpg File:Bombus_pascuorum_Zurich_lateral.jpg File:Bourdon des champs Face.jpg File:Bourdon des champs global.jpg References * Goulson, D. et al.

They were known for their early use of 9-foot lances, and were called \\"Rush's Lancers.\\" History The regiment was raised during August and September 1861 from companies raised in Philadelphia, Montgomery and Berks counties by Richard H. Rush, who had been authorized to do so by Governor Curtin. Rush was appointed colonel of the regiment, with John H. M'Arthur as lieutenant colonel and C. Ross Smith and Robert Morris, Jr., as majors. At the suggestion of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, the men were armed with Austrian lances. After several weeks of training in Philadelphia, the regiment was transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to the Cavalry Division of the Army of the Potomac. Members of the regiment in 1862 The regiment served with the army during the Peninsula Campaign and Maryland Campaign, skirmishing many times but seeing no heavy fighting. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, it served as the provost guard for the Center Grand Division, guarding the bridges to the grand division's rear. It was absent during the Battle of Chancellorsville, participating instead in Stoneman's Raid. In the May 1863, the regiment was rearmed with Sharps carbines and assigned to the Reserve Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. It fought in the Gettysburg Campaign and Mine Run Campaign. During the Battle of Brandy Station in June 1863, the regiment (led by Major Robert Morris, Jr.) unsuccessfully charged the guns at St. James Church, suffering the greatest casualties of any regiment in the battle. Several Confederates later described the 6th's charge as the most \\"brilliant and glorious\\" cavalry charge of the war. (In many Civil War battles, cavalrymen typically dismounted once they reached an engagement and fought essentially as infantry. But in this battle, the surprise and chaos led to a mostly mounted fight.)NPS; Loosbrock, p. 272; Kennedy, p. 204; Salmon, pp. 194, 198; Eicher, p. 492. The following year, it fought in the Overland Campaign and Sheridan's Valley Campaign among the Valley Campaigns of 1864. In September, the regiment's original enlistments expired, and the unit was reorganized for an additional three years. Following the Appomattox Campaign, it was ordered to Washington, D.C., where it was consolidated with the 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry and 17th Pennsylvania Cavalry to form the 2nd Pennsylvania Provisional Cavalry. The combined regiment was sent to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out in August 1865. The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry had one Medal of Honor Recipient: Captain Frank Furness, commander of Company F. During the Battle of Trevillian Station (June 11‚Äì12, 1864), Furness \\"Voluntarily carried a box of ammunition across an open space swept by the enemy's fire to the relief of an outpost whose ammunition had become almost exhausted, but which was thus enabled to hold its important position,\\" according to the citation for the medal, awarded on October 20, 1899.

Both these stations were closed in 2006 while the Kols√•s Line was being upgraded from a light rail to a rapid transit. Bj√∏rnsletta is from Stortinget. History The station, looking westwards The first station named Bj√∏rnsletta opened with the connection from the Kols√•s Line to the R√∏a Line on 15 June 1942. It was originally called Sletta, meaning \\"The Plain\\", but the ministry protested and felt that the name was too generic. Since bears had been spotted in the area in 1852, it was decided to name it Bj√∏rnsletta, meaning \\"The Bear Plain\\". A lower secondary school named Bj√∏rnsletta was opened in 1981, though that school is located closer to the √Ösjordet Station. In 2006, the Kols√•s Line was closed for renovations. Although connected to the Oslo Metro, the line had been built as a light rail and still had overhead wires, level crossings, low platforms and lacked automatic train protection. The upgrade allowed the metro to replace the aging T1300 trains with the new MX3000, and have longer six-car trains. The construction was managed by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, who also owns the station. After the closing of Lysakerelven, Bj√∏rnsletta is the last station on the Kols√•s Line in Oslo, with the next station, Jar, being located in B√¶rum. The official opening of the station took place on 17 August 2010 by Mayor Fabian Stang, and the station will remain the terminal station of Line 6 until December, when Jar is scheduled to open.

This name has been widely used for a range of nearly identical-looking or cryptic species of bumblebees. In 1983, Scholl and Obrecht even coined the term Bombus lucorum complex to explain the three taxa (B. lucorum, Bombus magnus, and Bombus cryptarum) that cannot be easily differentiated from one another by their appearances. A recent review of all of these species worldwide has helped to clarify its distribution in Europe and northern Asia, almost to the Pacific. B. lucorum reaches the Barents Sea in the North. However, in southern Europe, although found in Greece it is an upland species with its distribution never quite reaching the Mediterranean. Compared to other bumblebee species, the individuals of B. lucorum have shorter tongues, and this characteristic enable them to rob nectar. The worker bee uses the horny sheath around its tongue to make a hole through the flower, reaching the nectar without entering the flower. Therefore, the worker bee does not come in contact with the pollen while getting the nectar.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  Bombus lucorum is part of the order Hymenoptera which consists of ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies, and the family Apidae which comprises bees. It is also part of the genus Bombus which consists of bumblebees, and the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto, which contains five species in Europe: B. terrestris, B. sporadicus, B. lucorum, B. magnus, and B. cryptarum. B. lucorum is closely related to B. terrestris, B. cryptarum, and B. magnus, with only few subtle differences in their morphologies.  Description and identification   Queens, males, and workers  Bombus lucorum is a large bumblebee, with the queen having a length of , a wingspan of around , and a weight of 0.46-0.70 g. The workers are smaller than the queens, with a length of 12‚Äì18 mm and weight of 0.04-0.32 g. The males are 16-18mm in size and differ more in their appearance from the queens with their yellow noses and larger amounts of yellow hairs. The species has a short proboscis. The predominant color is black, with a pale yellow collar, a yellow band on the second tergite (abdominal segment), and a white tail. Both darker and paler forms exist. The males vary in color more than the females. The darker males are mostly found in northernmost Fennoscandia, southwestern Norway, and on the island of Gotland in the Baltic.  Nests  The nests of B. lucorum can be found underground and may be very large, containing up to 400 workers. Often, they are abandoned nests of old mice or vole. In the nest, the queen makes a circular chamber where she builds a wax egg cell in which she lays her first batch of eggs. The eggs are laid on a layer of pollen and then covered again with a wax layer.Free, J.B & Butler, C. G (1959) The New Naturalist: Bumblebees. Collins, London. In the United Kingdom, where the species is very common, they prefer to have their nests facing south for extra warmth.  Distribution and habitat  Bombus lucorum is distributed widely and can be found in the Palearctic (including Japan), Oriental, Arctic, and western Nearctic realms. It is more common in more northern parts. It also can be found in Iceland, where it was probably introduced by humans, and Britain. Its habitats include coastal, farmland, grassland, heathland, towns, gardens, upland, and woodland edges. The species can be found most anywhere where there are flowers for food.  Colony  Bombus lucorum is one of the first species of bumblebees to emerge from hibernation. The hibernating queen emerges as early as February, but in southern Britain, they usually emerge in March. They usually can be found flying near the ground, looking for holes that are suitable for their new nests. They will also forage on flowers to create reserves for their new nests. They will have pollen loads on their hindlegs when they are ready to establish a colony. The workers start to emerge sometime between late March and mid May. A colony can have as many as 400 workers. The males emerge later, starting in August. As in many other bumblebee species, the males fly in a low patrolling circuit, depositing pheromones on grass to attract young queens. The new queens mate with these males, and when the old queen and the males die in Autumn, they hibernate to start the colony cycle again the next spring  Mating   Female/male interactions  During their pre-mating behavior, males scent-mark prominent objects in their flight paths with a species- specific sex pheromone. Then, they fly along these paths, showing patrolling behavior, in order to mate with females that come to the path due to their attraction to the pheromone.  Pheromones  Males produce pheromones in the cephalic part of the labial gland, and they mark objects in their flight paths with the volatile components of the gland secretion. This secretion is a complex mixture of sixty compounds of which 53% is ethyl (z)-tetradec-9-enoate, ethyl esters of fatty acids. Other components include ethyl dodecanoate (6%), ethyl tetradecanoate (2%), ethyl (Z)-hexadec-9-enoate (4%), ethyl (Z)-octadec-9-enoate (2%), hexadecan-1-ol (4%), (Z,Z,Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trien-1-ol (1%), and (Z)-hexadec-7-enal (2%). The biosynthetic pathway of the pheromones is not well known, but it was suggested that they are produced from common lipids in the body. Young and old males of B. lucorum have similar quantities of labial gland secretions because the secretory activity continues throughout their lifetime with no dependence on age.  Relatedness to other species   Bombus lucorum complex  The term \\"Bombus lucorum complex\\" was coined by Scholl and Obrecht in 1983 to explain the complex of three taxa (B. lucorum, Bombus magnus, and Bombus cryptarum) that cannot be easily differentiated from one another by their morphological characteristics. However, they can be distinguished using mitochondrial gene sequences and male pheromones. For example, B. lucorum can be identified by its main substance of the male labial gland secretion called ethyl tetradec-9-enoate. = Bombus magnus = Bombus magnus queens are bigger than B. lucorum queens in their size. Also, the size of their yellow collar on thorax are larger than those of B. lucorum queens. However, the workers of the two species are basically indistinguishable. = Bombus cryptarum = Similar to B. magnus, the yellow collar of B. cryptarum extends further below the wing than that of B. lucorum. Also, it has a thin \\"S\\"-shaped line of black hairs through its yellow collar. In addition, the queens of B. cryptarum emerge before B. magnus or B. lucorum during the colony initiation.  Bombus terrestris  Bombus lucorum was separated from B. terrestris in the beginning of 20th century because of their morphological differences, male labial gland secretions, and mitochondrial DNA markers. While the workers of B. terrestris and B. lucorum are basically indistinguishable by their appearances as the queens of the two species have few identifiable differences in their morphologies. At the end of the abdomen, B. terrestris queens have orange hairs while those of B. lucorum have white hairs, from which their common name originated. Also, the yellow thorax hairs of B. terrestris have a tint of dull orange while those of B. lucorum are more lemon yellow in color. The width of the collar in B. terrestris workers is narrower than that in B. lucorum workers, and B. terrestris have very small dots in the ocellus- orbital-area and in the surface structure of the second tergite rim. However, all these morphological differences are too subtle to be reliable in differentiating between the two species, and only by using their genetic characteristics can they be identified reliably.  Chinese Bombus lucorum  A species of bumblebees called B. lucorum in China is not the same species as B. lucorum in Europe. The labial gland secretions of male bumblebees can be divided into two different types according to the biochemical pathways that synthesize the compounds. The two types are PP type secretions that contain only fatty acid derivatives and PP + MAP type secretions that contain fatty acid derivatives and mevalonic acid derivatives in the form of acyclic diterpenes. It was found that the European B. lucorum contains PP type secretions while Chinese B. lucorum contains PP + MAP type secretions. They would be very difficult to tell apart solely on their morphological characteristics but they can be identified according to the different types of male labial gland secretions.  Interaction with other species   Parasites  B. bohemicus is a species of cuckoo bees that lay eggs in the nest of a host species. B. lucorum often become the host for B. bohemicus, and because B. lucorum is fairly common in Europe, B. bohemicus also does well there.  Diet  After the queens emerge from their hibernation, they forage on flowers including crocus, Erica, Mahonia, white and red deadnettles, Prunus, flowering currant and bluebells. However, the bees forage on many other flowers, including many garden plants, such as lavender, Hebe, Rhododendron, deadnettles, thistles, and vetches, as well as ceanothus, wall flower, campanula, privet, sage, Hypericum, bramble, red bartsia, clovers, lupins, honeysuckle, sedum, knapweed, Buddleia, viper's bugloss, and trefoils, and comfrey. = Nectar robbing = Compared to other bumblebee species, the individuals of B. lucorum have short tongues. Therefore, they tend to forage on flowers with short corollas and daisy-type flowers. However, because of their shorter tongues, they also developed a method of \\"robbing nectar.\\" To rob nectar, the worker uses the horny sheath around its tongue to make a hole through the flower. Then, it will reach the nectar without entering the flower. By getting the nectar this way, the worker bee does not come in contact with the pollen and thus does not pollinate the flower. The flower is not only \\"robbed\\" of its nectar but also left with a hole for other insects to reach nectar as a result.

Early life Rashbehari Ghosh was born on 23 December 1845 at Torkona village in Khandaghosh area in Purba Bardhaman district in Bengal Presidency. He attended Burdwan Raj Collegiate School and Presidency College, Kolkata. He obtained a first class in the MA examination in English. In 1871, he passed with honours the Law examination and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws in 1884. Political career Ghosh became a member of the Indian National Congress and leaned towards the moderate wing. He had deep faith in progress but was opposed to radicalism in any form. He served as the President of the Congress for two terms. First in the 1907 Surat Session, succeeding Dadabhai Naoroji, after which the Congress split into Moderates and Extremists, and then the year after in Madras, 1908. Ghosh was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council (1891‚Äì94, 1906‚Äì9) and the Council of India. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1896 New Year Honours and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) in the 1909 Birthday Honours. He was knighted in the 1915 New Year Honours and conferred with his knighthood on 14 July of that year.

He made a fortune through his legal practice, but donated much of it by way of charity and endowments. In 1913, he established an endowment for scientific studies at Calcutta University with an initial capital of ten lakh rupees. He also donated 13 lakh rupees to establish a National Council of Education (NCE) at Jadavpur. It later became Jadavpur University. Ghosh was the first president of NCE. Sir Rashbehari Ghosh Mahavidyalaya was established at Ukhrid in Khandaghosh CD Block in 2010. He also established schools and hospital in his village.

Sayani and Nawab Syed Muhammad Bahadur) to become the President of Indian National Congress. One of his ancestors was the private tutor to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Hasan Imam's father was a professor of history at Patna College. By his first wife, Syed Hasan Imam had a son Syed Medhi Imam, educated at Harrow and Oxford University, a barrister of the Supreme Court of India and scholar of Latin and Greek. Hasan Imam also married an Indo-French lady, and Bulu Imam the human rights campaigner, and wildlife expert is their grandson. Regarded as one of India's finest barristers, some barristers such as Chittaranjan Das (C.R. Das) and H.D. Bose considered Hasan as the best barrister in British India. He is related to many other barristers besides those within his own immediate family including Sir Sultan Ahmed and Syed Abdal Aziz. Hasan Imam's Cambridge University educated nephew Syed Jafar Imam was also his son-in-law and later became a Supreme Court judge. Law and political career Hasan Imam, son of lmdad Imam, and younger brother of freedom fighter Sir Ali Imam, was born at Neora village, Patna district, Bihar on 31 August 1871. A Shia Muslim by faith, he belonged to a distinguished, educated landed family. After a course of schooling, interrupted frequently by ill-health, he left for England in July 1889 and joined the Middle Temple. While there, he campaigned actively for Dadabhai Naoroji during the General Election of England in 1891. He was called to the Bar in 1892; he returned home the same year and started law practice in the Calcutta High Court. Hasan Imam became a Judge of the Calcutta High Court in 1912. On the establishment of the Patna High Court in March 1916, Imam resigned the Judgeship of the Calcutta High Court and started practice at Patna. In 1921, he was nominated a Member of the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council. From 1908 onwards he took part in political affairs. In October 1909, he was elected President of the Bihar Congress Committee and in the next month he presided over the fourth session of the Bihar Students' Conference. He resumed political activity on a larger scale after resigning the Judgeship in 1916. Hasan Imam was one of the prominent Indian leaders who called upon Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, in November 1917 and was listed by him among \\"the real giants of the Indian Political World\\". He presided over the special session of the Indian National Congress held at Bombay, 1918, to consider the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms Scheme. It was an important, but difficult, session to handle because opinion was sharply divided on the merits of the scheme. Hasan Imam played a moderating role. It was his opinion, where he thought a hostile environment between Hindus and Muslims would make it impossible to achieve freedom from the British rule. A staunch constitutionalist, he was opposed to the ideology of the Non- cooperation movement. Hasan Imam took a leading part in the Khilafat Movement. He joined the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930 and was elected Secretary of the Swadeshi League formed in Patna. He actively campaigned for the boycott of foreign goods and use of Khaddar. Earlier in 1927, he \\"materially conduced to the success\\" of the boycott of the Simon Commission in Bihar. Hasan Imam was a strong advocate of social reforms, particularly the amelioration of the position of women and the depressed classes. As a member of the Tikari Board of Trustees, he promoted schemes for girls' education. He exposed the economic exploitation of the country, both under the Company and the Imperial rule. He was President of the Board of Trustees of the Biharee, the leading English daily of Bihar; he was also one of the founders of the succeeding Searchlight.

After immigrating to the United States in 1905, Finger settled in Houston, Texas in 1908, where he would remain for the duration of his life. Finger is best remembered for his role in bringing modern architecture to Texas. Early years Joseph Finger was born 7 March 1887 in Bielitz, Austria-Hungary to Henri Finger (1862-1941) and Hani Seifter (1870-1947). After finishing high school and technical training, he moved to the United States in 1905. Career Finger settled first in New Orleans in 1905, then moved to Houston, Texas in three years later. He found employment with C. D. Hill, an architecture firm based in Dallas, where he worked for about five years. Finger joined a series of architecture partnerships, starting with Green & Finger in 1913. At that firm, he designed the DeGeorge Hotel, located at the corner of Preston and Labranch. His second partership was with Lamar Q. Cato (Finger & Cato). After 1922, he worked independently. By the late 1920s, he established a robust business for hotel design, completing three hotels outside Houston, and the Auditorium Hotel, the Ben Milam Hotel, the Plaza Hotel, and the Texas State Hotel, all in Houston. Many of these hotels catered to wealthy residents with modern amenities such as air conditioning and running ide-water. All of these Houston hotels were still standing through the first part of 2012, when the Auditorium and Texas State still operated as hotels, the DeGeorge was used as a hotel for veterans, and the Plaza as a bank. By the end of 2012, however, the Ben Milam was taken down. While conservative style marked Finger's luxury hotels, some of his other buildings reflected Art Deco style. In 1925, he designed the Temple Beth Israel, more recently repurposed as a theater building for Houston Community College. His 1929 building, the Houston Turn-Verein Clubhouse, employed some Austrian-inspired \\"zig-zag\\" Art Deco elements. Meanwhile he was the artitect of over two dozen Art Deco grocery stores for the Weingarten chain. Though Finger established a practice of commercial architecture, he also designed many single-family residences, especially in the Riverside Terrace neighborhood in Houston. One of these was for Abe Weingarten. Jesse H. Jones contracted for his services for a mixed-use building to house the Houston Chamber of Commerce with a store front for Levy Brothers' Dry Goods, a collaboration with Alfred C. Finn. This design team later produced Jefferson Davis Hospital, which occupied a site more recently occupied by the Federal Reserve Building. From 1944 until his death in 1953, Finger worked in a partnership with George W. Rustay. Finger designed the 1939 Houston City Hall, designed in a stripped classical style. In response to criticism from Houston mayor R. H. Fonville, who wanted a style with more classical reference, Finger said, \\"Here in America we are rapidly developing our own type of architecture which is far above that of foreign countries. We are building for the masses, not the classes.\\" Above the lobby entrance of the City Hall is a stone relief of two men taming a wild horse, symbolizing a community coming together to form a government to tame the world around them. This sculpture, and the twenty-seven other friezes around the building, were carved by Beaumont artist Herring Coe and co-designer Raoul Josset. Personal life On June 18, 1913, Finger married Gertrude Levy (1891-1985), a Houston native. The couple had one son, Joseph Seifter Finger (1918-2003), who also practiced architecture. In Houston, Finger was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Houston Chamber of Commerce, Houston Turn-Verein, B'nai B'rith, and the Westwood Country Club. Death and legacy On 6 February 1953, a month short of his 66th birthday, Finger died in Houston. He is buried in Beth Israel Mausoleum in Beth Israel Cemetery.

He rose to prominence following his appeal against the charges alleging him to have instigated a Hindu ‚Äì Muslim riot in Salem (now in Tamil Nadu). The legal battle and eventual victory in proving his innocence earned him the title The Lion of South India. He entered politics as a member of the Salem Municipal Council in 1882. His prominence in the national media and friendship with Allan Octavian Hume, a civil servant and reformer, led him to be invited to the first sessions of the Indian National Congress. Once within the Congress, he rose to serve as its president in 1920. He played a key role in framing the Swaraj Constitution. He was part of the Propaganda Committee of the Congress and thus served in spreading the ideologies of the party to the masses. He also served as the president of Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist party, in 1931. Early years Vijayaraghavachariar was born on 18 June 1852 into an Iyengar Brahmin family in the village of Pon Vilaindha Kalathur, in the district of Chengalpattu in the state of Madras Presidency, in what was then the British Raj. His father, Sadagoparchariar, was a priest and raised his son as an orthodox religious believer. At a very early age, Vijayaraghavachariar was sent to a school in his village where he learned Sanskrit and the Vedas, the holy language and the scriptures of Hinduism. His English education began when he was twelve. He joined the Pachaiyappa High School and passed out in 1870, ranking second in the Madras Presidency, the province that included most of South India. He joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) the following year, graduated in 1875, and the same year was appointed a lecturer there. He was transferred to the Government College, Mangalore, and after three years resigned his post. Subsequently, he joined the Salem Municipal College as a lecturer in English and mathematics. Career as lawyer During his time in Salem Municipal College Vijayaraghavachariar took law examinations privately without attending formal classes, and qualified as a pleader in 1881. Salem riot In 1882, a short time after Vijayaraghavachariar had set up practice in Salem, a riot broke out in the city. Vijayaraghavachariar was charged for instigating the violence that led to the demolition of a mosque and was sentenced to prison for ten years. He fought the charges in court and finally proved his innocence. Subsequently, through his efficiency in advocacy he successfully pleaded to Lord Ripon for others who were sentenced for the riots to be released from Andaman Cellular Prison. He took objection to being disqualified from the membership of the Municipal Council, Salem, of which he had been a member during the period of the riot. As a result of his appeal, he was not only reinstated in the Municipal Council, but was able to obtain from the Secretary of State for India a sum of Rs 100 as a nominal damage for removing him from the council. He also proceeded against the witnesses who had falsely deposed against him, and got them convicted. The Salem riots of 1882 made Vijayaraghavachariar famous overnight. The riot case was highly publicised in the Indian national media and newspapers hailed him as a great champion of civil liberties. Thus he came to be called \\"The Lion of South India\\" and \\"The Hero of Salem\\". Entry into politics Vijayaraghavachariar's entry into public life began with his membership of the Salem Municipal Council in 1882. In 1895 he was elected to the Madras Legislative Council, which he served for six years, until 1901. Indian National Congress When the Indian National Congress was started in 1885 Vijayaraghavachari attended the first convention as one of the special invitees. He was a close associate of A. O. Hume, the founder of the Congress. Even prior to December 1885, Vijayaraghavachariar had suggested to Hume that a national organisation like the Indian National Congress, which he was proposing to create, should be political in outlook and at the same time should look into the economic and social needs of the masses. He felt that only then could the influence of such a body spread wide all over the country. He attended the Bombay session of the Congress and in 1887 he was one of the members of the committee which drafted the constitution of the Indian National Congress. He held high influence in the Congress, and most of the early names in Congress history were his friends or co-workers. His counsel and leadership were much sought after by the Congressmen of the early days. In 1899 (fifteenth session of the Congress, Lucknow) he was made a member of the Indian Congress Propaganda Committee. Through this committee he commanded a wide national influence and played a key role in spreading the message of the Congress throughout the length and breadth of the country. It was as a result of the committee's work that multitudes were brought within the fold of the Congress. Relationship with other Congress leaders Vijayaraghavachariar's close associates in the Congress included Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Dr. Ansari, Maulana Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Lala Lajpat Rai, C. Rajagopalachari and Motilal Nehru. With the advent of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ideologies in the party, there was a rift in the Congress ranks between the old moderates and the new radicals. Vijiaraghavachariar was a Nationalist and the Moderate Congress policy did not appeal to his judgement. He, therefore, stood aloof from the Congress after the organisation split following Surat session. Nevertheless, he later joined to carry the message of Gandhi. The climax of his political career came when in 1920 he was elected to preside over the Indian National Congress Session at Nagpur, where Gandhi's advocacy of Poorna Swaraj through non-violent non-co- operation was debated and accepted. He, with his powerful oratory, gave many a wordy battle to C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru on the question of the Council Entry Programme drawn up by them. He was also in the vanguard of the opposition to the Simon Commission that toured the country in 1929. He took an active part in the committee that met under Motilal Nehru to frame the Constitution for Congress. He appealed to the League of Nations to intervene and arbitrate in the Indian deadlock that proceeded after the Simon Commission. He considered the League of Nations as the hope of humanity. Constitution for Indian National Congress Earlier in 1913 he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council with which he was associated till 1916. At Delhi he worked in close co-operation with great leaders like Madan Mohan Malaviya, Surendranath Banerjea and Gopala Krishna Gokhale. In the third session of the Congress, held at Madras in December 1887 and presided over by Badruddin Tyabji, a historic decision was taken to draw up the Constitution of the Indian National Congress. Vijayaraghavachariar was the leading member of this committee. It was he who drafted the Constitution of the Congress which became the Swaraj Constitution for India. He performed this task with great care and ability and won the appreciation of all his colleagues. Achievements and social outlook Vijayaraghavachariar advocated post- puberty marriage for women and also the right of a daughter to have a share in her father's property. He rendered great assistance to Swami Sharathananda in his work connected with the Anti-Untouchability League. His multi-sided personality also found expression in his participation in the organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha. He presided over the All India Hindu Mahasabha Sessions at Akola in 1931. He was one of the two Vice-Presidents of the Madras Branch of the Passive Resistance Movement. Mahatma Gandhi was its President; the other Vice-President was S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, editor of The Hindu. Vijayaraghavachariar's powerful advocacy of the cause of labour and the non- Brahmins bear ample testimony to the largeness of his heart. He was also munificent in his donations to causes dear to him. The Anti-Untouchability League and the Congress Propaganda Organization in England in its early days received liberal financial support from him. His life was filled with relentless struggle against Imperialism and economic and social distress. Though an anti-imperialist, he had lifelong friendship with some of the representatives of imperialism in India, such as governors and viceroys. Lord Ripon, Lord Curzon, Lord Pentland, Lord and Lady Hardinge, Sir Conran Smith and Sir William Meyer were his friends from the Imperialistic Bloc. Eardley Norton, the great advocate, who argued his Salem Riots case and saved him from transportation to the Andamans, was his intimate friend. Edwin Montagu, then Secretary of State for India, commented that Vijayaraghavachariar was a vigorous thinker but with impractical ideas. Last years Though the leadership of the Congress in South India passed on from his hands to C. Rajagopalachari, Vijayaraghavachariar contented himself with giving periodic advice on matters of public importance through his regular contributions to the Madras journals. He died on 19 April 1944. After his death, his valuable collections were treasured in the Memorial Library and lecture halls in Salem specially constructed and named after him. His portrait hangs on the walls of Parliament of India.

He played nine seasons in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1972 until 1980. He played the majority of his career for the Minnesota Twins before playing his final season with the Chicago White Sox. Borgmann was drafted out of the University of South Alabama by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft. A little over a year later, he made his major league debut for the Twins. He became the team's starting catcher during the second half of 1972, replacing the platoon of Phil Roof and George Mitterwald. After spending most of 1973 in the minor leagues, Borgmann was back in the majors for good in 1974. That season, he took over as the club's starting catcher, batting .252 in 128 games while leading all American League catchers with a .997 fielding percentage. After seeing his average slip to .207 in 1975, Borgmann lost the starting job to rookie Butch Wynegar in 1976. He spent four seasons as Wynegar's backup, then became a free agent. Borgmann signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1980. After starting the season in the minors, Borgmann was called up in August to replace Ricky Seilheimer as the main backup to starting catcher Bruce Kimm. In September, he split time behind the plate with Marv Foley. Borgmann became a free agent again after the season. In 1981, Borgmann signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, playing 11 games for their Triple-A farm club, the Charleston Charlies, ending his professional career.

He was born April 27, 1948 just north of Chesterfield Inlet, at a point of land we call Qatiktalik (known as Cape Fullterton in English). That same spring of 1948 he and his family moved to Repulse Bay and in 1960 to Rankin Inlet. In 2019, he lives in Sooke, BC and plans to move to Manitoba in the summer. In 1954, a plane arrived and at the age of six Michael Kusugak and many of his friends were sent away to residential school. The teachers were strict and did not allow the children to speak their own language, Inuktitut. Kusugak remembers sitting in the back of the class crying most of the time. The following year, Michael successfully hid when the plane came to take him and his friends away again. However, he returned the following year and became one of the first Inuit in the eastern Arctic to graduate from high school. He was also educated in Yellowknife, Churchill and Saskatoon. He has later worked as an educational administrator for Nunavut Arctic College. Michael Kusugak grew up living a traditional, nomadic Inuit life with his family. Every night, Michael pleaded with his grandmother to tell him a story, until she eventually gave in. In this environment, Michael‚Äôs love of storytelling was born. It wasn‚Äôt until Michael had his own children that he realized that there was hardly anything written for children about life in the Arctic, so he started telling them his grandmother‚Äôs stories. In the late 1980s, Robert Munsch visited a local school and stayed in the Kusugak household. Along with Munsch as a co-author, Michael wrote his first book, A Promise is a Promise, published in 1988. Michael Arvaarluk Kusugak has been writing ever since. His books have been published in French, Korean, Japanese and Braille. All of Kusugak's books, except for T is for Territories, which is part of a non- fiction series, are illustrated by Vladyana Krykorka. Krykorka came to Toronto from Prague when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. She illustrated A Promise is a Promise in 1988, and since then has been to Nunavut many times to visit, photograph and paint the land and people. She has also written and illustrated a set of her own books depicting the land and animals of the north: Arctic Land, Arctic Sea, and Arctic Sky. Ijiraq, Kiviuq, and Siarnaq, moons of Saturn, were named by astronomer John J. Kavelaars after encountering the figures in one of Kusugak's books. Paaliaq, another moon, was named after one of Kusugak's original characters featured in The Curse Of The Shaman: A Marble Island. Reception Kusugak holds a unique place in Canadian children's literature, speaking from \\"the in-between of cultures\\" and finding common ground that relates to the very different parts of Canada.[Bainbridge, J. M. (2002). The Role of Canadian Children's Literature in National Identity Formation. English Quarterly, 34(3/4). Web. 1 Feb. 2014.] He is valued not only for the captivating content of his books, but also for his role as one of very few Inuit authors, and his commitment to sharing stories. Kusugak has to take stories that he naturally tells out loud in Inuktituk, and put them into writing in English. He rehearses his stories first out loud, and his books are praised for having \\"the well-worn feeling of an old, much-told tale\\".[Schwartz, Joanne. \\"Michael Kusugak: Reviving Tradition,Bridging Cultures.\\" The Horn Book Magazine Jan.-Feb. 2009: 65+.Canadian Periodicals Index Quarterly. Web. 1 Feb. 2014.] Michael Kusugak is known for his power to keep large groups of kids captivated for long periods of time with his stories. He is a storyteller, not only a writer of children's books, and spends a lot of his time telling stories to children in schools and libraries. At these events, he doesn't read his books out loud; he tells stories that he heard as a child and stories from his own life. \\"Before books, or even reading, should come the story, says Inuit storyteller and children's author Michael Kusugak. It should be told in person, with lots of repetition, facial expressions and feedback from listeners,\\" he says. \\"You can take these stories and write them down, but I think you lose something if you don't actually go and tell them\\".[Watts, Richard. \\"Inuit Storyteller Inspired by Kids; Children's Author Michael Kusugak Says Audience Reactions are Key to the Story.\\" Times - Colonist. Nov 12 2011. ProQuest. Web. 4 Feb. 2014.] His stories stimulate interesting questions and prompt classroom discussion. They seem to have a power in their unique nature and topics. A group of teachers who introduced their classes to Kusugak's books reported that their students were keenly interested in learning more about Canada. Rich discussions were held in classrooms and the children expressed pride in being part of such a large country with diversity in geography and people. They often asked challenging questions about life in the various regions of Canada.[Bainbridge, J. M. (2002). The role of Canadian children's literature in national identity formation. English Quarterly, 34(3/4). Web. 1 Feb. 2014.] Awards Winner of the Ruth Schwartz Award for Children‚Äôs Literature for Northern Lights: The Soccer Trails in 1994. Winner of the Vicky Metcalf Award for Children's Literature in 2008. Kusugak has also been shortlisted for many other awards The Hnatyshyn Foundation, REVEAL Indigenous Art Awards, Laureate (2017) Themes Kusugak‚Äôs work reflects many of the common themes in Canadian Indigenous children‚Äôs literature. In his books, many of the heroes are strong female protagonists, girls who get themselves out of tight situations by being clever and resourceful. This is one of the ways that Indigenous authors try to counteract the particularly harsh destruction of Indigenous women, by European colonizers.[Wolf, Doris and Paul DePasquale. \\"Home and Native Land: A Study of Canadian Aboriginal Picture Books by Aboriginal Authors\\". Home Words: Discourses of Children‚Äôs Literature in Canada. Ed. Mavis Reimer. Waterloo, ON: Wilfrid Laurier UP, 2008.] Another theme is Kusugak‚Äôs focus on home and family, and the essential role of elders, particularly grandmothers. This is common as a way for Aboriginal authors to create positive cultural associations for children, and a positive image of home, which includes ‚Äòthe land‚Äô much more than a physical house in Kusugak‚Äôs stories. Often, his main characters are warned by a parent or grandparent about a potential danger, but don‚Äôt believe them. In the end, they learn their lesson the hard way and learn to trust the knowledge of their elders.[Wolf, Doris and Paul DePasquale. \\"Home and Native Land: A Study of Canadian Aboriginal Picture Books by Aboriginal Authors\\". Home Words: Discourses if Children‚Äôs Literature in Canada. Ed. Mavis Reimer. Waterloo, ON: Wilfrid Laurier UP, 2008.] In Kusugak‚Äôs first book, A Promise is a Promise, a girl named Allashua decides that her mother‚Äôs warnings about the sea ice must be wrong, and decides to go and play near the cracks in the spring ice. She is taken by creatures who live under the ice, the Qallupilluit, who crave children but have promised never to take children who are with their parents. Allashua makes a bargain with the creatures, and promises that she will bring them more children if they let her go. She gets all the way back home before freezing solid, and after her parents warm her up, she tells them what she promised. They come up with a plan and together outwit the Qallupilluit, so Allashua and all her brothers and sisters are safe.

The second named storm and first hurricane of the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed out of an area of low pressure over the central Gulf of Mexico on June 23\\\\. The system gradually intensified and was declared Tropical Storm Bonnie the next day as it moved generally towards the west-northwest. On June 25, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane. Bonnie strengthened further and on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Bonnie made landfall near High Island, Texas. Following landfall, Bonnie quickly weakened below tropical storm status and dissipated over Missouri on June 28\\\\. Prior to Bonnie moving ashore, 22,000 people were evacuated in Texas and Louisiana. Upon making landfall, Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5.2 feet (1.5 m) at Sabine Pass. Rainfall from the storm peaked at 13 inches (330 mm) in Ace, Texas, which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County, Texas. Three fatalities were reported in the Port Arthur, Texas area; two deaths were from separate car accidents and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house fire. Flooding also impacted northwestern Louisiana. In the Shreveport area alone, 381 homes, 20 businesses, and 80 major highway intersections were flooded. The hurricane also spawned 11 tornadoes, destroying about 25 houses in southwestern Louisiana. Overall, Hurricane Bonnie caused $42 million (1986 USD) in damage and five fatalities. Meteorological history In mid-June, a mid-level center of circulation formed in association with a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf of Mexico. On June 20, a weak and disorganized area of low pressure developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, there was little convection observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June 23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330 mi (535 km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500 UTC on June 24, at which time winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie. In the 24 hours after becoming a tropical storm, satellite imagery showed a substantial increase in upper-level outflow as Tropical Storm Bonnie gradually intensified. A reconnaissance plane into the system shortly before 1200 UTC on June 25 revealed hurricane-force winds above the surface. This evidence was the basis of Bonnie's upgrade to a Category 1 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale at 1800 UTC on June 25\\\\. During the afternoon hours of June 26, Bonnie reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). While accelerating towards the northwest, the hurricane retained this intensity until landfall near High Island, Texas at 1000 UTC on June 26\\\\. Eight hours later, Bonnie weakened to a tropical storm and was downgraded to tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 27. The depression persisted until 1200 UTC on June 28, at which time it was absorbed by a frontal zone while located over the U.S. state of Missouri. Preparations alt=Colored contoured map of rainfall amounts. Each contour denotes a difference in precipitation totals. Upon the system being classified as a tropical depression, a high risk of landfall near Port Arthur, Texas was noted, giving federal officials sufficient lead time to warn local residents about a possible approaching hurricane. As the system neared landfall, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 1200 UTC on June 25, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch, stretching from Port O'Connor, Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A few hours later, a hurricane warning was issued for area west of Morgan City, Louisiana to Freeport, Texas. In advance of the approaching storm, roughly 22,000 residents were evacuated, with 10,000 from Galveston County, Texas alone. Impact Due to the small size of Hurricane Bonnie, damage was relatively light, totaling to $42 million. The storm was also attributed to five deaths, four in Texas and one in Louisiana. Texas In some areas of eastern Texas, the storm dropped of rain, with a peak total of in Ace. Heavy rains caused by Bonnie also lead a small dam collapse in northeastern Liberty County, Texas, resulting in severe flooding. In Hardin County, the Pine Island Bayou overflowed, causing water to enter hundreds of homes and businesses. Several major roadways were flooded due to flooding, including Highway 59 between Livingston and Shepherd, U.S. Route 79 in Panola County, and Interstate 20 and several farm-to-market roads in Harrison County. The Bear Foot Lake dam overflowed, damaging some homes and forcing 200 families to evacuate. Overall, approximately 1,300 people in southeastern Texas fled their homes due to flooding. Severe flooding left behind by the heavy rains caused $5 million in damage. In addition to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned a few miles southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000 power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds. Louisiana Most of the damage in Louisiana occurred in Cameron Parish. Twenty-five homes, trailers, and cabins in southwestern Louisiana were destroyed, resulting in about $400,000 in damages. Two tornadoes were spawned in Webster Parish. The first caused about $15,000 in damage to the roofs of three homes. The other tornado destroyed three mobile homes and severely damaged an additional two as well as three permanent homes. Damage from this tornado totaled $200,000. Just south of Blanchard, of rain fell within a 12-hour period. Interstate 20 was closed from Shreveport to the Louisiana-Texas state line due to flooding, with as much as of standing water near Greenwood. Torrential rains caused water inundation up to in some areas of Shreveport. Firefighters used boats to rescue some stranded Shreveport residents in their homes by sudden high water. Rescuers also had to bind themselves together to rescue some people stranded in a flooded trailer park. Flooding in the city forced police to barricade 50 major highway intersections. Along the shore of Cross Lake, about 80 homes were damaged by water intrusion. About 381 homes and 20 businesses in Shreveport were damaged by flooding. A tornado spawned in the city overturned an airplane at Shreveport Downtown Airport, damaged a roof from a house, and shattered a number of windows. No injuries were reported from the tornado. Damage in Louisiana from flooding alone totaled $11‚Äì13 million, with $4 million to highways and bridges, $1‚Äì2 million to vehicles, $5 million to property, and $1‚Äì2 million to boats. Three fishermen were tossed into a lake after a boat was capsized due to high winds. Two were rescued, but one perished. Elsewhere Heavy rains from the remnant low-pressure area of Bonnie led to heavy rains in several states in the Southeastern United States. Rainfall was generally minor in most areas, however in Arkansas, rains totaled up to 11.75 in (254 mm) at the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Several roads were washed out in Ouachita County near Elliott. A number of roads and bridges were also washed out in Union County, with damage totaling $200,000. U.S. Route 79 was closed between Magnolia and Stephens because of standing water. Three or four families evacuated near the Ouachita-Union County line after the Smackover Creek overflowed its banks and flooded 20 homes. There was also a small area of heavy rains totaling up to 5 in (127 mm) along the border of Tennessee and Georgia.

In addition to 2006 champion Brazil and host nation Italy, 22 teams qualified for the tournament by means of continental and regional competitions. The matches took place in ten venues across ten Italian cities, with the final being held at the PalaLottomatica, Rome. The tournament was won by Brazil, who beat Cuba in final. Brazil won their third straight world championship having won previously in 2002 and 2006. The podium was completed by Serbia who defeated Italy in the 3rd place match. Brazilian wing-spiker Murilo Endres was named the tournament MVP. Brazil's victory continued their eight-year period of domination of world volleyball. Brazil has now won 15 of 17 major competitions since 2002. Brazil's third straight world championship equals the record for consecutive titles set by Italy in the 1990s. Host Finals hosts Italy.

Chinese Seal script for teng \\"flying dragon\\" Names This legendary creature's names include teng \\"a flying dragon\\" (or te \\"a plant pest\\") and tengshe \\"flying-dragon snake\\" or \\"soaring snake\\". Teng The Chinese character for teng or te graphically combines a phonetic element of zhen \\"I, we (only used by emperors)\\" with the \\"insect radical\\" . This radical is typically used in characters for insects, worms, reptiles, and dragons (e.g., shen \\"a sea-monster dragon\\" or jiao \\"an aquatic dragon\\"). The earliest written form of teng is a (ca. 3rd century BCE) Seal script character written with the same radical and phonetic. Teng has two etymologically cognate Chinese words written with this zhen phonetic and different radicals: teng (with the \\"water radical\\" ) \\"gush up; inundate; Teng (state); a surname\\" and teng (with the \\"horse radical\\" ) \\"jump; gallop; prance; mount; ascend; fly swiftly upward; soar; rise\\". This latter teng, which is used to write the tengshe flying dragon, occurs in draconic 4-character idioms such as longtenghuyue (lit. \\"dragon rising tiger leaping\\") \\"scene of bustling activity\\" and tengjiaoqifeng (\\"rising dragon soaring phoenix\\", also reversible) \\"a rapidly rising talent; an exceptional literary/artistic talent; a genius\\". The (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BCE) Erya dictionary (16, tr. Carr 1990:111) defines teng as tengshe \\"teng-snake\\", and Guo Pu's commentary glosses it as a \\"[feilong ] flying dragon that drifts in the clouds and mist\\". Some bilingual Chinese dictionaries translate teng as \\"wingless dragon\\", but this apparent ghost meaning is not found in monolingual Chinese sources. For instance, the Wiktionary and the Unihan Database translation equivalent for teng is \\"mythological wingless dragon of\\" . This dangling \\"of\\" appears to be copied from Robert Henry Mathews (1931:894) Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary \\"A wingless dragon of the clouds\\", which adapted Herbert Giles's (1892:1352) dictionary \\"A wingless dragon which inhabits the clouds and is regarded as a creature of evil omen.\\" While dragons are depicted as both winged and wingless (e.g., the lindworm \\"a bipedal wingless dragon\\"), Chinese dictionaries note teng \\"flying serpents\\" are wuzu \\"footless; legless\\" (see the Xunzi below) not \\"wingless\\". Tengshe Black Tortoise pattern on eaves-tile \\"The teng dragon\\", says Carr (1990:111), \\"had a semantically more transparent name of tengshe 'rising/ascending snake'.\\" Tengshe is written with either teng \\"flying dragon\\" or teng \\"soaring; rising\\" and she \\"snake; serpent\\" From the original \\"flying dragon; flying serpent\\" denotation, tengshe acquired three additional meanings: \\"an asterism\\" in Traditional Chinese star names, \\"a battle formation\\" in Chinese military history, and \\"lines above the mouth\\" in physiognomy. First, Tengshe Flying Serpent (or Tianshe \\"Heavenly Snake\\") is an asterism of 22 stars in the Chinese constellation Shi Encampment, which is the northern 6th of the 7 Mansions in the Xuanwu Black Tortoise constellation. These Tengshe stars spread across corresponding Western constellations of Andromeda, Lacerta, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus. In traditional Chinese art, Xuanwu is usually represented as a tortoise surrounded by a dragon or snake. Second, Tengshe names \\"a battle formation\\". The (643‚Äì659 CE) Beishi history of Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei Dynasty (r. 452‚Äì465 CE) describes a 454 CE battle. The Wei army routed enemy soldiers by deploying troops into over ten columns that changed between feilong \\"flying dragons\\", tengshe \\"ascending snakes\\", and yuli \\"beautiful fishes\\" (alluding to Shijing 170). Third, Tengshe \\"flying dragon\\" has a specialized meaning in Xiangshu \\"Chinese physiognomy\\", referring to \\"vertical lines rising from corners of the mouth\\". Te The earliest occurrence of means te \\"a plant pest\\" instead of teng \\"a flying dragon\\". The (ca. 6th century BCE) Shijing (212 ) describes farmers removing plant pests called mingte and maozei in fields of grain. These Shijing names rhyme, and Bernhard Karlgren reconstructed them as Old Chinese *d'…ôk and *dz'…ôk . The Mao Commentary glosses four insects; the ming eats hearts, the te eats leaves, the mao eats roots, and the zei eats joints. Compare these translations: *We remove the insects that eat the heart and the leaf, And those that eat the roots and the joints (tr. James Legge 1879:380) *Avaunt, all earwigs and pests (tr. Arthur Waley 1937:171) *We remove the noxious insects from the ears and leaves, and the grubs from roots and stems (tr. Karlgren 1950:166) Han Dynasty Chinese dictionaries write te \\"a plant pest\\" with the variant Chinese character . The Erya defines ming as \\"[insect that] eats seedlings and cores\\" and te \\"[insect that] eats leaves\\". Guo Pu's commentary glosses these four pests as types of huang \\"locusts; grasshoppers\\". The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary defines ming \\"insect that eats grain leaves\\" and te as \\"insect that eats sprout leaves\\". The identity of this rare te or \\"a grain pest\\" called remains uncertain. In Modern Standard Chinese usage, te only occurs as a literary archaism, while ming is used in words like mingling \\"corn earworm; adopted son\\" and mingchong \\"snout moth's larva\\". Classical usages Chinese classic texts frequently mention tengshe or \\"flying dragons\\". The examples below are roughly arranged in chronological order, although some heterogeneous texts are of uncertain dates. Only texts with English translations are cited, excluding tengshe occurrences in texts such as the Guiguzi, Shuoyuan, and Shiji. Xunzi The (c. 4th century BCE) Confucianist Xunzi (1 ) first records the Classical Chinese idiom tengshe wuzu er fei \\"flying dragon is without feet yet flies\\", which figuratively means \\"success results from concentrating on one's abilities\\". *The T'eng-she dragon has no feet but flies; the squirrel have five talents, but cannot perform any one of them to perfection (tr. Dubs 1928:35). *The wingless dragon has no limbs, but it can fly; the flying squirrel has five talents, but it is reduced to extremity (tr. Knoblock 1988:139). Hanfeizi The (3rd century BCE) Legalist text Hanfeizi uses tengshe in two chapters. \\"Ten Faults\\" (, tr. Liao 1939:77) uses it describing the Yellow Emperor's heavenly music. > In by-gone days the Yellow Emperor once called a meeting of devils and > spirits at the top of the Western T'ai Mountain, he rode in a divine > carriage pulled by [] dragons, with Pi-fang a tree deity keeping pace with > the linchpin, Ch'ih-yu [a war deity] marching in the front, Earl Wind [a > wind deity] sweeping the dirt, Master Rain [a rain deity] sprinkling water > on the road, tigers and wolves leading in the front, devils and spirits > following from behind, rising serpents rolling on the ground, and male and > female phoenixes flying over the top. The \\"Critique on the Concept of Political Purchase\\" (, tr. Ames 1983:74) quotes Shen Dao contrasting feilong \\"flying dragon\\" with tengshe to explain shi \\"political purchase; strategic advantage\\". > Shen Tzu said: \\"The flying dragon mounts the clouds and the t'eng snake > wanders in the mists. But when the clouds dissipate and the mists clear, the > dragon and the snake become the same as the earthworm and the large-winged > black ant because they have lost that on which they ride. Where men of > superior character are subjugated by inferior men, it is because their > authority is lacking and their position is low. Where the inferior are > subjugated by the superior, it is because the authority of the latter is > considerable and their position is high. Chuci The (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BCE) Chuci parallels tengshe with feiju \\"flying horse\\" in the poem \\"A Road Beyond\\" (, tr. Hawkes 1985:271). > With team of dragons I mount the heavens, In ivory chariot borne aloft. ... > I wander through all the constellations; I roam about round the Northern > Pole. My upper garment is of red stuff; Of green silk is my under-robe. I > loosen my girdle and let my clothes flow freely; I stretch out my trusty > Gan-jiang sword. The Leaping Serpent follows behind me, the Flying Horse > trots at my side. Huainanzi The (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi uses both tengshe graphic variants (with the insect radical, chapters 9 and 18, which is not translated) and (horse radical, chapter 17). \\"The Art of Rulership\\" (9 , tr. Ames 1981:176) uses tengshe with yinglong \\"responding dragon\\". The t'eng snake springs up into the mist; the flying ying dragon ascends into the sky mounting the clouds; a monkey is nimble in the trees and a fish is agile in the water.\\" The \\"Discourse on Forests\\" (17 , tr. Carr 1990:111) has tengshe in the same \\"drifts into the mist\\" phrase, \\"The ascending snake can drift in the mist, yet it is endangered by the centipede.\\" Other texts Tengshe frequently occurs in Chinese poetry. Two early examples are \\"The Dark Warrior shrinks into his shell; The Leaping Serpent twists and coils itself\\" (\\"Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery\\" by Zhang Heng, 78‚Äì139 CE, tr. Knechtges 1982:127), and \\"Though winged serpents ride high on the mist, They turn to dust and ashes at last\\" (\\"Though the Tortoise Lives Long\\" by Cao Cao, 155‚Äì220 CE, tr. Ward 2008:19). Mythology The Chinese books above repeatedly parallel the tengshe \\"soaring snake; flying dragon\\" with its near synonym feilong \\"flying dragon\\". Like the tianlong \\"heavenly dragon\\", these creatures are associated with clouds and rainfall, as Visser (1913:109) explains. > The Classics have taught us that the dragon is thunder, and at the same time > that he is a water animal akin to the snake, sleeping in pools during winter > and arising in spring. When autumn comes with its dry weather, the dragon > descends and dives into the water to remain there till spring arrives again. The (1578 CE) Bencao Gangmu (43, tr. Read 1934:349) mentions this mythic serpent, \\"There are flying snakes without feet such as the Ëû£Ëõá T'eng She.\\" The commentary (tr. Visser 1913:75) explains, \\"The t'eng-she changes into a dragon. This divine snake can ride upon the clouds and fly about over a thousand miles. If it is heard, (this means) pregnancy.\\" Wolfram Eberhard (1968:385-6) surveys the cultural background of tengshe \\"ascending snake\\" myths. > Frequently, in the early literature, the snake steps into the clouds > [Shenzi, Baopuzi, Huainanzi].

The first of the two station, Uskmouth A power station, was built in the 1940s and demolished in 2002. The second station, Uskmouth B power station, was built in the 1950s and is currently undergoing a conversion to run on biomass and waste plastic. Uskmouth A Uskmouth A power station was authorised in 1947, and building started in April 1948. The first generating set was commissioned in December 1952, followed by other sets in September 1953, March 1954, September 1954, June 1956 and finally December 1956 for a set scrapped in January 1956.

The station was demolished in 2002 Uskmouth B Uskmouth B power station (or Uskmouth Power as it is now known) was authorised in May 1957 and built in 1959. It has a generating capacity of 363 MW, which is enough to power 360,000 homes, or the surrounding area of Newport. The electricity is provided by three 110 MW generating sets. Uskmouth B was one of the CEGB‚Äôs twenty steam power stations with the highest thermal efficiency; in 1963‚Äì4 the thermal efficiency was 32.15 per cent, 32.72 per cent in 1964‚Äì5, and 32.89 per cent in 1965‚Äì6. The pulverised fuel boilers were capable of delivering 324.0 kg/s of steam at 103.4 bar and 538¬∞C. It is situated in an essential position for the National Grid, as there are very few power stations situated in the south of Wales.

The station was then closed in 1995. But in 1998, it was purchased by AES. The station was given a ¬£120 million refurbishment to bring it up to date with legislative requirements. New environmental equipment was installed and it was given a refurbishment which is thought to have extended the station's life by 25 years. The station's generating capacity was also increased to 393 MW. In 2001 the work was completed and the station was reopened. However, only a year later the plant passed into receivership, but had a brief period of operating in the winter between 2003 and 2004. In June 2004 the station was put back into full operation, when it was bought by Welsh Power, who were then known as Carron Energy. Welsh Power sold it to SSE (Scottish and Southern Energy plc) in 2009 for ¬£27m. In April 2013 one of the three remaining blocks was closed, so the power station has now a remaining generation capacity of 260 MW. View of the power station from Newport Wetlands Reserve The station was one of the cleanest coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, and was fitted with Flue Gas Desulphurisation equipment and low NOx burners. It also burns biomass, as well as coal, for its emissions to be considered closer to being carbon neutral. The station does not take water from or dump waste water into the River Usk. It instead uses secondary treated sewage water in its cooling system. The station employed 90 people. It has been awarded RoSPA Gold Award for Occupational Health and Safety for its efforts to ensure station safety. The station's owners have participated in many local community projects ‚Äì they donated land to the Newport Wetlands Reserve, and sponsor Welsh swimmer David Davies and the Newport Gwent Dragons. The station was earmarked for closure in 2014 and subsequently mothballed. However, in 2015, plans were announced to instead convert the station to run fully on pellets of biomass and waste plastic, as part of a scheme to regenerate the area and create hundreds of jobs. These plans have since taken priority and as a result, Uskmouth has seen very infrequent use as a coal plant; with April 2017 being the last occasion. In 2017, Atlantis Energy joined a partnership to undertake this transformation by 2020. In 2019, it was reported that the plant would be running on 50% pellets of plastic and 50% pellets of cardboard and paper by 2021 and is expected to operate for 20 years. Severn Power Station An 832 megawatt (MW) Combined Cycle Power Plant running on natural gas, known as Severn Power Station, was built on the site of Uskmouth A by Siemens. It comprises two gas turbines and two steam turbines, each operating on a single shaft, and entered commercial operations in November 2010. It was initially reported that it would cost ¬£400 million to build and create 650 construction jobs. Originally owned and operated by the Danish company DONG Energy (now √òrsted), the station was acquired in December 2013 by MPF Holdings, which later changed its name to Calon Energy. Uses in culture In 2006, the station was used as a location for two episodes of Doctor Who. In the episodes \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The Age of Steel\\", the station was used as the setting for the Cybermen Factory. It was then used again for the 2011 Christmas special \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" as spaceship corridors, filmed on 20 September 2011. In 2014, the station was once again used for two episodes, respectively \\"Into the Dalek\\" and \\"Time Heist\\".

Biography A member of the aristocratic family of the Symmachi, he was the son of Marcus Aurelius Valerius Tullianus Symmachus, consul for 330. He had one daughter and four sons, among whom were Celsinus TitianusJones, Arnold Hugh Martin, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , p. 869. and the most influential of the Symmachi, the orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus. Avianius was a pagan senator,Mazzarino, p. 412. and was member of several priestly collegia, including the Pontefices Vestae and the quindecimviri sacris faciundi (from 351 to 375).R√ºpke, J√∂rg, Fasti Sacerdotum, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005, , pp. 512‚Äì529. By January 350 he held the office of praefectus annonae; later that decade he was vicarius urbis Romae. In 361, he went to Antioch (in Syria), where he probably met Libanius, to meet Emperor Constantius II: it is probable that the Roman Senate wanted to assure its loyalty to the ruling emperor after receiving a letter from Julian, cousin and caesar of Constantius, who had been just proclaimed emperor by his troops. On their way back, Symmachus and his colleague Valerius Maximus travelled through Nassus, where they were received by Julian with all the honours.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxi.12.24; CIL, VI, 1698.Sogno, pp. 3‚Äì4. From April 364 to March 365 he held the office of praefectus urbi of Rome, under the rule of Valentinian I. As praefect, he restored the ancient pons Agrippae on the Tiber (on the place of the modern Ponte Sisto),CIL, VI, 31403, 31404. which took the name of pons Valentiniani; Symmachus even paid for a lavish public celebration for the inauguration of this bridge. Ammianus Marcellinus has a flattering opinion of his mandate.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvii.3.3-4. His house was on the right side of the Tiber, in Trastevere, and was burned down by the plebs during a riot in 367.Kahlos, Chapter 12 \\"A senatorial life\\" ; Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, JHU Press, 1992, , p. 135. According to the story told by Ammianus, the riot originated from a rumour, diffused by a member of the plebs, according to which Symmachus, during his prefecture, had said that \\"he would prefer putting out the limekilns with his own wine, to selling the lime at the price expected of him\\"; forgetting the prosperity achieved during Symmachus' office, the enraged plebs burnt down his house.It was proposed that the riot had had a political purpose, being a means of putting Symmachus under pressure (Lizzi Testa). Symmachus left the city following this offence caused by \\"envy\\",Symmachus, Orationes, v.1. that he tried to heal by writing a literary work.Symmachus, Epistulae, i.2.2. After a while, however, the plebs changed their minds and started supporting Symmachus, even asking for a punishment of the offenders.Mazzarino, p. 411. Symmachus returned to Rome, by request of the Roman Senate,Symmachus, Epistulae, i.44.2. whom he thanked on 1 January 376; the senators, even the Christians, proposed him to Emperor Gratian as praetorian prefect and consul for year 377.Wace. Avianius Symmachus died in 376, as consul-elect.Sogno, p. 77. The following year, his memory was honoured with a gilded statue, erected by imperial decree after a request of the Senate, on 29 April. Culture Avianius Symmachus is described by his son as a reader of every kind of literature. He composed a small number of epigrams of low quality about members of the Constantinian age, such as Amnius Anicius Iulianus and Lucius Aradius Valerius Proculus.Salzman, Michele Renee, The Making of a Christian Aristocracy, Harvard University Press, 2002, , pp. 58-59.

The aircraft is powered by a modified Continental O-200 piston engine. The Nemesis originated as an attempt by Jon Sharp to build a Shoestring racer, with composite skins over a steel frame. Along the way, Dan Bond convinced him to use an airfoil with extensive laminar flow and finally, Steve Ericson helped Jon design a sleeker, all composite airframe. All that remains of the original ‚Äúplastic Shoestring‚Äù is the horizontal tail. The steel space frame was sold to Dan Gilbert, who built on it his Shadow Formula One air racer. Although Shadow looks much like Nemesis it is fabricated differently and has a completely different wing.Lednicer, David A. \\"Fluid Dynamic Analysis of Nemesis and Shadow\\" EAA Sport Aviation, August 1997 The success of the aircraft led Jon Sharp to design a follow-on type, the Nemesis NXT.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 113. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X Racing career Between 1991 and 1999, the plane won 45 of the 48 race events in which it was entered, including nine consecutive Reno Gold National Championships. During each of the race seasons from 1994 through 1999, Nemesis finished as the International Formula One points champion. Nemesis was awarded the George Owl Trophy for its design in 1991, three Louis Bl√®riot Medals from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (1993, 1996 and 1998),FAI list of Bleriot winners and four Pulitzer Trophies (1993, 1994, 1995 and 1999). The aircraft set 16 world speed records, and in one of those records, Nemesis flew at over 290 mph (467 km/h). Because of its successes, the National Air and Space Museum has described the plane as \\"the most successful aircraft in air racing history\\". To put the Nemesis performance in perspective, most production O-200 equipped aircraft struggle to break 100mph. Very few, if any, can reach even half its maximum speed. Display After the end of the 1999 racing season, Jon Sharp donated the aircraft to the National Air and Space Museum, and it is now on display at the NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

Kelly is best known for his work with the influential LA rock band The Autumns, which he fronted for more than a decade (1997‚Äì2008). He is also a member of the experimental post-punk collective The Sound of Animals Fighting, and the black-metal-inspired Pyramids. In addition to his musical output, Kelly is a historian of the modern Middle East. He holds a PhD from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), has published several articles in professional journals, and is the author of a forthcoming book with the University of California Press. Kelly currently resides in Los Angeles with his wife, the dancer and choreographer Tammie Rose Johnston. They have one son.  The Autumns  Portrait of Matthew Kelly by Norton Wisdom The Autumns' career began in 1997, when the band released the EP Suicide at Strell Park and, shortly thereafter, the LP The Angel Pool. Both records garnered a good deal of critical acclaim, especially The Angel Pool. Flipside called it a \\"hypnotic pop masterpiece.\\" All Music Guide deemed it a \\"fine debut\\" that featured \\"an alluring mix of power and beauty.\\" Word of the LP soon spread to Europe, where it caught the ear of Simon Raymonde, whose band Cocteau Twins was among The Autumns‚Äô primary influences. In 2000, Raymonde produced The Autumns‚Äô second album, In the Russet Gold of this Vain Hour. He went on to release the band's third and fourth albums‚Äì‚ÄìThe Autumns (2004) and Fake Noise from a Box of Toys (2008)‚Äì‚Äìon his prestigious London-based recording label, Bella Union. The self-titled album was a hit with the British press. It won four-star reviews in MOJO, NME, The Times of London, and other high-profile outlets. Critics were more ambivalent about Fake Noise. NME memorably wrote that it sounded like \\"Sigur Ros getting hurt in a free jazz boot camp.\\" FILTER took a different view, declaring that Fake Noise proved The Autumns were \\"everything that other bands wish they were.\\" The Autumns also expanded their discography with a number of EPs, including Winter in a Silver Box (1998), the 50s-themed Le Carillon (2001), and the covers collection Covers (2001). The band released several singles (with exclusive b-sides) as well. These included Boy with the Aluminum Stilts (2000), Every Sunday Sky (2004), Boys (2008), and Killer in Drag (2009). In addition, they put out a limited edition split 7\\" with Denton, Texas band Lift to Experience, 2000's \\"White Nights\\"/\\"Calling out to Jesus in the Middle of the Night.\\"  The Sound of Animals Fighting  The Sound of Animals Fighting (Best Buy Theater 2014) In 2006, avant-garde producer R. Loren (Rich Loren Balling)‚Äì‚Äìwhose collaborators include Lydia Lunch, Alec Empire, and Vern Rumsey‚Äì‚Äìconscripted Kelly into the post-punk collective The Sound of Animals Fighting. Kelly lent his vocal and songwriting talents to the album Lover, The Lord Has Left Us (Equal Vision). Adopting the moniker \\"The Wolf\\", he collaborated with Loren (\\"The Nightingale\\") and RX Bandits‚Äô Matt Embree (\\"The Walrus\\") to produce the Persian-infused track \\"My Horse Must Lose\\", as well as the album's closer, \\"The Heretic.\\" Kelly also appeared on The Sound of Animals Fighting's third album, The Ocean and the Sun (Epitaph), where he again sang on the closing track (\\"On the Occasion of Wet Snow\\"). Awareness of TSOAF's cult status spread when the group performed a series of sold out shows on the West Coast in 2006, which were captured on the live DVD We Must Become The Change We Want To See. In 2014, the band performed another short series of shows, this time on both coasts, selling out a number of large venues (including the Best Buy Theater in Times Square NYC and Los Angeles‚Äô Wiltern Theatre).  Pyramids  283x283px In 2007, Kelly and Loren collaborated on another project, Pyramids. Pyramids released its debut, self- titled album in 2008 on Hydra Head Records. The record's dissonant, arhythmic aesthetic captivated the press, from The Wire to Pitchfork. The latter characterized the album as an \\"unapologetic post-rock assault\\", the product of \\"a formidable talent.\\" Drowned In Sound called it \\"totally weird and totally new.\\" Decibel claimed that the record had \\"redefined grimness for a generation.\\" Terrorizer deemed it \\"a beguiling nightmare of an album.\\" In the end, All Music Guide may have said it best: \\"There is no other music like this out there.\\" Pyramids‚Äô subsequent collaborations with Nadja (Pyramids with Nadja), Windy and Carl (and 49 others, on the five-cassette box-set Wvndrkmmer), Wraiths (Magpie and Raven), Horseback (A Throne Without a King), and a split with Mamiffer, evoked similarly passionate reactions the world over. In 2015, Canadian label Profound Lore released A Northern Meadow, again to rave reviews.  Soviet League, Minus Music  In 2010, Kelly teamed up with Sugarplastic's Ben Eshbach to write and record an album of richly melodic pop. The result was the Phil-Spector- and Brian-Wilson-inspired Soviet League. Few critics seemed to notice the record, but those who did regarded it as one of the year's best. Kelly then joined forces with Evol Intent's Knick Weiller to produce a short EP entitled Minus Music (2012).  Future Projects  In 2015, Kelly performed twice, both times in Los Angeles with acclaimed singer- songwriter Josh T. Pearson.

It provided access to the town of Ruth. The roadway was turned over to local control in the 1980s. Route description Former SR 485 in 2014 SR 485 started at U.S. Route 50 (US 50), about west of Ely. SR 485 ran west to the mining town of Ruth. The road's pavement ends slightly west of Ruth, although a dirt road continues back near the former site of Riepetown. History The road to Ruth was established as State Route 44 by 1935. At that time, the route was shown on official state maps as being a paved road connecting the former town of Kimberly to US 50 via Ruth. By 1941, SR 44 appears to have been altered and then comprised two roadways, a road to Ruth and a spur to Kimberly;. a routing which was defined by state highway law. Although maps are unclear, it appears the road to Ruth was eliminated prior to 1964, and the spur to Kimberly was retained as SR 44. The town of Ruth may have been relocated along the highway as well, in concordance with open pit mining operations in the area. SR 44 remained unchanged for many years, until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highways. In that process, SR 44 was to be replaced by SR 485. However, the new designation was not retained through the state's renumbering process; SR 485 last appeared on the 1980‚Äì1981 state highway map while the numbering transition was still underway.

He dropped out of medical school, and they traveled to an Islamic conference in Paris for a month. They had two sons, named Ilyass and Adam. By 1992, he'd returned to France and begun selling Moroccan handicrafts to support his desire to travel and volunteer as a Bosnian mujahideen. After one tour in Bosnia, he returned to bring his wife back to the Balkans with him, but was stymied by Germany's refusal to grant a visa. Returning alone, he was arrested for a month by Croatian forces, before being released at the request of the French government, although he was forbidden to return to Bosnia for five years. Upon returning to Morocco, he rented a two- room apartment and began wearing Afghan clothing and a long beard. When women visited, he and his male friends would sleep in their cars parked on the street, while the women slept inside. Neighbours later recalled that he once loudly berated a couple for their public display of affection. In early 1994, he traveled to Mecca on the hajj pilgrimage, and then continued on to Afghanistan, where he enrolled at the Khalden training camp where he contracted malaria and had to be sent home to Morocco. Once, upon returning to Morocco, he was questioned about the Pakistani visa in his passport and the Abdullah Azzam book he was reading. Around this time, his wife was diagnosed with cancer. He maintained a relationship with Yusuf Fikri, leader of the Takfir wal-Hijra. In 1996, he took a second wife at the urging of his wife, the Belgian Fatihah al-Hawshy who lived in England and was a friend of his wife.Al-Riyadh, ŸÖÿµÿßÿØÿ± ÿ£ŸÖŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÖÿ∫ÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿ™ÿ®ÿØŸä ÿßÿ±ÿ™Ÿäÿßÿ≠Ÿáÿß ŸÑÿ≥ŸÇŸàÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ÿßÿ∑Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÅŸÇŸàÿØÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ™ŸÅÿ¨Ÿäÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ∂ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ±Ÿáÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ©, July 28, 2005 Around 1997, he traveled to New Jersey on the invitation of a friend for several months. It was one of two visits he made to the United States prior to 1999. He later listed the address of a New York City bookseller, Abdulrahman Farhane, as his own - later entered as evidence against Farhane following accusations he financially supported terrorism.Preston, Julia. New York Times, Bail denied for Brooklyn Bookseller accused of financing terrorism, February 11, 2006 While American authorities claimed he hadn't entered the country since 1999, Saudi media reported that he traveled back to the United States with al-Hawshy, his second wife, in 2000 and dropped her off there while he traveled to Pakistan. In July 2001, el- Mejjati and his wife determined to leave Morocco permanently, and flew to Spain for two weeks while awaiting their entry visa to Iran. When Italy declined their request for travel documents, they flew out of Frankfurt instead. After landing in Tehran, they crossed the border into Afghanistan the following day. He traveled to Kandahar, ostensibly to seek out Osama bin Laden even though he had no intentions of joining al-Qaeda, but was disappointed to discover the militant leader had already left the city. He later managed to see both bin Laden and Mullah Omar. Following the American reprisal bombings following the September 11 attacks, el-Mejjati and his wife left Afghanistan and traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh where they remained for ten months after their passports were seized due to fake Pakistani visa stamps. They moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using false Qatari passports, after that. Some have claimed the move was authorised by bin Laden to build a \\"Saudi network\\".Tefft, Bruce. \\"Mastermind of Spain bombings dies after shootout in north Saudi town\\", April 18, 2005  Entry into militant plots  After moving to Riyadh, el- Mejjati agreed to allow Khalid al-Juhani, a veteran of the First Chechen War and Afghan Civil War who was being sought by Americans, stay with his family. He asked his wife to help him find a wife for al-Juhani, who was not supposed to be involved in any more fighting. On March 23, 2003, his wife and 10-year- old son Ilyass left the city to try to reach an Ophthalmologist. They had been originally intended to travel with al-Juhani, which caught the attention of the Mabahith secret police. However, al-Juhani argued he wasn't feeling well and asked a brother and his wife to instead accompany el-Mejjati and her son. The group was nonetheless arrested by authorities who hoped that al-Juhani was present. When questioned, his wife confirmed to police that el-Mejjati was indeed living in Riyadh, but refused to write an open letter in the newspapers calling for her husband to surrender himself to authorities stating that he hadn't done anything wrong. After his wife's arrest, he is believed to have fallen in with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, and to have provided training to its members in a forest outside Rabat. His name was mentioned in connection with the Riyadh compound bombing in May of that year. Days before the May 16 attack in Casablanca, el-Mejjati is believed to have fled to Spain. Arguments that he had dressed as a woman to travel unnoticed were rebuffed by his wife who pointed out he stood 6'4\\". On June 20, 2003, when it was discovered that al-Juhani had been among the men killed in the Riyadh compound bombings, Saudi Arabia transferred el-Mejjati's wife and son to Moroccan custody, flying them on a private jet through Cairo into Morocco. In September 2003, the FBI issued an alert for four people they alleged \\"pose a threat to U.S. citizens\\", including Abderraouf Jdey, Adnan G. El Shukrijumah and the previously unknown Zubayr al-Rimi and el-Mejjati.CNN, FBI seeks 4 suspected of terrorist activities, September 2003 While in Spain, el-Mejjati became associated with Jamal Zougam, who had helped construct the bombs, leading to the suggestion that he had been involved in the March 11 Madrid bombings.El Periodico, \\"El Marroc identifica el presumpte cervell de la massacre de Madrid\\", March 28, 2004 In December 2003, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in absentia by a Moroccan court, for his role in the Casablanca bombings. On March 17, 2004, his wife and son were released from prison. Police set up a 24-hour stakeout of her house, and watched her every move. In April, Belgian newspapers in Antwerp received threatening notes that made reference to el-Mejjati, and suggested that Jewish locations in the city might become targets in the future. While authorities now began searching Europe in earnest for his whereabouts, others suggested that he had fled to Pakistan, Iran, Syria or Iraq. In early 2005, Riyadh officials intercepted text messages being sent by el-Mejjati to Great Britain authorising hawala money transfers.Dodd, Vikram.

A friend of the family had phoned to tell her that he had just heard a report that el-Mejjati had been killed on the television, to which she replied \\"Alhamdulillah\\". She then wrote to the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, and its Saudi counterpart, to ask them to positively confirm the identity of her husband and son through DNA testing, with which they complied. His wife sought permission to travel to Saudi Arabia to claim the body of her husband and son for proper burial, and proposed traveling with his second wife, stating that she could not find closure until she had seen the bodies herself.  Aftermath  His wife later gave an interview to France 3 television following his death,France 3, , January 21, 2006 in addition to Moroccan newspapers; stating that her husband had been a mujahideen, and not a terrorist. However, in other interviews she stubbornly stated that it was wrong to consider him a member of GICM since he \\"only belongs to Al-Qaeda\\".

A local gang planned to ram-raid the De Beers diamond exhibition which was being held in the riverside Dome at the time. The gang had then planned to escape via the Thames in a speedboat. The De Beers diamond exhibition had a number of jewels on display, including the Millennium Star, a flawless gem with an estimated worth of ¬£200 million and considered one of the most perfect gems in the world. Also on display were priceless blue diamonds. The attempted robbery was foiled by the Flying Squad of the Metropolitan Police Service, as a result of information from Kent Police Serious Crime who already had the gang members under surveillance for their suspected roles in a number of unsuccessful armoured vehicle robberies. The operation to foil the robbery was the biggest operation undertaken in the Flying Squad's history and at trial the judge in the case commended the way it was carried out. If the heist had succeeded, then with a haul of ¬£350 million worth of diamonds, it would have become one of the biggest robberies in history. Operation Magician In the summer of 2000, the Flying Squad became aware of a major armed robbery plot after a tip-off was received. The location of this robbery was unclear, but the identities of some of the robbers were known to the police. The police spent a number of months developing intelligence on the plot and set up an operation that they codenamed Operation Magician. During the intelligence gathering the location of the robbery was found to be the Millennium Dome in Greenwich. In February 2000, armed men tried to pull off a ¬£10 million raid on a security van in Nine Elms, South London. The gunmen had stopped the security lorry by blocking off both ends of Nine Elms Lane. They had planned to use their own lorry, which was carrying Christmas trees, as a battering ram. This lorry had a huge metal spike welded into the chassis and covered by the foliage. The gang planned to split the security lorry's rear doors with the ram. The gang's plan failed when a motorist who was late for work removed the keys from the ignition of the unattended Christmas tree van. The robbers, left with no choice, made their escape in an inflatable speedboat towards Chelsea. It was attempted again on 7 July in Aylesford, Kent. This time, the gang got even closer to the cash, with the metal spike being rammed into the van. They were seconds from taking the money when an unexpected police car appeared; the gang shot at the approaching car and again made their escape in an inflatable speedboat. Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford stated that this attempted robbery brought to his attention a gang which was capable of carrying out a robbery with this level of planning. This unsuccessful attack provided the police with important clues and led them to track some of the vehicles that were used in the raid to two isolated farms in rural Kent; these properties were then put under 24-hour surveillance. After this unsuccessful robbery the police received a tip-off about the Dome raid from an informer. At a meeting between detectives to discuss the Nine Elms Lane attempted robbery and the information that the informer had provided about the Dome raid, one detective who had recently visited the dome quipped, \\"Maybe they are after the Millennium jewels?\\" It was this comment that led to beginning an investigation into the raid. Surveillance On 1 September 2000, the team identified three of the suspected robbers ‚Äì Lee Wenham, Raymond Betson and William Cockram ‚Äì at the Dome. It was then found that every time they had visited the attraction, the Thames was at high tide. They were observed visiting the exhibition and recording video footage, leading the police to suspect that the exhibition could be a target. The surveillance on the men was significantly increased and the Dome was placed under close watch. The precautions taken by the Flying Squad included replacing the priceless gems with replicas of the same size, allowing the originals to be stored elsewhere, as well as installing a false wall inside the exhibit room, behind which 20 police were waiting in full tactical gear. Due to an increase in surveillance, the police discovered other members of the gang. These included Terry Millman, who was tasked with obtaining the getaway speedboat which was to be used for the escape. Cockram and Betson were also observed filming the surrounding river and jetty. The surveillance on the gang continued and their visits to the Dome became more frequent. In late September a few members of the gang were spotted testing a speedboat in a harbour in Kent. Aborted robbery attempts The Metropolitan Police were able to identify the possible days upon which the raid could take place and communicated this information to De Beers and the Dome's management. Two of the days that the police had identified resulted in aborted attempts. The first aborted attempt occurred in early October and was called off due to the malfunctioning of the speedboat which was to be used for the getaway. The second aborted attempt occurred one day before the date of the actual raid, but was cancelled upon the gang discovering the tide was too low to ensure a safe getaway. After this attempt the police suspected the raid was imminent and were convinced the raid would take place the following day. The police then replaced all Dome staff with armed undercover officers. On a number of days in October, the gang under surveillance looked as if they were about to commence the raid. Some members were spotted towing a speedboat to Greenwich and then placing the boat in the river opposite the Dome. This activity indicated to the Squad that the robbery was close; however, this was not the case. The delay was then investigated by police. The detectives analysed the times and days of the aborted attempts and found that they had something in common ‚Äì the high tide. Upon closer investigation the detectives found that, on each of the days when the robbery was aborted, the tide was at its highest possible level. The police began to investigate the patterns of the tide and were able to predict the possible times that the raid was to take place. One of the predicted days happened to be the date of the actual raid.  Day of raid  On 7 November at 9:30am, Operation Magician was under way commanded by Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford of the Metropolitan Police. A total of two hundred officers were involved in the operation, of which forty were from the Specialist Firearms Command (SCO19). A further sixty armed Flying Squad officers were stationed around the Thames, and twenty on the river itself to hamper any escape attempts. Surveillance officers were disguised as Dome employees. The Millennium Dome's CCTV room was used by the police as a control room. All the officers were briefed at 3 a.m., the day of the raid, on the contingency plans in place. Before the raid, some officers were positioned behind a dummy wall and others were dressed as cleaners and Dome employees, with their firearms concealed. Before the raid, four members of the gang had been identified in a JCB earth digger and all were wearing body armour and gas masks. The men were armed with smoke bombs, sledgehammers and nail guns, to be used to penetrate the security glass that was protecting the exhibit. The digger was used by the gang to break through the perimeter fence and to crash through the side wall of the Dome to reach the Money Zone, where the De Beers diamonds were kept. The digger came into the Dome itself, parked outside the Money Zone. Once inside Ciarrocchi started throwing smoke bombs and Cockram attempted to break the glass, where the diamonds were stored. Cockram knew that the bombproof glass could resist the force of a 60-ton ram raid, but his plan was to weaken the glass with three shots from a powerful Hilti nail gun and then another gang member, Robert Adams, would use a sledgehammer to break the weakened glass. The plan was working and the gang were inches away from the diamonds. The police pounced on four members of the gang, as they attempted to smash their way into the display case. As the four men were being arrested, other officers stationed around the Dome arrested another man who was in a high-powered boat on the Thames. The police also arrested a man whom they suspected of monitoring police radio frequencies: he was detained on the north shore of the Thames, opposite the Dome. All the suspects were apprehended; Millman was apprehended in a van. Once all the suspects had been detained, they were taken to police stations in South London. By 1200 GMT, some areas of the Dome had reopened, but other areas, including the Money Zone, were cordoned off. Detective Superintendent Shatford defended the decision that was taken to wait until the gang had reached the diamonds before arresting them. He said, \\"Our chief concern throughout was public safety. We decided it was better to let the robbers get to the vault where they were effectively imprisoned\\". The serious crime unit of the Kent Police worked in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service and arrested six more people in connection with the raid on Tuesday morning in the villages of Collier Street and Horsmonden. Police said the ages of the men ranged between 38 and 62. Trial The case came to trial a year later, on 8 November 2001. It was heard at the Old Bailey, and only six members of the gang were present, as Terry Millman had died of cancer. The court heard that Betson, Cockram, Ciarrocchi and Adams were caught by undercover officers in the Dome when they burst inside by using a JCB digger. On the first day of the defence case, Cockram discussed the lack of security inside the Dome: \\"I couldn't believe how simple it was.... I was thinking, this cannot be true, It was a gift. At first I had thought it was pie in the sky, but after going down there I couldn't believe security was so bad.... There was nobody in the vault, no security workers walking around\\". He stated that had the plan succeeded, \\"It would have taken a very short time from hitting the main gate to getting back across the Thames ‚Äì five minutes maximum\\". He also added, \\"No one was going to get hurt ‚Äì there was no one to hurt.... The Dome was always empty\\". Cockram explained that the nail gun that was bought by the gang was to be used to break the glass in the vault, not as a weapon. The ammonia was to be used to contaminate any traces of blood left by him, he said. He explained that the body armour was to be used after the raid for protection when he was scheduled to attend a meeting with associates to discuss the sale of the gems. Beston told the jury that his brother-in-law, Michael Waring, who was working at the Dome as part of the perimeter security, had told him about a school friend, Tony, who was also working there. Betson claimed that Waring had told him about a plan that Tony had put together: \\"Tony had got this plan together. He had a backer ‚Äì someone to buy the jewellery. He said the security was crap.\\" Betson then went on to say, \\"I had every confidence in him ‚Äì there was no way I thought he would betray me ‚Äì not for two seconds.... If this had come to me from someone else ‚Äì in a pub ‚Äì I would not have gone along with it but it was the background to where it had come from. It was solid.\\" Betson explained how he developed a trusting relationship with Waring: \\"I did not think he would try and do me any harm. I trusted.\\" Cockram also said that Betson had told him that Waring was in on the plan. Called as a prosecution witness, Waring \\"totally denied\\" that he was part of the plan or had offered to act in a criminal way by providing information on security. The gang had invested tens of thousands planning the raid and stored the equipment needed at a disused commercial yard in Plumstead, southeast London, as well as two remote Kent farms, near Maidstone. Terry Millman, who had died of cancer before the trial, used the name T. Diamond when he paid ¬£3,700 in cash to purchase a getaway speedboat at a yard in the seaside town of Whitstable, Kent. At the trial, Crown Prosecutor Martin Heslop, QC, said that \\"the raid was planned professionally, carefully and down to the last detail.... So well organised was it that it would probably have succeeded, had it not been for an equally professional, careful and detailed police operation.\\" Heslop stated that to minimize the risk to the public, \\"Arrangements were made to keep children away from the danger area, but for obvious reasons it was not practicable to alert all staff to the possibility of an attack.\\" After three months for the trial, the jury of seven women and five men reached a 10‚Äì2 majority verdict against the defendants after it had deliberated for nearly seven court days. After a week of deliberations the judge Michael Coombe accepted the majority verdict and so the men were found guilty. The judge told the defendants, \\"You played for very high stakes and you must have known perfectly well what the penalty would be if your enterprise did not succeed.\\" The judge added, \\"This was a wicked, professional plan and one which was carried out with the minutest attention to detail. Mercifully the police were on to it.\\" Beston and Cockram, considered the two leaders of the gang, were both given 18-year sentences. Aldo Ciarrocchi and Robert Adams were sentenced to 15 years.

The decision to award Cockram the money was condemned by the then-shadow home secretary David Davis. Cockram claimed that he was assaulted by a police officer at about 9.39am on the day of the raid, as he was lying handcuffed on the floor. One of the diamonds on display during the raid was a pear-shaped rare blue diamond. In March 2010, the London Evening Standard reported that the gem would be sold in a collection at Sotheby's Hong Kong, the following month. The blue diamond, which had an estimated worth of ¬£3 to ¬£3.8 million, was sold for ¬£4.2 million in April 2010 in Sotheby's Hong Kong. The Flying Squad arrested a man that it was believed was the mastermind behind the plot, but he was not present on the day of the raid. The man, Londoner James Hurley, was arrested following an undercover operation. The undercover operation tracked Hurley to Puerto Banus, on the Costa del Sol. The officer in charge of Operation Magician, Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Shatford, arrived in Spain with a team of three others and an emergency warrant for Hurley's arrest. Hurley had been under surveillance by the police when he was spotted refining and testing the robbery plan for weeks in advance. He was dubbed the \\"boatman\\" by the police as he was seen taking photographs of the Dome from vessels on the Thames and was organising the speedboat to be used for the getaway. Hurley disappeared at the last minute before the raid took place. After his disappearance, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the Spanish police were unable to locate him.

President Chester A. Arthur appointed a commission in May 1882 to recommend how much tariff rates should be reduced. The issue was controversial during the last three decades of the nineteenth century, making tariff revision a daunting task. Different constituents argued for opposite measures, often wanting to maintain tariffs on some items while reducing them on others. Support or opposition to tariffs often broke down along regional lines. In December 1882, the commission argued for substantial reductions. Protectionists in Congress by this time recognized that some type of reduction would be politically popular, but wanted to avoid a drastic cut. Lame-duck Republicans wanted to ensure that a tariff reduction passed before incumbent Democrats assumed control of Congress in the next session and lowered rates by a greater margin. The result was an enormously complicated and unpopular piece of legislation with no clear vision. Tariffs on some items were lowered. Others were inexplicably raised. Some goods had multiple tariffs rates placed on them to be applied in different locations with no clear reasoning. Tariff rates were reduced an average 1.47 percent, with most rates remaining around 35-40 percent. President Arthur was not the most enthusiastic supporter of tariff reduction, but he did feel that some meaningful reduction was needed and he recognized that the changes made by the \\"Mongrel Tariff\\" were insufficient. Thus, he directed U.S. Secretary of State Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen to establish reciprocal trade agreements with other nations, especially those with raw material the U.S. needed. The reciprocal trade agreements allowed Arthur to amend the tariff without having to involve himself in a congressional battle over the issue. Nix v. Hedden The law exempts fruit but not vegetables, causing tomato importers to file sue claiming that tomatoes are a fruit, resulting in the unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision in Nix v. Hedden (May 10, 1893) that tomatoes are to be considered a vegetable for purposes of this tariff.

Knowl Hill is a co-educational (mixed gender) school. There is a Junior school with pupils from years 3 to year 8, and a Senior school with years 8 to 11. It is a relatively small school with up to 67 pupils. Speech and Language Therapy and Occupational Therapy is provided on site, and integrated into the lessons as well as being offered on a 1:1 basis. Teaching is multi-sensory in style and dyslexia friendly. Following the creation of an art block, the school also places some emphasis on the visual arts. Although the school is in Surrey, pupils come from different Local Educational Authorities, for example Kingston upon Thames, West Sussex and Hampshire. History Knowl Hill was founded in 1984. As well as standard classrooms, the school also provides a science lab and an art block with a photography studio. The school itself is small, as are the grounds within which the school is located. Because of this, certain activities or sports take place outside the school, for example tennis which takes place on public tennis courts within the village of Pirbright itself around a one-minute walk from the school. Progression Some pupils return to mainstream education before year 11, however, the majority continue to take GCSEs and BTECs.

This is currently the most common infectious disease of dogs in Southern Africa. It is also known as tick bite fever or \\"Bosluiskoors\\" in Afrikaans. It is caused by a tiny parasite (Babesia canis) which is introduced into the body by a tick bite. This parasite then enters and destroys red blood cells. Biliary in dogs has a lot in common with malaria in man, except that in the latter, a mosquito is the vector.  Presentation  The peracute (very sudden and severe) form causes death within a few hours and treatment is of little avail. More commonly dogs suffer from the acute or subacute form. This is recognised by the dog being listless or lethargic, losing its appetite and running a temperature. If your dog is off its food, take a rectal temperature reading. If this is 39 ¬∞C or higher you should have the dog examined ‚Äì do not wait until its mucous membranes become pale, white or yellow, which commonly suggests a more advanced stage of the disease. Fever is present only while the patient is actively fighting the parasite; the disease may be present with a normal (38,5 ¬∞C) or subnormal temperature. Yellow faeces and brown or red urine also suggests the presence of biliary fever. Diagnosis A small drop of blood is collected and a smear made. Once stained, the parasites can be seen in the red blood cells under microscopic evaluation.http://www.vetcareclinics.co.za/educare/an-overview-of-biliary-in- dogs/4  Prevention  A vaccine has been launched in South Africa at the end of 2008. Nobivac Piro, has been proven effective when combined with twice yearly booster shots. Rely on reducing the dog's tick population by regular use of approved tick control measures that may be recommended by a veterinarian.  Treatment  Treatment should only be given after a positive diagnosis has been made by means of a blood test. Usually treatment is effective, depending on several factors, but the majority will respond. In early cases simple injections are usually sufficient, but in others blood transfusions, electrolyte infusions per vein, liver tonics, blood-building, etc., may be required.  Diet  Avoid fatty foods, and give a good quality balanced dog food. A tonic and/or follow up treatment may be required if the animal does not appear to be responding to the initial treatment.

It was one of the first Earth observation satellites developed by NASA in response to the National Research Council's Decadal Survey. NASA's investment is of US$916 million (design, development, launch, and operations). Mission overview SMAP provides measurements of the land surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw state with near-global revisit coverage in 2-3 days. SMAP surface measurements are coupled with hydrologic models to infer soil moisture conditions in the root zone. These measurements enable science applications users to: # Understand processes that link the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. # Estimate global water and energy fluxes at the land surface. # Quantify net carbon flux in boreal landscapes. # Enhance weather and climate forecast skill. # Develop improved flood prediction and drought monitoring capability. SMAP observations are acquired for a period of at least three years after launch, and the 81 kg of propellant that it carries should allow the mission to operate well beyond its design lifetime. A comprehensive validation, science, and the application program are implemented, and all data are publicly available through the NASA archive centers. Measurement concept The SMAP observatory includes a dedicated spacecraft and instrument suite in a near-polar, Sun-synchronous orbit. The SMAP measurement system consists of a radiometer (passive) instrument and a synthetic-aperture radar (active) instrument operating with multiple polarizations in the L-band range. The combined active and passive measurement approach takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the radar and the sensing accuracy of the radiometer. The active and passive sensors provide coincident measurements of the surface- emission and backscatter. The instruments sense conditions in the top 5 cm of soil through moderate vegetation cover to yield globally mapped estimates of soil moisture and its freeze-thaw state. The spacecraft orbits Earth once every 98.5 minutes and repeats the same ground track every eight days. Scientific payload The satellite carries two scientific instruments: a radar and a radiometer, that share a single feed and deployable 6 m reflector antenna system, built by Northrop Grumman,https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/earth/smap/brochure/SMAP_Mission_Brochure_final.pdf that rotates around the nadir axis making conical scans of the surface. The wide swath provides near-global revisit every 2-3 days. SMAP system characteristics {  ! Characteristic ! Radar !

Cal Poly designed the core-satellite bus, while the scientific payload is supplied by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The University of Wisconsin, at Madison, and Scientific Solutions, Inc. (SSI) are developing the scientific objectives and providing guidance for instrument development. ExoCube measures the density of hydrogen, oxygen, helium, and nitrogen in Earth's upper atmosphere (exosphere and thermosphere) using direct mass spectroscopy measurements. The size of ExoCube is three CubeSat units, or 30 x 10 x 10 cm. * GRIFEX, the Geo- cape Roic In-Flight performance Experiment, developed by the University of Michigan's Michigan Exploration Laboratory in partnership with NASA's Earth Science Technology Office and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is a technology validation mission that performs an engineering assessment of a JPL-developed all digital high-performance focal plane array consisting of an innovative in-pixel analog-to-digital readout integrated circuit. Its high throughput capacity enables the proposed Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) satellite mission concept to make hourly high spatial and spectral resolution measurements of rapidly changing atmospheric chemistry and pollution with the Panchromatic Fourier Transform Spectrometer (PanFTS) instrument in development. GRIFEX advances the technology required for future space-borne measurements of atmospheric composition from geostationary orbit that are relevant to climate change, as well as future missions that require advanced detectors in support of the Earth Science Decadal Survey. The size of GRIFEX is three CubeSat units, or 30 x 10 x 10 cm. * FIREBIRD-II (A and B), developed by the University of New Hampshire, Montana State University, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Aerospace Corporation. FIREBIRD-II is a two-CubeSat space weather project to resolve the spatial scale, size, and energy dependence of electron microbursts in the Van Allen radiation belts. Relativistic electron microbursts appear as short periods of intense electron precipitation measured by particle detectors on low-altitude spacecraft, seen when their orbits cross magnetic field lines that thread the outer radiation belt. FIREBIRD-II provides dual point radiation belt measurements that offer insight into electron acceleration and loss processes in the outer Van Allen radiation belt. Each of the FIREBIRD CubeSats is 1.5 CubeSat units in size, or 15 x 10 x 10 cm. The CubeSat projects are deployed at a minimum of 2,896 seconds after the separation of the Soil Moisture Active Passive observatory, into a 440 x 670 km, 99.12¬∞ inclination orbit. Program description SMAP is a directed mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The SMAP project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with participation by the Goddard Space Flight Center. SMAP builds on the heritage and risk reduction activities of NASA's cancelled ESSP Hydros Mission. Science and applications SMAP observations are used to characterize hydrologic and ecosystem processes including land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and carbon. Among the users of SMAP data are hydrologists, weather forecasters, climate scientists and agricultural and water resource managers. Additional users include fire hazard and flood disaster managers, disease control and prevention managers, emergency planners and policy makers. SMAP soil moisture and freeze-thaw information directly benefit several societal applications areas, including: Weather and climate forecasting Initialization of numerical weather prediction models and seasonal climate models with accurate soil moisture information extend forecast lead times and enhance prediction skill. Drought SMAP soil moisture information improves the monitoring and forecasting of drought conditions, enabling new capabilities for mitigating drought impacts. Floods and landslides Hydrologic forecast systems calibrated and initialized with high-resolution soil moisture fields lead to improved flood forecasts and provide essential information on the potential for landslides. Agricultural productivity Soil moisture observations from SMAP lead to improvements in crop yield forecasts and enhance the capabilities of crop water stress decision support systems for agricultural productivity. Human health Improved seasonal soil moisture forecasts directly benefit famine early warning systems. Benefits also are realized through improved predictions of heat stress and virus spread rates, and improved disaster preparation and response. Status In August 2015, scientists completed their initial calibration of the two instruments on board, however, SMAP's radar stopped transmitting 7 July due to an anomaly that was investigated by a team at JPL. The team identified the anomaly to the power supply for the radar's high-power amplifier. On 2 September 2015, NASA announced that the amplifier failure meant that the radar could no longer return data. The science mission continues with data being returned only by the radiometer instrument. SMAP's prime mission ended in June 2018. The 2017 Earth Science senior review endorsed the SMAP mission for continued operations through 2020, and preliminarily, through 2023.https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fy2021_congressional_justification.pdf See also * Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite Notes References External links * SMAP website at NASA/JPL * SMAP data at the National Snow and Ice Data Center * \\"Technology Innovations Spin NASA's SMAP into Space\\", article at NASA.gov * \\"NASA's New Studies of Earth's Seas, Skies and Soils\\", article at NASA.gov Category:Earth observation satellites of the United States Category:Spacecraft launched in 2015 Category:Spacecraft launched by Delta II rockets Category:NASA satellites Category:Space synthetic aperture radar ","title":"Soil Moisture Active Passive"},{"id":"20301014","text":"Lee Eon (5 February 1981 ‚Äì 21 August 2008) was a South Korean actor and model.

In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called \\"the man who beat the man\\". Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted. History Boxing John L. Sullivan, the first lineal champion, came to welcome his successor, Jack Johnson. Ever since, it has been a tradition for champions of the past to attend title fights of recent champions, thus to \\"pass the torch\\" and legitimize their reign. The concept of a lineal champion was developed by boxing fans dissatisfied by the tendency of each of the various sanctioning bodies (WBC, WBA, IBF, etc.) to recognize different champions, and in particular to strip a champion of his title for refusing to fight its top-ranked contender. Prior to the 1970s, this rarely happened; the National Boxing Association (NBA) and the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) sometimes recognized different champions, but there was usually only a short interval before one champion defeated the other. In this era, a title vacancy was generally filled by having a single- elimination tournament box-off between two or more top-ranked contenders. The lineal championship is intended as a return to that era. Several top boxers have specified holding the lineal championship as a personal accomplishment (e.g. Lennox Lewis) or goal (e.g., Nate Campbell). Many boxing experts view the lineal championship as a prestigious status which trumps the world titles being issued by the sanctioning bodies (e.g. Steve Farhood). Mixed martial arts In mixed martial arts (MMA), the lineal championship is of particular relevance because until the mid 2000s, the top-ranked fighters were spread out amongst a number of mixed martial arts promotions across the globe. This included Japanese promotions such as Pride Fighting Championships, Pancrase, and Dream as well as US-based promotions such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), World Extreme Cage Fighting (WEC) and Strikeforce. The UFC eventually purchased most of the major promotions and, as a result, all of the lineal champions are currently signed with the promotion. Former UFC champion Jon Jones was suspended and stripped of the title for reasons resulting from an alleged hit and run felony charge. Daniel Cormier, whom Jones had just defeated, subsequently won the vacant UFC title. These events, however, do not affect the lineal title because Jon Jones was never defeated in the octagon. Issues An issue in the implementation of a lineal championship is what to do if the lineal champion retires, dies, or moves to a different weight class. Different ways of resolving this vacancy mean the lineal championship may itself be subject to dispute. Since the modern lineal championship is merely a notional title tracked by fans, there is no money or organization to arrange a box-off to fill a vacant title, and there may not be consensus on who the top contenders are - this is true both for boxing and MMA. One example given by Cliff Rold of BoxingScene is the light heavyweight title, considered vacant from the time Michael Spinks moved up to heavyweight in 1985 until some time in the 1990s. While Rold considers Virgil Hill's defeat of Henry Maske as the beginning of the next line of succession, as does Cyber Boxing Zone, Ring magazine controversially traces the title through Roy Jones Jr. Another criticism of the lineal championship is that a fighter may defend it against inferior opponents. For example, George Foreman was considered lineal champion from 1994 until 1997, when Shannon Briggs beat him. After the WBA and IBF stripped him of their titles in 1995, Foreman fought only two, low-ranked opponents before Briggs. The lineal champion is not necessarily the boxer viewed as the best. Cyber Boxing Zone and BoxingScene considered Zsolt Erdei the lineal light-heavyweight champion from his 2004 defeat of Julio C√©sar Gonz√°lez until 2009, when he vacated his title and moved up to cruiserweight; as he had not fought the highest-ranked opponents in the interim, Cliff Rold conceded, \\"while the concept of a champion needing to lose a title in the ring is solid, the practice is sometimes highly flawed\\". In mixed martial arts, most controversy centers on the proper method for determining the first lineal MMA champion within each weight class. Early fights did not follow the currently agreed upon weight classes determined by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, a rule set that was not finalized until the year 2000. For example: Some consider Mark Coleman's victory in 1997, when he became the first UFC Heavyweight champion, to be the beginning of the Heavyweight lineage. Others argue that Royce Gracie's victory at UFC 1 in 1993 is the true heavyweight starting point due to the Open-weight nature of the tournament. In this case, however, the lineal titles converge and unify with the current UFC Heavyweight title, so the champion remains the same regardless of which lineage one chooses to follow. Versions Manny Pacquiao has won lineal championships in five different weight divisions, more than any other boxer The Ring The boxing magazine The Ring has its own lineal championship. The original sequence was from its first publication in the 1920s until its hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When it started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion. CBZ commented in 2004, \\"The Ring has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\\". In 2007, The Ring was acquired by the owners of fight promoter Golden Boy Promotions, which has publicized The Ring's world championship when this is at stake in fights it promotes (such as Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones, Jr. in 2008). Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, The Ring allows fights between a #1 or #2 contender and a #3, #4, or #5 contender to fill a vacant title. This has prompted further doubts about its credibility. Sports Illustrated used The Ring lineages for galleries of lineal heavyweight and middleweight champions. Cyber Boxing Zone The Cyber Boxing Zone (CBZ) website maintains lists of lineal champions, with input from boxing historian Tracy Callis of the International Boxing Research Organization. These were first published in 1994, and are retrospective to the introduction of Marquess of Queensberry Rules in 1885. The historical lists have sometimes been updated when new information about old fights comes to light. If its lineal champion at one weight class moves to another class, CBZ does not automatically vacate his title. BoxingScene BoxingScene.com disagrees with the lineages given by The Ring and by CBZ, especially in lower weight divisions with a higher rate of champions changing division. BoxingScene has traced its own most recent lineages, generally back to the 1990s. Transnational Boxing Rankings Board The Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) was formed in October 2012 as a volunteer initiative to provide boxing with authoritative top-ten rankings, identify the singular world champion of every division by strict reasoning and common sense, and to insist on the sport's reform. Board membership includes fifty respected boxing journalists and record keepers from around the world who are uncompromised by sanctioning bodies and promoters. The board was formed to continue where The Ring \\"left off\\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of the editorial board headed by Nigel Collins. After the new editors of The Ring announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012,The Ring updates championship policy three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. These three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England. The board only awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet, and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \\"true champions\\" each weight classes. Since its inception, TBRB has been viewed by many boxing historians and analysts as the superior version of lineal championship (e.g. Teddy Atlas) and their rankings as the most authoritative in boxing today. Lineal Boxing Champion Since April 6, 2019, LinealBoxingChampion.com (LBC) has been producing monthly, non-computerized divisional rankings for women's professional boxing. Prior to this, no such impartial, independent rankings existed. The rankings are compiled by an international team of ten boxing experts, which includes site editor and member of the International Boxing Research Organization, Adam McMeeking (from the UK)https://www.ibroresearch.com/about/member-list/, International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame 2019 inductee, David Avila (from the U.S.), Max Boxing journalisthttps://www.maxboxing.com/authors and former Boxing Monthly contributor, Anthony Cocks (from Australia) http://www.boxingmonthly.com/stories/aussie-wrap-up-for-october/and Ring Magazine contributor, Yuriko Miyata (from Japan). In keeping with the tradition, the lineal champion status is awarded to the winner of a fight between the number one and number two ranked contenders. Currently LBC recognizes four true lineal champions in women's boxing: Katie Taylor at Lightweight, Jessica McCaskill at Junior Welterweight, Claressa Shields at Middleweight, and Geovana Peres at Heavyweight. Due to its limited number of competitors LBC does not recognize the light heavyweight division.

A variety of Christian apologetics, called presuppositional apologetics, argues that the existence or non-existence of God is the basic presupposition of all human thought, and that all people arrive at a worldview which is ultimately determined by the theology they presuppose. Evidence and arguments are only developed after the fact in an attempt to justify the theological assumptions already made. According to this view, it is impossible to demonstrate the existence of God unless one presupposes that God exists, with the stance that modern science relies on methodological naturalism, and thus is incapable of discovering the supernatural. It thereby fashions a Procrustean bed which rejects any observation which would disprove the naturalistic assumption. Apologetics argue that the resulting worldview is inconsistent with itself and therefore irrational (for example, via the Argument from morality or via the Transcendental argument for the existence of God).

It is responsible for the operation, maintenance and development of the French high-voltage transmission system, which at approximately , is Europe's largest. \\"... le plus grand r√©seau de transport d'Europe\\" (\\"...the biggest transmission network in Europe\\"). RTE is a wholly owned subsidiary of the partially public-owned French generator √âlectricit√© de France (EdF), headquartered in Paris. It is a limited liability corporation, known in France as a soci√©t√© anonyme.  Corporation   History  RTE was formed as a result of European Directive No. 96/92/EC of December 1996, which directed that at least 26% of member countries' electricity sales be open to competition, and became law in France in February 2000. The directive required France to liberalise its electricity market by unbundling its generation and transmission activities, which until then had been fully controlled by EdF. RTE was established in July 2000 as a division of EdF, with a public charter to guarantee equitable access to its electricity market, and to secure the continuity and quality of electricity supply. Further legal acts in July 2004 and August 2005 enforced the legal separation of RTE from EdF, transforming it into a limited liability subsidiary, and granted it trademark rights to its logo and the name R√©seau de Transport d'√âlectricit√©.  Regulation  RTE's activities are overseen by the Government regulatory body Commission de r√©gulation de l'√©nergie (Commission for Energy Regulation) (CRE). CRE's duties in this regard include ensuring RTE facilitates access to its network, and to survey and regulate the electricity market while opening it up to competition.  Commercial operations  RTE declared a turnover of ‚Ç¨4,126 million in 2007, and yielding a profit of ‚Ç¨466 million, both up slightly from the previous year, which RTE attributed to increases in network access payments and revenue derived from interconnector capacity auctions. The workforce in the same year was 8,279.  Data portal  RTE operate an open data portal named Open Data RTE which serves French electricity system data for public reuse.  Transmission network  RTE's transmission system operates at voltages of 63 kV, 90 kV, 150 kV, 225 kV and 400 kV. RTE deems the 63 to 150 kV circuits to be \\"high voltage\\" and the 225 kV and 400 kV \\"extra high voltage\\". As of the end of 2006, there were of transmission lines interconnecting 2,490 substations. Most of the transmission network is carried on 77,544 route-kilometres (48,180 mi) of overhead power lines; only of the network consists of underground cable. In common with the rest of Europe, the supply frequency is a nominal 50 Hz. Demand and trade France's peak demand occurs during the winter, and in 2007 was 88,960 MW. The annual production of electricity was 544.7 TWh, generated from an installed capacity of 108,319 MW, almost 60% of which was nuclear. RTE's network interconnects with those of its counterparts in most of France's neighbouring countries, and the international trade (both import and export) of electricity is a major contribution to RTE's business activities. France is the largest exporter of electricity in Europe, and the country is linked via a total of 44 high voltage interconnections to Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom, the last of which by means of an HVDC submarine power cable. France's balance of trade in this market is normally positive; in 2007, exports of electrical energy totalled 83.0 TWh and imports 27.5 TWh. The largest trading partner was Switzerland, which imported 26.1 TWh of French electricity and exported 4.4 TWh back.

The station was accused of broadcasting partial information, as well as inciting hatred and division.

Through touring and recording the Ergs! became recognized on a national and international level, touring and playing with such noted acts as The Descendents, The Bouncing Souls, Lifetime, Less Than Jake, The Loved Ones, The Gaslight Anthem, Dillinger Four, None More Black, The Explosion, Municipal Waste, Lemuria, and more. They have appeared at a number of festivals including Riot Fest, Insubordination Fest, and The Fest, the latter of which the band played four consecutive years, including as a headlining act in 2008, and making a fifth appearance as a headlining reunion act in 2016. History Early history The Ergs! was formed in 2000 by Old Bridge High School students whose previous band the Flatliners (unrelated to other bands with this moniker) had broken up. The band members shared a common passion for all forms of music and culture with no desire to be pigeonholed. In a 2007 interview with Steve Bove of the Asbury Park Press, Joey Erg cited John Coltrane's seminal jazz record Giant Steps with instilling in the band aspirations \\"to maybe making music that was more than just punk.\\" Even early songs poked fun at generic songwriting, such as \\"Xerox Your Genitals, Not the Ramones,\\" which encourage punk bands to strive for their own sound, because there would only ever be one Ramones. The band quickly recorded a pair of CD- Rs, f'n and Digital Endpoints, selling them at live shows throughout New Jersey. The band went on its first tour outside New Jersey as the support of Dirt Bike Annie, a noted pop-punk band for whom Mikey Erg also played drums. New York's Whoa Oh Records took an early interest in the band and issued their first 7\\", entitled 3 Guys, 12 Eyes, which was soon followed by a self-released CD-EP, \\"The Ben Kweller EP,\\" whose artwork (and lyrics) only referred to indie darling Kweller, but not satirically as has been sometimes perceived. The Ergs set out on a brief tour in the spring/early summer of 2003 in support of The Ben Kweller EP with their friends and Whoa Oh labelmates, Charlie Brown Gets A Valentine (touring to promote their album \\"Dismissed\\"), called the \\"Who Grabbed My Ass? Tour\\". It began at the now closed Uncle Joe's in Jersey City, NJ, looped out west as far as Columbia, MO and ended with a show in an apartment in Philadelphia that featured Dirt Bike Annie. Dorkrockcorkrod After a few tours around the United States, the band entered Technical Ecstasy Studios with Chris Pierce to record their first full length. Dorkrockcorkrod was originally released on CD by Whoa Oh on June 15, 2004 (and on vinyl in 2005 by Don Giovanni Records). While playing more and more shows at home to increasingly large and rabid audiences, the band began to draw attention on a national level, including that of hip-hop artist and Adult Swim contributor mc chris. This led to the band writing an original song, \\"All Kids Out Of the Pool\\" to be used in an Adult Swim promo spot. In the summer of 2005, mc chris chose The Ergs! and North Carolina's SNMNMNM as the openers for his 2 and a half month Revenge of the Nerd Tour. With fans now awaiting the follow-up to dorkrockcorkrod, the band returned to Technical Ecstasy with Chris Pierce and emerged with the 7-track album Jersey's Best Prancers. The title and artwork parodied that of Lifetime. BuzzFeed included the album at number 24 on their \\"36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F‚Äî‚Äîing Die\\" list. Upstairs/Downstairs On the strength of dorkrockcorkrod, Jersey's Best Prancers, and a various singles, the Ergs! took their New Brunswick cohorts, Hunchback, on their Discover America Tour in the summer of 2006. At the midpoint of the tour in Seattle, WA, the band, with Hunchback in tow, entered the studio of Conrad Uno, a seasoned record producer whose past credits include the Grammy-nominated debut of The Presidents of the United States of America, as well as Mudhoney and The Young Fresh Fellows. Taking its title from an infamous nervous breakdown suffered by Can vocalist Malcolm Mooney, the resulting LP Upstairs/Downstairs was released by Portland, Oregon's Dirtnap Records. Styles which had previously been alluded to were introduced full-bore on the record. The album's closing title track was an almost 20 minute expression of romantic remorse and mental instability that erupts into an abrasive noise collage. Reception of the record among fans of the band's earliest pop punk work was at first confused, but the record found an audience quickly. Janelle Jones of Alternative Press reviewed the record, hailing it as \\"the punk album to beat this year.\\" Stewart Mason of Allmusic rated it three and a half stars out of five, calling it \\"notably less willfully silly than what has come before.\\" Mason praised one of the tracks \\"Books About Miles Davis\\" as \\"a particular gem.\\" As the band embarked on another full-US tour, this time with Buffalo indie rock trio Lemuria. During this tour, the band was contacted by New Brunswick punk rock veterans The Bouncing Souls who wanted the Ergs! to be a part of a tour with the Souls and Lifetime celebrating the generations of punk rock in New Brunswick and New Jersey at large. More recording followed, with the band releasing numerous 7\\" vinyl EPs and singles, as well as more touring, both on their own and supporting larger acts such as Philadelphia's The Loved Ones and fellow NJ residents The Gaslight Anthem. Hindsight Is 20/20 Following the success of Upstairs/Downstairs, Dirtnap Records offered to issue a compilation record of the Ergs' now sizable catalog of singles, b-sides, and compilation appearances. The CD, entitled Hindsight Is 20/20 My Friend (after a line spoken by Chevy Chase in the movie Dirty Work) was released in the summer of 2008, just as the Ergs! and Hunchback took to the road again for the Jackalry Across America Tour. Despite the tour's success, by its end Hunchback had chosen to break up, and the Ergs! would follow suit in a matter of weeks, announcing that they would complete their remaining tour plans and play a final show in November at the Asbury Lanes. In October 2008, the Ergs began their final bout of touring with dates supporting Less Than Jake alongside Landmines and Bomb the Music Industry!, followed by a Canadian and American tour which included 2 shows at Chicago's Riot Fest. This tour closed with a spot supporting Dillinger Four at the Brooklyn, NY record release show for D4's long-awaited 4th LP, Civil War. The Ergs! bid farewell to their largest collection of fans from around the US and the globe at No Idea Records' The Fest 7 in Gainesville, Florida, where they were the only band on the headlining stage at the Fest to play two consecutive sets. During the first set, the band played songs from throughout their career, and during the second, played dorkrockcorkrod in its entirety. On November 13, 2008, the Ergs! played an unannounced set at a Lemuria show at the Parlor, a New Brunswick basement. On Friday, November 14 they played Upstairs at the Khyber in Philadelphia. On Saturday, November 15, 2008, The Ergs! played 2 shows at the Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, NJ. The band played long, retrospective sets at each show, and at the late show closed with an extended version Upstairs/Downstairs that eventually incorporated all the night's band members and much of the audience demolishing instruments. Post-breakup activity After the final Ergs! performance, several 7\\" records and compilation appearances were released posthumously. Though each release was planned prior to the breakup, some recording sessions and in some cases writing for these records took place after the final show. The band also honored a commitment to a friend of the band to play a set of their own songs as well as requested covers at his wedding, which took place after the final show, but was not open to the public. After their split, the members of The Ergs! went on to form numerous groups. Many of these bands have been collaborations with members of Hunchback. Major post-Ergs! projects include: Mikey Erg has continued touring and recording with numerous bands, including The Unlovables, The Dopamines, The Slow Death, and Worriers, usually playing guitar or drums. Projects for which he was the primary songwriter included the hardcore band Psyched To Die and the duo Ergquist, before he began touring and recording as a solo musician. Although Mikey would play guitar and sing with no accompaniment in his early solo shows, his studio recordings would typically feature full-band arrangements, on which he played all the instruments. In 2016, however, Mikey formed a studio band to record the LP Tentative Decisions, produced by Jeff Rosenstock and released by Don Giovanni Records. Subsequent to this release, Mikey has favored playing live with a full backing band. Both Psyched To Die and Mikey's live band have featured former Hunchback member J Nixon on bass. Additionally, Mikey is the drummer for the LLC, the house band for the television show The Chris Gethard Show. Joey Erg formed the surf-influenced hardcore punk band Night Birds with vocalist Brian Gorsegner, a multi- instrumentalist and veteran of numerous New Jersey bands. The original lineup of Night Birds featured Hunchback member Mike Hunchback on guitar. Hunchback departed after the band's second LP, and was replaced by guitarist PJ Russo. Subsequently, the band was signed to Fat Wreck Chords, and continues to tour and record. Jeff Erg briefly joined Hunchback, playing in both bands on the final Ergs!/Hunchback tour. After briefly playing as a solo artist following the split of both bands, Jeff regrouped with the Hunchback rhythm section of J Nixon (bass) and Miranda Taylor (drums) to form the post-punk band Black Wine. Black Wine toured the US extensively and released 4 LPs, all released by Don Giovanni Records, before going on hiatus in 2015. In 2017, the band played sporadic shows before playing an official final performance. Although the band has not ruled out collaborating in the future, as of 2017, there are no plans for further live shows or new recordings.  2010 Reunion  On December 5, 2010, The Ergs! and Hunchback played a pair of one-off reunion shows at Asbury Lanes. The motivation for the bands' decision to reunite was to raise money to offset medical bills for Hunchback bassist J Hunchback's mother, Jackie Nixon. The reunion shows coincided with many other fundraising efforts that weekend, including raffles, limited edition poster sales, auctions, and donated door money from other shows, including a show in Jersey City at which Mikey Erg performed solo, and Mikey Erg & (Ergs! roadie) Jay Insult's birthday party (also at Asbury Lanes), which featured a performance by The Hamiltons, a Canadian punk rock band with whom The Ergs! normally share an intense rivalry. On the day of the reunion shows, each band played an afternoon and an evening set, which were largely identical, although the Ergs! made the spontaneous decision to play the early song \\"Pool Pass\\" at the evening show. No new material was written or played, however the Ergs! performed a cover of \\"Tommy Gun\\" by The Clash, a song they had never played in full before, but had constantly referenced by teasing the opening drumroll and guitar riff to punctuate their live sets for years.  2011 Karaoke Performance  On December 31, 2011, The Ergs! performed a set of live band punk rock karaoke at the Asbury Lanes New Year's Eve party. Between 9 pm and midnight, the band played as the backing band for audience members who signed up to sing from a repertoire of over 100 songs, mostly of the punk/hardcore/new wave idiom. While the band were billed by name, as per assurances in advance of the performance, no original Ergs! songs were performed, and at no point did any of the three band members perform lead vocals. The band had previously performed as the Asbury Lanes' house karaoke band during their active tenure.  2016 Reunion, Goddamn Death Dedication, and Hindsight is 20/20, Volume 2  In April 2016 it was announced that The Ergs! would be reuniting at The Fest's 15th anniversary. On May 6, 2016 Chris Gethard announced via Twitter that The Ergs! would reunite prior to Fest on The Chris Gethard Show at the May 12, 2016 taping. The band played a full set for the studio audience and viewers watching the live taping online, only a portion of which was broadcast on the episode. The full live performance was archived on the show's YouTube channel shortly thereafter. The Ergs! played two sets at The Fest 15. On Friday, October 28, 2016, they played on the headlining stage at Bo Diddley Plaza in Gainesville. On Saturday, October 29, 2016, they played a surprise second set at a smaller Gainesville club called the High Dive, which was announced that same day. Amidst practicing for these reunion shows, the band found time to return to the studio to record a new 4-song 7\\" EP, entitled Goddamn Death Dedication (a reference to a famous epithet used by radio DJ Casey Kasem), which saw release on Whoa-Oh Records. The record included one new song written by each band member, as well as \\"No Sharona,\\" a no-wave- inspired cover of \\"My Sharona\\" by The Knack. Additionally, the band self- released the long-delayed second collection record, titled Hindsight is 20/20, My Friend Vol. 2: OK, Enough Reminiscing. The collection record featured recordings released subsequent to those on Vol. 1. The Goddamn Death Dedication material was not included on the collection.  2017 Reunion  On Saturday, July 22, 2017, The Ergs! played a show at Sunnyvale in Brooklyn, NY for the 40th birthday party of longtime friend of the band, Fid. The show was a benefit for Planned Parenthood, and also featured The Besties (also reuniting for the show), Shellshag, Weird Skin, and Nervous Triggers. The Ergs! played under the pseudonym \\"Fidnight Oil,\\" and played an atypical set, eschewing many of their more popular pop-punk songs in favor of a set with numerous original hardcore & thrash songs as well as covers. It was announced that The Ergs! would be the direct support band for The Descendents at the New Jersey stop on their 2017 tour, playing at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, NJ, located a very short distance from where the three band members had grown up and formed the band. Also on the bill were Ruth Ruth. The show sold out well in advance of it taking place on Saturday, December 02, 2017. Shortly after the Descendents show sold out, the Ergs! announced that they would be playing a headlining show the following day, Sunday, December 03, 2017, at the House of Independents in Asbury Park, NJ. The Ergs! selected the opening bands Exmaid, Nervous Triggers, and The Weird Fantasy Band, all of whom feature at least one former member of Hunchback. Hunchback made an unannounced appearance, playing 2 songs to open the show, as well as joining the Ergs! onstage to collaborate on \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\" at the very end of the show. The Ergs! set also featured a guest appearance by Marisa Bergquist (formerly of The Besties), who played keys on the song \\"Anthem For a New Amanda.\\" Discography Demos {  !Year !Title !Label !Format !Other information - 2000 f'n Frilly Pink Records CD-R  - 2000 Digital Endpoints Frilly Pink Records CD-R  * Recorded in the style of a science fiction radio drama - } EPs and singles {  !Year !Title !Label !Format !Other information - 2001 3 Guys, 12 Eyes Whoa Oh Records 7\\" vinyl  - 2002 The Ben Kweller EP Fongul Records CD  * 2009 re-release on 12\\" vinyl on Freedom School Records - 2003 Cotton Pickin' Minute Prison Jazz Records 7\\" vinyl  * features original country songs - 2004 All the Hits!

It is based in K√≥pavogur, Iceland, and currently plays in the √örvalsdeild kvenna, the top-tier women's football league in Iceland. They finished second in the league in 2017 and first in 2018. History The women's football team is the powerhouse of Icelandic women's football and nearly made a clean sweep in 2005, winning the championship and cup plus almost all of the younger division titles. In International competitions Brei√∞ablik has taken part in The Nordic Open Championship in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 among teams such as Fortuna Hj√∏rring from Denmark, Trondheims √ñrn from Norway and HJK from Finland. Brei√∞ablik was the first Icelandic team to earn a seat in The European Women's Cup 2001‚Äì02 but due to financial reasons Brei√∞ablik did not participate and KR was therefore the first Icelandic team to take part. Brei√∞ablik did however take part in the Women's Cup the following year where they played in group with the Danish Champions Fortuna Hj√∏rring, Belarus Champions FC Babruyshanka and Moldovan Champions FC Codru Anenii Noi. There Brei√∞ablik won Iceland's first win in the Women's Cup against FC Codru Anenii Noi. In the Women's Cup 2006‚Äì07 Brei√∞ablik qualified again and this time won their group with some differences. The team did not conceive a goal and scored 14 in the three matches. Their opponents were SV Neulengbach from Austria, SU 1¬∞ Dezembro from Portugal and Newtownabbey Strikers from Northern Ireland. In the second qualifying round Brei√∞ablik was very unlucky to have as an opponent the great team from Germany 1. FFC Frankfurt. It turned out the German team was too big for the Icelandic team but they did well and came in second with two wins, against HJK from Finland and Universitet Vitebsk from Belarus and qualified to the quarter finals. In the quarterfinals in 2006‚Äì2007 competition Brei√∞ablik played home and away matches against the team that later won the competition Arsenal Ladies FC from England. No need to say Arsenal was way better team but Brei√∞ablik could still walk strong and hold their head up high. The third time Brei√∞ablik qualified to the European Women's Cup the name of the Competition had been changed to UEFA Women's Champion League and the season was 2010‚Äì11. Brei√∞ablik came in as a second Icelandic team to the competition and had to play in the Qualifying round, group 4 along with FCF Juvisy Essonne from France, FC Targu Mures from Romania and FC Levadia Tallinn from Estonia. Brei√∞ablik came in second in the qualifying round with 7 points like FCF Juvisy and was one of two teams to qualify to the main round of 32 teams. In 2015, the team won the Icelandic championship for the sixteenth time. On 17 August 2018, Brei√∞ablik won the Icelandic Cup for the 12th time, defeating Stjarnan 2-1 in the Cup finals. On 17 September 2018, Brei√∞ablik won the Icelandic championship for the seventeenth time.

Popularized by the jazz pianist George Shearing, it is a way to implement the \\"block chord\\" method of harmony on a keyboard instrument. The locked hands technique requires the pianist to play the melody using both hands in unison. The right hand plays a 4-note chord inversion in which the melody note is the highest note in the voicing. The other 3 notes of the chord are voiced as closely as possible below the melody note, which is the definition of a block chord. The left hand doubles the melody note one octave lower. To achieve this result, the pianist's hands must be placed close together on the keyboard and both hands move simultaneously in the same direction. To an observer, the pianist's hands appear to be locked together. The technique had been employed by numerous jazz pianists prior to Shearing. (Phil Moore, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Red Garland),Block chord Shearing said he was first exposed to it through Milt Buckner, the pianist for Lionel Hampton and the musician considered the originator of the technique. This harmonic technique was also used in the horn arrangements of Glenn Miller's big band and is a staple of modern big band arranging.

He joined No Limit Records in 1998 under the new stage name of Lil Italy, and released his first and only album with No Limit, On Top of da World, in 1999. The record peaked at #99 on the Billboard 200 and #20 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and featured guest appearances from the likes of Silkk the Shocker, Snoop Dogg, and Magic, but Lil Italy was soon dropped from the label due to poor sales. Lil Italy's second album, Full Blown, was distributed by independent label K-Lou in 2001, but it did not chart. In 2011, he returned after a decade-long hiatus with the new release My Life, which is only available as an MP3 download. He was born to Jamaican-American parents.

The six-part series was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Three starting 13 November 2008. Format The Last Millionaire takes 12 of Britain's most successful young entrepreneurs and drops them into six of the world's most exciting and demanding cities. Here they face the ultimate business challenge; to make money from scratch in just five days. Used to running successful businesses, these award-winning entrepreneurs have proved themselves at home, but can they do it abroad? This time they'll be stripped of their legions of staff, company contacts, personal cash/credit cards and all their business lifelines. All they have left is a small amount of start up capital plus their raw money making talent. To make it even tougher the entrepreneurs won't be travelling in the style they're used to. Instead of five star accommodation they'll be staying in backpacker hostels and surviving on a limited budget for food and drink. The only way back to their lavish lifestyles is to make more money than their rivals. Visiting a new city every week the entrepreneurs must work in pairs.

He was appointed Prebendary of Longden, in the cathedral of Lichfield (being M.A.) 24 November 1660 and confirmed as Bishop of Sodor and Man on 5 October 1661. His consecration was on 24 March 1660-1 (the last day of the Restoration year). He was a chaplain to the James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, and was at Lathom House during its first siege. He was also \\"the chosen friend counsellor, and afterwards chaplain, of the noble- minded Countess, during all her troubles, and it was principally through her influence that he succeeded to the bishopric.\\" He is reported as having been \\"grave and devout, temperate and dignified, and unfortunately was worn out, though not an old man, when he became a bishop, and died in the Isle of Man\\" on 30 May in either 1662 (according to Le Reve) or says he died in 1663 (according to Seacome). (see Stanley Papers, part iii. vol. i. pp. cxxx.-ii., note; Chetham Society) His body was interred in the chancel of St. German's Cathedral in Peel Castle and there one can find an inscription, that he is alleged to have written himself. A translation of it reads as follows: :In this house which I have borrowed from my brothers the worms :in the hope of the resurrection to life :lie I SAM by divine grace Bishop of this Island. :Stay reader, behold and laugh at the Bishop's palace.

For example, in the special effects industry, when a director needs to simulate an actor being shot or cut, a wide variety of chemicals and natural products can be used. The most common is red food coloring, often inside small balloons coupled with explosive devices called squibs. However, Alfred Hitchcock used Bosco Chocolate Syrup as fake blood in his 1960 thriller Psycho.Seckel, Al. Masters of Deception: Escher, Dali & the Artists of Optical Illusion. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. p. 200. . Retrieved May 23, 2006. Since the film was in black and white, the color was less important than the consistency. Tomato ketchup is also a common alternative. Reasons for use There are many reasons for substituting for real blood in the film industry, such as ethical and sanitary concerns, and concerns for the emotional well being of the actors. Also, actual blood's tendency to coagulate and solidify quickly make it unsuitable for repeated takes without freshening; the longer- lasting viscosity of stage blood makes it far easier to work with on the set. Kensington Gore \\"Kensington Gore\\" (a pun on the London place and street) was a trademark for fake blood used in films and in theatre. It was manufactured by a retired British pharmacist, John Tinegate or Tynegate, during the 1960s and 1970s, in the village of Abbotsbury, Dorset. Many varieties of blood, having various degrees of viscosity, shades and textures, were available. Since Tinegate's death, the name \\"Kensington Gore\\" has become a generic term for stage blood. Kensington Gore was used in the film The Shining. Other uses Theatrical blood has other applications apart from its use in the film industry. The crime scene investigation science of bloodstain pattern analysis uses stage blood or sometimes cow's blood in mock-up crime scenes when training new investigators.Forensics Biology course description, see footnote at bottom (PDF) The art of moulage uses theatrical blood in applying mock injuries for the purpose of training emergency response teams and other medical and military personnel. Theatrical blood is also popularly used in Halloween costumes, as well as certain horror-themed live action role- playing games.

Beach (May 23, 1881 ‚Äì August 6, 1956) was an American sculptor who was known for his busts and medallic art. Early life Beach was born in San Francisco, California. He studied initially at the California School of Mechanical Arts and worked as a jewelry designer immediately afterward, while continuing his art studies at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. In 1903 he moved to New York City and in May 1904, he moved to Paris to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts as well as under the tutelage of Raoul Verlet at the Acad√©mie Julian. Career He returned to the U.S. in 1907 and quickly gained a following for his representations of allegorical and mythical figures. That year, he established his studio in Manhattan, which he maintained for the next forty-five years. He was soon elected to the National Sculpture Society, the Salmagundi Club and the American Numismatic Society. When he was selected to join the National Academy of Design, he was the youngest member at the time. He was also later selected for the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1910, Beach married Eleanor Hollis Murdock, whom he had met while in France. The couple settled in Rome for two years, returning to the U.S. in 1912 with their first daughter Beata (later a painter married to Vernon Porter). Daughters Eleanor and Natalie were born in America. His first major commission came in 1915, when he designed three statues for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, for which he received a silver medal. His 1919 submission for a medal commemorating the Treaty of Versailles was selected as the winner by the American Numismatic Society. He engraved the Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollar, which was designed by Juliette May Fraser and issued in 1928,Yeoman, R. S., Guidebook of United States Coins, 35th revised Ed., Whitman Publishing Company, Florence, AL, 1982, p. 203 and designed the 1935 commemorative Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar. His best-known busts are found in the New York University Hall of Fame. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. A prolific worker, Beach exhibited works yearly without fail at the National Academy of Design winter and annual exhibitions from 1907 to 1926. He was president of the National Sculpture Society from 1926 to 1927 and also taught at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and the Grand Central School of Art. He received the Numismatic Society's Saltus Medal in 1946 for his medallic work. In 1917 Beach built a studio in Brewster, New York on of land he acquired in trade from a local farmer for two sculptures. A year later he built a home for his family of stone from the old stone walls on the property. This became known as \\"Old Walls\\". He built an additional cottage on the property in 1947 known as \\"The Camp\\". Beach died on August 6, 1956 in Brewster, New York.

Along with Three Souls in my Mind (later known as El Tri), it was one of the most representative predecessors of the \\"under\\" scene of Mexican rock. Developed as so-called \\"hoyos funkies\\"; their music transcended their live performances rather than commercial success. History In spite of their Rolling Stones influence, Toncho Pilatos interpreted original instrumentation. Polydor issued their first album, with a double cover, within its 'Power Rock' series, something of a first for a Mexican band. The Toncho Pilatos album was so successful that it was even released in Germany. The tolerance and support supplied by Polydor was almost unique at that time, and both Bob Dylan and Beck commented on the influence of Toncho Pilatos' debut release. Critics were divided over the recorded work, but most agreed concert performances brought the best out of the Guadalajaran based band. Their national television debut took place on 3 May 1974, on the television program Hour Zero, with production from Luis de Llano, through Channel 4 of the DF. The violins of the Mariachi New Tecalitl√°n also enhanced the presentation. In time, Toncho Pilatos incorporated the violinist Richard Nassau, originating from Chicago, United States, into the group. Nevertheless, and in spite of the achieved success, it was not until 1980 that Toncho Pilatos returned to record their second studio album, Segunda Vez. To a large extent, this delay was because Mexican rock music had entered a low period, due to the repression and intolerance that arose after the Festival of Av√°ndaro. At the end of the 1980s, Toncho Pilatos had disappeared from the scene. After several changes of membership, the group appeared in Los Angeles, under the name of Toncho Indian Braves. In 1991, they recorded their third and final studio album, Soy un Mexicano. Alfonso Toncho Guerrero died on 4 July 1992, at the age of 42 years, just a few months after the release of the album, and only weeks after the band's last television appearance. The legacy of Toncho Pilatos, with their Mexicanista sound and Spanish lyrics sowed the seeds for Mexican rock music.

He later played at minor counties level for Wiltshire, and made a single List A appearance for that county. He also went on Minor Counties' tour of South Africa in 1993‚Äì94. Smith's professional career was not particularly successful: in his few first- team appearances for Worcestershire, his highest score was the 28 he made on debut against Cambridge University, while his solitary success with the ball was the wicket of Warwickshire wicket-keeper Geoff Humpage on Smith's final first-class appearance in July 1987. Smith's only half-century in senior cricket came for Wiltshire against Durham in the first round of the 1993 NatWest Trophy; opening the batting, he top-scored with 73, but his innings was not enough to avoid a 103-run defeat. His father David Smith played over 100 times, mainly for Derbyshire, between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s.

Bradner occupies a height of land above the Fraser River, immediately across which is the community of Silverdale, a part of the District of Mission, and Ruskin, on the border between Mission and Maple Ridge. On the floodplain below to the west is the Langley rural neighbourhood of Glen Valley, while on the floodplain to the east, which is called Matsqui Prairie, the nearest Abbotsford neighbourhood is Matsqui Village. Bradner was formerly part of the District of Matsqui, which in 1995 was amalgamated into the City of Abbotsford. Bradner was named after Thomas Bradner, a settler in the area who homesteaded there in 1895. A Bradner Post Office was designated in 1912 and Bradner was a station on the British Columbia Electric Railway interurban line from New Westminster to Chilliwack after the expansion in 1910. Bradner is near-totally agricultural in nature, and is noted for its annual show of blooms, as the crops in the area are largely floral, particularly daffodils, a legacy of the many farmers of Dutch extraction who helped found that area's agricultural industry. In 1928, Mr. Fenwick Fatkin, a recent settler from Vancouver, wanted other local growers to showcase their daffodils and this became the humble beginnings of the famous annual Flower Show. In the beginning, only 10 types of daffodils were displayed. Today, there are over four hundred, some of which are still of a Fatkin variety. Another notable celebration in the Bradner community is the annual May Day parade. Every year, a sixth grade student is selected to become the May Queen. In 2009, the first May King was elected. Hunter was the first May King to be elected in 2009. This raised much controversy in the community, as tradition was not being followed. Bradner also has a local, monthly newspaper. The Bradner Barker is distributed every month during the months school is in session. It often features work submitted by students at Bradner Elementary.

Biography Dorian Le Gallienne was born in Melbourne in 1915. His father, an actor, was born in France, and his mother, a pianist who had studied with G. W. L. Marshall-Hall, was the daughter of the Assistant Astronomer at the Melbourne Observatory. His parents separated in 1924, and his father lived in England thereafter. He attended Melbourne Church of England Grammar School. He was diagnosed with diabetes at age 16. After leaving school, he studied with A. E. H. Nickson at the Melbourne Conservatorium and with Arthur Benjamin and Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music in London in 1938. In 1939, he travelled in Europe with Richard Downing, a future Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and with whom he later lived in Melbourne in a mud-brick house at Eltham. He returned to Australia, where he worked for the Commonwealth Department of Information in the overseas broadcasting service, later joining the ABC. He was employed as music critic for The Argus and The Age, both Melbourne newspapers, from 1950 until his death. In an article called \\"Why Preference for 'Celebrities'?\\", he criticised the ABC for its lack of support for local music and musicians in its \\"Celebrity\\" subscription concerts. From 1951 to 1953 he undertook further study with Gordon Jacob in England. He taught harmony at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium between 1954 and 1960. His best known work, the Sinfonietta, was written between 1951 and 1956, and was interrupted by the writing of his only completed Symphony (1953). The Sinfonietta is of 12 minutes duration and shows the influence of Shostakovich, Hindemith, Prokofiev and Vaughan Williams. The first two movements were written in Britain, the remainder some years later in Australia. The Symphony was premiered in 1955, the Sinfonietta in 1956. In 1967 the music critic Roger Covell wrote that Le Gallienne's Symphony was 'still the most accomplished and purposive ... written by an Australian'. Rhoderick McNeill has more recently opined that the Symphony is only eclipsed by Robert Hughes's Symphony as the finest Australian symphony of the period. However, it is little known since the score has never been published and the work has never been commercially recorded (although it can be heard at the Australian Music Centre in SydneyAustralian Music Centre: library recording of Le Gallienne's Symphony No. 1). Another especially significant work of Le Gallienne is his song-cycle, Four Holy Sonnets of John Donne, for low voice and piano. He also wrote music for Tim Burstall's film The Prize (1960), which won a bronze medal at the Venice Film Festival, and worked with Burstall on two other films.ABC Classic FM: Knowing the Score He died of diabetes-induced heart disease in 1963, and was buried in the Eltham cemetery next to the artists' colony Montsalvat. A second symphony remained incomplete at the time of his death. The Dorian Le Gallienne Award was founded to commemorate his life in music, and is awarded every two years to a composer resident in Victoria.University of Melbourne, Faculty of Music The first award, in 1965, was to Helen Gifford.Australian Music Centre: Helen Gifford Works * Contes heraldiques, or The sleepy princess (ballet, 1947) * Beloved, let us love one another *Blue Wrens (piano) * The Cactus of the Moon * Duo (violin and viola; 1956) * Fanfare * Farewell!

Colombia and Brazil did not send their representatives. This edition became the first club competition of the world to include the runners-up of each of its participating association. Despite the fact that Colombian and Brazilian clubs did not participate, this tournament saw a record 95 matches being played out to determine this year's champion. Colombia did not send a representative due to the disagreements between CONMEBOL and the Colombian football federations. The Brazilians protested the inclusion of the runners-up of each nation and argued that the tournament should be reserved for national champions. That led them to become denatured and the powers reserved only for the champions, in addition to the priority order they gave their interstate tournaments and the many unattractive encounters-to-come against teams from the \\"Pacific\\", the Brazilian clubs opted for tours around the world instead as they were seen more economically rewarding. Not having any economic incentives, CONMEBOL was forced to allow clubs the freedom of whether they participated or not. This trend will continue for the next 5 editions. After winning each of their home legs, Pe√±arol and River Plate required a playoff to break the deadlock. The match was played in the Estadio Nacional of Santiago, Chile. River Plate finished the first half 2-0 and was in cruise control towards its first title. The manyas managed to revert the disadvantage to push this match into extra time. With two more goals, the final score of 2-4 meant that Pe√±arol became the first three-time winners of the competition.

The duo, alongside other Australian hip hop artists Solo and Adit (together known as Horrorshow), Joyride and Jackie Onassis, form the Inner-West \\"One Day\\" crew. Biography The group was founded in Sydney's Inner West by rappers Nick Lupi and Jimmy Nice, Nick Lupi attended Fort Street High School whilst Jimmy Nice attended Leichhardt High School. In 2006, Spit Syndicate's debut release was a mixtape CD called The Future's Bright, which was followed by an appearance on MTV Australia's The Lair in July 2007, alongside other musical acts such as Sparta and The Hot Lies. In February 2008 the duo signed with Obese Records, when Nice was 21 years of age and Lupi 19, to release their debut album Towards the Light: Towards the Light was released in October 2008 and features vocal contributions from Rowan Dix, Sarah Corry, Ron-E, Fame, Miriam Waks and Solo (Horrorshow). In 2013, Nice reflected on their experience of releasing a debut album: \\"We were so young when we started, we were just little sponges ... We just wanted to know what it was all about, we wanted to be around it, we wanted to be at every gig, we wanted to record at every chance that we got\\". The album was nominated for \\"Best Urban Release\\" at the 2008 ARIA Music Awards. In May 2010, they released their second studio album, Exile, which featured production contributions from Adit (Horrorshow), M-Phazes, JSquared and Cam Bluff, and guest vocals from Solo, Joyride (Spit Syndicate's DJ) and Corry. In the official Exile press release, the album was \\"inspired by the clarity of mind borne out of travel, the feeling of suffocation by one's everyday surroundings and the displacement sometimes required to get right\\". Exile's lead single was called \\"Starry-Eyed\\" and received prominent airplay on Australia's triple j radio station. In 2010, the duo appeared on the song \\"Long Winding Road\\" for M-Phazes' debut album, Good Gracious. The management company Phat Planet signed the group in 2011. During the same year, Spit Syndicate released Best Intentions: Part One, the first of a free online mixtape series, and attracted over 10,000 downloads. In October 2012, the duo released \\"Beauty in the Bricks\\", the first single from the third studio album Sunday Gentlemen. The second single, \\"Folly\\", was released in 2013, followed by the release of the album on 22 February 2013. Contributing artists included Drapht, Illy and Solo, and production is accredited to Adit, M-Phazes, J-Skub and Styalz Fuego. In March 2013, Nice explained the duo's different approach for the recording of the album: > The first album that we put out, I don't think it was ever really intended > for an audience, a wide audience ... We made that album when we were just > out of school and it was just something that we could play at parties ... > this time we had a greater sense and an understanding of what we wanted out > of the record, so we paid a lot more attention to detail, and had a greater > creative control and a bigger say in how the product ended up. Written over two years, the band called the album their \\"strongest work to date\\" in 2013. Nice also explained that the duo's creative process had matured over time, while Adit's production work was more experimental. Spit Syndicate completed a national Australian tour in support of the album, from March until May 2013, with support from Sydney artists Jackie Onassis. Touring The duo opened for international acts such as Cypress Hill, Xzibit, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, People Under The Stairs, Diverse and Savage + Mareko‚Äîthey were also billed to support Fabolous before his tour was cancelled. Spit Syndicate have supported local groups such as Funkoars, Urthboy, Ozi Batla, The Lullabyes, Phrase, Lyrical Commission and Hyjak N Torcha, and they toured New South Wales with Bliss N Eso twice. In February 2010, Spit Syndicate were one of the local artists who performed at the 2010 Sydney Good Vibrations Festival, held at Centennial Park. One Day The One Day collective consists of Spit Syndicate, Horrorshow, Joyride and Jackie Onassis, all of whom are from the Inner West area of Sydney. Nice explained in February 2013: > ... that‚Äôs [One Day] been our little banner we‚Äôve been riding under and it > includes Spit Syndicate, Horrorshow, Joyride and Jackie Onassis. We all grew > up together, went to school together and make music together. We really want > to strengthen that connection, and have it more as a collective as opposed > to four different acts. These guys are family and people we see on the > reg[ular], it‚Äôs not just different acts coming together, we all share a > strong bond. Following the release of the single \\"Love Me Less\\" in early June 2014, the collective released their debut album, Mainline, on 1 August 2014 through the Elefant Traks Australian hip hop label. The release date will be followed by a national Australian tour in September 2014 that will present all seven members of One Day on stage for the first time.

In practice, most Confederate corps were referred to by their commanders' name and not by numerical designation. In its various forms, the Third Corps served under William J. Hardee, Edmund Kirby Smith, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Leonidas Polk, and Alexander P. Stewart. Formation The corps was originally formed by the re- designation of Major General William Hardee's division from the Central Army of Kentucky, also known as the Army of Central Kentucky, into a corps. Having previously served in Kentucky and Tennessee, Hardee's division was marched to Corinth in the personal accompaniment of General Albert Sidney Johnston as part of a strategic Confederate concentration leading up to the Battle of Shiloh. On March 23rd, 1862, Hardee's men arrived in Corinth where they joined other Confederates under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard.Cunningham, P. 97 When these forces were consolidated into a single army titled Army of the Mississippi, Hardee's division was designated the Third Corps. This \\"corps\\" remained a division in structure, consisting of three brigades under Brigadier Generals Thomas Hindman, Patrick Cleburne, and S.A.M. Wood. Additionally, an artillery battalion of three Arkansas batteries under Major Francis Shoup was also attached to the corps. Hardee's effective force numbered 6,789 and was the smallest of the four corps in the army. Cunningham, P. 118, 402-403 Hardee's corps was selected to lead one of the two Confederate columns in the march from Corinth. The army would concentrate at Mickey's farmhouse and then launch an attack upon Grant's Army of the Tennessee encamped at Pittsburgh Landing on April 4th. Hardee was to move his corps up along the Ridge Road, followed by the First Corps under Major General Leonidas Polk. However, Hardee's and Polk's troops became inter-tangled in the streets of Corinth, delaying the march. Though they had departed in the morning, it was late into the afternoon by the time the last of Hardee's corps had left Corinth.Cunningham, P. 123-124 Poor staff work combined with muddy roads and conditions delayed the march, and thus the attack, well past the April 4th target date. It was not until the morning of April 6th that the Confederates were into position to make the attack.Cunningham, P. 137 Largely because of its position at the head of the line of march and camp, Hardee's corps found itself at the spearhead of the attack on the morning of April 6th. Hardee's corps deployed in single line of battle arrayed from left to right; Cleburne's brigade on the left resting near Widow Howell field, Wood's brigade in the center, and Hindman's brigade under the temporary command of Colonel Robert Shaver on the right. To extend Hardee's frontage, Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden's brigade was attached to Hardee from Major General Braxton Bragg's Second Corps and posted on Shaver's right.Cunningham, P. 138. With this additional brigade, Hardee decided to form his corps into two temporary divisions; the first under Hindman and consisting of Wood's brigade and his own under Shaver. The second division consisted of Cleburne's and Gladden's brigades and reported directly to Hardee himself. The rest of Bragg's corps deployed in a single line of battle behind Hardee's corps, with Polk's corps in column of march behind Bragg's corps, and Breckinridge's corps bringing up the rear. Thus it was Hardee's corps that became the first Confederates engaged in the Battle of Shiloh when a Federal patrol under Major James Powell from Colonel Everett Peabody's brigade stumbled into a cavalry outposts and pickets from Major Aaron Hardcastle's 3rd Mississippi Battalion of Wood's brigade. This skirmish lasted for about an hour before Powell's Federals fell back.Cunningham, P. 148-149. In the meanwhile, the Confederate offensive began. In the initial advance, the elements of the corps became separated, with Hindman's two brigades and Gladden advancing towards the northeast and right into the camps of Brigadier General Benjamin Prentiss's 6th Division, while Cleburne's brigade advanced more northerly and to left, into the camps of Brigadier General William T. Sherman's 5th Division.Cunningham, P. 155. Russell's brigade of Polk's corps advanced to fill the gap in between the two widening segments of the corps. It was a similar story elsewhere, and before long the Confederate advance had lost organization, with mixed units of different corps forming ad-hoc commands and advancing without regard to table of organization. Cleburne's brigade advanced Sherman's position, with his skirmishers of the 15th Arkansas and 6th Mississippi wounding an unsuspecting Sherman in the hand and killing his aide Private Thomas Holliday.Cuningham, P. 166-167. However, Cleburne's attack became bogged down in the marshy terrain, briars, and lowground in front of Sherman's position, and his men suffered significant casualties in the attack. Notably, the 6th Mississippi, which started the battle with 425 officers and men, suffered more than 300 casualties in this attack alone.Cunningham, P. 175. The corps was later engaged at Bloody Pond and assisted Breckinridge's Reserve Corps in the rearguard. Fighting at Corinth, the corps served successfully for a few more months until the four corps of the Army of the Mississippi were consolidated and the corps discontinued. The brigades which made up the corps later constituted a division under Simon Buckner, and then more famously, Patrick Cleburne. 1862 recreation The Third Corps was re-constituted four more times following its abolition. First it was re-constituted when Edmund Kirby Smith's command from East Tennessee was attached to the Army of Tennessee. Kirby Smith's corps consisted of Carter Stevenson's division, the largest at 10,000 men, John McCown's division of 5,500, Henry Heth commanded a division of 4,500 men and lastly Thomas Churchill commanded a division of 6,500 men all in all 26,500. The corps never was fully engaged in any major battle, at Cumberland Gap the corps was lightly engaged. The corps would have fought at Stones River but Stevenson's division was ordered to Vicksburg, Heth and Churchill went to Knoxville which left only John McCown and his small division. This proved to be a key factor in the battle and many say if Braxton Bragg had Smith and his four divisions, he may have won decisively, not only tactically. With that, the corps broke up. McCown was assigned to Hardee's corps, and thus his division became a permanent part of the Army of Tennessee. Stevenson's division remained at Vicksburg, the remaining divisions were put under new departments and thus the corps was abolished. The corps was again reconstituted for was at the Siege of Vicksburg. With so many of the Army of Tennessee's units at Vicksburg area, the garrison seemed like part of their own army and additionally nearly the entire garrison fought with the Army of Tennessee sometime or another. The Corps consisted of Forney's division, 4,500 men, Martin Smith's division with another 6,500, William Loring's division of 6,000 more, John Bowen's division of 6,000 and Carter Stevenson's division of 10,000. The Corps all in all numbered 33,000 men. The Corps fought at Champion Hill, and the siege itself. Loring and his division broke out and later on served in two other Third Corps but the rest of the 'Corps', usually known as the Army of Mississippi, surrendered on July 4. A Third Corps (although seldom so-called) was again re-constituted under Joseph Johnston during the Vicksburg campaign. The corps contained many troops from both the Army of Mississippi and the Army of Tennessee. The corps contained Loring's division after it broke out, 6,000, Wallker's division from Charleston with 10,000, John Breckinridge from the Army of Tennessee with 10,000 more, Jackson's division from the Army of Tennessee with 6,000 and finally a command of five disorganized brigades numbering 10,000 more. All in all 42,000 men at its height. This Corps though was dispersed and then was abolished though its fragments later became part of another III corps. The corps was reconstituted again during the Chickamauga Campaign. Braxton Bragg created an additional corps for the Army of Tennessee by consolidating Simon Buckner's command from the Department of East Tennessee into his army. Buckner's corps consisted of three divisions: Alexander P. Stewart's division with 4,500 men, William Preston's division with 5,000 men, and a provisional division under Bushrod Johnson with 6,000 more. Johnson's division was detached to operate with Longstreet's corps at Chickamauga however, and was broken up shortly after the battle. Final reappearance The Third Corps was re-raised for a fifth and final time. It was organized after the battle of Chattanooga when Leonidas Polk's Army of Mississippi went east to join the Army of Tennessee in the Atlanta Campaign. It contained divisions under William Loring with 6,500 men, veterans from the Vicksburg Campaign. It also contained a division of 7,500 under Samuel French from Mississippi and finally 6,000 men from Mobile under general Cantey (later under Walthall). All in all, 20,000 men. This corps took the right flank of the Army of Tennessee at Rocky Face Ridge and the left flank at Resaca. Polk's corps also fought also at Pine Mountain where Polk was killed. The command switched hands five times during the campaign, first to W.W. Loring for the rest of the battle, but then Alexander P. Stewart took command briefly. Stewart's corps fought heavily at Peachtree Creek, where it broke through George Henry Thomas's lines. At Atlanta the corps was in reserve. Soon after, Stewart's corps took part in the Battle of Ezra Church, where Walthall's division was committed in an attack to support Lee's corps. The attack failed, and Stewart and division commander Loring were wounded the fighting. Stewart's corps also not take part in the Jonesboro. The corps, while the smallest in the army suffered the least between the three Corps. Franklin‚ÄìNashville When army commander John Bell Hood invaded Tennessee, Stewart's corps went with it. It fought heavily at Altoona Pass, and assaulted the Union left at the disastrous Battle of Franklin. Suffering heavy losses, the corps was merely a large division once it arrived at Nashville. Stewart's corps was on the left flank for the first part of the battle, where it suffered heavily. It was later transferred to the center where it suffered lightly by muskets but fled the field. The corps went to the Carolinas afterwards, fighting at the Battle of Bentonville. It surrendered with the rest of the army. Notes References *Cunningham, Edward O..

The identification of Shu øayb with Jethro, however, is a Druze tradition rather than historical fact (see Shuaib). Prophet Shu øayb is the 14th prophet. Nabi Shuayb was an object of traditional veneration by Druze through Palestine. The shrine figured down to Israeli-Arab war of 1948 as a place where Druze took vows (nidhr) and made ziyarat (\\"pilgrimages\\"). After the 1948 war, Israel placed the Maqam (shrine) under exclusive Druze care.Mahmoud Yazbak, 'Holy shrines (maqamat) in modern Palestine/Israel and the politics of memory,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer (eds.),Holy Places in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Confrontation and Co-existence, Routledge 2010 pp.231-246 p.241. A central figure in the Druze religion, the tomb of Nabi Shuaib, has been a site of annual pilgrimage for the Druze for centuries.Dana, Nissim. (2003). The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status, Sussex Academic Press, pp. 28-30. Shrines dedicated to Nabi Shuaib are common throughout the Greater Syria region.Kais Firro The Druzes in the Jewish State: A Brief History, BRILL, 1999. History The courtyard of the complex Another courtyard view In Druze tradition, it is believed that towards the end of his life, Shu øayb took refuge in a cave outside Hittin (a village just west of Tiberias), where he would die in old age. His followers buried him at the site and placed a tombstone at his grave. Another Druze tradition holds that the Ayyubid sultan Saladin had a dream the night prior to the Battle of Hittin in which an angel promised him victory on the condition that after the battle, he would ride his horse westward; then, where the horse would stop, the angel said he would find the burial site of Shu øayb. The tradition holds that when Saladin's dream was realized, the Druze built a shrine for Shu øayb at the site. Nabi Shu øayb has been expanded and renovated over time. The older section of the existing structure was built in the 1880s, under the direction of Sheikh Muhanna Tarif, the shaykh al-aql (Druze spiritual leader) of Julis. Sheikh Muhanna summoned an assembly of religious leaders in the community to discuss and collaborate on its construction. A delegation of high-ranking community members traveled to Syria and Lebanon in order to collect funds for new construction and renovations and the local Druze of the Galilee and Mount Carmel also made considerable contributions. After Israel's establishment in 1948, and the total depopulation of Hittin which had been a predominantly Muslim village, the Druze were granted full custodianship over the tomb, and an additional 100 dunams surrounding it. Under the leadership of Sheikh Amin Tarif, the shrine was then renovated and numerous rooms were added for the hosting of pilgrims. The Israeli government also paved the road leading to Nabi Shu øayb and provided electricity and water infrastructure services there. Pilgrimage Druze scouts visiting the tomb The first mention of the tomb dates back to the 12th century CE, and the Druze have held religious festivals there for centuries. According to Druze tradition, the imprint of Shuaib's left foot (da'sa) can be seen on the grave. Pilgrims visiting the site pour oil into the imprint, and then rub the oil over their body in order to be blessed with good fortune. The Druze customarily had no fixed date for their annual pilgrimage, which generally occurred sometime in the spring. When the Israeli government granted official recognition of the pilgrimage as a Druze religious holiday, the dates were standardized, such that the event now takes place between April 25 and April 28. During the festivities, mass celebrations are held at Nabi Shu'aib, and Druze religious leaders gather there for ritual purposes and to discuss religious questions. Prior to Israel's establishment, Druze from Syria and Lebanon also used to participate in the festival, but are no longer able to do so today.

Both his father and grandfather had served as Danish Councillors (dansk rigsr√•d). His nephew Peder Oxe, would become the future Danish finance minister and Steward of the Realm. Torben Oxe served as a liege man of King Christian II of Denmark, under whom from 1514, he was governor of Copenhagen Castle. He also inherited a fief in Kronborg from his father who died in 1490. Torben Oxe (Den Store Danske) During the summer of 1517, Torben Oxe was accused of murdering Dyveke Sigbritsdatter, King Christian II's mistress, with some poisoned cherries. Dyveke's mother Sigbrit Willoms, the widow of a Dutch merchant, acted as an advisor to the king, to the displeasure of much of the Danish nobility.Dyveke (ca. 1490 - 1517) Dyveke Villomsdatter (Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon) Villoms, Sigbrit ( - ca. 1532) (Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon) Torben Oxe was first tried and acquitted by the State Council. King Christian II did not accept the judgment and had Oxe indicted by a court consisting of a jury from Solbjerg outside Copenhagen. Oxe was charged in what amounted to a justice-of-the-peace court with vague offences against his liege lord, Christian II. The verdict as directed by the king was guilty and the death sentence imposed. He was condemned to death, traditionally in the words: \\"Vi d√∏mmer ham ikke, men hans gerninger d√∏mmer ham\\" (We do not condemn him - his deeds condemn him), and was beheaded and buried in the graveyard of St. Gertrude's Hospital (St Gertruds Kloster) in Copenhagen.S. Gertruds Hospital og Kapel (Kj√∏benhavns Kirker og Klostre i Middelalderen) Members of the Royal Council of the State (Rigsraadet) disapproved of the execution of Oxe, who was a popular figure. The execution further alienated Christian II from the nobles and the people of Copenhagen. Thereafter the king lost no opportunity to suppress the nobility and raise commoners to power. A famous painting by Eilif Peterssen titled Christian II Signing the Death Warrant of Torben Oxe is present in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, Norway.

German torpedo boats were designated by shipbuilder, with the first letter of their designation reflecting their builder.Gardiner and Gray, p. 164 Design General characteristics and machinery 1902 lithograph of and These 48 vessels were built to ten different designs over the period 1898 to 1907. Thus they varied in dimensions, and they gradually increased in size as more vessels were built. The boats were long at the waterline and long overall. They had beam (nautical) of and a draft of .Gr√∂ner, p. 170 The hull for each boat was divided into eleven watertight compartments, though after , a twelfth compartment was added. They had a crew of two officers and fifty- five enlisted men, though some of the boats had larger crews; had four more sailors, while G132 had twelve more men, and had a crew of three officers and 78 enlisted. When serving as half-flotilla flagships, the boats would have a flotilla leader's staff of four officers and eleven enlisted men in addition to the standard crew. The vessels carried a yawl and a dinghy apiece.Gr√∂ner, p. 169 The S90-class boats were propelled by a pair of vertical, 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engines that drove a pair of three-bladed screw propellers. Steam was provided by three coal-fired water-tube boilers. Two boats, and , were fitted with Parsons steam turbines instead of the older reciprocating engines; G137 also received an additional boiler. The reciprocating engine-powered boats were rated at from . Meanwhile, S125 and G137 were rated at and , and and , respectively. The boats had storage capacity for of coal. As a result, cruising radius varied significantly, from at . Each vessel was equipped with one or two 110-Volt generators for electrical power. Steering was controlled with a pair of rudders, one at the stern and the other in the bow.Gr√∂ner, pp. 169‚Äì170 Armament Most of the ships of the class were armed with a main battery of three SK L/40Regarding German naval gun nomenclature, SK stands for \\"Schnelladekanone\\" (quick-loading gun) and L refers to the \\"L√§nge\\" (length) of the gun in terms of calibers.

The band was formed by Ken Elliot (keyboards, vocals) and Kieran O'Connor (percussion), both of whom had been members of earlier progressive rock groups, Second Hand and Chillum. Produced by future Mot√∂rhead producer Neil Richmond, and signed to the UK based label, Gull, distributed by Motown in the US, together with other UK bands of the day such as If and Judas Priest, Seventh Wave released their first album, Things to Come, in 1974. Joined by other musicians, including Pete Lemer, Hugh Banton (organist of Van der Graaf Generator), Steve Cook, Brian Gould, Tony Elliott, Pepi Lemer, and Rob Elliott, for their second album, Psi-Fi (1975), the band enjoyed a brief success but broke up after the USA tour promoting the album. Kieran O'Connor continued to perform in blues-rock bands, but died in the 1980s. Ken Elliot went on to write the theme tunes to ITV's lunchtime news bulletin First Report and BBC2's Out of Court.

Sport In sports, a professional is someone who participates for money. The opposite is amateur, meaning a person who does not play for money, but in an academic (e.g. college football) or other private setting. The term \\"professional\\" is commonly used incorrectly when referring to sports, as the distinction simply refers to how the athlete is funded, and not necessarily to what competitions he engages in or what results he achieves. Sometimes the professional status of an activity is controversial; for example, there is debate as to whether professionals should be allowed to compete in the Olympic Games. The motivation for money (either in rewards, salaries or advertising revenue) is sometimes seen as a corrupting influence, tainting a sport.

The league is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the team that is top of the league at the end of the season. La Liga, first established in 1929, originally contained ten teams. Before La Liga's organisation, the Copa del Rey‚Äîa regionalised cup competition‚Äîwas effectively the national championship. La Liga is contested by 20 teams; the three lowest-placed teams are relegated to the Segunda Divisi√≥n and replaced by the top three teams in that division. Of the founding teams in La Liga, only Athletic Bilbao, Barcelona and Real Madrid have not been relegated. The league was cancelled between 1936 and 1939 because of the Spanish Civil War. Real Madrid is the most successful club with 34 titles. The most recent club other than Real Madrid and Barcelona to win the league is Atl√©tico Madrid in the 2013‚Äì14 season. Barcelona has won the Spanish version of the double the most times, having won the league and cup in the same year eight times in its history, three more than Athletic Bilbao's five.

Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries. Durkheim √âmile Durkheim saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1971[1915]) p. 38 Rituals - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.Kenneth Allen, Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory (2009) p. 120 Mary Douglas has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;Mary Douglas, Natural Symbols (2002) p. 50-1 while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of deviancy as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for their communal reinforcement.Annalee R. Ward, Mouse Morality (2002) p. 38 As Durkheim himself put it, \\"Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common\\",Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., The New Modern Sociology Readings (1991) p. 480 thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached. Transgressing boundaries Prejudice is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.C. Cunningham, Prejudice (2000) p. 18 (The ancient ceremony of beating the bounds highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).Fran√ßois Laroque, Shakespeare's Festive World (1991) p. 13 Salman Rushdie has emphasised the role of the migrant as a postmodern representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.Salman Rushdie, Imaginary Homelands (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402 Marjorie Garber has explored the role of the transvestite in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (1994) p. 125 Symbolic/social boundaries Symbolic boundaries are distinct from ‚Äúsocial boundaries\\" that are \\"objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources‚Ä¶ and social opportunities.‚Äù Play Playing may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken frames set about social activities.Gerry Bloustien, Girl Making (2003) p. 117 Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.P.

It was serviced to urban radio stations in the United States on October 10, 2008, as the third overall single from the album. A pop and R&B; song, instrumentation consists of \\"rudimentary piano melodies\\" and a \\"plush beat\\". Commercially the song debuted and peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles, a component chart that represents the 25 songs that failed to make an impact on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Out of This Club\\" has been removed from digital stores and streaming services as of February 2019 due to the sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly.  Background and production  R&B; singer R. Kelly co- wrote and produced the song. \\"Out of This Club\\" was written and produced by R. Kelly with additional writing from Jamal Jones. The Pussycat Dolls and Polow Da Don had previously collaborated, but it marks his first time as a featured artist. He co-produced \\"Buttons\\" (PCD, 2005) and produced \\"Whatcha Think About That\\" (Doll Domination, 2008).

Their stage names are largely references to pop culture films, song titles, and fictional characters. The group members refer to themselves as storytellers, creating a \\"rock and roll fable\\";. History The band is composed mostly of MTSU recording program graduates, and originated in order to meet class deadlines and the need to record for their grades. Their first live performance was in April 2004. Most of the band had graduated and moved to Nashville by 2005. } In a 2009 interview, lead vocalist Panther stated, \\"We basically gathered up all of our good friends from the local rock bands of Murfreesboro, tied ourselves together, and tried to walk. And somehow it worked. At the time, we noticed a void in rock and roll. A hole that could only really be filled with grown men and women painting up like robots and playing some fierce and furious rock music based on a 1980s video game. We were fairly certain no one else was going to fill that hole. But, by God, it's filled now. You can thank us later.\\" The band has strong ties to the Murfreesboro and Nashville independent music scene, and some members perform with several bands. The Protomen In the band's first album, Dr. Wily is represented as an Orwellian ruler over a dystopic city, full of humans who are too scared to stand up to his control. Dr. Light creates a \\"perfect man, an unbeatable machine\\", Proto Man, to fight to free the City, but Proto Man is destroyed by the overwhelming power of Wily's armies. Defeated and despairing, Dr. Light then creates a second son, Mega Man, whom he attempts to dissuade from battle. Mega Man runs away from home and confronts his brother in an apocalyptic concluding battle. The album has been described by the band as \\"the sound of the end of the world\\" and straddles the line between chiptune and hard rock, with heavier focus on distorted 8-bit synthesizers and electronic instrumentation. Band member, Commander, has stated that the album \\"was made specifically to go against everything our recording teachers and fellow students were trying to feed us about making everything sound pristine and 'perfect.'\\". The album was recorded over two years in various Murfreesboro studios, using analog rather than digital production techniques. \\"Due Vendetta\\", the group's first recorded track, was completed in April 2003. The album was produced by then-Protomen member Heath Who Hath No Name. Act II: The Father of Death For the band's second album the group, working with Meat Loaf producer Alan Shacklock, devised a prequel storyline to their first album. The second act details the rise of Albert Wily to power, the rivalry between himself and Thomas Light, and the tragic events which brought the City under Wily's control. The band stated that Act II was designed to sound cleaner, reflecting a time \\"before the bomb dropped\\". Accordingly, the second album reflects a much broader range of musical styles and more lyrical instrumentation, embracing references from Ennio Morricone to Bruce Springsteen to Shacklock's own Babe Ruth. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd, a Grammy-winning recording engineer. The Protomen Present: A Night of Queen The Protomen are known for performing, along with their original rock opera, a variety of 1970s and 1980s cover songs in their live performances, typically related to the band's preferred motifs of heroism, struggle, and self-determination. On December 10, 2010, the Protomen performed along with Nashville band Evil Bebos for the latter band's farewell concert. Evil Bebos played a set entirely composed of Black Sabbath cover songs, while the Protomen in kind performed a set of Queen covers. The live performance was recorded and mastered, and on April 19, 2012, the Protomen announced through their website and mailing list that the resulting live album, titled The Protomen Present: A Night Of Queen, would be released and was available for pre-order. Though set for a June 1, 2012 release, the album shipped early to those who pre-ordered it. The Cover Up: Original Soundtrack From the Motion Picture In November 2010 while performing at InDisFest in Atlanta, GA, the band announced their intention to formally record an album of cover songs. Production on the album began in February 2011 with producer, Alan Shacklock; the band's second collaboration with the producer following Act II. By June 2014, the band announced that a downloadable EP would be made available to attendees of their Warped Tour 2014 performances to promote the upcoming full- length album, titled The Cover Up. The EP was released via a download code printed on a faux movie ticket stub for The Cover Up, referencing a non- existent film, packaged in a laminate sleeve attached to a lanyard commemorating the Warped Tour. The full-length album was released on January 23, 2015 to attendees of MAGFest 13, where The Protomen were performing. The following morning, on January 24, the album was made available for pre-order to the general public through the band's website. Musical style and influences The group has cited the influence of \\"artists like Syd Mead, films like Eddie and the Cruisers and Streets of Fire, books like 1984 and Atlas Shrugged... those are the pretty obvious ones you can pull out of Acts I and II. But what you might not realize is that we own every Ernest movie ever made. And we watch them all the time.\\" The band draws inspiration from diverse sources, including Sergio Leone's films, the song \\"The Mexican\\" and musical groups Radiohead, Styx, Toto, Queen and Alabama. Concepts and themes The Protomen playing at Holy Mountain in Austin, TexasThe Protomen's work is inspired by the first six NES Mega Man games. This franchise has an existing storyline featured in the games, manga, and anime; however, The Protomen have concocted a dark and dystopian version of the game's underlying world. The group is generally uninterested in concerns of making their story adhere to the original. Instead, they view the games as a jumping-off point for the story they want to tell, and have borrowed surface attributes of some characters while heavily altering their histories and functions. The band has stated that they intend to make a three-part story. Two of the parts are completed with the release of their first two albums, while the third is in outline form. The overall story as created by the band deals with loss, and they \\"don't really expect it to end well for humanity.\\" Festival and convention performances The Protomen have performed at a number of conventions, festivals and showcases throughout their career. In 2007, The Protomen played at Capcom's booth at San Diego Comic Con by Capcom's invitation.

While some residents receiving so- called total care may be able to independently meet all or some of their needs for their activities of daily living without the assistance of a caregiver, the facility and its staff have the duty of monitoring the resident to be sure s/he is having those needs met.Essentials of Nursing Leadership & Management By Patricia Kelly: Page 226 The term \\"total care\\" is also used within long- term care facilities to refer to residents who need actual assistance in meeting all their needs in their activities of daily living.But this is my mother!: the plight of our elders in American nursing homes By Cynthia Loucks: Page 83 Those who need little or no assistance are referred to as \\"self care.\\" Some facilities have special units reserved for those dependent on total care. Others specialize specifically in residents in need of total care. Some facilities cannot handle total care residents, and when one becomes needy of such care, the facility will transfer the resident to another facility.Effective Management of Long Term Care Facilities By Douglas A. Singh: Page 104 It is not uncommon for a resident to enter a facility able to meet one's needs independently, but later to come in need of total care.Effective Management of Long Term Care Facilities By Douglas A. Singh: Page 8 Many facilities will house total care residents in the less desirable parts of the buildings, such as upper floors or rear wings, and place the self care residents in better health near the entrance for a better impression. This is considered to be controversial for the stigma it brings to such residents, though it does not necessarily mean substandard care.But this is my mother!: the plight of our elders in American nursing homes By Cynthia Loucks: Page 84 Losses of a total care patient Residents of long-term care facilities who are receiving total care will typically suffer in the following ways:But this is my mother!: the plight of our elders in American nursing homes By Cynthia Loucks: Pages 84-86 *Less accommodation for personal needs *Longer waits for care to meet one's needs for basic comfort *Loss of freedom to make one's own choices *Loss of freedom when to be awake or asleep *Loss of privacy, as caregivers will need to view patient's private parts Hazards faced by total care patients Besides the inevitable possibility of death caused by the conditions of a total care resident, their lives are also at risk due to the dangers caused by their care. Neglect is common among total care residents. Many residents who are immobile must have their weight carried by caregivers, who often are overworked and/or understaffed and as a result, are forced to try to cut corners and do it minimally or avoid it altogether.But this is my mother!: the plight of our elders in American nursing homes By Cynthia Loucks: Page 136 Many total care residents are left in one position for a long time, which can lead to the breakdown of their skin, bed sores, and insufficient circulation.But this is my mother!: the plight of our elders in American nursing homes By Cynthia Loucks: Page 131 Feeding becomes an issue with total care patients.

National legislative history  President George W. Bush signed into law legislation introduced by Congressman Joe Baca (D-Calif.), to designate the Friday after Thanksgiving as Native American Heritage Day. The Native American Heritage Day BillHouse Joint Resolution 62, Native American Heritage Day Act of 2008. was supported by the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) and 184 federally recognized tribes, and designates Friday, November 28, 2008, as a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States. The Native American Heritage Day Bill encourages Americans of all backgrounds to observe Friday, November 28, 2008, as Native American Heritage Day, through appropriate ceremonies and activities. It also encourages public elementary and secondary schools to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instructions focusing on their history, achievements, and contributions. The United States House of Representatives originally passed H.J. Res. 62 on November 13, 2007. The bill was passed with technical adjustments by unanimous consent in the United States Senate on September 22, 2008. Then, on September 26, 2008, the House of Representatives unanimously voted to pass the legislation again, this time including the adjustments from the Senate. The legislation was signed into public law by the President on October 8, 2008. Some individual states have also taken legislative action to recognize this day. For example, Maryland established this day in 2008 under the name American Indian Heritage Day.Maryland Laws 2008, Chapter 486, State Holiday -American Indian Heritage Day. Further, the State House of Washington approved this measure in 2013.

In 2006, the subsidiary bank of the National Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan for Foreign Economic Activity in the Russian Federation - Joint-Stock Commercial Asia-Invest Bank has developed its own money transfer system called Asia Express to transfer money of individuals. The main direction of transfers is the Russian Federation - the Republic of Uzbekistan . In March 2007, the Bank entered into an agreement on accelerated non-trading transfers via MIGOM system with the European Trust Bank. In April 2009, the National Bank's units servicing organizations started Quick Mail operations. Since March 2012, the Bank's institutions launched MoneyGram transfer system operations. In April 2012, the Bank signed an agreement with Russlavbank CJSC to connect to Contact money transfer system and have operations to send and pay money transfers via this system in USD and EURO. In 2013, the Bank became a member of KoronaPay service . In 2013, there were changes in the operation of exchange offices . On February 1, the sale of cash foreign currency was abolished . The Bank adopted the sale of foreign currency to individuals in non-cash form using international payment cards . September 2017 was marked by an e-commerce project via Visa International cards. The new Internet acquiring (e-commerce) service in Uzbekistan enabled Visa cards acquiring on the global Internet, ensuring an increase in cashless payments and reduction of costs for enterprises, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses.  Investment activity  The NBU is the largest investment bank in the country. The Bank's large-scale infrastructure enables development of the financial and industrial sectors that actively support economic reforms in Uzbekistan. The Bank's capital incorporation in strategically important enterprises of the Republic enables its participation in investment in enterprises of various sectors of the economy, their modernization, technological and technical re-equipment.

The main borrowers of the Bank are large domestic manufacturers, small and private businesses. Most of the investments are allocated to develop oil production and refining, mechanical engineering, food industry, non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy, textile industry, agricultural production, communications infrastructure, transport and tourism. Financing of national-scale facilities Loans from the National Bank are involved in almost all sectors of the economy of Uzbekistan. The great share in the structural transformations of the economy covers the development of communication systems - rail, road and aviation. The loans are also allocated to the development of priority sectors of the economy, financing of modernization of existing and implementation of new high-level productions, support for small businesses, creation and development of import-substituting consumer goods industries based on the processing of local raw materials. Bank is systemically important for the Reporting and provides loans to the largest enterprises of the Republic of Uzbekistan under government guarantees. This determines low diversification of the loan portfolio, low return on assets, as well as a strong dependence on the financial policy of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

NEC made its own game for their TurboGrafx-16 system in 1991. Plot This game involves the adventures of Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker, two bears delivering cargo for Rebecca Cunningham, another bear. However, Shere Khan, the evil tiger tycoon, wants to put Rebecca out of business, so he hires air pirates, led by Don Karnage, to do his dirty work. In the Sega Genesis and Game Gear games, Baloo and Kit face up against Shere Khan's company in a contest to earn a lifetime work contract from the city of Cape Suzette. In the TurboGrafx game, Louie tells Baloo of an ancient artifact, the pieces of which are scattered across the road. Gameplay Mega Drive/Genesis version The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of the game is a platform game for up to two players, playing as either Baloo or Kit. The aim of each level is to collect at least 10 cargo boxes in order to open the exit. TurboGrafx-16 version The TurboGrafx version is also a platform game, in which players play as Baloo. There is also a bonus level where players control the plane pulling Kit behind him.

She is widely accused of causing widespread harassment, torture and violent deaths of children accused of witchcraft. Biography Ukpabio was born in the village of Mbente, Imo State, Nigeria and is married to Dr. Elijah Ukpabio. She has three children. During her early life she was educated at St. George's Catholic School in Falomo, Jinadu Anglican School in Obalende and the Methodist Girls' School in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State, all in south-eastern Nigeria. In 1992, Ukpabio founded Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries with the aim of spreading her often literal interpretations of the Bible to the people of West Africa. Views on demonic possession and witchcraft Ukpabio and her organisation believe that Satan has the ability to manifest himself in the bodies of children by demonic possession and make them become his servants in the form of 'witches' or 'wizards'. Exploiting superstitious beliefs, particularly those related to spiritual or demonic possession or witchcraft, Helen Ukpabio's organisation has grown exponentionally throughout Nigeria and West Africa since its foundation. There are now major Liberty Gospel Churches in Cameroon, Ghana and South Africa as well as Nigeria. Ukpabio has published her views in several books. An example is 'Unveiling The Mysteries of Witchcraft', in which she states that: > Under the age of two, the child screams at night, cries, is always feverish > suddenly deteriorates in health, puts up an attitude of fear, and may not > feed very well. She also produces, through her film production company, Liberty Films, part of the Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries franchise, a number of films to spread the view that children can become possessed by evil spirits. The most famous of these is End of the Wicked in which child actors are shown to eat human flesh and murder their parents. Her activities are not limited to Nigeria. Ukpabio announced she would preach in Limbe (Cameroon) to promote a program she calls \\"Freedom From Strong Family Darkness\\", October 18‚Äì22, 2017. > She incites violence against imputed witches who are usually women, children > and elderly persons. The people of Cameroon should resist Ukpabio. They > should reject her ‚Äògospel‚Äô of hate and division in families and communities. > - Leo Igwe Media coverage In 2007 an Observer newspaper article claimed Ukpabio and other evangelical pastors were encouraging an upsurge in the numbers of children being accused of witchcraft and being abused and stigmatised by parents and communities as a result. In 2008, the TV news documentary Dispatches Saving Africa's Witch Children by UK broadcaster Channel 4 stated the views that she expresses have led to a massive upsurge in children stigmatised and abandoned by their families in West Africa, particularly in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Both reports followed the activities of two charities, CRARN and Stepping Stones Nigeria, now known as safe Child Africa, which aimed to look after the children who have been rejected by their parents for displaying what they believed to be signs of witchcraft, assertions which have also been made by the Associated Press. The Telegraph Thursday 14 April 2011. The accusation and her defence against them have been reported in The New York Times. A 2009 conference in Nigeria that was critical of her organisation was violently disrupted by members of her organisation. Libel suit against her critics In 2014, Ukpabio brought a libel case against the British Humanist Association (BHA) and Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network (WHRIN) seeking damages of ¬£500,000,000. Ukpabio claims that the BHA misrepresented her by saying that she ascribed certain behaviours in children to Satanic possession when she in fact attributed them to possession by 'witchcraft spirits'. The BHA described the case as libel tourism. After sending a mob to disrupt a meeting led by humanist Leo Igwe in 2009, she filed a suit for $1.3 million against the government for allowing the police to protect Igwe's group. The suit was promptly dismissed. Ukpabio also used smears against other groups of her actions, notably the non-governmental organization Stepping Stones Nigeria. She has been prevented by the Home Office from entering Great Britain by revoking her visa after calls from campaigners in 2014 that she be banned from Britain on child protection grounds.

LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617 (2008), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court reaffirmed the validity of the patent exhaustion doctrine,. and in doing so made uncertain the continuing precedential value of a line of decisions in the Federal Circuit that had sought to limit Supreme Court exhaustion doctrine decisions to their facts and to require a so-called \\"rule of reason\\" analysis of all post-sale restrictions other than tie-ins and price fixes.See section below captioned Mallinckrodt background. In the course of restating the patent exhaustion doctrine, the Court held that the exhaustion doctrine is triggered by, among other things, an authorized sale of a component when the only reasonable and intended use of the component is to practice the patent and the component substantially embodies the patented invention by embodying its essential features. The Court also overturned, in passing, the part of decision below that held that the exhaustion doctrine was limited to product claims and did not apply to method claims. Factual background LG Electronics (LGE) owned several patents on methods and systems for processing information. It entered into two contracts with Intel. In the License Agreement, LGE authorized Intel to make and sell microprocessor products using the patented inventions. Moreover, the License Agreement expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products (for example, for combining Intel microprocessor products with other parts of a computer). The License Agreement also provided, however, \\"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.\\" In the Master Agreement, LGE required Intel to give its customers notice that the patent license does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would have no effect on the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel's customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court's opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets. Quanta Computer purchased licensed Intel microprocessor products and proceeded to manufacture computers containing them. In doing so, Quanta followed Intel's specifications, which in turn led to practice of the patented methods and making the patented systems that LGE licensed to Intel‚Äì‚Äìsince that was the way Intel had designed its microprocessor products. (The trial court found that the Intel microprocessor products were without any reasonable noninfringing use.) LGE then sued Quanta for patent infringement. Quanta prevailed in the district court under the exhaustion doctrine, but on appeal the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply because of the statement in the Master Agreement that combination products were not licensed, given the Federal Circuit's 1992 ruling in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. that a seller of patented goods could by notice impose a post-sale restraint on its customer's use of the goods. Additionally, the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply, in any event, to method patents. Mallinckrodt background In Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., the Federal Circuit had held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of antitrust law violations, such as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions,Richard H. Stern, Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc‚ÄîComments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States, [2008] 527. or violations of \\"some other law or policy.\\" Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 708. More specifically, the Mallinckrodt court had said, \\"Unless the condition violates some other law or policy (in the patent field, notably the misuse or antitrust law),\\" patent owners, licensees and downstream purchasers \\"retain the freedom to contract concerning conditions of sale.\\" The Federal Circuit went on to say that \\"[t]he appropriate criterion\\" in determining whether \\"a restriction or condition . . . placed upon the sale of a patented article\\" is valid \\"is whether [the patentee's or licensor's] restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, or whether the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.\\"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 708‚Äì09. According to the court, the tests for restrictions and misuse were alike, outside the tie-in and price fixing area: \\"To sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the Supreme Court, a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market.\\"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 706 (quoting Windsurfing Int'l, Inc. v. AMF, Inc., 782 F.2d 995, 1001‚Äì02 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). But this Federal Circuit test is contrary to many decisions of both the Supreme Court and other courts of appeals. For example, in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,. the Supreme Court addressed the legality of licenses under which royalties were paid on total sales of all products, irrespective of whether the licensor's patents covered all products. The Court held that such licensing was permissible when the licensor and licensee adopted it for mutual convenience to simplify administration of the license,Zenith, 395 U.S. at 136 (\\"If convenience of the parties rather than patent power dictates the total-sales royalty provision, there are no misuse of the patents and no forbidden conditions attached to the license.\\"). but it was impermissible for the licensor to insist upon it over the licensee's opposition.Zenith, 395 U.S. at 139 (\\"But we do not read Automatic Radio to authorize the patentee to use the power of his patent to insist on a total-sales royalty and to override protestations of the licensee that some of his products are unsuited to the patent or that for some lines of his merchandise he has no need or desire to purchase the privileges of the patent. In such event, not only would royalties be collected on unpatented merchandise, but the obligation to pay for nonuse would clearly have its source in the leverage of the patent. We also think patent misuse inheres in a patentee's insistence on a percentage-of-sales royalty, regardless of use, and his rejection of licensee proposals to pay only for actual use.\\"). Such conduct was misuse, the Court held, but not an antitrust violation unless the other elements of an antitrust violation were also shown, such as market power.Zenith, 395 U.S. at 140 (\\"if there was such patent misuse, it does not necessarily follow that the misuse embodies the ingredients of a violation of either ¬ß 1 or ¬ß 2 of the Sherman Act, or that Zenith was threatened by a violation so as to entitle it to an injunction under ¬ß 16 of the Clayton Act.\\"). Earlier, in Brulotte v. Thys Co.,. the Supreme Court held that it was patent misuse if, without more, a patentee charged royalties that extended beyond the statutory term of the patent. In National Lockwasher Co. v. George K. Garrett Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a patentee misused its patent by requiring licensees to agree not to deal in the technology of the patentee's competitors.National Lockwasher Co. v. George K. Garrett Co., 137 F.2d 255, 256-57 (3d Cir. 1943) (patentee misused patent because patentee was \\"attempting by means other than that of free competition to extend the bounds of its lawful monopoly to make, use and vend the patented device to the extent where such device would be the only one available to a user of such an article. This monopoly is obviously not covered by the patent.\\"); accord Thus, in these cases, among many others, the Supreme Court and other federal courts had found misuse in cases not involving price fixing or tie-ins, and had not required any rule-of-reason or relevant-market analysis. Other Federal Circuit decisionsSee, e.g., U.S. Philips Corp. v. International Trade Comm'n, 424 F.3d 1179, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\\"If the particular licensing arrangement in question is not one of those specific practices that has been held to constitute per se misuse, it will be analyzed under the rule of reason. We have held that under the rule of reason, a practice is impermissible only if its effect is to restrain competition in a relevant market.\\") (citations omitted); followed the Mallinckrodt approach, which was, at the very least, divergent from Supreme Court decisions.One commentator at the time of the Mallinckrodt decision referred to it as inaugurating the demise of the exhaustion doctrine in the United States, Richard H. Stern, The Unobserved Demise of the Exhaustion Doctrine in US Patent Law: Mallinckrodt v. Medipart, 15 460 (1993). Accordingly, when certiorari was granted in Quanta, it was widely surmised that the Supreme Court would overturn Mallinckrodt, which many (including the United States Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall,The United States Solicitor General filed an amicus curiae brief on the merits stating, \\"The test adopted by the Federal Circuit in Mallinckrodt thus reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role and scope of the patent-exhaustion doctrine. ... The court of appeals' approach cannot be reconciled with those [Supreme Court] precedents.\\" Brief for United States as amicus curiae in Quanta, at 23; see also id. at 6 (\\"In recent years, the first-sale doctrine has evolved in the Federal Circuit in a manner that is at odds with this Court's precedents.\\"); id. at 22 (\\"The Federal Circuit misreads Univis as standing only for the proposition that restrictions that have been found to be unlawful restraints on trade in the patent context, such as \\"price-fixing or tying\\" arrangements, cannot be enforced in a patent-infringement suit.\\"); id. at 30 (\\"The judgment below rests on the same erroneous understanding of patent exhaustion that infuses the Federal Circuit's approach to this area of the law.\\"). viewed as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.Thus, Holman's Biotech IP Blog said: \\"Many people viewed Quanta as an important opportunity for the Supreme Court to address the viability of Mallinckrodt (976 F.2d 700), a 1992 Federal Circuit decision which held that the doctrine of patent exhaustion applies only to unconditional sales, and that a patent owner is thus permitted to impose post-sale restrictions on purchasers of a patented product by providing purchasers with notice to that effect, and enforce those restrictions under the patent laws. Many, including the Solicitor General, argue that Mallinckrodt should be overruled, and that the decision conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, particularly the 1942 Univis decision, which they interpret as mandating a doctrine of patent exhaustion that bars the enforcement of such restrictions by means of a patent enforcement action.\\" An O'Melveny & Myers commentary advised the law firm's clients: \\"As set out by the Solicitor General, the Federal Circuit has once again adopted a formalistic rule that does not advance the interest of patent law as articulated by Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, there seems little doubt that the Solicitor General's views will prevail on the merits, and that the Supreme Court will again reverse the Federal Circuit.\\" Supreme Court opinion The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, in an opinion by Justice Thomas. Method claims First, the Court said, the distinction between method and product claims is insupportable. In United States v. Univis Lens Co.,. the most recent decision of the Court on exhaustion, some of the patents held exhausted were method patents. Earlier, in Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States,. some patents covered a method of combusting gasoline in an automobile engine‚Äì‚Äìand the exhaustion doctrine was held applicable. Furthermore, because it is easy to write patent claims for the same invention either in method format or apparatus format, the exhaustion doctrine could easily be evaded if reliance on method claims was sufficient to avoid exhaustion: By \\"including a method claim for the machine's patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.\\"128 S. Ct. at 2118. Exhaustion and related patents The Court then turned to the extent, if any, to which exhaustion of the patent rights on the microprocessor products exhausted patent rights relating to the combination products on which LGE had patents. In the Univis case the sale that exhausted patent rights was a sale of an unpatented semifinished lens blank, which subsequent processing turned into a patented finished lens. The Intel microprocessor products were finished commercial articles of commerce, but in this case the trial court had found as a fact that the microprocessor products had no noninfringing use, just as in the Univis case the semifinished lens blanks had no use but to be finished into the patented finished lens blanks. Therefore, the Court found Univis dispositive. In the Quanta Court's language, in Univis \\"exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they 'embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.'\\" LGE did not challenge the claim that the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (\\"features\\") rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have \\"no real use.\\" As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability. A further reason why sales of the microprocessor products exhausted LGE's patent rights was that \\"everything inventive about each patent is embodied in\\" the licensed Intel products, which \\"embody the essential features of the [licensed] patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.\\" Any point of novelty‚Äîthat is, respect in which the claimed invention departs from the prior art‚Äîis found in the licensed microprocessor products rather than in the combination product of which they are components. This last aspect of the Quanta opinion is very similar to the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case, a doctrine that the Federal Circuit had previously held to be no longer authoritative.See Under the Supreme Court's Lincoln Engineering doctrine, the combination of a newly invented device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated is unpatentable as an \\"exhausted combination\\" or \\"old combination.\\" Thus, when the Quanta Court said that \\"everything inventive about each patent is embodied in\\" the licensed Intel products, which \\"embody the essential features of the [licensed] patents,\\" the Court was, in effect, saying that the combination of a novel Intel microprocessor in a conventional manner with an old personal computer is an exhausted combination. Accordingly, no weight would be put on the fact that separate patents had issued to LGE on the inventive device and on the old combination that included it. Licensing a limited field LGE's argument for non-exhaustion sought to invoke the doctrine of General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co. (upholding legitimacy of field-of-use limitations on scope of patent licenses to make and sell amplifiers only in \\"non-commercial\\" field), affirmed on rehearing, . In that case, the patentee had granted no license for \\"commercial\\" amplifiers. Therefore, when a manufacturer licensed only in the \\"non-commercial\\" field of use sold an amplifier to an accused infringer, who knowingly resold it in the commercial market, the manufacturer \\"could not convey to [the accused infringer] what both knew it was not authorized to sell.\\" By parity of reasoning, LGE said, it had licensed Intel only in the field of manufacturing microprocessor products for combination with specified products and not with other products. But the Court said that was not how LGE had drafted its license to Intel: The Court appears to be saying that LGE simply licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel's manufacturing, using, and selling rights‚Äì‚Äìno \\"magic words.\\" LGE came close‚Äì‚Äìit said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that‚Äì‚Äìbut LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: \\"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.\\" That this was a critical error (for LGE) is confirmed by the Court's final statements in its opinion: > The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the > patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products > substantially embodying the patents. ... Intel's authorized sale to Quanta > thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a > result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta. Thus, the exhaustion doctrine governed what Quanta could lawfully do with what it bought from Intel. The failure to give third parties a license to combine Intel microprocessor product with other products had no legal significance, because the exhaustion doctrine obviated any need for such a license. Having bought the products from an authorized seller, Quanta didn't need any license. No contract issue Just before closing, the Court added a final note pointing out that the case did not raise, and the Court did not rule on, whether LGE could have enforced a contractual restriction. In footnote 7, the Court commented: > We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not > necessarily limit LGE's other contract rights. LGE's complaint does not > include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether > contract damages might be available even though exhaustion operates to > eliminate patent damages. By the same token, the Court said nothing as to specific performance or whether contract rights, if any, could be enforced against Quanta. Impact and issues that the court did not consider The impact of Quanta is problematic, largely because the decision avoided deciding many issues, presumably in the interest of maintaining consensus. (The decision was unanimous.) One academic commented: > It is a very disappointing decision from the Court. It decided so little, > and it was such an important case. You are left reading tea leaves.Professor > Josh Sarnoff of American University Law School, quoted in Inside Counsel, > Sept. 2008. Inside Counsel adds, \\"Businesses and their counsel are left > scouring the court's ruling for clues as to what might happen next.\\" The Court's failure to approve or reject the precedent on which the Federal Circuit had relied in its decision in Quanta, Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., which had limited the applicability of the exhaustion doctrine when a sale was made \\"conditional,\\" further contributed to business uncertainty about permissible license restrictions. But, as one commentator observed: > The Supreme Court, in Quanta, was widely expected to rule on whether > Mallinckrodt was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly > interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. > ... Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to > what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions > on downstream purchasers.Inside Counsel, Sept. 2008. To be sure, in Quanta, the Court held that \\"[t]he longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.\\" But what constitutes \\"authorization\\"? The Court did not address the issue of \\"constructive\\" authorization‚Äîthat is, authorization as a matter of law in certain circumstances, whether or not the patentee or licensor likes it or even tries very hard to avoid it.In contract law, certain binding promises are implied by law irrespective of the unwilling promisor's desire not be so bound. Thus, a husband \\"constructively\\" promises to pay for his wife's necessities or often for medical care that is given him. The common law entertained a legal fiction, indebitatus assumpsit, that a person owing a debt promised to pay it, so that he could be sued on that imagined promise. See Lionel D Smith, et al., The Law of Restitution in Canada: Cases, Notes, and Materials, pp. 72-75 (Emond Montgomery Publications 2004) (avail. Google Books). Some of the language in the Univis decision points in this direction. As discussed below, in at least one case the House of Lords, in effect, imposed a compulsory copyright license on automobile manufacturers as to repair parts, where the effect was the same as constructive authorization under the exhaustion doctrine. Accordingly, it is uncertain to what extent Quanta undoes Mallinckrodt. That seems to be the unstated message in Quanta, but the Federal Circuit may take an impenitent view, in defiance of the Solicitor General's views as amicus. Other transactional forms There are a number of important issues that the Court did not address in Quanta.See Richard H. Stern, Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc‚ÄîComments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States, [2008] EUR. INTELL. PROP. REV. 527, 531-34. (Cited hereafter as Quanta--EIPR.) One such omission is the Court's failure to say anything about the other possible formats that this transaction might have used‚Äîsuch as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the patentee or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.\\"The huge omission in Quanta is the Court's failure to say anything about the other possible forms of this transaction. ... \\" Quanta--EIPR at 531. The first of these possible formats follows the pattern of the General Talking Pictures case. The second format follows the pattern of the Mallinckrodt case. Under the General Talking Pictures doctrine, a patentee may limit the scope of a manufacturer-licensee's license to a defined field‚Äîsuch as microprocessors not incorporated into computers‚Äîand then the use of those micropressors as computer components is a patent infringement. This is the format that LGE mistakenly thought it was using.By the same token, LGE thought that its contract with Intel caused intel to use the Mallinckrodt format. The Federal Circuit opinion is clear that the court accepted LGE's argument that it had used and caused use of these two formats. See Quanta--EIPR at 531-32; LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d at 1369-70. The court of appeals said, \\"The exhaustion doctrine ... does not apply to an expressly conditional sale or license, so LGE's rights in asserting infringement of its system claims were not exhausted.\\" (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted.) Under the Mallinckrodt doctrine, a sale of a patented product subject to a restriction‚Äîsuch as you must not sell this microprocessor for use as a computer component‚Äîis a \\"conditional,\\" rather than \\"unconditional,\\" sale. If the condition is violated the conduct is patent infringement.See Mark L. Patterson, Reestablishing the Doctrine of Patent Exhaustion. The exhaustion doctrine does not apply under the rule stated in Mallinkrodt. However, as Quanta seemingly holds, when a restriction is not clearly and explicitly stated the exhaustion doctrine applies. Resolving the \\"anomaly\\" In a brief to the Supreme Court (at its request) when the petition for writ of certiorari was pending, the US Solicitor General observed that a curious \\"anomaly\\" existed between the exhaustion doctrine and General Talking Pictures doctrine: > [T]here is a seeming anomaly in allowing a patentee to achieve indirectly ‚Äì- > through an enforceable condition on the licensee ‚Äì‚Äì a limitation on use or > resale that [because of the exhaustion doctrine] the patentee could not > itself impose on a direct purchaser, [yet] the distinction is a necessary > and explicable result of the Court's decision in General Talking Pictures. For reasons that so far have not been explained in any publicly available document, the Government deleted this passage from its subsequent brief on the merits.Compare Brief of Solicitor General in support of certiorari in Quanta at pp. 13-14 with Brief of Solicitor General on merits in Quanta at 17-18. As the Government brief suggested, on the one hand, the exhaustion doctrine prohibits post-sale restraints on a patentee's (or its licensee's) sale of goods, while on the other hand General Talking Pictures permits a patentee to place post-sale limitations on its manufacturing licensee's sale of goods if the license to manufacture uses the right, magic words.In the Quanta case, LGE failed to use them in its license to Intel, according to the Supreme Court, although the Federal Circuit (perhaps reasonably, see Quanta--EIPR at 531; LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d at 1369-70) had thought that LGE did. Nothing in the Quanta opinion addresses this \\"seeming anomaly,\\" much less attempts to resolve it or synthesize the competing doctrines.\\"The Court, in indicating what LGE had neglected to put into its License Agreement, did not opine on what would have happened if LGE had written its licence differently.\\" Quanta--EIPR at 532. Can contract trump the exhaustion doctrine? The Court, in a footnote quoted above (the Court's note 7), expressly refrained from stating any of the following: whether contractual language could overcome, or prevent triggering, the exhaustion doctrine; if so, what language would be effective to do so; and whether the surrounding circumstances would be relevant. To the extent that the exhaustion doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to the extent that the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the Quanta case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts may be more likely to place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law. The Court explicitly refused to consider this issue in Quanta.For a brief consideration of such issues, see Quanta--EIPR at 532-35. The Quanta court did make clear, however, that it recognized the fundamental difference in law between a sale of patented goods by a patentee and a patentee's license of another to manufacture the patented goods, which the Supreme Court had explained in United States v. General Electric Co.. At the same time, the Court made it clear that LGE had failed to license Intel (the seller to Quanta) in language that invoked the General Talking Pictures doctrine, which could have changed the outcome, as discussed above in the section of this article captioned \\"Licensing a limited field.\\" The House of Lords considered whether contract could trump the similar doctrine against derogation from title in British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.. This is the doctrine that a seller may not successfully take actions, such as enforcing an intellectual property right, that decrease the value of what the seller has sold to a purchaser. The House of Lords ruled that contract could not be used to lessen the rights of end user purchasers, at least purchasers of consumer products such as motor cars. Subsequent decisions Static Control In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., the district court reconsidered its former decision in this case and granted a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) in favor of the accused infringer. The court said that the Supreme Court's Quanta decision \\"has changed the landscape of the doctrine of patent exhaustion generally, and specifically\\" required a reversal of the judgment, so that SCCI was not liable to Lexmark for patent infringement. Lexmark had sought to restrict the refilling of its toner cartridges by relying on the Mallinckrodt doctrine. However, it did not enter into any conventional bilateral contract selling the toner cartridges to the public on a \\"conditional sale\\" basis.The district court found: \\"Sales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional. Anyone could walk into a store carrying Lexmark Prebate cartridges and purchase one. Anyone could purchase Lexmark Prebate cartridges directly from Lexmark through its website. No potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate tenns before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in Quanta. As such, sales of Lexmark cartridges exhausted Lexmark's patent rights in them, stripping Lexmark of the ability to control post-sale use of the cartridges through patent law.\\" Instead, Lexmark relied on \\"shrinkwrap licenses,\\" and restrictive notices accompanying the products. The court considered these ineffective to prevent application of the exhaustion doctrine, despite Mallinckrodt's approval of their use. The court acknowledged that, \\"[a]s Lexmark points out, the Supreme Court did not expressly overrule Mallinckrodt in its Quanta opinion.\\" Nonetheless, the court concluded: > After reviewing Quanta, Mallinckrodt, and the parties' arguments, this Court > is persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio. The Supreme > Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be > squared with the position that the Quanta holding is limited to its specific > facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on Mallinckrodt in > reaching its decision in LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., > 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court > reversed in Quanta. It is also worth noting that the Quanta decision did not > mention a single Federal Circuit case. On the other hand, the court did not consider Quanta to have foreclosed the enforcement of the shrinkwrap restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's tortious interference with contract. Impression Products In April 2015, the Federal Circuit sua sponte called for briefing and amicus curiae participation in an en banc consideration of whether Mallinckrodt should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Quanta case.

Led by their chieftains ‚Äì Charles Curtis, John Sarsfield, Patrick Delaney, Teri Sullivan (aka \\"WR Rickson\\", according to other sources), William Collins, and A. Munn ‚Äì these soldiers terrorized their fellow prisoners, stealing their possessions and sometimes even committing murder. An internal force of soldiers with a policing role, called the \\"Regulators\\", was eventually formed to counter the Raiders' theft and violence. In the early summer of 1864, leading members were finally brought to trial. On July 11, 1864, six of the Raiders' leaders were hanged, concluding the group's control of the Confederate prison. William (\\"Willie\\") Collins and his fellow Raiders appear throughout MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \\"Andersonville\\" (1955). Collins, \\"a New York City rough,\\" first appears near the end of Chapter III, in a scene where he kills a man for his pocket watch.  Historical context  Formally called \\"Camp Sumter\\", Andersonville (as it was later named by prisoners) was established in February 1864 in the small town of Andersonville, Georgia. The camp was established in response to a surplus in prisoners-of-war (POWs) that was the result of a breakdown in POW exchanges in 1863. The surplus had led to overcrowding in Confederate-run POW camps across the northern part of the Confederacy, particularly in the Richmond camps. As a result, the Confederacy needed to create a large Southern prison that could handle a considerable population of inmates.Futch, pp. 1‚Äì6. Andersonville, Georgia, was chosen as a strategic location for the Confederacy's new prison due to its small location and close proximity to fresh water and a railroad. Originally about , the camp would later be expanded to . The entire camp was surrounded by a high stockade, with large guard towers known as \\"pigeon roosts\\" located every 30 yards.Davis, pp. 1‚Äì12. Located about from the stockade was a smaller fence called the \\"dead line\\" (so termed because any prisoner who crossed this fence would be shot). Its creators built Andersonville not for quality but with the dual priorities of preventing escape and enabling as many prisoners as possible to be housed within the new camp. No wooden barracks were built; prisoners were required to live in self-built tents.Davis, p. 1‚Äì17. At its height in August 1864, the camp housed over 30,000 Union prisoners of war.Davis, p. 24.  Prison conditions  Union prisoner of war in May 1865, upon release from Andersonville Conditions at Andersonville were among the worst of all Civil War prison camps; the camp was extremely overcrowded and starvation was a common cause of death. The overcrowding, coupled with unsanitary conditions, caused illnesses to flourish within the camp. When food was available, prisoners would often suffer from diseases caused by contaminated food and water. Dysentery, scurvy, and gangrene became prolific as a result of the harsh conditions and poor quality of food. In addition to the severe health issues, records indicate that guards often behaved sadistically, sometimes killing prisoners regardless of whether they were breaking camp rules or crossing over the \\"dead line\\". Contributing to the fearsome conditions were the Andersonville Raiders, who used theft, murder, and terror to obtain goods and power within the prison. Organization and methods \\"The Raiders\\", as they were called within the camp, were known throughout Andersonville for their harsh tactics and vicious behavior towards their fellow inmates. According to John McElroy, the Raiders used various methods to get what they wanted, ranging from \\"sneak thievery to highway robbery\\".McElroy, p. 74. The group's most common method of stealing food and goods involved looking out for \\"promising subjects\\" in crowds of new prisoners, tricking their targets by pretending to help them find a good place to sleep, and then beating and robbing them.McElroy, pp. 73‚Äì74. Another of the Raiders' favored techniques involved sending out teams of spies to track down prisoners suspected of having valuables which could be traded to camp guards. After determining that a prisoner had something of value, the Raiders would wait for him to fall asleep and would then raid his tent. If the prisoner awoke during the robbery, the raiders would threaten him with death if he tried to resist.Futch, p. 65. The Raiders were well organized and had many members who performed a variety of tasks. It is unclear exactly how many members the group had; some sources put membership at 50, while others propose numbers as high as 500. The best estimate is that the Raiders consisted of at least 100 regular members, as well as a number of others who would do favors for the group or provide assistance in exchange for compensation.Futch, p.68. The group was centrally organized around its six most important members, known as the \\"chieftains\\": Charles Curtis, John Sarsfield, Patrick Delaney, Teri Sullivan (or W.R. Rickson, according to other sources), William Collins, and A. Munn.Futch, pp. 64‚Äì65. According to Futch, each of the leaders had henchmen who were organized into groups named after the leaders, such as \\"Collins's Raiders\\" and \\"Curtis's Raiders\\".Futch, p. 64. As a result of their widespread thievery, the Raiders were well stocked and enjoyed considerably better living conditions than their fellow prisoners. They possessed a variety of weapons, ranging from axes to bowie knives. They were also well fed, which gave them a major advantage when it came to fighting; many of their victims were suffering from malnutrition, and consequently were considerably weaker and less able to defend themselves. In addition, for living quarters, the Raiders were able to build a tent that was large enough to fit over one hundred men, constructed mostly with stolen materials.Futch, pp. 65‚Äì68. Given the harsh conditions, overcrowding, and scarcity of basic items needed for survival within Andersonville, the Raiders' actions often resulted in dire consequences for their victims. When the Raiders stole from a person, they would put that person at risk of dying as an indirect or direct result of the robbery. For example, according to former prisoner Warren Goss, in an autobiography of his time spent at Andersonville, the indirect effect of the Raiders \\"[s]tealing blankets from boys unaccustomed to hardships was downright murder\\", because the victim would then be exposed to the \\"chill dews of evening and the frequent rains... and was sure to sicken and die\\".Goss, p. 150. Death could also result more directly from the Raiders' actions, as when a prisoner attempted to resist being robbed by the Raiders, and was murdered in the process. Another account of life at Andersonville describes one such occurrence: \\"one poor fellow came to an untimely death at their [the Raiders'] hands... because he showed resistance to their inhuman attempts\\".Kellogg, pp. 91‚Äì92. While resistance to the Raiders' actions could prove deadly, it also was sometimes effective. Victims ‚Äì particularly new inmates ‚Äì would often be awoken in the middle of the night with a knife to their throat, with their attackers threatening to cut their throat if they moved. Nevertheless, some victims succeeded in defending themselves from these attacks and escaping. John McElroy describes one such event, in which a young man was attacked by eleven Raiders but managed to escape by hitting one of his attackers in the head with a spade; the attacker was knocked down and his fellow Raiders retreated.McElroy, p. 75. It was common for the Raiders to retreat as soon as they realized a form of significant resistance was at hand. While resistance had the potential to be successful, the camp's prisoners needed the motivation to fight the Raiders, and this proved to be a major barrier. The prisoners were suffering from widespread disease, starvation, and the effects of the other harsh conditions within the camp. In contrast to the well-fed, well- stocked, and well-organized Raiders, the prisoners' physical capabilities for resistance, and their abilities to sustain a motivated, organized resistance effort, were significantly weakened. However, by mid-June 1864, the prisoners decided that they could no longer tolerate the Raiders' terrorization and control over Andersonville in addition to the constant threats they also experienced from the camp's guards and the constant risk of death due to the conditions within the camp. They organized to bring their complaints to Confederate authorities, and they also formed an inner prison police force to defend against and capture the Raiders. Defense against the Raiders The first organized resistance efforts within Andersonville involved small groups of prisoners - usually members of the same platoon or squadron ‚Äì forming together in defense against the Raiders. The groups would agree that if one of their members were attacked, he would scream out an agreed-upon code word; the other members of the group would then come to the victim's defense and would scare away the attackers. For example, members of the Plymouth Squad would yell \\"Plymouth!\\" when being attacked, and all of the other members of the squad would come to their rescue.Goss, pp. 150‚Äì151. McElroy also describes a similar situation in which a victim would scream \\"Raiders!\\" and the prisoners around him would attack the robbers. However, in order to defeat the Raiders, the prisoners would have to become more organized, and would also need some sort of backing from the Confederate authorities. On June 29, 1864, a prisoner named Dowd was beaten severely by two Raiders, and had some of his valuables (including a watch and money) stolen.Futch, pp. 68‚Äì70. After his attack, Dowd went immediately to the front gate of the prison in order to confront the Confederate guards and demand justice. His complaints caught the interest of Andersonville's head official, Captain Henry Wirz. After hearing Dowd's story, Wirz announced that he would cut off all rations until the Raiders were turned in.Futch, p. 69. As a result of Wirz's actions, an internal police force, commonly known as \\"the Regulators\\", was quickly organized within the camp. The Regulators were not new to the camp, but they became significantly more powerful after Dowd's case was brought to Captain Wirz. According to McElroy, a small band of soldiers calling themselves the Regulators had previously existed within the camp; prior to Wirz's involvement, their actions were limited to beating Raiders who attacked other prisoners. However, after Wirz became involved, permission to organize a police force was given the inmates, and the Regulators began to make arrests and hold the individuals they arrested until they were given a fair trial.McElroy, pp. 78‚Äì79. The Regulators were also given additional powers beyond the ability to arrest and hold suspects. According to the diary of a prisoner named John Ransom, Captain Wirz gave the internal police force permission to set up a court and put offenders on trial. Wirz also gave the Regulators full permission to administer any punishments they deemed necessary, from more minor penalties such as lashings or public humiliation, to death by hanging.Ransom, pp. 105‚Äì107. Arrest and punishment Most of the Regulators' arrests of suspected Raiders took place between June 29 and July 10, 1864, when the main offenders were tried and hanged.Ransom, p. 105. The Regulators were able to round up most of the Raiders by attacking them at their headquarters; while the Raiders put up considerable resistance, they were overthrown by the Regulators. In his diary, Ransom notes that the first night of arrests were successful because, \\"thirty or forty of the worst characters in camp had been taken outside\\".Ransom, pp. 105‚Äì106. Ransom also notes that it was very difficult to protect the captured Raiders from being lynched, rather than being given a fair trial as promised. Estimates of how many Raiders were arrested vary from source to source, but the number is likely to be somewhere between 75 (according to what Ransom believed) and 150 (as estimated by McElroy). After the Raiders' arrests, as promised by Captain Wirz, the offenders were put on trial for their crimes against their fellow prisoners. The court was set up much like a typical court, including a judge and jury of the offenders' peers.Ransom, p. 108. Of those who were convicted by the court, many were given relatively light sentences, such as \\"setting in the stocks, strung up by the thumbs, thumb screws, head hanging, etc.\\" Another of the lesser punishments was the running of the gauntlet. Those sentenced to this punishment were forced to run through a gauntlet of inmates who were given clubs and allowed to hit the offenders as they ran by.McElroy, pp. 85‚Äì86. In some cases, the Raiders running the gauntlet were able to escape with just a few blows to the head, but a few were beaten so badly that they died as a result of their injuries. While most of the convicted Raiders received non-lethal punishments, six members, who were considered the group's leaders, were given the most severe punishment: death by hanging. The six leaders ‚Äì Sarsfield, Collins, Curtis, Delaney, Munn, and SullivanRansom, pp. 112‚Äì113. ‚Äì were executed on July 11, 1864, on a set of gallows that was built that day.Ransom, p. 112. On the way to the gallows, Curtis escaped from his rope ties and fled, but was caught by the police and returned to the gallows. Each man was given time to say some last words before he was hanged. Munn expressed great remorse for his acts and hoped that God would show him mercy; Collins pleaded for mercy from the crowd and claimed that he was innocent; and Sarsfield gave a long speech in which he, too, expressed some regret. Delaney and Curtis, however, showed no contrition; Delaney went so far as to say that he would \\"rather be hanged than live here [in Andersonville]\\".Ransom, pp. 112‚Äì115. All six were buried separately from the rest of those who died at the camp. Their execution marked the end of the Raiders' reign over Andersonville.

Founded by John B. Bartholomew, the company continued to produce automobiles until 1920, when the company began manufacturing trucks for the Avery Company, of which Bartholomew was also president. Company origins J. B. Bartholomew started with the Avery Company in Galesburg, Illinois on December 8, 1879 driving a team to haul lumber for a US$1.10 per day. In 1882 the Avery company purchased in Peoria, Illinois and moved the business there to North Adams and North Jefferson Streets. In 1892, Robert Avery, the president of the Avery Co., died and Bartholomew was made vice-president. He had for the prior ten years been in Des Moines, Iowa, managing one of the Avery Co. plants, and where he also built up a small side business, the Bartholomew Company, to manufacture popcorn and peanut roasters and wagons. Upon his return to Peoria to become vice president of the Avery Company, he continued his side business. In 1900, he moved the company's manufacturing facility to a new facility on the 300-500 block of Glide Avenue in Peoria. Models produced In 1901 Batholomew began experimenting with automobile manufacturing, and in 1902 he added automobiles to the Bartholomew Company production line. Their slogan was \\"Ride in a Glide, Then Decide.\\" They made a total of seven models, though never more than 500 cars in a year, and usually less. The first car was a single-cylinder tiller- steered runabout named the Glidemobile. By 1904, they had added a steering wheel and increased the engine to . The engine was positioned horizontally under the seat, featured a single chain-drive and an optional tonneau top. The two-seater sold for US$750, and the tonneau top for US$850. About 25 were sold in 1903 and twice that in 1904. In 1905 they introduced a 14 hp 2-cylinder engine and in 1906 a 36 hp 4-cylinder front-mounted engine. They stopped making single- and two-cylinder engines in 1906, and in 1907 they added a 50/60 hp 6-cylinder Model H. This was mounted on a wheelbase and sold for US$3500. In 1908, the company stock was worth $200,000. The cars were sold through dealers in Des Moines, New Orleans, Boston, San Francisco, New York City, Butte (Montana), Washington D.C., Indianapolis, Allegheny (Pennsylvania), Wausau (Wisconsin) and Montreal. The Model H was made for only two years, and from 1909-1915 the cars featured a 4-cylinder, engine, shaft drive, and several bodies including roadster or tourer makes. They began offering a closed car for the first time in 1916, when they also returned to offering a 6-cylinder engine. They produced about 200 cars per year, until 1916 when this rose to about 500 autos. The new Model 6-40 offered a smaller engine than the Model H, on a wheelbase. This sold for US$1095 as a tourer body and US$1295 as a sedan. This model remained largely the same through 1920. Absorbed into Avery Company In 1920, as competition from Buick and Studebaker increased, Bartholomew decided to bring the plant into the Avery Company fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery Company employed four thousand people by this point, but went into bankruptcy and receivership in 1923. President J. B. Bartholomew died in 1924.

Preseason Entering the season, the Gators had to overcome the loss of Marreese Speights, who after his sophomore season, left for the 2008 NBA Draft. Speights was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers. To help replace his presence on the court, the Gators welcomed six freshmen to the team. The Gators won their two preseason games against Rollins and Warner.

It was painted between 1808 and 1810 in Dresden and was first shown together with the painting The Abbey in the Oakwood (Abtei im Eichwald) in the Berlin Academy exhibition of 1810. On Friedrich's request The Monk by the Sea was hung above The Abbey in the Oakwood.Held: Romantik, 2003, p. 81. After the exhibition, both pictures were bought by king Frederick Wilhelm III for his collection.Friedrich, Norbert Wolf, Taschen, p. 31. Today, the paintings hang side by side in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. For its lack of concern with creating the illusion of depth, The Monk by the Sea was Friedrich's most radical composition. The broad expanses of sea and sky emphasize the meager figure of the monk, standing before the vastness of nature and the presence of God.van Prooyen, Kristina. The Realm of the Spirit: Caspar David Friedrich's artwork in the context of romantic theology, with special reference to Friedrich Schleiermacher Journal of the Oxford University History Society, Winter 2004. Development A single figure, dressed in a long garment, stands on a low dune sprinkled with grass. The figure, usually identified as a monk, has turned almost completely away from the viewer and surveys a rough sea and a gray, blank sky that takes up about three quarters of the picture. It is unclear whether he is standing on a high rock or only on a gentle slope to the sea. The dune forms an inexpressive triangle in the composition, at the farthest point of which is the figure. Contrasting with the dark ocean there are several whitecaps of waves sometimes mistaken for seagulls. Although Friedrich's paintings are landscapes, he designed and painted them in his studio, using freely drawn plein air sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The composition of The Monk by the Sea shows evidence of this reductive process, as Friedrich removed elements from the canvas after they were painted. Recent scientific investigations have revealed that he had initially painted two small sailing ships on the horizon, which he later removed. Friedrich continued to modify the details of the painting right up to its exhibition‚Äîto the sky's grey was added blue, with stars and a moon‚Äîbut the basic composition always stayed the same.Die Briefe/ Caspar David Friedrich, p. 66 The picture appeared at a time when Friedrich had his first public success and critical acknowledgment with his controversial Tetschener Altar, a work that explicitly fused the landscape format with a religious theme. The Monk by the Sea furthered his success and drew much attention. Friedrich probably began the painting in Dresden, 1808. In a letter of February 1809, he described the image for the first time. The stages in its conception were also documented by guests to his studio. In June 1809, the wife of painter Gerhard von K√ºgelgen, an acquaintance of Friedrich, visited him and later criticized the painting in a letter; she was put off by the loneliness of the setting and the lack of consolation that movement or narrative might provide the \\"unending space of air\\". Art historian Albert Boime believed that the figure of the monk was Friedrich, walking on the cliffs at R√ºgen, which would place the subject near the site where a Protestant mystic built a chapel for poor fishermen who were far from home and wished to profess their faith.Eisler, Colin. Masterworks in Berlin: A City's Paintings Reunited, Little Brown and Company, 1996. The identification of the monk as a self-portrait has been accepted by other scholars, both for physical resemblances to Friedrich (the long blond hair and round skull), and for the fact that, in keeping with the perception of artists as belonging to a \\"higher priesthood\\", Friedrich later painted himself in a monk's clothing.  Contemporary reception  The painting was exhibited in its current form at the Berlin Academy in October 1810, to much controversy and criticism. The composition notably lacks a repoussoir‚Äîa framing device that leads the viewer's gaze into the image. Rather, the emptiness of the foreground is overwhelming. It is commonly argued that a viewer of this painting has difficulty relating himself to the picture's space. One cannot mentally \\"penetrate\\" the image: Friedrich has created an unbridgeable gap between the monk and the viewer. The monk is cut off from us spatially and existentially, and there are no traditional landscape elements that might soften the effect‚Äîonly a cold sky and a flat foreground, void of greenery, and a dark sea, reduced to a narrow band on which no vessels sail. Friedrich has compressed space in a manner anticipating abstract art; The Monk by the Sea has been described as \\"perhaps the first 'abstract' painting in a very modern sense\\".Miller In the month of the exhibition, German Romantic author Clemens Brentano submitted an article on the painting to the Berliner Abendbl√§tter, a new daily journal edited by his friend Heinrich von Kleist. The piece, titled \\"Different Feelings about a Seascape by Friedrich on which is a Capuchin Monk\\", was critical of the work, but Kleist substantially revised Brentano's text to produce an article sympathetic to Friedrich's painting. Kleist's commentary has become a central element in discussion of the painting and of Friedrich; the two men are seen as at odds with the aesthetic of the more conventional German Romantics, in which Brentano was firmly entrenched. Kleist wrote, for example: > How wonderful it is to sit completely alone by the sea under an overcast > sky, gazing out over the endless expanse of water. It is essential that one > has come there just for this reason, and that one has to return. That one > would like to go over the sea but cannot; that one misses any sign of life, > and yet one senses the voice of life in the rush of the water, in the > blowing of the wind, in the drifting of the clouds, in the lonely cry of the > birds ... No situation in the world could be more sad and eerie than this‚Äîas > the only spark of life in the wide realm of death, a lonely center in a > lonely circle... Nevertheless, this definitively marks a totally new > departure in Friedrich's art...Quoted with translation in: More famously, Kleist also wrote, \\"since in its monotony and boundlessness it has no foreground except the frame, when viewing it, it is as if one's eyelids had been cut away.\\"Quoted with translation in: The painting was too minimalist for Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had been a supporter of Friedrich by introducing his work to the duke of Weimar and gaining prizes for him at an 1805 exhibition. Goethe said the painting \\"could be looked at standing on one's head\\", making a criticism that would be levied against abstract artists a century later.  Influence  James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Harmony in blue and silver: Trouville, 1865. The Monk by the Sea inspired responses from painters like Gustave Courbet and James Abbott McNeill Whistler later in the 19th century. In works such as Gustave Courbet's The Coast Near Palavas a lone figure is depicted as a seeker, similarly exposed and looking out to sea.Wolf, p. 34 Expressionist painter Franz Marc's Horse in a Landscape bears formal similarities with The Monk by the Sea. Friedrich, though a Romantic painter, had a significant influence on later Symbolist and Expressionist artists. Franz Marc's Horse in a Landscape (1910) has been described as formally similar to The Monk by the Sea. Although their use of colour is at two extremes, both paintings are compositionally simple, with undulating horizontals and a figure that looks out at the same scene as the viewer. In his 1961 article \\"The Abstract Sublime\\", the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening StarReproduction of Turner's The Evening Star here \\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved on November 21, 2008. and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and BlueSee also, Geldzahler (1969), 353. Reproduction of the Rothko can be found here . as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, \\"Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail‚Äîa bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape‚Äîis no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night.\\"Rosenblum, Robert. \\"The Abstract Sublime\\". Reprinted in: Rosenblum goes on to say, \\"Like the mystic trinity of sky, water and earth that, in the Friedrich and Turner appears to emanate from one source, the floating horizontal tiers of veiled light in the Rothko seem to conceal a total, remote presence that we can only intuit and never fully grasp. These infinite glowing voids carry us beyond reason to the Sublime; we can only submit to them in an act of faith and let ourselves be absorbed into their radiant depths.\\" From the 1960s on, Gotthard Graubner's picture-size coloured cushions or \\"color- space bodies\\" were also inspired by Friedrich's The Monk by the Sea.Raum der Stille im Landtag Nordrhein-Westfalen.Sabine Sch√ºtz, \\"Color-Space Bodies: The Art of Gotthard Graubner\\", Arts Magazine, Volume 65, April 1991, pp. 49-53. According to art historian Werner Hofmann, both Graubner and Friedrich created an aesthetics of monotony as a counterpart to the aesthetics of variety that was predominant before the nineteenth century.\\"Kissenkunst, zerrissene Realit√§t\\", Die Zeit, 19 December 1975.

Several species are found in North America as well. These stocky geometer moths seem to be closely related to other robust tribes, such as the Campaeini, Ennomini, Lithinini and Nacophorini - all of which might warrant to be subsumed in the Ennomini - the genus Odontopera, and perhaps the Caberini and Colotoini.Young (2008) The tribe was first described by William Trowbridge Merrifield Forbes in 1948. Description They rest with their wings stretched out parallel to the surface, and the hindwings hidden under the forewings unlike most related Ennominae. Though they are among the larger Geometridae, they are nonetheless not very conspicuous; the outer third of the forewings is usually conspicuously lighter than the middle third, and at the apical end of the forewing cell there is usually a white or black spot, altogether very much reminiscent of the Ennomini's pattern. At least some Azelinini lack the sensillae at the end of the adults' antennae found in most geometer moths. The foreleg tarsi are relatively short, as in many of their relatives. The hindwing veins Sc and R1 are extensively fused in some Azelinini, reminding of the Larentiini which are not very closely related. The characteristic comb of transverse setae on the underside of the males' abdominal segment A3, found in many Ennominae, is apparently absent in the Azelinini, as is the associated \\"scent-brush\\" on the hindleg tibiae. The male genital's valvae usually have complex autapomorphic modifications (such as a hypertrophied ampulla and gnathos) in this tribe, but the valvula, like in their relatives, is not distally expanded. Unusually, they have both an elongated uncus and well-developed socii;, the sacculus is rarely hairy and the saccus' vinculum is generally neither extended nor recurved. Some Azelilini, perhaps all, completely lack the cornuti (spines) on the vesica of the aedeagus usually found in Lepidoptera. Of the female genitalia, the ovipositor is narrow. A robust funnel-shaped antrum - the foremost part of the ostium bursae - is present and the interior of the corpus bursae is studded with small spines, while the ductus bursae is delicate and not sclerotized much. Like the Nacophorini, their caterpillars have many setae on the (vestigial) prolegs of abdominal segment A6. And like the Ennomini and Nacophorini, their pupae have antennal tubercles. The chorion cell walls of their eggs are visibly reticulated only around the micropyle. Selected genera As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe,See references in Savela (2008) the genus list is preliminary. * Pero Herrich- Sch√§ffer, 1855 * Stenaspilatodes Franclemont & Poole, 1972 Oratha, usually placed in the Nacophorini, might also belong here.

The basement of the North Sea was formed in an intraplate setting during the Precambrian. Rigid blocks were overlaid with various depositions, sands and salts. These rigid blocks were transformed to a metamorphic base due to tectonic processes such as continental collisions which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion in the Caledonian plate cycle as well as the Variscan plate cycle. The blocks were also subjected to metamorphic evolution during the Triassic and Jurassic periods when the rock was heated up by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth's interior. The Caledonian (Iapetus) plate cycle saw the formation of the Iapetus suture during the Caledonian orogeny. The Iapetus suture was a major weakness creating a volcanic fault in the central North Sea during the later Jurassic period. The Iapetus ocean was replaced with a suture line and mountain range when Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia continents collided. This collision formed Laurussia. The Variscan (Rheic) plate cycle resulted in the formation of Pangaea when Gondwana and Laurussia collided. The elimination of the Rheic Ocean caused the formation of a massive mountain range through the border countries of the present day North Sea. Triassic and Jurassic volcanic rifting and graben fault systems created highs and lows in the North Sea area. This was followed by late Mesozoic and Cenozoic subsidence creating the intracratonic sedimentary basin of the North Sea. This era experienced higher sea levels because of sea floor spreading, cooler lithosphere temperatures. Plate tectonics and continental orogenies combined to create the continents and the North Sea as we know them today. The final events affecting the North Sea coastline features and submarine topography occurred in the Cenozoic era. Tectonic structure The Mesozoic structures underneath the North Sea can be seen as a failed rift system. After initial crustal extension and the formation of rift basins during the Triassic and Jurassic periods, the extension concentrated on the other side of the British Isles, which would create the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rift basins even saw some inversion during the late Cretaceous and Eocene epochs. From the Oligocene onward, tensions in the European crust caused by the Alpine orogeny to the south cause a new, more modest phase of extension. Some grabens in the area are still active. The subsurface of the North Sea area is dominated by grabens: the north-west south-east oriented Lower Rhine Graben under the southern North Sea and the Netherlands, the north‚Äìsouth-oriented North Sea Central Graben that begins north of the Dutch coast and ends in the region east of Scotland, and the Viking Graben along the south-east Norwegian coast. The Horn Graben is a smaller graben east of the Central Graben and in front of the Danish coast. Another smaller structure is known as the Terschelling Graben, which borders the Central Graben in the west, just north of the Netherlands.Geology of the North Sea from Petroleum Geology A larger graben is found in the subsurface below the Skagerrak, this north-south structure is called the Bamble-Oslo Graben. Map on page 303 The Viking Graben is separated from the Faeroe Shetland Basin below the Atlantic by the Shetland Platform, the two structures join in the area north-east of the Shetland Islands. Geologic history Precambrian The area we now call the North Sea was interspersed amid several separate continental areas (Siberia, Baltica, Gondwana, and Laurentia) as well as the Iapetus Ocean and Tornquist Sea. Plate tectonics and continental collisions (orogenies) brought the features together of the North Sea that we recognise presently. Paleozoic orogenies =Finnmarkian, Athollian, Caledonian orogenies= Image:Euramerica en.svgEuramerica showing the Caledonian orogeny Image:Caledonides EN.svgThe branches of the Caledonian/Acadian belts at the end of the Caledonian orogeny (Early Devonian). Present-day coastlines are in gray.Later in geological history, the Atlantic Ocean opened and the parts of the orogenic belt moved apart. Reconstruction based on Matte (2001); Stampfli et al. (2002); Torsvik et al. (1996) and Ziegler (1990) The Finnmarkian orogeny affected northern Norway in the early Palaeozoic era. In the late Ordovician period, Avalonia collided with Baltica creating the Tornquist Margin. This corresponds to the suture of the north German-Polish Caledonides. By the end of the Ordovician the Tornquist Sea had been eliminated. The Tornquist-Tesseyre fault system also had its beginnings in the orogeny closing the Tornquist Sea. Baltica subducted below Avalonia. The Atthollian Orogeny was a collision between the Scottish Highlands and a Midland Valley area which very likely created the Highland Boundary Fault. During the late Silurian period Baltica then collided with Laurentia which is named the Scandian phase of the Caledonian Orogeny. Baltica was subducted below Laurentia forming the Caledonian Belt. The Caledonian Orogeny caused the closure of the Iapetus Ocean when the continents and terranes of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia collided. The combined mass of the three continents formed a \\"new\\" continent: Laurussia or Euramerica.See for paleogeographic reconstructions of the collisions for example Stanley (1999), p. 386; Ziegler (1990), pp. 17‚Äì19 The Caledonian orogeny encompasses events that occurred from the Ordovician to Early Devonian, roughly 490‚Äì390 Ma. The basement formations of the North Sea were roughly formed during this Caledonian geosynclinal stage of the Cambrian ‚Äì Devonian periods. The Caledonian mountains range helped create the 'Old Red Sandstone' continent at the joining of the tectonic plates. The Rheic Ocean began to open to the south. =Acadian Orogeny= The Acadian orogeny occurred in the Lower Devonian period (Paleozoic era), about 500 Ma. The continents of Laurentia and Baltica collided. The Iapetus Ocean disappeared under this continental collision. These plate tectonic forces built up a mountain range extending from what is now termed the Adirondacks north through Nova Scotia, the British Isles, Norway and the eastern margin of Greenland. Greenland and Scandinavia were situated at the amid the equator and mid tropics (20 to 20 degrees north). The area now comprising Greenland-Scandinavia-British Isles began drifting northward in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian period. A high amount of volatile magmatism caused dikes parallel to the Tornquist Margin which were formative areas of the North Sea ‚Äì British Isles -Germany ‚Äì southwest Sweden area. The continents after the Caledonian orogeny (Devonian to Permian times).Differences in fossil faunas astride the red line (the Iapetus suture) show that an ocean was between the two sides before the continents were joined in the supercontinent Pangaea. Figure based on Windley (1996) and Ziegler (1990) Pangaea 230 ma =Variscan Orogeny= The Rheic Ocean or Proto-Tethys Ocean was eliminated during the Hercynian/Variscan orogeny, and the Pangaea supercontinent formed. The continents of Gondwana and Laurussia collided, both were drifting north, however Gondwana was drifting at a faster rate. The mountain range which was created extended along Spain, Brittany, central Germany and into Poland. The closure of the Rheic Ocean in the late Carboniferous formed thrusts in southern England. The Pangaea supercontinent was added to in the late Permian period when Siberia collided with Baltica and Kazakhstan. Pangaea was surrounded by massive subduction plate tectonics. The North Sea area was central to the continental Pangaea supercontinent. In this period the area now named the North Sea was in the subtropics and was a non-marine arid environment. Permo‚ÄìTriassic rifting and thermal subsidence A graben fault system typical of the Viking graben and Central graben During the Triassic period, the Viking and Central Graben volcanic systems were formed. Upward thrusting rifts were formed during the Triassic comprising the taphrogenic stage. The Atlantic rift zone is associated with the North Sea rifts zone. The Triassic saw active crustal stretching via the rifting process, lower sea levels and volcanic activity. Jurassic As the Jurassic (200‚Äì145 Ma) started, Pangaea began to break up into two continents, Gondwana and Laurasia. At this time sea levels rose. The burial of algae and bacteria below the mud of the sea floor during this time resulted in the formation of North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to dinosaurs.McKirdy et al. (2007) op cit page 146.Gillen, Con (2003) op cit Pages 133‚Äì7. =Middle Jurassic domal uplift= Volcanism and a rift system developed in the central North Sea area where basaltic lavas were extruded. The mantle warped upwards creating a dome in the middle of the North Sea where the Iapetus Suture intersected the Tornquist-Teisseyre fault system. The dome area was amidst the Viking Graben, Central Graben and Moray Firth Basin. The Scotland rifting and the extrusive centre of the Forties were associated with the uplifted area. The Long Forties and Horda Basin were also volcanic centres. During this time the sea level fell. Major reservoirs were created in the North sea during this time as clastics and sands were deposited in paralic environments. Cretaceous period sea floor spreading During the cretaceous the main rift expansion was in an east and west direction. There are two basins the large South Permian Basin, and the smaller Northern Permian basin, which are east-west trending. The basins are separated by the Ringk√∏bing-Fyn system of highs. The Viking Graben lies between the Shetland Platform and the Fenno- Scandian high. The Central Graben lies amid the Permian basins and their high. The formation of these has been influenced by the zig zag suture line of the Caledonian orogeny with its areas of crustal tension weakness. Sea floor expansion continues, and sea levels rise. The sea level is to higher than present day levels. In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are characteristic for the Chalk Group, which forms the white cliffs of Dover on the south coast of England and similar cliffs on the French Normandian coast. The group is found in England, northern France, the low countries, northern Germany, Denmark and in the subsurface of the southern part of the North Sea. Stagnation of deep sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic circumstances in the sea water. In many places around the world, dark anoxic shales were formed during this interval.See Stanley (1999), pp. 481‚Äì482 These shales are an important source rock for oil and gas, for example in the subsurface of the North Sea. Across the north central and northern North Sea, the Chalk Group is a major seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards. The Silverpit crater, a diameter suspected impact crater in the North Sea The age of the feature is constrained between 74 ‚Äì 45 million years (Late Cretaceous ‚Äì Eocene). The Sole Pit Basin was created by deep burial of depocentres. Cenozoic era intracratonic basin formation Northern hemisphere glaciation during the last ice ages.Northern hemisphere glaciation during the last ice ages. The accumulation of to thick ice sheets caused a sea level lowering of about . Also, the Alps and the Himalayas were covered by glaciers. Winter sea ice coverage was much more limited in the south. Geologically, the Cenozoic is the era when the continents moved into their current positions. The Alpine Orogeny, the spreading of the Mid Atlantic ridge, and the creation of the Atlantic Ocean basin occurred in the Cenozoic era. The Iceland hot spot and North Atlantic rifting helped to exhume the British Isles. In the early Palaeogene period (Caenozoic Era) between 63 and 52 Ma, the North Sea formed, and Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The post rift phase followed late Jurassic rift events during the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic thermal subsidence. As the rifting stopped, then regional subsidence occurred creating an intracratonic sedimentary basin. Subsidence occurred due to lithosphere cooling. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. Intraplate compression was caused when the Atlantic Ocean basin formed. the Mid-Atlantic spreading ridge has been busy separating east from west. Greenland separated from North America and the rifting altered direction during the Paleogene, which caused Northern Europe to separate from Greenland. During the Eocene period, the last land bridge across the Atlantic sank. The Alpine Orogeny that occurred about 50 Ma was responsible for the shaping of the London Basin syncline and the Weald anticline to the south. The eastern end of the London Basin merges with the basin of the North Sea, extending on land along the north Kent coast to Reculver and up the east coast of Essex and into Suffolk, where it is overlain by Pleistocene 'Crag' deposits which cover much of eastern Suffolk and Norfolk and are better considered as part of the North Sea basin.Ellison R.A. et al. 2004, Geology of London: Special Memoir for 1:50,000 Geological sheets 256 (North London), 257 (Romford), 270 (South London) and 271 (Dartford) (England and Wales), British Geological Survey, Keyworth, In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs of the Neogene period, further uplift and erosion occurred, particularly in the Pennines. Plant and animal types developed into their modern forms, and by about 2 Ma the landscape would have been broadly recognisable today. =Quaternary glaciations= The Pleistocene saw the sea retreat from the basin as global sea-level fell due to accumulation of ice sheets.Sumbler M.G. (4th Ed 1996), London and the Thames Valley, British Regional Geology series, British Geological Survey, The major changes during the Pleistocene epoch have been brought about by several recent ice ages. Pleistocene *Ice age 72k-12k BP Ice age glaciation locally called: *: Wisconsin (in North America) *: Devensian (in the British Isles) *: Midlandian (in Ireland) *: W√ºrm (in the Alps) *: Weichsel (in northern central Europe) *Interglacial 131k-115k BP *: Sangamonian Stage in North America *: Ipswichian interglacial in the UK *: Riss-W√ºrm interglacial in the Alps It began about 131,000 years ago. The warmest peak of the Eemian was around 125,000 years ago, when forests reached as far north as North Cape (which is now tundra) in northern Norway. Sea levels at that time were 5‚Äì8 meters higher than they are now, possibly indicating greater deglaciation than today (mostly from partial melting of the ice sheet of Greenland). The era quickly cooled to conditions cooler and drier than the present, and by 114,000 years ago, a glacial era had returned. *Ice age 200k-125k BP Ice age glaciation locally called: *: Wolstonian glaciation (in the British Isles) *: Illinoian Stage in the US *: Warthe glaciation and Saalian glaciation in northern Europe *: Riss glaciation in the Alps *Interglacial 300k-200k BP Interglacial locally called: *: Hoxnian interglacial in the UK *: Pre-Illinoian Stage in North America *: Holstein interglacial in northern Europe *: Mindel-Riss interglacial in the Alps It began about 300,000 ago and ended 200,000 years ago. *Ice age 410k-380k BP Ice age glaciation locally called: *: Pre-Illinoian Stage in North America *: Anglian glaciation in UK *: Elster glaciation in northern Europe *: Mindel glaciation in the Alps *Interglacial 600k-450k BP Interglacial locally called: *: Cromerian interglacial in the UK *: Pre-Illinoian Stage in North America *: G√ºnz-Mindel interglacial in the Alps It began about 600,000 ago and ended 450,000 years ago. During glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, causing global sea level to drop by about 120 meters, exposing the continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum LGM, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe. 350px At one time there was land where the strait is now, a south-east extension of the Weald joining what is now Great Britain to continental Europe. The Strait of Dover opened during the Ice Age, as described below; as a result the British Isles have now become islands not connected with continental Europe any longer. The English Channel was formed by erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald-Artois chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Afterwards, the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel, but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed northwards. In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or end-moraines left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the Channeled Scablands in the USA..Europe cut adrift\\", by Philip Gibbard, pp 259‚Äì260, Nature, vol 448, 19 July 2007 Glaciation had an enormous impact on the coastline of the North Sea. The west coast of Denmark is notable as it had been very glaciated during the Saale Glacial Stage and Weichselian glaciation. As the sea levels fell in the Holocene epoch, Denmark's north coast gave way to raised spits, beach ridges and cliffs. During the glacial maximum in Scandinavia regionally referred to as the Weichsel glaciation, only the western parts of Jutland were ice-free, and a large part of what is today the North Sea was dry land connecting Jutland with Britain. It is also in Denmark that the only Scandinavian ice-age animals older than 13,000 BC are found. In the period following the last interglacial before the current one (Eemian Stage), the coast of Norway was also ice-free. The Baltic Sea, with its unique brackish water, is a result of meltwater from the Weichsel glaciation combining with saltwater from the North Sea when the straits between Sweden and Denmark opened. The North Sea produces fossils from every period of the Pleistocene. The area was a dry steppe landscape, overlain with rivers, where animals such as the elephant-like mastodon, scimitar cat, southern mammoth, hippopotamus, horses, bears and giant deer lived. They were flooded at the close of the last Ice Age.

Career 1976‚Äì1998 Wetland graduated from the University of Oslo with the cand.jur. degree in 1976. He was hired in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the same year, but left to work as a deputy judge in Grimstad from 1978 to 1979. From 1983 to 1983 he worked as a secretary at the Norwegian embassy in West Germany.Biography at Government.no. Retrieved on 23 November 2008. He then returned to Norway to work as a civil servant. He worked in the Norwegian Office of the Prime Minister from 1985 to 1990, except for a period between 1989 and 1990 when he worked as director of the legal department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1991 he was promoted to deputy under- secretary of State () in the Office of the Prime Minister. In 1992 Wetland was responsible for coining the phrase , which translates to \\"It is typical for Norwegians to be clever\\". The phrase was used in a New Year's speech by then- Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, and quickly became famous in Norway. In 1994 Wetland moved from the administrative to the partisan political stratum in the Office of the Prime Minister, as he was appointed State Secretary in the third cabinet Brundtland. He lost this job when Gro Harlem Brundtland resigned in 1996. In the new cabinet Jagland, he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, but only lasted for less than two months, from 1 November to 18 December 1996.Thorbj√∏rn Jagland's Government, 25 October 1996 - 17 October 1997 - Government.no.

The same year be became the Norway's Ambassador to Germany, serving until 2003. During this period, he notably fell out with Bjarne Lindstr√∏m, who, being permanent under- secretary of State () in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was the highest- ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry. Wetland resigned, reportedly due to the tension, and worked two years as a director in Statkraft. However, Bjarne Lindstr√∏m was himself a controversial person. In 2005 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came under scrutiny for the handling of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, a natural disaster that gravely affected Norwegian citizens abroad. An ad hoc commission was set up, with Jan Rein√•s as the leader and Wetland as a member. Its final report contained strong criticism of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lindstr√∏m lost his position as permanent under- secretary, although he became Norway's Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Wetland was publicly accused, by anonymous sources, of having a personal vendetta against Lindstr√∏m; however no sanctions were taken against this. 2005‚Äì2008 In the autumn of 2005, when the second cabinet Stoltenberg assumed office, Wetland returned to politics as State Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister. At the time of the appointment, it was noted that Wetland was a member of the so-called Kristiania Forum, an informal group consisting of perceived right-wing elite members of the Labour Party. He left on 1 January 2008, having handed in his resignation in late 2007. 2008‚Äì2012 In late February 2008 he was appointed as Norway's new Permanent Representative to the United Nations. This was not uncontroversial. The foreign affairs administration had originally singled out another candidate, peace process veteran Mona Juul, who was the deputy leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations at that time. Instead, Wetland was appointed. Already in December 2007, when it became known that Wetland had applied for the position, the question was raised whether Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg or Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re had a conflict of interest in the process.

He was not present when the Council of State discussed the case. Jonas Gahr St√∏re chose to participate in the Council of State meeting. It surfaced, however, that St√∏re and Wetland had a long history of acquaintance, having attended each other's fortieth birthday parties in 1990 and 1991 respectively. St√∏re was specifically criticized for this by the political opposition.

She saw service during the latter stages of World War II and during the Cold War. In 1962 she was loaned to Ethiopia, where she served in the Ethiopian Navy as the training ship Ethiopia (A-01) until 1991. She was the Ethiopian Navys largest ship until she was sold for scrapping in 1993. Construction and commissioning Orca was laid down on 13 July 1942 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 4 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J. W. Reeves, Jr., and commissioned on 23 January 1944, with Commander Morton K. Fleming, Jr., in command. United States Navy service World War II =New Guinea campaign= After shakedown off San Diego, California, Orca sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, escorting the escort aircraft carrier . Reporting to Commander, Naval Air Force, United States Seventh Fleet, she was ordered on to Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, where she commenced operations with her first seaplane squadron on 26 May 1944. Orcas squadrons carried out \\"Black Cat\\" night bombing and reconnaissance missions during the ensuing five months. These missions, in which black-painted Martin PBM Mariner flying boats conducted night bombing strikes against Japanese shipping, proved to be tremendously destructive to the Japanese. For them, the squadrons were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Commander Fleming, Orcas captain and commanding officer of the task unit that included the ship and her squadrons, was awarded the Legion of Merit. Orcas squadrons also carried out air-sea rescue missions in support of the United States Army's 13th Air Force. =Philippines campaign= In early November 1944, Orca moved into the Leyte Gulf area in the Philippines, as that campaign was reaching the critical stage. She sent her planes into Ormoc Bay right under the noses of the Japanese on 3 December 1944, and they taxied around the bay for nearly an hour picking up survivors of destroyer , sunk the previous night. After the Japanese finally realized what was taking place, they threw up quite a fusillade. The pilots bore down on the throttles and headed for the open sea. Heavily loaded, the old Martin PBM Mariners finally heaved themselves into the air, after about a three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) run. Making additional trips, they were able to rescue 167 Cooper survivors. Orca was attacked by a lone plane on 27 August 1944, but her guns drove it off. That next night, the Japanese radio propagandist Tokyo Rose announced that \\"The volume of ack-ack which met the previous night's raid indicated that a battleship of the Wisconsin class had been sighted at Middleburg Island.\\"This quote, from Orcas Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/o3/orca-ii.htm, is unattributed Orca came under similar attack twice on 26 November 1944, and was credited with an assist on a plane which narrowly missed motor torpedo boat tender . On 2 January 1945, kamikaze suicide planes attacked Orcas convoy formation. In the attack, a minesweeper was destroyed and Orca was slightly damaged as a plane crashed close alongside, showering her with wreckage and bomb fragments and wounding six of her gun crew. Tokyo Rose overstated the attack's results by announcing that the kamikaze \\"special attack group\\" had sunk one battleship and one heavy cruiser and seriously damaged three other cruisers in a large convoy moving north along the coast of Mindoro. Orca continued to service air squadrons and carry out rescue missions until the end of World War II on 15 August 1945. =Honors and awards= Orca earned three battle stars for service in World War II. She also was commended, along with her squadrons, by United States Army General Walter Krueger, U. S. Sixth Army commander, for landing scouts behind Japanese lines, carrying supplies to Philippine guerrilla forces, and evacuating wounded personnel during the Philippines campaign. Post-World War II, 1945-1947 On 26 September 1945, Orca arrived at Okinawa to assist in the occupation of Japan. She was soon detached to proceed to the United States. Orcas next big assignment was furnishing services for Operation Crossroads, the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 1946. Orca then was decommissioned on 31 October 1947 and joined the reserve fleet in San Francisco, California. 1951-1960 Orca was recommissioned on 15 December 1951 and operated out of San Diego through 1952 under the command of Commander A. K. Espenas. On 5 January 1953 she was underway for the Philippines. On 2 August 1954, Orca relieved the destroyer escort at Hong Kong as station ship. By 25 February 1955 she was back in San Diego for leave and upkeep. Orca deployed to the Western Pacific on 11 July 1955 for another tour of duty in which she weathered two severe typhoons. She returned to the United States again on 1 December 1955 and was able to spend her first Christmas in four years at home. Her leave period was extended to 15 January 1956. Following extensive training during the early months of 1956, Orca deployed to the Western Pacific for a seven-month tour on 24 April 1956. During this deployment, she was awarded the Yellow \\"E\\" for excellence in the Air Department for fiscal year 1956. She returned to San Diego on 19 November 1956. Orca made a subsequent Western Pacific cruise beginning 22 August 1956 and continued to provide service to the United States Pacific Fleet until she decommissioned again in March 1960 and went into reserve on the Columbia River in Oregon. Ethiopian Navy service In January 1962, Orca was loaned to Ethiopia under the Military Assistance Program and was commissioned in the Imperial Ethiopian Navy as the training ship Ethiopia (A-01). Sold outright to Ethiopia in March 1976, Ethiopia was the Ethiopian Navy's largest ship from her arrival in 1962 until her scrapping in 1993. In May 1991, at the end of the Eritrean War of Independence, the independence of Eritrea made Ethiopia a landlocked country. With all Ethiopian Navy bases coming under hostile Eritrean control, Ethiopia was among ten Ethiopian Navy ships to escape to Yemen.Janes Fighting Ships, 1992-93, p. 176 Final disposition Never again operational after arriving in Yemen in May 1991, Ethiopia survived as a hulk thereJanes Fighting Ships, 1993-94, p. 185 until she was sold for scrap in 1993.Janes Fighting Ships, 1996-97, p. 192 In 1996, the Ethiopian Navy itself was disestablished.

Tuncay G√ºney (; born 25 August 1972 in Kargƒ± For details, see folder 398 of the indictment's annex.), code name \\"Ipek\\" (silk), is a Turkish citizen of D√∂nmeh Jewish origin who claims to have infiltrated the Turkish Gendarmerie's intelligence organization JITEM, Ergenekon, the Workers' Party, and the G√ºlen movement before being outed. He is subordinate to Mehmet Eym√ºr, who was discharged from the National Intelligence Organization (, Mƒ∞T). The information G√ºney has gleaned on these organizations make him a key figure in the ongoing Ergenekon investigation. His statements form the backbone of the 2455-page Ergenekon indictment, which mentions him 492 times and labels him a suspect at large ().  Background and personal life  G√ºney was born in the village of G√∂let, Kargƒ±, to Ali and Ay≈üe G√ºney; the youngest of three siblings. G√ºney says his family, whose roots can be traced to Egypt, was outcast by his community for being Sabbatean Jews. Less than a year after his birth, they left for the Harmantepe neighborhood of G√ºltepe, ƒ∞stanbul. In his spare time, his mother teaches the Quran to her neighbors' children in G√ºltepe. G√ºney says it was normal for D√∂nmeh crypto- Jews to express their devoutness to Islam, such as by sending their children to seminaries, in order to be accepted. His mother says \\"If my son said we are Jewish, we are Jewish.\\" His father was nominally a technician for the Be≈üikta≈ü School of Applied Fine Arts. According to G√ºney, this job was a cover for his work as a spy for the Mƒ∞T, which used the school as training ground. G√ºney names Mehmet Eym√ºr, the director of its defunct Counter-Terrorism Department, as one of his father's associates. His father started receiving his pension on 7 March 1982, and died on 13 February 1986. His father's funeral was attended by many men in uniforms. One of them was Eym√ºr, who told his mother that they could contact Mƒ∞T for support. Eym√ºr later denied G√ºney's allegations that his father worked for the Mƒ∞T. When G√ºney was twelve, a friend of his family called Mithat Ulusoy took G√ºney to a boarding Islamic seminary () of the S√ºleymancƒ± sect, in Ayazaƒüa. G√ºney says that the founders of the seminary are also Sabbateans. The manager of the Ayazaƒüa student dormitory, Halil Atam, remembers G√ºney as a hard-working and peaceful student. Around the same time, while attending secondary school (), G√ºney met the Welfare Party's mayor of Kaƒüƒ±thane, Arif Calban. Calban remembers G√ºney as a \\"good, bright kid\\". He allegedly dropped out of Pertevniyal high school after the first year (1986), however the headmaster, Aziz Yeniyol, has no record of G√ºney. G√ºney counters that he spent more time attending Tarabya Kemal Atat√ºrk high school of Bedrettin Dalan's ƒ∞stek Foundation. Males in Turkey are mandated to do conscripted military service for the Turkish Armed Forces. G√ºney went to the army in Ardahan on 5 May 1997, but was discharged four months later after receiving an exemption for allegedly being homosexual. G√ºney said he was bored of the army, so he used his connections to get an exemption report from a psychiatrist at Ankara GATA. However, he denies that the report said he was homosexual. Rather, he says he helped many homosexuals obtain exemptions. G√ºney currently lives in Toronto, Canada.  Marriages  On 28 September 1993 he married Nuray G√ºney, whom he had met through a mutual acquaintance in Germany. The couple divorced on 9 December 1994, after his wife complained that he continually asked for money. After returning from the military in 1998, G√ºney married Rabia Ta≈üdemir; the sister of his brother-in-law Adem (through his sister, Keziban). This marriage lasted for two years.  Journalism career  G√ºney's employment records start on 1 May 1988. He has assumed a variety of jobs, mostly in journalism, to cover his actual profession of espionage. At the time he was exfiltrated to the United States, he was receiving a government pension. Since he is too young (29) to have retired, this has been adduced as proof of covert payment from the government. His file from the Social Security Administration () was classified during the investigation. He entered journalism through his maths teacher at Pertevniyal High School, who sent him to Tevfik Yener of Sabah, where he allegedly became an office boy. Three years later he transferred to Milliyet, along with Yener. Newsweek says it was the deputy headmaster, Ali Kuru, who introduced G√ºney to Yener. Yener confirms that Kuru asked him to hire G√ºney, since his father had died. G√ºney disputes the office boy position, claiming that he had the highest salary in the newspaper. Social Security Institution () records show that he received a monthly salary of approximately 65,500 lira in 1988 when he started; twice the minimum wage. By 1991, he was earning 1.1 million lira; five times the minimum wage (which had drastically increased due to inflation). In 1991, he joined a new, conversative television channel called Samanyolu TV, of which he was a founding member. In April 1994 he became the anchorman. It was while preparing a show called G√ºndemdekiler that he met Veli K√º√ß√ºk. With his support, G√ºney found employment at the newspapers Terc√ºman and Ak≈üam, and at the television channel HBB. After being discharged from the army for homosexuality, he worked in the military magazine Yeni Strateji, launched in January 1998. Yeni Strateji is owned by Turgut B√ºy√ºkdaƒü, and edited by √úmit Oƒüuztan, an Ergenekon detainee. He was paid case-by-case by Ak≈üam from 1994 to 1996 to serve as a conduit of information from Veli K√º√ß√ºk. His boss, Behi√ß Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, related an incident in which G√ºney brought the U.S. ambassador, Robert Pearson, to the office after the publication of an article about the U.S. arming of Iraqi Kurds. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß said that G√ºney appeared to have a close relationship with Pearson, despite not knowing \\"a word of English\\". During the Susurluk scandal, G√ºney submitted photos of Abdullah √áatlƒ± dancing with ƒ∞brahim ≈ûahin to Kanal D. Ergenekon defendant √úmit Oƒüuztan alleged that G√ºney testified before the Susurluk commission, and that he knew Tansu √áiller, Mehmet Aƒüar, and Necmettin Erbakan. Before fleeing Turkey, G√ºney worked for six months at Samanyolu, where he presented a political show called Doruktakiler.  Spy career  He was inducted in 1990 (aged 18) by Galip Tuƒücu, the head of the Istanbul station. Initially operating in the Reactionary Activities Department () (i.e., countering religious fundamentalism), G√ºney was transferred to the Iran station in 1992. His assignment was to infiltrate JITEM and Ergenekon. He met Veli K√º√ß√ºk during this assignment, who provided him (and thus Mƒ∞T) with much information about the Susurluk scandal, which K√º√ß√ºk was implicated in. Fraud charges (2001) When G√ºney's journalism career tanked due to his lack of education, he sought other avenues of income. He set up a car registration racket with a financial budget officer () he had met in Kars, called Murat Oƒüuz. G√ºney's brother-in-law and chauffeur, Adem Ta≈üdemir, joined the racket. According to his testimony to the Istanbul First Heavy Penal Court, file number 2002/64, the racket extended to appropriating real estate. G√ºney was apprehended on 2 March 2001 after an individual named Timur B√ºy√ºk√∂lmez filed a complaint to the Fatih Republic Prosecutor's Office on 8 February 2001 stating that he had been cheated by police officers Orhan Sonu√ß‚Äîa.k.a. Tuncay G√ºney‚Äîand Erdal G√ºvent√ºrk‚Äîa.k.a. Adem Ta≈üdemir‚Äîover the purchase of an SUV. The vehicle was originally a gift from a retired police officer named √úmit Bavbek to Veli K√º√ß√ºk in return for his and G√ºney's support in \\"settling\\" a debt with Semih Tufan G√ºlaltay, the convicted killer of human rights activist Akƒ±n Birdal. When K√º√ß√ºk rejected the car, G√ºney took it and eventually put it up for sale on a newspaper. G√ºney took deposits from two people, who reported him to the police upon learning that they had been cheated. In a December 2008 testimony, K√º√ß√ºk said G√ºney gave him the car because G√ºney knew that he was about to retire, and had no car of his own. K√º√ß√ºk confirmed that he rejected the car, and said that the Ergenekon investigation would probably have begun much earlier had he accepted it. In the next hearing, K√º√ß√ºk testified that his acquaintanceship with G√ºney was superficial, and that he had not seen G√ºney since 2000. He was questioned by the ƒ∞stanbul Gayrettepe Public Order Department () on 1 March 2001. A few days later, without conducting any searches, he was transferred to the Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department () led by Adil Serdar Sa√ßan. A search of G√ºney's home four days later by the latter group turned up two guns, fake license plates, 115 fake diplomas, numerous identity cards () of people he had allegedly had sex with‚Äîand the six sacks of evidence on which the Ergenekon indictment is based. After his questioning, he was arrested on 8 March 2001 and taken to Bayrampa≈üa prison. According to his lawyer, G√ºney was released the next day on 3000 Lira bail, paid by G√ºney's sister with the proceeds of the sale of a building in Tarlaba≈üƒ±, Taksim owned by G√ºney. His friend and Ergenekon suspect, √úmit Oƒüuztan, testified that he had stayed briefly at the Taksim apartment; a three-floor property G√ºney had allegedly bought from Matild Manukyan on 29 May 2000. G√ºney was exfiltrated to the United States one day after being released on bail, despite an injunction from travelling, on a ten-year visa he had obtained on 4 February 1999. The newspaper Yeni ≈ûafak says that his departure was encouraged by both Sa√ßan, and K√º√ß√ºk. In November 2008 it was revealed that Sa√ßan had discovered G√ºney's identity as a spy during the interrogation, and that upon learning this, K√º√ß√ºk negotiated his release in order to prevent the police from learning that G√ºney worked for Jƒ∞TEM. At this point, the undersecretary of the Mƒ∞T, ≈ûenkal Atasagun, stepped in and asked the CIA to exfiltrate him to the United States. Mƒ∞T's Istanbul station chief, Kubilay G√ºnay, and his team had G√ºney flown by Turkish Airlines to Manhattan, New York City, where he was put up in the Marmara Manhattan on 301 East 94 Street. One week later he moved to a flat owned by the Mƒ∞T next to the Manhattan post office. G√ºney was indicted on May 16 for falsifying vehicle registration documents. By that time he had been exfiltrated, with the help of Adnan Akfƒ±rat of Perin√ßek's Aydƒ±nlƒ±k magazine. (Retired Mƒ∞T official Mehmet Eym√ºr said that G√ºney had infiltrated Perin√ßek's organization.) In 2004 he obtained political asylum and moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, supposedly with the help of the owner of the hotel he was staying in Manhattan, a Mehmet √ñzbay from Urfa. G√ºney holds that √ñzbay gave his identity card to Abdullah √áatlƒ±, a hitman who died in the Susurluk crash. However, a governmental commission set up to investigate the accident concluded that \\"Mehmet √ñzbay\\" was an alias. The actual owners of the hotel, the Marmara Manhattan,Marmara Manhattan are the G√ºrsel family. G√ºney alleges that he entered Canada on 14 February 2004, and that his application took 1.5 years to process. His legal counsel is from Legal Aid Ontario. G√ºney initially sought asylum for sexual discrimination, stating that his circumstances were \\"exceptional\\"; however, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada concluded that he was an ordinary applicant. Numerous observers have said that G√ºney played the religious persecution and sexual persecution cards in order to bolster his asylum application.  Appearances on 32. G√ºn  Before his outing, G√ºney participated in three teleconference debates on Kanal Ds 32. G√ºn, where participants questioned how, as a journalist unknown in the Turkish press community, he came into possession of six sacks full of evidence. (In the indictment, he is recorded as having obtained them from a disgruntled army officer.) Later in the show, G√ºney pointedly threatened Perin√ßek with retaliation if he continued to print allegations about him in his magazine Aydƒ±nlƒ±k. When asked about allegations of his being a CIA agent, G√ºney said that he did not work for the CIA, but added that it was an ordinary organization anybody was free to work for. In the second show, when pressed, G√ºney said he was protecting K√º√ß√ºk. (During the course of the Ergenekon investigation, it emerged that the Mƒ∞T had requested support from the CIA to procure G√ºney a visa.) During the 28 November episode, G√ºney was asked about his religious identity and Jacob's House Synagogue, his Mƒ∞T affiliation, his trips to Iran, and his pension benefits. G√ºney said that journalists had been unable to verify his status in Canada because he came from an obscure Jewish congregation. Concerning the orphanhood benefits resulting from his father's death in 1986, he vacillated over whether he had been paid until age 18 (adulthood), or 20. According to the chairman of the Social Security Ministry (), Faruk √áelik, G√ºney was compensated from 1 March 1986 to 1 October 1992, when he completed his secondary education. According to his mother, he was paid until age 18.  Outing (2008)  G√ºney's identity was not revealed until the chief prosecutor of the Ergenekon investigation, Zekeriya √ñz, requested his file from the Mƒ∞T during the sixteenth hearing, in November 2008. Mƒ∞T responded on 9 May 2008 with document number 11.010.05.051/14-16015736. √ñz had noticed that G√ºney was referred to as Tuncay G√ºney ƒ∞PEK in a confidential Mƒ∞T report seized from G√ºney during the course of the investigation. The report, numbered 10.251.01.011(IST00736) and dated 7 February 1997, indicates his station and alias. The report writes that police chief Hanefi Avcƒ±'s testimony to the Susurluk commission left G√ºney's undercover superior in JITEM, Veli K√º√ß√ºk, in a bind, and that this was a liability for G√ºney himself. However, G√ºney's alias had already been mentioned in the press (albeit without an explanation of its meaning), and his boss Mehmet Eym√ºr outed him two weeks before the court announcement, in an open letter to the deputy chief of the Workers' Party (the party chief himself being accused of being an Ergenekon ringleader). Eym√ºr had alluded to G√ºney's identity as far back as 2000, referring to him as \\"Tunca\\" in an article deriding G√ºney for profiting from the sale of photographs to the press of people involved in the Susurluk scandal. His boss at the newspaper Ak≈üam, Behi√ß Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, said G√ºney stole pictures from the archives which were used to create a widely circulated composite of prime minister Mesut Yƒ±lmaz and notorious criminal Abdullah √áatlƒ±. In response to the Sabah article purportedly revealing his identity (see below for a dissenting view), the Mƒ∞T immediately issued a press release, albeit an ambiguous one. It stated that G√ºney was not an employee; a \\"registered informant\\" (). Rather, he was a person they found suspicious. It insinuated that he was subordinate to Eym√ºr, whose Counter-Terrorism Department was disbanded in 1997. Sabah posted a follow-up article, asking G√ºney directly if he worked for the Mƒ∞T. G√ºney said it was too early to speak out, and that doing so would violate Mƒ∞T's bylaws. Reading between the lines of the Mƒ∞T press release, intelligence expert Mahir Kaynak and Radikal's Ismet Berkan said that G√ºney should be associated with Eym√ºr, not the Mƒ∞T. Finally, Eym√ºr contradicted the statements on his Web site by saying that he did not know G√ºney. One day later, G√ºney likewise denied knowing Eym√ºr. Indeed, he denied ever having worked for any intelligence agency. Ergenekon defendant √úmit Oƒüuztan testified that he had witnessed Eym√ºr call G√ºney by telephone after learning that G√ºney had befriended an Iranian diplomat called Muhsin Karger Azad. Owing to confusion over G√ºney's status, the Mƒ∞T report was leaked once again, to a different newspaper, this time in full. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper Radikal took it to mean that the Sabah article was disinformation, and that G√ºney was not from the Mƒ∞T, but followed by it. (Response from Ergun Babahan, the former editor of Sabah)  Subjects of espionage   JITEM/Ergenekon  In 1992 the MIT tasked G√ºney with infiltrating Ergenekon and the Gendarmerie's counter-terrorism and intelligence wing, JITEM, and reporting to the MIT bureau in Dolmabah√ße Palace's harem. G√ºney says he met retired colonel Necabettin Ergenekon, who some say is the eponymous person behind the organization, that year through a student at the Military Academy, and that Ergenekon introduced him to Veli K√º√ß√ºk; the founder of JITEM and a member of Ergenekon. Necabettin Ergenekon says he retired in 1982 and does not know G√ºney. In his Ergenekon testimony, K√º√ß√ºk says he met G√ºney through an elder, retired soldier, implicitly confirming G√ºney's assertion. In another article, G√ºney says he met K√º√ß√ºk as a journalist for Samanyolu TV. He approached K√º√ß√ºk as a journalist, who sent him as a member of JITEM to spy on Massoud Barzani, Jalal Talabani and the leader of Hezbullah, H√ºseyin Velioƒülu. K√º√ß√ºk did not know that G√ºney was a double agent for the Mƒ∞T. = Police testimony = G√ºney said his statements, which were instrumental in implicating K√º√ß√ºk, were extracted over nine days of torture (including genital electrocution) and therefore unreliable. However, a more recent article in the same newspaper says that G√ºney was an expert at dealing with questioning, and had established a good enough rapport to request special treatment. The superior of his two interrogators, Adil Serdar Sa√ßan of the Organized Crime Department, also refutes the torture allegations. According to police chief Hakan √únsal Yal√ßƒ±n, G√ºney openly said he was protected by K√º√ß√ºk and that Ergenekon would get him out. One of his interrogators, Ahmet ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu, said that G√ºney was unique among the 24,000 people he had questioned: \\"It was as if he was sent to tell us something. It is not usual for someone to possess so many documents and talk so freely.\\" The interrogators asked him what Ergenekon was, and G√ºney proceed to explain. ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu was amazed by what he had heard and had G√ºney repeat the story in front of some other associates, paying close attention to G√ºney's behavior. Contrary to his expectations, ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu said G√ºney was very relaxed, except when questioned about the G√ºlen movement. G√ºney told ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu that the G√ºlen movement is a unit of Ergenekon. ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu reported his findings to the Istanbul attorney general on 28 October 2008. Once the interrogation tapes were transcribed, a petition was written to request the continuation of the investigation by the Organized Technical Bureau () based on the contents of the tape. This request was submitted to State Security Court (DGM) chief prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin (who announced the Ergenekon case). A furious Engin told ƒ∞htiyaroƒülu that it was out of his jurisdiction, and rejected the request. Later, he changed his mind and had DGM prosecutor Muzaffer Yal√ßƒ±n do some preliminary work. Yal√ßƒ±n decided to reassign the case from Sa√ßan's Organized Crimes Department to the Intelligence Department, then led by Halil √áatƒ±kka≈ü by his deputy Niyazi Palabƒ±yƒ±k. The Intelligence Department closed the case one year later, citing a lack of evidence to substantiate the claims. Sa√ßan stresses that √áatƒ±kka≈ü and Palabƒ±yƒ±k had nothing to do with it and hints at Veli K√º√ß√ºk and a gang loyal to Fethullah G√ºlen inside that department. Istanbul governor Erol √áakƒ±r, who later formed a security company with Veli K√º√ß√ºk, was aware of the investigation and may have led to its closure at K√º√ß√ºk's behest. In January 2004, the Ergenekon documents seized from G√ºney were found in a depot belonging Sa√ßan located in Gazi Osman Pa≈üa, Istanbul. (They are included in the indictment and its annex.) Sa√ßan says he never saw G√ºney in person. His coworker says that Sa√ßan had a habit of making copies of important pieces of evidence for safe keeping. Sa√ßan was probed in September 2008 for covering up the Ergenekon investigation, allegedly because documents seized from Veli K√º√ß√ºk contained unfavorable material about Sa√ßan. Furthermore, G√ºney alleges that Sa√ßan had portions of his interrogation tape scrubbed. What the missing portions of the tape contained is a matter of much speculation. Sa√ßan's statements in defense of Ergenekon detainee Oktay Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m (the person whose grenades in √úmraniye officially launched the investigation) have gone on record.Folder 30 of the indictment's annex. See pages 207,208. Since 2002, Sa√ßan was fired six times and sued 39 times (acquitted on 36, as of August 2008). He was detained on 23 September 2008 on charges of being an Ergenekon member. Not directly related to the claim, but provides Sa√ßan's side of the story. Just before 2009, he was sentenced to five months in prison on charges of concealing the Ergenekon files. Ergenekon defendant Doƒüu Perin√ßek said that the content of G√ºney's testimony in 2001 was irrelevant to his crime (racketeering) and that the whole affair was a ruse by the CIA to entrap himself, his party, and Turkey. G√ºney's testimony is partially included in folders 165 and 442 of the annex. The more complete version in the latter runs 128 pages and also includes a separate 16 page summary. However, Adnan Akfƒ±rat of the Workers' Party alleges that even this version is abridged (i.e., from the scrubbed tape) and that the actual transcript is 170 pages. The court has obtained a copy of the interrogation tapes; four of G√ºney, and one of √úmit Oƒüuztan. The book ‚ÄúBlack Box: Ergenekon's Unknown Name, Tuncay G√ºney‚Äù, contains shocking statements from the mysterious witness. Nuh G√∂n√ºlta≈ü at Bug√ºn wrote about some interesting information from supreme Ergenekon weirdo, Tuncay G√ºney, in a piece titled \\"Where are JITEM's acid death wells?\\" that uses Faruk Arslan‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe Black Box, Tuncay G√ºney‚Äù, as a resource. G√ºney, who first disclosed Ergenekon and has become a legend, has an important nine-year relationship with Veli K√º√ß√ºk, who was the deep pa≈üa of the 1990s.G√ºney claims that thousands of Kurdish citizens, who were killed by JITEM as extrajudicial victims for harboring PKK‚Äôs secrets, were thrown into acid-filled wells, in which their corpses dissolved. Thus their bodies were never found. This was quite original and new information. G√ºney advises looking at the BOTA≈û complex which JITEM had used in the Southeast in the 1990s, to find acid-filled death wells. For years, no one knew where the graves of more than 18,000 citizens were, and most of the victims were of Kurdish origin and were killed by \\"unknown perpetrators\\"; no one had questioned or dared to question the case before. G√ºney claims that there are very few people who know where these acid-filled wells are located in the Southeast, and although Veli K√º√ß√ºk is one of them, he does not reveal this information. However, G√ºney gives a specific address in the book: \\"The places where JITEM and K√º√ß√ºk's group used were these places. For a clear address, when you go towards the Habur border, close by Mardin's old town Cizre, on the left there is a complex that is guarded by soldiers. If you dig there, there will be a lot of bodies. BOTA≈û has enterprises in Diyarbakƒ±r, Batman, Adƒ±yaman and these places should also be checked.\\" As a response to the question as to where they would find the acid, G√ºney replied in a classic way: \\"There are several factories in ƒ∞zmit. Even K√º√ß√ºk's greeting is an order for them. Besides, for drug-trafficking they needed acid. They had become experts in bringing acid.\\" For more on this issue, see 32. G√ºn from November 2008, in which G√ºney reiterates the claim about the acid-filled wells. Note that I've provided the link for the first in a series of fourteen videos of that particular edition of 32. G√ºn. Now it looks like the ≈ûƒ±rnak state prosecutor is going to investigate the claims of the acid-filled wells. The complaint was initially made by the head of the ≈ûƒ±rnak Bar Association, based on the book by Faruk Arslan, mentioned in the Nuh G√∂nulta≈ü piece. Before the state prosecutor's decision to go ahead with the investigation of the acid-filled wells, the ≈ûƒ±rnak Bar Association vowed to move to open the wells at first opportunity as soon as their exact locations were identified. The bar association will now be able to do just that, using Arslan‚Äôs book. In an article from Zaman, ≈ûƒ±rnak Bar Association chief Nu≈üirevan El√ßi says: \\"This situation gave us hope. Turkey must face its past in order to have a bright future. If there are illegal implementations, these must come before the judiciary. The relatives of those murdered by unknown perpetrators don't know whether or not they are dead these last 15-20 years. This situation puts those people in pain. If this event is disclosed, these people will cease hoping. For Turkey's bright future, these kinds of works must be done. Especially within this context I see the Ergenekon investigation as a new era.\\" In the past, the DTP (a Kurdish party in Turkey) had said that unless Ergenekon was investigated east of the Euphrates, there would be little hope for a solution to the Kurdish question in Turkey. Now let's wait and see how much of this is truly investigated and what the results will reveal. Then we'll find out, too, whether Ergenekon's mysterious \\"black box\\" has any credibility.  G√ºlen movement  G√ºney has been in contact with Fethullah G√ºlen, an Islamic preacher. At one point, G√ºney submitted a weekly espionage report on the sect to Yavuz Ata√ß, who then passed it on to Eym√ºr. G√ºney arranged his first meetings with G√ºlen in 1989-1991 at the Fem cram school () in Altunizade, Istanbul. After leaving his post at Milliyet, G√ºney spent his weekends talking to the manager of the Boƒüazi√ßi Kƒ±rklar boys' dormitory in G√ºltepe, which he says is affiliated with the sect. The current manager of the dormitory, √ñmer ≈ûamil Yal√ßƒ±n, says that G√ºney was not a registered student. Through the Caƒüaloƒülu manager of the newspaper Zaman's classifieds section, he found employment at I≈üƒ±k Prod√ºksiyon on 1 March 1994, a production company that works with Samanyolu TV. Zaman and Samanyolu are claimed to be G√ºlen's flagship media organizations. G√ºney also allegedly stole the much-publicized videotaped speeches of G√ºlen in which he advised his devotees to take official positions in Turkish state. G√ºney was fired on 31 October 1994, and G√ºlen subsequently emigrated to the United States, where he remains to this day. Journalist Ay≈üe √ñnal of Nokta, who was introduced to G√ºlen by him while he was producing Doruktakiler, said she was surprised by how well-connected G√ºney seemed despite his being only 22 at the time. G√ºney alleges that the former chief of Samanyolu TV, Mehmet Demircan, tried to get Veli K√º√ß√ºk to join the Gulen movement, and that K√º√ß√ºk and G√ºlen know each other from the National Struggle Unity Committee (). This organization descends from the Association for Struggling with Communism (), which was set up by the Counter-Guerrilla as a civilian front. Demircan was fired after he allegedly planned to oust G√ºlen.  Muhsin Karger Azad  G√ºney met an Iranian diplomat called Muhsin Karger Azad in a gay bar, thinking that espionage agents would not look for him there. Azad was officially the Iran Consulate's political affairs undersecretary, but allegedly also a member the Iranian branch of Operation Gladio, MOD. After the Mƒ∞T learned that the two had made contact, Eym√ºr instructed G√ºney to report back his findings. Azad is suspected of being involved in the assassination of Kemalist intellectual Uƒüur Mumcu. For this, he was expelled to Tehran in 1995. Despite the chronology, Ergenekon suspect √úmit Oƒüuztan testified that he witnessed G√ºney collect intelligence on Azad while he (Oƒüuztan) and G√ºney were working at Turgut B√ºy√ºkdaƒü's Strateji magazine in 1997.  United States and Canada (1999‚Äìpresent)  G√ºney is alleged to have a string of aliases: Tuncay G√ºney, Tuncay ƒ∞pek, Tuncay G√ºney ƒ∞pek, Tuncay Bubey, Tolga ƒ∞pek, Daniel G√ºney, Daniel Levi, Kemal Kosbaƒü, Alparslan Evrenos, and Alpaslan Evrenos. An individual named Alpaslan Evrenosoƒülu was also alleged to be an alias for G√ºney, but the police said such a person actually existed.  New York Institute  While working for Milliyet, G√ºney expressed his interest in converting to Christianity and learning English in the United States to a Protestant priest in Turkey. He took six months of English lessons from the church. He obtained a ten-year visa on 4 February 1999, enabling him to travel to the United States, which he did in June 2001 to avoid being tried for fraud in Istanbul. (He remains convicted in absentia.) His visa is stamped \\"R B1/B2\\" (R=Regular, B1=Business, B2=Visitor), which means he is not eligible to work in the United States. In response to a question from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, the Turkish consul said that ten-year \\"R B1/B2\\" visas are normally issued \\"to people providing solid guarantee of returning to Turkey\\". Erkan √ñnsel of the Workers' Party (whose chairman is one of the main defendants in the Ergenekon case) alleged that G√ºney was issued a ten-year visa in order to set the Ergenekon investigation in motion and save himself by traveling abroad. In New York, G√ºney found an Evangelical priest called Howard Williams, possibly through his Protestant connections in Turkey, according to Newsweek. Williams forwarded G√ºney to an evangelical Turk from Darge√ßit, Mardin by the name of Yakup Can, for support. Can says he taught G√ºney the Old Testament every Thursday‚Äîhis day off work from the gas station‚Äîfrom noon to eight at night. Finally, G√ºney converted to Christianity in 2004. In a later H√ºrriyet article, G√ºney says he never worked in New York. His nominal employer in the United States was the \\"New York Institute\\",New York Institute with post office box addresses in New Jersey and Toronto, Canada; his next destination. According to Can, G√ºney set up the organization as a front for his journalism and \\"research activities\\". Can assented to lending his name as manager of the organization, though he says he did not take part in any of its activities. When G√ºney told Can he had concerns over his safety and immigration status, Can allegedly drove G√ºney to the Canada‚ÄìUS border.  Life School of English  One of G√ºney's employers in Canada was the Life School of English (LSE),Life School of English chaired by Tim Stevens of the New York Institute. The LSE is an evangelical language school for refugees, mainly from Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, subsidized by a state fund for refugees. The school formerly operated from the Calvary Church Calvary Church in Toronto, and moved out in order to avoid its $400 monthly fee. G√ºney said Tim Stevens helped sort out his immigration problems, but the information Stevens gave about G√ºney's residence turned out to be inaccurate, says H√ºrriyet.  Jacob's House  G√ºney claims that he is from a Jewish family that descends from Egypt, and that they practiced their faith in secret (crypto-Judaism). He also claims to be a rabbi \\"Daniel Levi\\" at the Jacob's House (\\"B'nai Yakov\\" in Hebrew) Jewish Community Center. However, journalists investigated his background and raised several concerns: * It is impossible for G√ºney to have completed his rabbinical training since his 2004 arrival in Canada, according to the Turkish Jewish Congregation (). * The Toronto Board of Rabbis has no record of a rabbi by his name. A leading rabbi of the Orthodox community, Moshe Stern, did not recognize his name, and also voiced concerns regarding G√ºney's rabbinical education. * Jacob's House, despite listing his name on its Web site,Our Staff, Jacob's House. has no records of a rabbi by his name. A personnel query revealed that the head rabbi was someone else. * The person who answers the listed phone number says it is a language school (the congregation's address is the same as the \\"New York Institute\\",New York Institute mentioned below). * The communications director of the United Jewish Appeal in Toronto, Howard English, did not recognize him or his synagogue. The education director of the Toronto branch of Jews for Judaism, rabbi Michael Skobac, did not recognize him, and could not reach them by e-mail. * Newsweek reports that G√ºney himself accepts that Jacob's House is not a synagogue, although their Web site says otherwise. It is not registered with the Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto.Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto G√ºney counters that his congregation is autonomous, and that journalists have been asking Jewish leaders from communities who have no authority to comment on his own congregation. Finally, Canadian immigration officials do not question the religious qualifications of visa applicants. Based on these grounds, Milliyet and Newsweek say that Jacob's House is a front organization to enable G√ºney to reside in Canada. The congregation's listed address is a post office box (P.O. Box 63085, Toronto), deceptively prefixed \\"1655 Dufferin Street\\" (an actual location in Toronto Central),Contact Us, Jacob's House apparently matching the Canadian address of his front organization in the United States, the \\"New York Institute\\". This property on 1655 Dufferin Street is a small \\"medical clinic\\" building, \\"immediately available\\" from PAR-Med Property Services Inc. The U.S. address of the NYI is also a post office box. = Daniel Levi = The name G√ºney goes by in Canada is the same as the person who was convicted in absentia with Canadian citizen Mohammed el-Attar (now jailed in Egypt) for being spies for Israel. Like G√ºney, el-Attar said he was a homosexual, religious convert, and that he confessed only after days of torture. el-Attar said that Levi recommended he identify himself as a homosexual and change his religion before applying for asylum in Canada. The other two convicts at large, who have Turkish first names and have not been sighted, are Kemal Kosba and Tuncay Bubay. According to a senior official at Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kosba, Bubay, and Levi are all aliases for Tuncay G√ºney. Egyptian sources allege that the convicts were MOSSAD agents trying to recruit Egyptians into MOSSAD.

It is a specialized form of extrusion that uses a spinneret to form multiple continuous filaments. There are many types of spinning: wet, dry, dry jet-wet, melt, gel, and electrospinning.. Process First, the polymer being spun must be converted into a fluid state. If the polymer is a thermoplastic then it can be simply melted, otherwise it is dissolved in a solvent or chemically treated to form soluble or thermoplastic derivatives. The molten polymer is then forced through the spinneret, then it cools to a rubbery state, and then a solidified state. If a polymer solution is used, then the solvent is removed after being forced through the spinneret. Wet spinning Wet spinning is the oldest of the five processes. This process is used for polymers that need to be dissolved in a solvent to be spun. The spinneret is submerged in a chemical bath that causes the fiber to precipitate, and then solidify, as it emerges. The process gets its name from this \\"wet\\" bath. Acrylic, rayon, aramid, modacrylic, and spandex are produced via this process. A variant of wet spinning is dry jet-wet spinning, where the solution is extruded into air and drawn, and then submerged into a liquid bath. This method is used in Lyocell spinning of dissolved cellulose. Dry spinning A solution consisting of a fiber-forming material and a solvent is extruded through a spinneret. A stream of hot air impinges on the jets of solution emerging from the spinneret, the solvent evaporates, and solid filaments are left behind. Solution blow spinning is a similar technique where polymer solution is sprayed directly onto a target to produce a nonwoven fiber mat. Melt spinning Melt spinning is used for polymers that can be melted. The polymer solidifies by cooling after being extruded from the spinneret. Nylon, olefin, polyester, saran, and sulfar are produced via this process. =Extrusion spinning= Pellets or granules of the solid polymer are fed into an extruder. The pellets are compressed, heated and melted by an extrusion screw, then fed to a spinning pump and into the spinneret. =Direct spinning= The direct spinning process avoids the stage of solid polymer pellets. The polymer melt is produced from the raw materials, and then from the polymer finisher directly pumped to the spinning mill. Direct spinning is mainly applied during production of polyester fibers and filaments and is dedicated to high production capacity (>100 ton/day). Gel spinning Gel spinning, also known as dry-wet spinning, is used to obtain high strength or other special properties in the fibers. The polymer is in a \\"gel\\" state, only partially liquid, which keeps the polymer chains somewhat bound together. These bonds produce strong inter-chain forces in the fiber, which increase its tensile strength. The polymer chains within the fibers also have a large degree of orientation, which increases strength. The fibers are first air dried, then cooled further in a liquid bath. Some high strength polyethylene and aramid fibers are produced via this process. Electrospinning Electrospinning uses an electrical charge to draw very fine (typically on the micro or nano scale) fibres from a liquid - either a polymer solution or a polymer melt. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both electrospraying and conventional solution dry spinningZiabicki, A. Fundamentals of fiber formation, John Wiley and Sons, London, 1976, . of fibers. The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. Melt electrospinning is also practiced; this method ensures that no solvent can be carried over into the final product.Hutmacher DW & Dalton PD (2011) Melt Electrospinning. Chem Asian J, 6, 44-5. : see also the articles on Electrospinning and Melt electrospinning Drawing Finally, the fibers are drawn to increase strength and orientation. This may be done while the polymer is still solidifying or after it has completely cooled.

It dates from the mid-8th century, during the era of the Lombard Kingdom. The poet is unknown. The poem is an encomium, an example of the urban eulogy genre. It celebrates not only the Christian heritage of Milan, but also its pagan Roman history. It is considered to be the earliest surviving medieval description of a city. The poem served as a model for the Carolingian Versus de Verona, a similar encomium to its rival Verona, written around 50 years later. Background and history Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis has been dated at around 738, or 739‚Äì49. The Milan of that date was a bustling city in the Lombard Kingdom in northern Italy, which had regained its stability after the collapse of the Roman Empire. The anonymous poet is likely to have been a clergyman. No contemporary Milanese manuscript copies have survived, and the poem is known from a single 9th-century manuscript from the Chapter Library of Verona, another city in Lombardy. Milan was a popular subject for writers. Ordo Nobilium Urbium, a 4th-century poem by the Roman poet Ausonius, includes a brief section on the city. Later medieval descriptions include the anonymous De situ civitatis Mediolani (780‚Äì1000), and ones written by Bonvesin da la Riva (1288) and Benzo d'Alessandria (around 1316), all of which are in prose. Other 8th-century poems on an urban subject include Alcuin's poem praising the English city of York (780s), and a poem lamenting the destruction of the Italian city of Aquileia, which was possibly written by the city's ruler, Paulinus II (late 8th century). Structure The poem has 72 lines, arranged in 24 stanzas, each of which has three lines. The opening stanzas read: The poem is organised on an alphabetical scheme; the stanzas start with the letters \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and so on, with the penultimate stanza starting with a \\"Z\\". An additional Gloria concludes the poem. Subject Part of Milan's Roman walls, which are described in the poem The poem opens with a brief description of Milan's city walls, towers and gates; its public buildings, including the forum; and its paved streets and water supply. For example, lines 16‚Äì18 praise the city's \\"forum, with very beautiful buildings, and all its roads are solidly paved with blocks; it draws water for its baths through an aqueduct\\".Bryan Ward-Perkins (1984), From Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages: Urban Public Building in Northern and Central Italy, AD 300‚Äì850 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, ), 224. These buildings, however, were in use at the time; the Roman structures mentioned in the Versus de Verona were strictly monuments. The reference to \\"solid paving\\" appears to conflict with archaeological evidence. In describing the city's buildings, the poet pays particular attention to the churches. The bulk of the verses retell the spiritual history of Milan and discuss the characteristics of the Milanese church, including its unique Ambrosian rite. The poem praises the Milanese citizens for their piety and charitable nature, and expounds on their artistic and scientific successes. These virtues, together with their wealth and their close connection with the Lombard kings, are also cited in support of Milan's pre-eminence among the cities of northern Italy. The poet then lists the many saints, martyrs and bishops buried within the city, stating that they are responsible for Milan's prosperity. The poet goes on to praise the Lombardian monarch, Liutprand, who reigned from 712 to 744, as well as the city's bishop, Theodore II, who died in 735. Aside from this mention of Liutprand, the poet does not refer to the state of Lombardy. The poem concludes with a prayer. The subject matter is typical of later medieval Christian urban eulogies. It expresses the unknown author's sense of civic pride. The choice of topics and their organisation follow the classical scheme of a eulogy to a city, originating in Ancient Greece and commonly practised in Ancient Rome. The poet might have followed an 8th-century guide to the form called De laudibus urbium, adapting it to his Christian perspective. He does not seem to have been inspired by Ausonius's earlier poem. Several scholars have suggested that the Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis might be the contribution of Milan, the ecclesiastical capital of Italy, to a literary rivalry with the royal capital, Pavia. Nicholas Everett has pointed out that Milan is described as \\"the queen of towns, mother of the realm ... who bears the eminent title of metropolis. The immense dignity of her power endures, so that all the bishops of ancient Italy [presules Ausoniae] come to her to be instructed according to the dictates of canon law.\\"Nicholas Everett (2003), Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568‚Äì774 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 285. Pavia also had a canon law school. Giovanni Battista Pighi (it), one of the poem's editors, and Gina Fasoli (it) have argued that the poem inflates Milan's contemporary importance by a set of clever overstatements; for example, it was not the \\"urbs regia\\" and had not been the administrative capital since the end of the 4th century. The poem's opening also stresses that Milan's name stretched back into antiquity, while Pavia was then known by two different names, \\"Papia\\" and \\"Ticinum\\". The Verona encomium The poem appears to have been the inspiration for a eulogy to Verona, known variously as the Versus de Verona, Laudes Veronensis or Veronae Rythmica Descriptio, dated to around 796‚Äì800, which follows a very similar plan and contains numerous borrowed phrasings. The Milanese encomium is written in polished Latin and has a more consistent, more regular prosody than the Veronese poem.Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 29-31. It emphasises the characteristics of the city's inhabitants, and omits details of defunct Roman edifices such as the theatre and circus. The English historian J. K. Hyde considers that neither Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis nor the Verona poem was a significant influence on the later evolution of the genre of urban descriptions, many of which were written in prose. Modern critical reception The poem was first edited by the German historian Ernst D√ºmmler in 1881. A modern edition was prepared by G. B. Pighi in 1960. It is discussed in early reviews of medieval descriptions of cities by Margaret Schlauch (1941) and Hyde (1966). Hyde notes the \\"originality\\" of the poem's subject matter and method of treatment but describes its execution as \\"technically competent, but no more than mediocre\\" and \\"cold and wooden\\". Italian academic Paolo Zanna praises the poem's \\"very logical\\" organisation, and writes that the classical eulogy structure has been transformed into a \\"powerful and skilfully composed profession of the Italian civic pride.\\" Diego Zancani, a specialist in Italian literature, writes that the poem displays \\"the consciousness of belonging to a privileged place.\\" See also *List of literary descriptions of cities (before 1550) References External links *Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis: Complete Latin text from Poetae latini medii aevi (1880) Category:Medieval Latin poetry ","title":"Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis"},{"id":"20303520","text":"The Sacramento State Hornets men's basketball team is the basketball team that represents California State University, Sacramento in Sacramento, California.

Ben Blake states in the 1992 reissue liner notes: \\"Here We Go Again! was reportedly the first Kingston Trio album on which Voyle Gilmore utilized what was called 'double-voicing' whenever all three group members sang in unison. This was accomplished by having them record their vocals twice; then Gilmore simply overdubbed one of the tracks. This gave the group a fuller sound. Recorded at Studio B in Los Angeles, Here We Go Again! also benefited from Capitol's Grand Canyon-like echo chamber, which Gilmore used to make the Trio's instruments 'ring' like no other folk group, before or since.\\"  Reception  Sales of Here We Go Again! rose to over 900,000 copies reaching the number one chart position for eight weeks.

The finishing posts had been placed just outside the Lauterbrunnen station. Shortly before Miss Mackinnon appeared, a funeral procession emerged from the station and passed between Miss Mackinnon and the finishing posts. Miss Mackinnon naturally stopped, and her time was taken to the point where she stopped, and from the point where she stopped till she had passed through the finishing posts. She lost, of course, a few seconds for she had to start again on the level instead of being carried through the posts by her impetus. The Austrians put in a protest, alleging that the time that the funeral procession had taken to pass should be added to her time. This struck us as rather odd for the object of a race is surely to prove that you have skied faster than your rivals, and not that you are entitled to a prize as the result of the opportune intervention of a funeral procession. (p. 79) In any case, the Austrian protest was dismissed and Mackinnon was named the winner. Her final time was 10 minutes, 4.4 seconds.Inferno M√ºrren E. A. Sautter, F. St√§ger & K.

He was opposed to the Puritans. Life He was born at Treveilian in the parish of Llanrug, near Carnarvon, in 1589 or 1590, the son of a freeholder in the parish. His mother was a descendant of the house of Penmynydd in Anglesey. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 June 1604. He was sent there by his uncle, but after his aunt took a dislike to him, his means of support were cut off. Through John Williams, Williams obtained employment at Cambridge as a private tutor, and was admitted to Jesus College, where he graduated B.A. in 1605-6 and M.A. in 1609. He was incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 10 July 1610, graduated B.D. at Cambridge in 1616, and proceeded D.D. in 1621. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Rochester and priest by the bishop of Ely, serving as curate at Hanwell in Middlesex. In 1608 he was presented to the rectory of Foxcott in Buckinghamshire by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and afterwards became lecturer at St. Peter's in Cheapside and at St. Paul's Cathedral for five years. On 11 January 1611‚Äì12 he was instituted rector of St Benet Sherehog in London through the influence of his patron, John Williams, and resigned the rectory of Foxcott. He had strong high-church sympathies, which roused the dislike of the puritans, and after the appearance of his first publication, The Resolution of Pilate, they prevailed on John King, bishop of London, to suspend him in 1616. He was also bound over to appear at Newgate to answer the charges brought against him, but was discharged by Thomas Coventry (afterwards Lord Coventry), who estreated the recognisances of his accusers. After his suspension, from which he was eventually released on appeal to the prerogative court, he resigned his living, retired for a short time to Cambridge, and, on his return to London, found friends in the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, and in the chancellor, Sir Thomas Egerton, who presented him to the rectory of Llanllechid in Carnarvonshire. Here he became involved almost immediately in a dispute with his diocesan, Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor, a strong puritan, to whom his ecclesiastical views cannot have been acceptable. Bayly wished him to exchange his living for another, and, on his refusal, presented articles against him ex officio. Williams appealed to the court of arches, and Abbot came to his rescue, reprimanding Bayly, and giving Williams licence to preach through several dioceses in his province. London and Bangor Four years later, however, finding his position intolerable, after a visit to Cambridge he returned to London, and in 1625 became domestic chaplain to Philip Herbert, 1st earl of Montgomery (afterwards 4th Earl of Pembroke), and tutor to his children. In 1626 he was presented to the rectory of Trefdraeth in Anglesey. On 17 July 1628 he was installed prebendary of the eighth stall at Westminster,Carlyl, cites: cf. Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1628-9, p. 193 and on 28 March 1634 he was instituted dean of Bangor. About 1636 he was appointed a royal chaplain. He was on the point of being nominated tutor to Prince Charles and the Duke of Gloucester, but at the last moment William Laud, who disliked him in spite of their theological sympathies, obtained the appointment of Brian Duppa instead. Williams also states that \\"before he was forty years old, he narrowly escaped being elected bishop of St. Asaph,\\" probably on the death of John Hanmer, but on that occasion also saw another preferred to him at the instance of Laud. Ossory In 1641 he was raised to the Irish see of Ossory by a patent dated 11 September. He had resigned his prebend a few months before, but retained his deanery in commendam till his death. On 26 September he was consecrated, but in less than a month he was forced to fly to England by the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1641. He came to Apethorpe in Northamptonshire, where he possessed a house, and where he had settled his wife and children. On the night of his arrival he was arrested by a troop of cavalry, under Captain Flaxon, and carried before the parliamentary commissioners at Northampton. His position was perilous, for he had with him the manuscript of his Vindici√¶ Regum, with the words \\"The Grand Rebellion\\" written largely on the cover. The sheets were actually in the hands of Sir John North, one of the commissioners, but Williams contrived to get it from him before he had looked at the title, and afterwards, by representing himself as a victim of the Irish rebels, he procured a safe-conduct and the restitution of his belongings. He immediately rejoined the king, and attended him, as chaplain, at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. 1642‚Äì1644 Early in 1643 he published his Vindici√¶ Regum, or the Grand Rebellion; that is a Looking-glass for Rebels, whereby they may see, how by Ten Several Degrees they shall ascend to the Heighth [sic] of their Design (Oxford, 4to). This vigorous invective against the parliamentarians attained considerable fame, and was publicly burnt by order of parliament. It immediately drew a reply from John Goodwin, entitled Os Ossorianum, or a Bone for a Bishop to pick, which also appeared in an abridged form, as Os, Ossis, and Oris, within the same year. In the meantime, after spending most of the winter of 1642‚Äì3 at Oxford, Williams retired to Wales to compose a second onslaught on the parliamentarians, The Discovery of Mysteries, or the Plots and Practices of a prevalent Faction in this present Parliament to overthrow the established Religion ... and to subvert the fundamentall Lawes of this famous Kingdome (Oxford, 1643, 4to; 1645, 4to). Falkland, misliking some of its sentiments, desired to suppress it, but he was over-ruled by the king. Its publication earned Williams fresh notoriety and substantial punishment. On 8 March 1643/44, while he was preaching at the university church before the royalist parliament, his house at Apethorpe was plundered by the parliamentary troops, his wife and children driven forth, and his possessions sequestered. His sufferings increased his zeal, and in the following winter appeared Jura Majestatis; the Rights of Kings both in Church and State, granted first by God, secondly, violated by Rebels, and, thirdly, vindicated by the Truth; and the Wickedness of the Faction of this pretended Parliament at Westminster (Oxford, 1644, 4to). In 1643, shortly before his last work was published, he was employed by the king to try to bring over his patron, the Earl of Pembroke. Repairing to London he found the earl in bed, and so incensed him by his exhortations that he was forced to retire hastily in great dread that the earl would deliver him into the hands of parliament. On trying to quit the city he was stopped and brought before the lord mayor, to whom he said that \\"he was a poor pillaged preacher from Ireland, who came to London to see his friends,\\" and now desired to go to some friends in Northampton. By this means he obtained a pass to Northampton and reached Oxford, whence, shortly after, he passed into Wales, and thence to Ireland. During these years he contributed to the royal cause as freely from his purse as with his pen, giving the king the greater part of his private revenue. 1645‚Äì1660 In 1645 he visited England and had an interview with the king, and on his return found himself in Anglesey when it submitted to General Thomas Mytton. After in vain exhorting the royalists to resist, he managed by a succession of adroit stratagems to reach Ireland, and on 1 April 1647 was presented to the rectory of Rathfarnham, near Dublin. He resided in that city until its surrender in the same year, when he was included by name in the benefits of the capitulation. Ormonde sent him a sum of money to relieve his necessities, but on his way to Wales, to live on a small patrimony he possessed there, he was taken prisoner by Captain Beeche, who robbed him of all he had and left him to make his way back to Dublin in a destitute condition. Dr. Loftus furnished him with money to carry him to London, and he appealed to the committee of sequestrations for the benefits of the Dublin capitulation. On learning that he was the author of Vindici√¶ Regum, the committee told him he deserved to have his head cut off, and passed on to the next business without giving him any redress. Armed with a letter from Fairfax, he had better fortune with the committees at Northampton and Anglesey, to which he was driven by poverty to resort on foot. After regaining his small possessions, he lived at his house in Llanllechid in great poverty, preparing his Great Antichrist for press. His old patron, Pembroke, offered him a valuable living in Lancashire if he would submit to parliament; but this he refused, as well as an offer of Henry Cromwell's of ¬£100 a year on the same terms. In 1651, when Charles was marching on Worcester, he preached before the judges at Conway, and manifested such strong royalist tendencies that he saved himself only by flight. Return to Ireland He made various attempts to get his Great Antichrist printed, but could find no one bold enough to venture on it. In 1660, while crossing to Ireland, he heard at Holyhead the news of the Restoration, and the next morning, preaching in Dublin at St. Bride's, was the first in Ireland to pray publicly for the king. He further celebrated the event by the publication of his 'O' ŒëŒΩœÑŒπœáœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ, the Great Antichrist revealed (London, 1660, fol.), in which he triumphantly showed antichrist to be \\"neither pope nor Turk,\\" but the Westminster Assembly, whom he characterised in the title as a \\"collected pack or multitude of hypocritical, heretical, blasphemous, and most scandalous wicked men, that have fulfilled all the prophesies of the Scripture, which have forespoken of the coming of the great Antichrist.\\" On repairing to his diocese he found his palace and cathedral in ruins, and was immediately involved in numerous lawsuits in his endeavours to recover the alienated lands of the see, in which he was generally unsuccessful. In 1664 he published The Persecution and Oppression of John Bale, Bishop of Ossory, and of Griffith Williams, that was called to the same Bishopric (London, 4to), an animated autobiography, to which he appended a description of the distressed condition of the clergy of his diocese. Some statements in the appendix drew down the censure of the upper house of convocation at Dublin, and he was reduced to plead that they had inadvertently slipped in. He spent considerable sums in restoring his cathedral and repairing the damage wrought by the rebels. For some years he held the prebendary of Mayne in his diocese in commendam, exchanging it on 21 Feb 1671-2 for the precentorship, which, however, he resigned on 14 March. Rumours of his death were rife in 1671,Carlyl, cites: Cal State Papers, Dom. 1671, pp. 384, 441 but he died on 29 March 1672, and was buried in his cathedral at Kilkenny. He left property to endow almshouses for eight poor widows to be erected in the churchyard of the cathedral,Carlyl, cites: Addit. MS. 28948, f. 118 and also bequeathed his lands in Llanllechid for the benefit of the poor.Carlyl, cites: Rep. of Charity Comm. xxviii. 475-6, 491 Both his successors had some degree of connection with the Bangor area of Wales. Marriage By his wife Anne he left children. He was not always on good terms with her, and in October 1635 she brought a suit for alimony against him in the court of high commission, but the case terminated in a reconciliation.Carlyl, cites: ib. 1635-6, pp. 83, 86 Works Besides the works already mentioned, Williams was the author of: *The Delights of the Saints, London, 1622, 8vo. *Seven Golden Candlestickes, holding the Seven Greatest Lights of Christian Religion, London, 1627, 4to. *The True Church, shewed to all Men that desire to be Members of the Same, London, 1629, fol. *The Right Way to the Best Religion, London, 1636, fol. *Seven Treatises very necessary to be observed in these very bad Days, to prevent the Seven Last Vials of God's Wrath, that the Seven Angels are to pour down upon the Earth, London, 1661, fol. *The Description and the Practice of the four most admirable Beasts explained in Four Sermons, London, 1663, 4to. *A True Relation of a Law Proceeding, betwixt ...

The AR series uses a die-cast aluminium engine block and aluminium DOHC cylinder head. The engine series shares many of the technologies in the AZ engine, while incorporating new features such as variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts or dual VVT-i, low friction technologies including an offset crankshaft, roller rockers for the valvetrain, a three-stage variable oil pump, reduced-tension piston rings and auxiliary belt drive. An Acoustic Control Induction System switches the length of the intake tract in two stages, based on rpm and throttle angle, thereby ensuring strong torque across a broad engine speed range. New tumble control valves enhances combustion while the engine is cold, and helps to bring the catalytic converters up to working temperature quickly. The Tumble control valves, along with new 12-hole high atomizing long-nozzle fuel injectors, reduce the amount of fuel adhering to the intake ports and therefore maximize fuel economy and reduce harmful emissions. The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase. The AR engine replaces the AZ engine.  1AR-FE  A 2.7 L version of the AR family, first released in the Venza and Highlander in late 2008.

History  60th anniversary  Beginnings (1950s‚Äì1960s)  Korea Aerospace University was established as a national school on June 16, 1952. During the Korean War, under the Charter for Transport School which was granted by the Ministry of Transportation (which is now the Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs) to develop a civil aviation industry. The university primarily started as a two-year course school, solely with three departments: Department of Flight Operation, Department of Aircraft Power, Department of Telecommunication Engineering. Its status had been elevated by 1953. After the War, the campus moved to Seoul in 1962, then to Goyang City, Gyeonggi-do in 1963, where it stands today. The school buildings were constructed, including the Hangar, the Flight Training Center, and the Electronics & Telecommunication Building. Several institutes such as the Central Library, the Maintenance Factory, the Wireless Lab, the Aviation Research Institute, the Training School for Aviation Tech were also opened.  Strengthened (1970s‚Äì1990s)  In 1979, the university was taken over by Jungseok Foundation, established by Hanjin Group, and it transitioned into a private university. Through the modifications on quota and name, the establishment of schools, departments, and graduate schools were finalized. Auxiliary organizations and institutes were reorganized (see \\"Centers and institutes\\"). Furthermore, the Liberal Arts Building, Central Library, the Aviation Control Center, the Mechanical Engineering Building, and the Flight Operation Building were opened in the 1970s; the Student's Hall, the Science Building, the Mechanical Engineering Building, the Electronic Engineering Building were constructed in 1990s.  Development (2000s- )  Following the strengthening period, the university started to focus on ensuring its internal stability. From the early 2000s, structures were added and expanded. The Central Library, the Center for Technical Assistance to Small and Medium- sized Industries, the KAU Aerospace Center/Museum, and the New Administrative Building were built. The Library and the Student's Hall had a level extension. The microsatellite CubeSat was developed and launched for the first time among Korean universities in 2006. Major research results have been observed in the realm of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) since the first autonomous formation flight of UAV and the first flight of solar-powered UAV for 12 consecutive hours in Korea. The university changed its name from Hankuk Aviation University to Korea Aerospace University in 2007. It started to develop its competence by expanding international networks. After obtaining AABI (Aviation Accreditation Board International) qualification, for flight education, aviation management, air traffic management, and air transportation systems in 2007, MOUs (memoranda of understanding) and agreements with well-known organizations were concluded: MOUs with the University of Southern California, Drexel University, Oregon State University; agreement for cooperation with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University; joint development agreement with General Electric.

At about , it is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States. Metro, the regional government for the Oregon part of the Portland metropolitan area, manages the park. A covered shelter, restrooms, a paved walkway, and a canoe launch lie on the north side of the natural area. Although surrounded by port terminals, warehouses, and commercial areas, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including beaver, bald eagles and western painted turtles. An artificial water-control system helps keep the wetlands wet. Other systems collect methane and prevent leaching from a closed landfill near the south edge of the park. Access and amenities The park includes restrooms, interpretive displays, a covered shelter, parking for 40 cars, a bus drop-off, and public art, all near North Marine Drive, which skirts the north edge of the wetland. The parking lot is about west of the Delta Park - Marine Drive West exit from Interstate 5. A paved, wheelchair-accessible path called the Interlakes Trail leads from the parking lot to two wildlife viewing platforms between the lakes. Boaters in non-motorized craft can use the park's canoe- launch to enter the lakes for recreation, wildlife viewing, or fishing for non-native species. Bicyclists and walkers can reach the park via a bicycle path, which runs along North Marine Drive and is part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of greenway trails known as the 40-Mile Loop. Vegetation and wildlife Black cottonwood, Oregon ash, red alder, big leaf maple, willows, and shrubs grow in the park's forests. Some of the ash trees are more than 100 years old. Swamps include willow thickets, red-osier dogwoods, spiraea, and other small shrubs. Sedges, rushes, beggars tick, rice cutgrass, and reed canary grass grow in open meadows. Aquatic plants such as pond lilies, duckweed, and algae flourish in the sloughs and ponds. The wide variety of mammals inhabiting the park include beaver, nutria, river otter, cottontail rabbit, raccoon, muskrat, mule deer, mink, and coyote.Houck, pp. 309-11 The only reptiles found at the lakes are garter snakes and turtles, including more than 200 western painted turtles, listed as a sensitive- critical species by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. This listing means that unless the turtles reverse the downward trend in their population, the species could become listed as threatened or endangered. Amphibians include salamanders and frogs such as the Pacific chorus frog and the non- native bullfrog. Non-native fish introduced to the lakes include largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and carp. Most species of waterbirds and migrant songbirds in the region visit the park. Birds observed in the wetlands include bald eagles, house wrens, yellow warblers, red-eyed vireos, goldfinches, great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, great egrets, and double-crested cormorants, as many as a thousand at a time. Restoration projects Historically, the wetland lay in the floodplain of the Columbia and Willamette rivers, and seasonal floods inundated the area. Development, including dredging, piping, and levees to prevent flooding drastically changed the area's hydrology. In 2003, to help restore historic hydrologic cycles in the wetland, Ducks Unlimited installed a water-control structure at Bybee Lake. Metro uses it to hold as much water as possible in the lake during winter and spring. This improves habitat for waterfowl and young salmon and inhibits reed canary grass, an invasive plant. In June, after the salmon have migrated to the ocean, Metro opens the structure. Until it closes the structure again, water from the Columbia Slough, which is affected by semidiurnal tides and to which Bybee Lake is connected, flows into and out of the lake. South of Bybee Lake the park extends to the former St. Johns Landfill, which served as the region‚Äôs main garbage-disposal site from 1940 to 1991. Although most of the garbage at the site came from households, between 1958 and 1962 some came from a pesticide-manufacturing plant. Metro took over the landfill from the City of Portland in 1990 and by 1996 had completed a $36 million cover system to keep contaminants from leaching into the surrounding soil and water. Another system collects methane gas from beneath the cover and pipes it to a nearby cement company to use as fuel.

The film was banned in China.http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/director- clara-law/monk/ Synopsis Set in 7th Century China, General Shi Yan-sheng (Hsing-Kuo Wu) was tricked into the brutal murder of the crown prince of the Tang dynasty by General Huo Da (Zhang Fengyi), so that he could take the emperor's thrones. General Shi Yan-sheng was forced to fly away but was determined to revenge General Huo Da for his betrayal. However things didn't happen in favor Shi, and all his loved ones including his mother (Lisa Lu) and his girlfriend Princess Hong-e - Scarlet (Joan Chen) were brutally murdered by Huo Da.

While everyone praised the production designs, costumes and cinematography, the writing and characterization was met with lukewarm response. New York Times said that \\"For all its beauty, the film has its lethargic moments, and the tangled political intrigue that drives the story is not easy to follow.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE6D71438F935A25751C1A962958260 Stephen Teo of Senses of Cinema said that: \\"Temptation may be in the title but redemption is the real theme of the picture, and it‚Äôs a measure of Law‚Äôs inability to expound on the process of redemption that the film finally falls apart.\\" Meanwhile, some of the reviews called this film as a masterpiece http://www.sogoodreviews.com/reviews/temptationofamonk.htm and some other found the use of silence as a medium of communication as spellbouding.http://www.brns.com/pages4/drama153.html The first part of the film reminded critics of Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha .

Compiled by experimental filmmaker and notable eccentric Harry Smith as the fourth album of his Anthology of American Folk Music set from 1952, it was never completed by Smith himself. While the CD is out of print, Revenant Records website an LP version has been issued, along with the other three volumes, on the Portland-based Mississippi Records label. Contents The original anthology jump-started the folk music revival of the 1950s. In 1972, Moses Asch, interviewed by Sing Out! magazine, claimed that tapes for two additional volumes of the project had survived, although the documentation necessary to make a meaningful release of the volumes had been lost. Revenant Records worked with the Harry Smith Archive to recreate and release the fourth volume, associated by Smith with the classical element of earth. The extensive liner notes presented in a hardcover book were written by Dick Spottswood and John Fahey. Unlike the first set, Smith did not choose the selections for this set strictly from between \\"1927, when electronic recording made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the Depression halted folk music sales.\\"Smith, Harry. \\"Foreword,\\" liner note essay. Anthology of American Folk Music, 1952 edition, Folkways Records. As a companion to his three two-album volumes from the original Anthology of American Folk Music categorized by Ballads, Social Music, and Songs, Smith chose \\"Labor Songs\\" as this volume's organizing principle. Smith included material released as late as 1940, with a selection of union songs making their first appearances for an Anthology set. Reception Writing for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album \\"It does differ from the first three volumes in its focus on a slightly later period, with all the tracks culled from the years 1928‚Äì1940. Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, Joe Williams, Bukka White, Memphis Minnie, and John Estes are all major blues artists; the Monroe Brothers, the Carter Family, Uncle Dave Macon, and the Blue Sky Boys all giant country/bluegrass pioneers; and the Hackberry Ramblers are one of the pre-eminent Cajun groups. A few of these songs are archetypes that have burned their way into the American collective musical consciousness: John Estes' \\"Milk Cow Blues,\\" the Carter Family's \\"No Depression in Heaven,\\" Joe Williams' \\"Baby Please Don't Go,\\" and the Monroe Brothers' \\"Nine Pound Hammer Is Too Heavy.\\" Other less famous performances are quite intriguing... At 28 songs spread over two CDs, it's a little shorter than might be expected for a box set, though as compensation, it's enclosed in a pretty incredible 96-page liner-note-sized hardcover book with writing by Dick Spottswood and John Fahey.\\" In his The A.V. Club review, Joshua Klein wrote \\"Volume Four (Smith had originally promised six) is stylistically akin to the first three, with some of the artists from the earlier volumes making encore performances. As Spottswood notes, the two-disc set ignores several country developments, as well as the conspicuous invention of the electric guitar in the '30s. Fans can only hope that such key points of musical evolution will be displayed in future volumes, but as it stands, the 28 mostly Depression-era songs on Volume Four run the gamut from labor anthems to fiddle bands to ballads to blues to black gospel. It's another essential, timeless piece of the Americana puzzle, fitting nicely into the incomparable picture Smith painted.\\" Track listing Disc one #\\"Memphis Shakedown\\" ‚Äî Memphis Jug Band ‚Äî 3:04 #\\"Dog and Gun [Old English Ballad]\\" ‚Äî Bradley Kincaid ‚Äî 3:25 #\\"Black Jack David\\" ‚Äî Carter Family ‚Äî 2:41 #\\"Down on the Banks of the Ohio\\" ‚Äî Blue Sky Boys ‚Äî 3:20 #\\"Adieu False Heart\\" ‚Äî Arthur Smith Trio ‚Äî 2:51 #\\"John Henry Was a Little Boy\\" ‚Äî J.E.

The estimated BMR value may be multiplied by a number that corresponds to the individual's activity level; the resulting number is the approximate daily kilocalorie intake to maintain current body weight. The Harris‚ÄìBenedict equation may be used to assist weight loss ‚Äî by reducing kilocalorie intake number below the estimated maintenance intake of the equation.  Step 1 - Calculating the Harris‚ÄìBenedict BMR  The original Harris‚ÄìBenedict equations published in 1918 and 1919.A Biometric Study of Basal Metabolism in Man. J. Arthur Harris and Francis G.

The Harris‚ÄìBenedict equations revised by Mifflin and St Jeor in 1990: {  border=\\"1\\" -  Men  BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm) - (5 √ó age in years) + 5 -  Women  BMR = (10 √ó weight in kg) + (6.25 √ó height in cm) - (5 √ó age in years) - 161 }  Step 2 - Determine Total Energy Expenditure  While the original paper does not attempt to translate BMR into total energy expenditure (TEE), a BMR result may be multiplied by a factor that approximates an individual's physical activity level (PAL) to estimate their TEE. The following table enables approximation of an individual's daily TEE based on some example lifestyles. {  border=1 - ! Lifestyle !! Example !! PAL !! Calculation -  Sedentary or light activity  Office worker getting little or no exercise  1.53  BMR x 1.53 -  Active or moderately active  Construction worker or person running one hour daily  1.76  BMR x 1.76 -  Vigorously active  Agricultural worker (non mechanized) or person swimming two hours daily  2.25  BMR x 2.25 } History The Harris‚ÄìBenedict equation sprang from a study by James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict, which was published in 1919 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the monograph A Biometric Study Of Basal Metabolism In Man. A 1984 revision improved its accuracy. Mifflin et al. published an equation more predictive for modern lifestyles in 1990. Later work produced BMR estimators that accounted for lean body mass. Issues in dietary use As the BMR equations do not attempt to take into account body composition, identical results can be calculated for a very muscular person, and a very fat person, who are both the same height, weight, age and gender. As muscle and fat require differing amounts of calories to maintain, the TEE estimates will not be accurate for such cases. The paper behind the latest update (Mifflin et al) to the BMR formula states all participants in their study fall within the 'normal' and 'overweight' body mass index (BMI) categories, and so the results also do not necessarily apply to those in the 'underweight' or 'obese' BMI categories.

Development In January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in Neubrandenburg and Greifswald. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of R√ºgen with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union. Description The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer, at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the Wissower Klinken outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of erosion. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.Uta Baier: Am Ende bleibt nur die Kunst - Die Wissower Klinken und Caspar David Friedrich, article in Die Welt of 26 February 2005 A later variation on the theme; watercolor, 1824, 25 √ó 32 cm Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself.Helmut B√∂rsch-Supan: Caspar David Friedrich. 4. erweiterte und √ºberarbeitete Auflage, Prestel, Munich 1987, , p 118 His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him‚Äîthe abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men. On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline) sits beside an almost dried- up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures‚Äîwhether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear. The colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian theological virtues: faith, hope and love. The art historian Helmut B√∂rsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: \\"clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood\\".\\"deutlich [...] wie kaum zuvor, zugleich aber auch in einer selten heiteren Stimmung\\" Notes References * B√∂rsch- Supan, H.

Ministry of Home Affairs et. al. Leslie Luin Melnik, an American citizen, married Suman Panta, a Nepalese citizen, in December 2015 in California. Melnik then applied for a \\"Non-Tourist Visa\\" (\\"NT Visa\\") with the Department of Immigration (DOIM) in December 2016 as a dependent of a Nepalese citizen. The DOIM denied Melnik's application on the ground that Nepali law does not recognize same-sex marriage. The couple filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court requiring the DOIM to issue an NT Visa to Melnik. The court issued its judgement on 23 October 2017, ruling that under Rule 8(1)(h) of the Immigration Rules (), a foreign national who submits a valid marriage certificate with a Nepali citizen is eligible to obtain an \\"NT Visa\\" as a dependent. The Supreme Court further ruled that the Immigration Rules do not specify that a foreign national applying for an NT Visa must either be of the same or opposite gender. It also ruled that Panta, as a member of a \\"gender and sexual minority\\", is entitled to the fundamental right to live a life with dignity without discrimination under the Constitution of Nepal. Foreign same- sex spouses of Nepali citizens are now eligible to obtain an NT Visa as a dependent. 2015 Constitution Several sources reported that same-sex marriage and protections for sexual minorities would be included in the new Nepalese Constitution being drafted.Nepal charter to grant gay rights Nepal 'to stage gay weddings on Everest' The Interim Constitution provided for a Constituent Assembly, which was charged with writing a permanent constitution. Under the terms of the Interim Constitution, the new Constitution was to be promulgated by November 30, 2011,Nepali interim Constitution to be amended for extension of CA term but a final six month extension was granted just before this deadline bringing the date to May 31, 2012. Negotiations failed and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai dissolved the Constituent Assembly on May 28, 2012 in preparations for the 2013 elections. As a result, the future of same-sex marriage was uncertain. The elections were held on 19 November 2013.Nepal voting ends for new Constituent Assembly The vote was repeatedly delayed, having previously been planned for 22 November 2012 following the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly on 27 May 2012, but it was put off by the election commission. On 10 February 2014, Sushil Koirala was elected as prime minister with a large majority, breaking the political deadlock and opening the way for the Constitution to be finalised.Nepal Picks New Premier, Putting End to Stalemate The new Constitution of Nepal, approved in 2015, does not address the issue of same-sex marriage. Nonetheless, article 18 lists \\"gender and sexual minorities\\" among recognized and protected disadvantaged groups. Legislation In January 2014, Chaitanya Mishra, a member of the committee formed to study international laws on same-sex marriage and prepare a report on the matter, stated that the work on the report had been completed, except for a summary to be drafted by the chairman of the committee. The chairman, Laxmi Raj Pathak, promised to submit the report to the Nepali Government within a month, but said that the Cabinet was not interested in the matter. Bhumika Shrestha of the Blue Diamond Society, a Nepalese gay rights group, has not ruled out the possibility of another lawsuit with the Supreme Court.Report on same-sex marriage In August 2014, the Associated Press reported that the committee had decided to recommend the legalization of same-sex marriage.Nepal‚Äôs LGBT community parades for same-sex marriage The same month, Narahari Acharya, the country's Minister of Law, Justice, Constituent Assembly and Parliamentary Affairs, stated that his ministry would present a bill to allow such marriages.Nepal to legalise homosexuality and same-sex marriages, says law minister The committee submitted its report to the Government on 9 February 2015.Nepal panel recommends legalising same sex marriageNepal committee calls for legalising same-sex marriage In January 2016, a government official stated that the recommendations of the committee were under consultation.Once hailed, now failed?

In August 2018, former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai urged it to legalise same-sex marriage. The new Nepali Civil Code, which came into effect in August 2018, does not address same-sex marriage and specifically defines marriage as being between an opposite-sex couple. Activists have called out the Civil Code as unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court guidelines, though the previous Government had affirmed the year before that it intended to legalise same-sex marriage in a separate law. On 1 July 2020, the National Human Rights Commission called on the government to legalize same-sex marriage. Case of one marriage In July 2017, a couple (one partner identifies as third gender) successfully registered their marriage in the far-western Dadeldhura District.

EBICAB was originally derived from Ericsson's SLR system in Sweden. Most trains in Sweden and Norway use a similar on-board system, Ansaldo L10000 (more known as ATC-2) from Bombardier's competitor Ansaldo STS (now Hitachi Rail STS). ATC-2 was also developed in Sweden.Teknogram Twenty Years of Safe Train Control in Sweden EBICAB balise in the Mediterranean Corridor These on-board systems use pairs of balises mounted on the sleepers. The pairs of balises distinguish signals in one direction from the other direction with semicontinuous speed supervision, using a wayside to train punctual transmission using wayside transponders.Jernbaneverket / INFRASTRUKTURENS EGENSKAPER, 2001-02-05  Versions  EBICAB comes in two versions, EBICAB 700 in Sweden, Norway, Portugal and Bulgaria and EBICAB 900 installed in the spanish Mediterranean Corridor (vmax= 220 km/h), and in Finland () under the name ATP-VR/RHK. In Portugal it is known as Convel (the contraction of Controlo de Velocidade, meaning Speed Control). The EBICAB 900 system uses wayside transponders (also called balises) with signal encoders or series communications with electronic lookup table, and on-board equipment on the train. The transmission of data occurs between the passive wayside transponders (between 2 and 4 per signal) and the antenna installed under the train, which powers the transponders when it passes over the transponder. The coupling between the transponder and the on-board antenna is inductive. In comparison with ASFA, a system which transmits only a maximum amount of data per frequency, EBICAB uses electronic lookup table, the amount of data transmitted is much larger. Adif/Renfe, in Spain, sometimes use the term ATP to refer to EBICAB 900, which is the first system on its network to provide Automatic Train Protection.  Main Characteristics  * Transponders operating in the ISM band at 27 MHz amplitude modulated for the clock pulses and impulse frequency of 50 kHz. * Transmission of data to trains at 4,5 MHz at 50 kbit/s with 32 bit packets encoding 12 bits of information (EBICAB 700) or 255 bit packets encoding 180 bits of information (EBICAB 900), including the necessary synchronisation bits. * The signals are linked (concatenated), but the signs, for example, for warnings and speed, are not necessarily linked (concatenated); it is acceptable to have 50% of the transponders linked to be safe against failures. * The driver may input characteristics such as train identification, length, speed type, maximum speed, braking characteristics, and train pressure. * The driver receives visual indications such as speed limit, target speed, overspeed, ASFA Alarm, braking reset, Permission to Pass, alarm signals, braking warning, red or alphanumeric indications.  Supervision  * Line velocity, as a function of line capacity and the vehicle's performance capabilities in situations of overspeed or the imposition of lower velocity for some types of trains. * Multiple objectives, including signaling information without wayside signals. * The system can enforce permanent, temporary and emergency speed restrictions by using unlinked (concatenated) transponders. * Stop Point. * Dynamic braking profile. * Status of the level crossing and landslide detectors. * Maneuvers. * Protection against wheel wear. * Slip/Slide compensation. * Authorization to pass a signal at Stop.  Warnings  * Acoustic warning at excess of 5 km/h, service braking at excess of 10 km/h and emergency brake application at excess of 15 km/h * The operator may release service braking when the speed is below one of the speed limits (Normally below the speed limit + 10 km/h in Portugal).  EBICAB 700  The most important difference with EBICAB 900, is that EBICAB 700 can only transmit packets with 12 useful bits for a total of 32bits and allows up to 5 transponders per signal.

Construction, commissioning, and shakedown Rehoboth was laid down on 3 August 1942 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 8 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. R. P. McConnell, and commissioned on 23 February 1944, with Commander Robert Crawford Warrack, Jr., in command. World War II service Rehoboth was originally operated as a Barnegat-class seaplane tender. Following shakedown off San Diego, California, Rehoboth transited the Panama Canal on 25 April 1944 and reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 May 1944. On 17 May 1944 she sailed for Casablanca carrying men and cargo of Blimp Squadron 14. Returning to Norfolk on 9 June 1944, she carried cargo and personnel for Fleet Air Wing 7 in the United Kingdom from 8 July 1944 to 9 August 1944, then sailed south to Recife, Brazil, reporting to Commander, Fleet Air Wing 16, for duty on 31 August 1944. She transported passengers and cargo between various Brazilian ports until 15 January 1945, when she departed Natal, Brazil, for Bristol, England, carrying personnel and cargo for Commander, Fleet Air Wing 7. On 14 February 1945 she returned to Norfolk, whence, until mid-June 1945, she carried men and equipment to Bristol and Avonmouth in England. Peacetime service 1945-1947 Rehoboth retransited the Panama Canal on 18 August 1945, and after calls at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she arrived off Okinawa on 2 October 1945. There for two weeks she tended planes of Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 6 (VH-6), then steamed to Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea, where she took command of a seadrome and tended planes of Patrol Bombing Squadron 20 (VPB-20). In mid-November 1945 she crossed the Yellow Sea, and from 18 November 1945 to 21 December 1945 she tended a detachment of VH-6. On 25 December 1945 she arrived at Shanghai, China, to tend Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 1 (VH-1) and Patrol Bombing Squadron 25 (VPB-25) seaplanes. On 25 January 1946, Rehoboth got underway for Nagoya, Japan, thence proceeded to Kobe, Japan, on 17 February 1946, where she set up an auxiliary seadrome area. On 24 March 1946 she arrived at Sasebo, Japan, where she assumed seadrome control. Rehoboth continued to serve in Japanese waters until August 1946 when she returned briefly to the Chinese coast, then operated off Australia and in the Philippines. In November 1946 she returned to Japan, whence she sailed east in 1947. Arriving at San Diego on 18 March 1947, she continued on, transited the Panama Canal at the end of March 1947, and reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 April 1947. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1947. Oceanographic survey operations 1948-1970 Rehoboth commenced conversion to an oceanographic survey ship in 1948. She recommissioned on 2 September 1948, and commenced oceanographic survey work under the direction of the Navy Hydrographic Office, predecessor of the Naval Oceanographic Office, being redesignated AGS-50 in August 1949. Equipped with a small laboratory and machinery to take Nansen casts, which provide the oceanographer with the temperature and samples of sea water at different depths, and to drill for core samples, she traveled over in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas during her first six years of operation. Rehoboth (AGS-50) as an oceanographic survey ship in the 1960s.In February 1952, while crossing the Atlantic, Rehoboth discovered and accurately positioned an underwater mountain range with heights up to above the ocean floor. In March 1952 she discovered and charted a undersea mountain near Bermuda and in August 1953 she became the first ship to anchor in over This metric conversion assumes the use of statute miles rather than nautical miles for depth; if nautical miles are used for depth, the conversion is 4,630 meters of water. Employed on special projects in 1953 and 1954, she returned to oceanographic survey work in the Atlantic and Caribbean in 1955. Transferred to the Pacific in 1956, Rehoboth departed Philadelphia on 15 February 1956. Transiting the Panama Canal on 22 February 1956, she was diverted to an area northwest of the Galapagos Islands to search for the raft Cantuta, which she found after four days. On 9 March 1956 Rehoboth reached San Francisco, California, and for the next year operated off the United States West Coast. On 4 March 1957 she proceeded to Pearl Harbor for three months of work in Hawaiian waters. For the next nine months she operated in the eastern Pacific. In April 1958 she extended her range to the Marshall Islands and in 1960 to the Western Pacific. In October 1960 she also added operations off the coast of South America. For the next four years her missions spanned the Pacific from equatorial to arctic climes. In September 1965 Rehoboth completed operations in the northern Pacific and in November 1965 commenced survey operations in the South China Sea, conducting in December 1965 a hydrographic survey of the coast of South Vietnam from the Mekong Delta to Cape Padaran. After completing survey operations in the South China Sea in February 1966, Rehoboth sailed east, arriving at San Francisco on 23 March 1966. Overhaul and United States West Coast operations followed. In 1967 she conducted operations in the northern and western Pacific. In California waters from December 1967 until 14 March 1968, she then departed San Francisco for Yokosuka, Japan. She undertook survey operations in the Philippine Sea until August 1968, returning to San Francisco on 26 September 1968, where she remained for the balance of the year. She operated off the California coast in early 1969 until deploying to the Far East in August 1969, returning in December 1969 to San Francisco.  Final decommissioning and disposal  Rehoboth again was decommissioned and was struck from the Navy List on 15 April 1970. She was sold for scrapping in September 1970.

As a nominal sentence does not have a verbal predicate, it may contain a nominal predicate, an adjectival predicate, in Semitic languages also an adverbial predicate or even a prepositional predicate. In Egyptian-Coptic, however, as in the majority of African languages, sentences with adverbial or prepositional predicate show a distinctly different structure.. The relation of nominal sentences to verbal sentences is a question of tense marking. In most languages with nominal sentences such as Russian, Arabic and Hebrew, the copular verb does not surface in indicatival present tense sentences. Conversely, these languages allow the copular verb in non-present sentences.  History  Historically, nominal sentences have posited much controversy regarding their identity as an existent linguistic phenomenon. Ancient grammatical tradition did not uncover such sentences, or if they did, they were only found as an exception to the language structure. This was the view taken by the Western grammatical tradition, which began with an analysis of Ancient Greek followed by an analysis of Latin. However, this Western/European approach to nominal sentences was not how the Arab grammarians of the early Middle Ages approached it. Arab grammarians did not feel as bound by the classical grammatical categories as did the European counterparts of that historical period. Rather, they viewed a sentence as having two basic categories: 1. a verbal sentence that begins with a verb, and 2. a nominal sentence that begins with a noun and may or may not have a verb within it. Moving forward in the historical time period, Orientalists later borrowed the nominal sentence terminology from the early Arab grammarians, however modified it slightly to be defined solely with respect to the absence of the verbal predicate, rather than with respect to the first word of the sentence (the noun) that may or may not have a verb in it, as the Arab grammarians defined it. This slight shift in the definition of nominal sentences corresponds partly to both the Western and the Arabic grammar tradition. The Orientalists' definition agrees with the Western grammar's focus of the predicate orientation, and it supports how the Arab grammarians included a sentence category of nominal sentences (nonverbal sentences). Since this new definition of nominal sentences corresponded more accurately to the notion of non-verbal sentences, compared to the Arab definition of it 'may or may not contain a verb', the Orientalists' definition included predicate types other than verbs (nouns, adjectives, etc.).  Syntactic structure and analyses  Different phrase structure trees of Arabic \\"I happy\\" according to zero copula analysis To successfully account for the syntactic structure of a nominal sentence, there must either be a change in the phrase structure rules or a zero copula must be assumed. This is because nominal sentences cannot be accounted for using traditional phrase structure rules, which state: TP ‚Üí {NP/ CP} (T) (VP). In other words, a tense phrase must consist of a noun phrase or complementizer phrase, an optional tense head, and a verb phrase. Less technically, this means each sentence must have a noun and verb component. Because there is no overt verb in a nominal sentence, this creates a challenge for the theory. Taking an Arabic sentence like (), literally \\"I happy\\", which is fully grammatical in the language, we see that there is a pronoun, and an adjective, . The first satisfies the sentence requirement of having a noun, but the latter being an adjective, our verb requirement remains unfulfilled. In order to allow this construction, we would have to revise our theory to state *TP ‚Üí NP {VP/AP} (the * indicates that this is actually an ungrammatical construction), meaning you could have a sentence which breaks down to either a verb phrase or an adjective phrase (see the above figure). However, phrase structure rules are supposed to be universal, therefore this new rule would also allow us to generate \\"I happy\\" in English. Since this is not a grammatical, this is an issue that requires attention. Another problem is that each phrase must consist of a head which bears its name. Therefore, in a verb phrase, the head is always a verb. Again, nominal sentences like do not have a verb, so the verb head position in the verb phrase cannot be filled. Having a zero copula is one way to solve the problems listed above without compromising the existing syntactic theory. The verb is present, just covertly as \\"null\\". English and Arabic trees of \\"I am happy\\" Using X-bar theory, it is possible to both account for the grammaticality of constructions such as \\"I happy\\" as well as explain how the subject DP is derived. In X-bar theory, there are no obligatory lexical categories that make up a sentence; instead, there are only general X-bar rules: the specifier rule, adjunct rule, and complement rule. Therefore, the theory accurately permits the AP \\"happy\\" as grammatical even without a verb since AP can be a complement to the T head (see aside). Additionally, under the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject \\"I\\" will be generated in the specifier of VP and, using the DP movement, it will move to the specifier position of TP. Consequently, the resulting surface structure of the nominal sentence \\"I happy\\" is properly generated under this analysis.  In English  Nominal sentences in English are relatively uncommon, but may be found in non-finite embedded clauses such as the one in \\"I consider John intelligent\\", where to be is omitted from John to be intelligent. They can also be found in newspaper headlines, such as \\"Jones Winner\\" where the intended meaning is with the copular verb, \\"Jones is the Winner\\". Other examples are proverbs (\\"More haste, less speed\\"); requests (\\"Scalpel!\\"); and statements of existence (\\"Fire in the hole!\\"), which are often warnings. The omission of the verb 'to be' can also provide basis for nominal sentences: for example, in the sentence \\"the higher I am, the hungrier I feel\\", the verb 'to be' can be omitted to form a nominal sentence thus: \\"The higher, the hungrier\\". A sentence such as \\"What a great day today!\\" is, for example, considered nominal since there are no verbs.  In Arabic   Present tense  A verbless sentence in Arabic ( ) does not consist of a subject but rather a topic followed by a predicate. They are only possible in present tense sentences. Below are examples of verbless sentences with NP, AdjP or PP predicates. ;NP predicate {  -  Arabic -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the man a teacher\\" -  English translation the man is a teacher } ;AdjP predicate {  -  Arabic -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the man sick\\" -  English translation the man is sick } ;PP predicate {  -  Arabic -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the man in the school\\" -  English translation the man is in the school } All the examples above are perfectly grammatical in Arabic since they all refer to the present tense and therefore do not require verbs.  Past tense  As stated above, verbless sentences occur only in the present tense thus, a formal nominal sentence in Arabic can never express something in the past tense. That is, the past feature has to always be indicated morphologically to convey accurate information of (+past), unlike the present which can be referred to as tenseless. The following is an example of a past tense sentence in formal or written Arabic: {  -  Arabic ŸÉÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ¨ŸÑ ŸÖÿ±Ÿäÿ∂Ÿãÿß -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"was the man sick\\" -  English translation the man was sick } Demonstrated by the sentence above is the idea that tense is a guiding factor to the use of nominal sentences in Arabic. A sentence in the past always requires the (+past) verb. Negation Nominal sentences can be negated in different ways depending on tense and whether or not they are embedded. The following is an example of a negative nominal sentence in the present tense, using the formal Arabic negative particle : {  -  Arabic -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the boy not tall\\" -  English translation the boy is not tall } The negative particle () by itself has the meaning of a present tense and it is used to negate a general existence; so it means something along the lines of \\"there does not exist\\" or \\"there is not\\". Thus, it can only negate a tenseless sentence where an overt copula is not necessary. In order to negate a nominal sentence in the past, however, the copular verb must be included. The following is an example of a negative past sentence using the negative particle : {  -  Arabic -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the boy not(+past) is tall\\" -  English translation the boy was not tall } It is important to note that the negative particle () is a tense marker of (+past). Therefore, it negates a lexically present tense to refer to the past, making past negative sentences similar to the affirmative past tense sentences in that a past feature must be marked.  In other languages   Hungarian  For some languages, nominal sentences are restricted to third person only. Hungarian is an example of such a language. In Hungarian, the copular verb simply expresses something that exists, such as something, someone, a place, or even time, weather, a material, an origin, a cause or purpose. In third person proposition sentences (both singular and plural), there are no copular verbs required and instead, the copular is null. {  -  Hungarian -  Literal translation \\"the house high\\" -  English translation the house is high } Russian In Russian, there are no restrictions on verbless propositional sentences as they can occur with all persons and all numbers (i.e., singular or plural). However, despite such restrictions and variability seen in both Arabic and Hungarian above, there are no structural differences between the languages. Instead, these differences are derived by whether or not there must be a relation with the verbal constructions and the copular verb. {  -  Russian -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"you teacher\\" -  English translation you are a teacher } {  -  Russian -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"house small\\" -  English translation the house is small } {  -  Russian -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"father works\\" -  English translation the father is working } Hebrew In Hebrew, sentences may or may not include verbs since verbs are optional and not at all obligatory. Also, the order of words is quite flexible such that for the sentences that do include verbs, the verb can appear either before or after the nominal predicate, adjectival predicate or prepositional predicate; the nominal predicate can appear either before or after the adjectival predicate, prepositional predicate; and so on, all of which are possible combinations that still mean the same thing. Although for the sentences that lack verbs, only two combinations are possible: either the nominal predicate appears before or after the adjectival/prepositional predicate. And like in Arabic, the copular verb is simply implied, in fact, there are no present tense forms of the verb \\"to be\\" in any stage of Hebrew, ancient or modern. {  -  Hebrew -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"I here\\" -  English translation I am here } {  -  Hebrew -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the horse beautiful\\" -  English translation the horse is beautiful } Ancient Indo-European languages In ancient Indo-European languages, verb inflections and context both play a significant role in determining the structure of the sentence as well as their translations to other languages. Verb inflections are used to indicate person (first, second or third), number (singular, dual or plural), tense, voice, and mood. Also, personal endings, which are suffixes that attach to verbs, are specifically used to express person and number and consist of nine different forms: alternating combinations between the three persons and three numbers. Context determines whether the simple present and present progressive (for example, \\"I eat\\" vs. \\"I am eating\\") indicates the present or future tense. This is a common phenomenon found in English as well, since the sentence \\"I am eating in the cafeteria\\" can either mean \\"I am eating in the cafeteria [right now]\\" or \\"I am eating in the cafeteria [next Tuesday]\\". Additionally, the present tense can be used to talk about either the present or the past and which one it implies is determined by context. For instance, \\"We went to the mall [yesterday]. James buys a new bike\\", where without the context (yesterday) the action of buying would take place in the present but in this very sentence, it occurs in the past. Thus for the examples below, the omitted copular verb only acts and implies a connection between the subject and predicate. Due to the missing verbal inflections, only the suffixes that are attached to the nominal predicates can be used to determine such things as number and possession. As to what time the sentences are describing, it depends entirely on the context of when the sentences are being used and/ or the preceding and following sentences. ;Ancient Greek {  -  Ancient Greek -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"and to me pain\\" -  English translation and to me there is pain } ;Latin {  -  Latin -  Literal translation \\"one salvation for the conquered\\" -  English translation only one salvation remains for the conquered } ;Old Persian {  -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"my father Vi≈°tƒÅspa\\" -  English translation my father is Vi≈°tƒÅspa } ;Tocharian A {  -  Transliteration -  Literal translation \\"the strong the protection of the creatures\\" -  English translation the strong are the protection of the creatures } See also * Phrase * Predicate (grammar) * Zero copula References Sources * * * Further reading * Category:Sentences by type ","title":"Nominal sentence"},{"id":"20304522","text":"Zhou Qifeng (; born October 1947) is a Chinese chemist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This map sends vertices to vertices and edges to nontrivial edge-paths with the property that for every edge e of the graph and for every positive integer n the path fn(e) is immersed, that is fn(e) is locally injective on e. Train-track maps are a key tool in analyzing the dynamics of automorphisms of finitely generated free groups and in the study of the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space. History Train track maps for free group automorphisms were introduced in a 1992 paper of Bestvina and Handel.Mladen Bestvina, and Michael Handel, Train tracks and automorphisms of free groups. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 135 (1992), no. 1, pp. 1-51 The notion was motivated by Thurston's train tracks on surfaces, but the free group case is substantially different and more complicated. In their 1992 paper Bestvina and Handel proved that every irreducible automorphism of Fn has a train-track representative. In the same paper they introduced the notion of a relative train track and applied train track methods to solve the Scott conjecture which says that for every automorphism Œ± of a finitely generated free group Fn the fixed subgroup of Œ± is free of rank at most n. In a subsequent paperMladen Bestvina and Michael Handel. Train-tracks for surface homeomorphisms. Topology, vol. 34 (1995), no. 1, pp. 109-140. Bestvina and Handel applied the train track techniques to obtain an effective proof of Thurston's classification of homeomorphisms of compact surfaces (with or without boundary) which says that every such homeomorphism is, up to isotopy, either reducible, of finite order or pseudo-anosov. Since then train tracks became a standard tool in the study of algebraic, geometric and dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups and of subgroups of Out(Fn). Train tracks are particularly useful since they allow to understand long-term growth (in terms of length) and cancellation behavior for large iterates of an automorphism of Fn applied to a particular conjugacy class in Fn. This information is especially helpful when studying the dynamics of the action of elements of Out(Fn) on the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space and its boundary and when studying Fn actions of on real trees.M.

Formal definition Combinatorial map For a finite graph Œì (which is thought of here as a 1-dimensional cell complex) a combinatorial map is a continuous map :f : Œì -> Œì such that: * The map f takes vertices to vertices. * For every edge e of Œì its image f(e) is a nontrivial edge-path e1...em in Œì where m ‚â• 1\\\\. Moreover, e can be subdivided into m intervals such that the interior of the i-th interval is mapped by f homeomorphically onto the interior of the edge ei for i = 1,...,m. Train track map Let Œì be a finite connected graph. A combinatorial map f : Œì ‚Üí Œì is called a train track map if for every edge e of Œì and every integer n ‚â• 1 the edge-path fn(e) contains no backtracks, that is, it contains no subpaths of the form hh‚àí1 where h is an edge of Œì. In other words, the restriction of fn to e is locally injective (or an immersion) for every edge e and every n ‚â• 1\\\\. When applied to the case n = 1, this definition implies, in particular, that the path f(e) has no backtracks. Topological representative Let Fk be a free group of finite rank k ‚â• 2\\\\. Fix a free basis A of Fk and an identification of Fk with the fundamental group of the rose Rk which is a wedge of k circles corresponding to the basis elements of A. Let œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) be an outer automorphism of Fk. A topological representative of œÜ is a triple (œÑ, Œì, f) where: *Œì is a finite connected graph with the first betti number k (so that the fundamental group of Œì is free of rank k). * œÑ : Rk ‚Üí Œì is a homotopy equivalence (which, in this case, means that œÑ is a continuous map which induces an isomorphism at the level of fundamental groups). * f : Œì ‚Üí Œì is a combinatorial map which is also a homotopy equivalence. * If œÉ : Œì ‚Üí Rk is a homotopy inverse of œÑ then the composition : œÉfœÑ : Rk -> Rk :induces an automorphism of Fk = œÄ1(Rk) whose outer automorphism class is equal to œÜ. The map œÑ in the above definition is called a marking and is typically suppressed when topological representatives are discussed. Thus, by abuse of notation, one often says that in the above situation f : Œì ‚Üí Œì is a topological representative of œÜ. Train track representative Let œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) be an outer automorphism of Fk. A train track map which is a topological representative of œÜ is called a train track representative of œÜ. Legal and illegal turns Let f : Œì ‚Üí Œì be a combinatorial map. A turn is an unordered pair e, h of oriented edges of Œì (not necessarily distinct) having a common initial vertex. A turn e, h is degenerate if e = h and nondegenerate otherwise. A turn e, h is illegal if for some n ‚â• 1 the paths fn(e) and fn(h) have a nontrivial common initial segment (that is, they start with the same edge). A turn is legal if it not illegal. An edge-path e1,..., em is said to contain turns ei‚àí1, ei+1 for i = 1,...,m‚àí1\\\\. A combinatorial map f : Œì ‚Üí Œì is a train-track map if and only if for every edge e of Œì the path f(e) contains no illegal turns. Derivative map Let f : Œì ‚Üí Œì be a combinatorial map and let E be the set of oriented edges of Œì. Then f determines its derivative map Df : E ‚Üí E where for every edge e Df(e) is the initial edge of the path f(e). The map Df naturally extends to the map Df : T ‚Üí T where T is the set of all turns in Œì. For a turn t given by an edge-pair e, h, its image Df(t) is the turn Df(e), Df(h). A turn t is legal if and only if for every n ‚â• 1 the turn (Df)n(t) is nondegenerate. Since the set T of turns is finite, this fact allows one to algorithmically determine if a given turn is legal or not and hence to algorithmically decide, given f, whether or not f is a train-track map. Examples Let œÜ be the automorphism of F(a,b) given by œÜ(a) = b, œÜ(b) = ab. Let Œì be the wedge of two loop-edges Ea and Eb corresponding to the free basis elements a and b, wedged at the vertex v. Let f : Œì ‚Üí Œì be the map which fixes v and sends the edge Ea to Eb and that sends the edge Eb to the edge-path EaEb. Then f is a train track representative of œÜ. Main result for irreducible automorphisms Irreducible automorphisms An outer automorphism œÜ of Fk is said to be reducible if there exists a free product decomposition :F_k=H_1\\\\ast\\\\dots H_m\\\\ast U where all Hi are nontrivial, where m ‚â• 1 and where œÜ permutes the conjugacy classes of H1,...,Hm in Fk. An outer automorphism œÜ of Fk is said to be irreducible if it is not reducible. It is known that œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) be irreducible if and only if for every topological representative f : Œì ‚Üí Œì of œÜ, where Œì is finite, connected and without degree-one vertices, any proper f-invariant subgraph of Œì is a forest. Bestvina-Handel theorem for irreducible automorphisms The following result was obtained by Bestvina and Handel in their 1992 paper where train track maps were originally introduced: Let œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) be irreducible. Then there exists a train track representative of œÜ. =Sketch of the proof= For a topological representative f:Œì‚ÜíŒì of an automorphism œÜ of Fk the transition matrix M(f) is an rxr matrix (where r is the number of topological edges of Œì) where the entry mij is the number of times the path f(ej) passes through the edge ei (in either direction). If œÜ is irreducible, the transition matrix M(f) is irreducible in the sense of the Perron-Frobenius theorem and it has a unique Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue Œª(f) ‚â• 1 which is equal to the spectral radius of M(f). One then defines a number of different moves on topological representatives of œÜ that are all seen to either decrease or preserve the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of the transition matrix. These moves include: subdividing an edge; valence-one homotopy (getting rid of a degree-one vertex); valence-two homotopy (getting rid of a degree-two vertex); collapsing an invariant forest; and folding. Of these moves the valence-one homotopy always reduced the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. Starting with some topological representative f of an irreducible automorphism œÜ one then algorithmically constructs a sequence of topological representatives :f = f1, f2, f3,... of œÜ where fn is obtained from fn‚àí1 by several moves, specifically chosen. In this sequence, if fn is not a train track map, then the moves producing fn+1 from fn necessarily involve a sequence of folds followed by a valence-one homotopy, so that the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of fn+1 is strictly smaller than that of fn. The process is arranged in such a way that Perron-Frobenius eigenvalues of the maps fn take values in a discrete substet of \\\\mathbb R. This guarantees that the process terminates in a finite number of steps and the last term fN of the sequence is a train track representative of œÜ. =Applications to growth= A consequence (requiring additional arguments) of the above theorem is the following: *If œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) is irreducible then the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue Œª(f) does not depend on the choice of a train track representative f of œÜ but is uniquely determined by œÜ itself and is denoted by Œª(œÜ). The number Œª(œÜ) is called the growth rate of œÜ. *If œÜ ‚àà Out(Fk) is irreducible and of infinite order then Œª(œÜ) > 1\\\\. Moreover, in this case for every free basis X of Fk and for most nontrivial values of w ‚àà Fk there exists C ‚â• 1 such that for all n ‚â• 1 :\\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\lambda^n(\\\\phi) \\\\le \\\\phi^n(w)_X\\\\le C \\\\lambda^n(\\\\phi), :where uX is the cyclically reduced length of an element u of Fk with respect to X. The only exceptions occur when Fk corresponds to the fundamental group of a compact surface with boundary S, and œÜ corresponds to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of S, and w corresponds to a path going around a component of the boundary of S.

D. 1300 (Cambridge University Press), pp. 85‚Äì86. is an anonymous late ninth-century Latin lyric poem encouraging the guards who stood watch on the walls of Modena. The poem contains later interpolations (lines 11-16, 25-26, 30-34), but its musical notation has survived. Peter Godman called it \\"hauntingly beautiful\\".Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 71-72 (analysis), 324-327 (poem, with translation). Francesco Novati proposed that the song was written by a cleric in his cell as he listened to the chant of the guardsmen echo on the walls. This Romantic interpretation has been superseded.Neil Christie (2006), From Constantine to Charlemagne: An Archaeology of Italy, AD 300-800 (Ashgate Publishing, ), 163. At about the same time as the lyric was composed the walls of Modena were augmented for defence against the Magyars, and prayers pleading deliverance from their raids are preserved in the same manuscript as the watchmen's song. The song falls into the tradition of liturgical vigils (known to have been kept at Modena during this time) and the secular vigiliae murorum (vigils of the walls). It was probably composed for use at Mass sending off the guards for duty. The poet invokes the blessing of Christ, the Virgin, and John, who had lately seen a chapel consecrated in their honour on 26 July 881, a date which helps place the poem in time.Godman and Roncaglia date it to the late ninth century with later interpolations. Brittain puts it between 892 and 900. According to J. J. Savage (1927), \\"The Song of the Soldiers of Modena,\\" Speculum, 2:4, 475-76, Edelestand du M√©ril and Domenico Comparetti place its composition between about 924 and 934. The chapel of Santa Maria e San Giovanni was beside a city gate, and it was probably there that the guards assembled before their watch and joined the clergy in singing the song. The poet cites two stories from classical history to encourage the guards: the Trojan War, and how the city was safe while Hector kept watch; and the Sacred Geese (derived from Virgil and Servius), who defended the Rome from the Gauls.The tradition of the Sacred Geese becomes that of the Sacred Goose in the watch-song, due to the influence of Servius, cf.

Lines 17-18 of the song--Pro qua virtute facta est argentea / Et a Romanis adorata ut deaGodman's translation: For this virtuous deed [saving Rome] its [the goose's] image was made in silver / and was adored as a goddess by the Romans.--seem to be the poet's invention, based on his reading of Servius, or Isidore of Seville, who copied Servius.Savage, 477. Scholarly opinion has varied as to the origin of this story, of the goose's deification and idolisation. Hans Ferdinand Massmann believed it was a Germanic concoction based on the moving figures of a clock in the Capitol. Arturo Graf believed it was a four- or fifth-century transformation of the idea of the Capitol as the seat of the empire. Comparetti believed it was a Byzantine legend.

He previously served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016. Biography Rouson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the son of W. Ervin and Vivian. His father was a guidance counselor at Gibbs Junior College and an administrator at St. Petersburg Junior College. He was also vice president of student affairs Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth, Florida. He died in 1979. His mother taught French and English at Sixteenth Street Junior High and Lakewood Senior High. She was a pioneer of integration in Pinellas County. She lived for a time in Minnesota where her leadership extended to many arenas: she was the first African American elected to the School Board for the Burnsville-Egan School District (in the Twin Cities metro), she co-founded the Dakota County Society of Black Women, and she served as interim director at Normandale Community College's women's center. She retired to Washington, D.C. Rouson came to St. Petersburg at age three and lived in Cromwell Heights.Nealy, Jounice. \\"A man of many battles.\\" St. Petersburg Times. July 30, 2000. Online. November 22, 2008. He attended a Bishop Barry High School which later became St. Petersburg Catholic High School. He returned to New Orleans to attend college at Xavier University and graduated in 1977. He received his law degree from the University of Florida Spessard Holland Law Center in 1979. In 1980, he returned to St. Petersburg with a job at Gulfcoast Legal Services. Shortly afterward, he opened his own practice. He developed an addiction to cocaine that grew at the expense of his practice, his standing in the community, and his marriage. In 1987, he sold his practice and his home on Pinellas Point. He divorced his wife and left St. Petersburg. After some time, he met Reverend George Clements in Chicago. Reverend Clements was the founder of One Church- One Child, an adoption program. Rouson became the recovery revival coordinator for One Church-One Addict, a program that taught churches how to help recovering addicts. Rouson married a second time in 1991. His second wife developed breast cancer and died in 1997. He then returned to St. Petersburg in 1998. Shortly after arriving in St. Petersburg Rouson experienced a brief period of homelessness. He went on to become active as a leader in the community. He became chairman of the St. Petersburg Area Black Chamber of Commerce, and he served on St. Petersburg's Charter Review Commission. He supported a substance abuse ministry at Mount Zion Progressive Missionary Baptist Church. He became the president of St. Petersburg branch of the NAACP in 2000. Rouson has said that this experience has helped him to understand the plight of the homeless and to endorse making homelessness a hate crime in Florida. Miami Herald, April 21, 2010: \\"Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, said he used to be homeless about a decade ago and slept on the floor of an office building. 'I understand homelessness,' he said. 'I understand what it means to wash off in a public bathroom. This bill seeks to protect our weakest.'\\" On August 16, 2017 Rouson was named Legislator of the year by the Florida Alliance for Assistive Services and Technology. Activism and law practice Rouson's activism in the community and his law practice often involve his passions for civil rights and against drug addiction. In January 2000, Rouson was appointed to the St. Petersburg Charter Review Commission. The Council decided at the same session to award a $50,000 grant to the St. Petersburg Area Black Chamber of Commerce. The chamber had experienced financial difficulties since it was established in 1999. Ryan, Kelly. \\"TV call-in show to return in March.\\" page 6B. The St. Petersburg Times. January 21, 2000. Online. November 18, 2008. Rouson also became the president of the Chamber later in the month. His predecessor had co-mingled personal funds with that of the Chamber's in order to maintain solvency, and Rouson sought to establish the financial integrity of the Chamber. He saw the Chamber as the NAACP's economic arm and as a partner with the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce. He set the chamber's goals at bringing more minority-owned businesses to St. Petersburg and attracting the convention of a national company.

St. Petersburg Times. Online. November 18, 2008. In the late 1990s, several Tampa Bay Area malls, including Tyrone Square mall, developed dress codes to deter what they saw as gang activity.

In July 2000, Tyrone mall's policy generated controversy after the son of a minister at Bethel Community Baptist Church was ejected. The boy's father felt the mall's actions were discriminatory, whereas the mall said it was simply providing for the safety of its patrons.Mall ejects minister's teen son for wearing his cap sideways Rouson went to the mall in an effort to \\"test the policy.\\" He too was asked to leave.Helderman, Rosalind. \\"Lawyer tests mall policy on clothing, gets warning.\\" page 3B.

He did say that the NAACP should work more closely with the Uhurus and other civic organizations on such matters as economic development. Omali Yeshitela, the group's leader, also denied that Rouson was a member. He did welcome what he perceived as needed change in the NAACP.Gilmer, Bryan. \\"NAACP chief faces challenge from board.\\" page 1B.St. Petersburg Times. November 21, 2000. Online. November 24, 2008.

St. Petersburg Times. Online. November 24, 2008. That same month, he represented a neighborhood association that was suing a motel on a nuisance complaint. The Fossil Park Neighborhood Association accused the owners of the motel of allowing it to be used as a crack house and providing a place for prostitutes to bring their clients. Complaints to the motel owners and to the police had been unavailing. Rouson said he saw the suit as an opportunity to continue his fight against drug abuse in the area.Meacham, Andrew. \\"Irritated by motel, Fossil Park files suit Series: NEIGHBORHOOD NOTEBOOK.\\" St. Petersburg Times. November 26, 2000. Online. November 24, 2008. The suit was settled two years later, with both sides bound by a gag order under the terms of the settlement.

September 15, 2002. Online. November 24, 2008. By early 2003, the NAACP under Rouson's leadership achieved a number of milestones in meeting its goals. Pinellas County created a program to help small businesses owned by minorities. The first African American was appointed to the St. Petersburg Times board of directors. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office appointed its first black captain. The school board hired more African American subcontractors for the construction of Gibbs High School. His achievements were tempered by some adversity. He declared bankruptcy to erase debts incurred before his return to St. Petersburg.Franklin, Marcus. \\"NAACP president's wins come at a cost.\\" page 1B. St. Petersburg Times. Online. November 24, 2008. He received a reprimand from the state bar in early 2001. During a criminal trial, he had surreptitiously gone through a report on the opposing counsel's table in the courtroom. He readily admitted he had made a mistake and apologized. Prosecutors said that he could have had access to the material merely by asking.LeVesgue, William R. \\"Florida Bar disciplines bay area attorneys.\\" January 3, 2001. Online. November 24, 2008. In October 2003, Rouson condemned the message sent by the Monopoly parody Ghettopoly and joined the president of the Hillsborough NAACP in demanding that the Urban Outfitters in Ybor City remove the game from its shelves. Although the game's creator claimed it was intended to be satirical, Rouson declared, \\"There's nothing humorous or light about death and destruction that drugs and drug dealing cause in our neighborhoods that one should profit in parody.\\"Franklin, Marcus. \\"Game's street theme upsets NAACP.\\" St. Petersburg Times. October 4, 2003. Online. November 21, 2008. In January 2004, Rouson said he would not seek re- election as president of the St. Petersburg NAACP, citing the time the unpaid position took from his law practice and family. He also challenged the community to build on the progress made in civil rights in the private sector and in government. By November, however, no one had stepped forward to replace him and he agreed to stay.Franklin, Marcus. \\"Call for leadership comes up empty\\". page 1B. St. Petersburg Times. November 8, 2004. Online. December 1, 2008. In July 2005, he announced that he would be replaced by his assistant, vice-president Trenia Byrd-Cox. He had earlier advocated for the secession of Midtown from St. Petersburg in an effort to emphasize shortcomings in the status of African Americans in Pinellas County. However, he had backed away from the idea after recognizing its divisiveness.Franklin, Marcus. 'Interim NAACP leader named.\\" page 3B. St. Petersburg Times. July 20, 2005 Online. December 2, 2008. In April 2005, while president of the St. Petersburg NAACP, Rouson stood trial on a charge of misdemeanor trespassing. In June 2004, he had entered into a conflict with the manager of a St. Petersburg tobacconist's shop, the Purple Haze. He claims to have strongly objected to the selling of what he condemned as drug paraphernalia, glass smoking pipes. Although ostensibly sold for use with tobacco, Rouson claimed it was common knowledge they were commonly used to smoke such illicit drugs as marijuana and cocaine, and decried the \\"legal lie and deception\\" that allows them to be sold. In court, the manager of the shop said anyone who talks about illegal drugs is asked to leave, and that Rouson had refused to do so. Rouson claimed that he tried to leave, but his way was blocked by two pit bulls. At trial, Rouson claimed he had gone to the store as an act of protest against the sale of what he called \\"death utensils\\". One of his witnesses was a Catholic priest who testified about his training in nonviolent civil disobedience. He was found guilty, but the judge withheld adjudication.Franklin, Marcus. \\"Jury finds NAACP leader guilty.\\" St. Petersburg Times. April 28, 2005. Online. November 21, 2008. Politics In September 2005, Rouson joined the Republican Party. Though registered with no party affiliation, he had been long regarded as a closet Republican, and had been courted by such Republican leaders as then- Attorney General Charlie Crist, whom he supported for governor.\\"Rouson takes the Republican plunge.\\" page 3B.

However, while on the Commission, he voted to place two amendments on the ballot that would allow religion based schools to receive taxpayer support.Kinane, Se√°n. McKenzie accuses Rouson of receiving aid from pro-voucher group. WMNF 88.5 FM. McKenzie again opposed Rouson in the regular primary. He criticized Rouson's support of a proposed amendment to the State Constitution which he said would hurt public education. Rouson said he wanted to reduce taxes and felt the proposed amendment should go to referendum to let the voters decide. McKenzie claimed he looked forward to improving teachers salaries, making changes in FCAT and reworking Florida's system for delivering health care to children. Rouson emphasized the need for reducing property taxes, the need to create more affordable housing and the need to bring more jobs to the district.

One of the oldest buildings in Copenhagen, it was part of the largest medieval hospital in Denmark which King Christian I turned into an Augustinian priory 1497.  History  Hospital The Hospital of the Holy Ghost was founded in 1296 near Grayfriars monastery by the Bishop of Roskilde, , under the name 'Copenhagen's Hospital'. Bishop Krag was member of the powerful Krag-Hvide noble family. For its support a ground rent was assessed all properties in Copenhagen which had not already paid the tax. The hospital's purpose was to gather up the poor and sick and feed and care for them. After the imposition of the original ground rent, the hospital sent out 'petitioners' to solicit alms for the upkeep and operation of the hospital. As was the case with St. Clare's Hospital, the Hospital of the Holy Ghost was operated by a quasi- religious brotherhood which lived a religious life and cared for the residents. Local priests were assigned to see to the spiritual welfare of the people who lived and worked at the hospital. The 'rule' of the brotherhood most closely resembled that of the Knights of St. John. In time the name was changed to Holy Ghost House (Danish: Hellig√•ndshus). Common people came to refer to it as 'Holy Ghost's', (Danish: Helliggestes) the pronunciation coming from the countless German merchants who frequented the city. Over the centuries families donated properties to the hospital for its maintenance. By the 15th century it had income from several such properties. Sometime before 1449 the hospital had its own church and bath house. In 1472 King Christian I took the hospital, and all its properties, contents, and its brothers and sisters under his protection, most likely because it could no longer support itself. The king invited contributions from throughout Denmark for the assistance to the poor and sick of Holy Ghost House. Abbey In 1474 Christian I went on pilgrimage to Rome and stopped at the Augustinian Holy Ghost Hospital at Saxia de Urba, Italy. It apparently showed him the advantages of having an established religious order, the Order of the Holy Ghost, to organize and operate a hospital. Pope Sixtus IV issued a bull declaring on Christian's behalf that there was in all of Denmark only one Augustine hospital and in the capital where gathered princes, nobles, and knights there was no place to house or care for abandoned and bastard children and the poor. Therefore will the king permit the improvement and re-foundation of a hospital where the Augustinian Order would prevail. The space available for the hospital had long been considered to be too small to accommodate the needs of the poor. The hospital had lost its church to a fire and the time had come for a major expansion with the complete support of Christian I In just two years the hospital had more than doubled the space available by tearing down several houses adjacent to the old hospital property. Christian I gave not a penny to the expansion, but used his influence to get others to contribute to his new favorite cause. No information about the rebuilding of the church is known, but it was completed before 1479 when a donation was made by Bernt Hakenberg to the St. Anne 's Chapel in it. Queen Dorothea made the single largest contribution on condition that '12 poor sick persons be cared for at all times', going into great detail for the specific care and feeding until each recovered or went the way of all earth. She specifically names her husband's reorganized hospital a monastery. By 1498 the hospital was in financial difficulties due to the costs of expansion. The Augustine monks who operated it petitioned the pope in 1497 for permission to sell indulgences, which was granted until 1515 when the permission was rescinded except during Easter and then only in places where papal indulgences were not available. Christian I had also been expanding the Augustinian-run hospital in Malm√∂, then part of Denmark. In 1517 the pope decided that the two hospitals should share one prior. Hans I and Queen Christina were generous in their gifts to both hospitals. Christian II added an unusual income source by decreeing that shipwreck goods on the √òresund which lay unclaimed were to be sold and the funds sent to the hospital.  Reformation  In 1527 the city fathers read a publication by Povl Helgesen which decried the conditions at the hospitals and outlined the view that the hospital should be broken up so that the poor were not mixed in with those who had contagious diseases. The sick should be divided into those who had non-contagious diseases and those who has contagious diseases. His views were accepted by those charged with administration of the hospital. A new hospital was planned along those lines. The plans came to naught because of the fall of the Catholic Church in the 1530s. Even before Denmark became officially Lutheran, the city fathers petitioned the king to separate the hospital form the monaster;, in so many words asking that the Augustinian monks be expelled from their combined hospital-priory. They went further to propose that the hospital be given the properties and incomes that had belonged to St Gertrude's Hospital and St J√∏rgen's Leper Hospital be turned over to Holy Ghost House. A governor was to be appointed by the city fathers. In 1530 the Augustines were sent packing and the hospital became a city institution. Holy Ghost Church became a parish church. Holy Ghost Church was built around the old Hospital Church and contains what is left of the old priory church. The tower of the church has views of Copenhagen.  Later history  Once the furor of the Count's Feud ended and Christian III came to the throne, there was no money to pay for the new hospital. In 1607 Vartov Hospital was begun and over the next several years Holy Ghost Hospital's buildings and properties were sold or torn down to make room for newer structures. In 1607 Vartov Hospital took over the leper hospital at St J√∏rgens G√•rd. Holy Ghost Church was rebuilt into one the city's most beautiful churches around the existing hospital church.

The brown Arctic has highly variable colorings, which tend toward light yellow to orange brown wings that help camouflage it against its mountainous rocky habitat. The larvae feed on local grasses and take two years to develop. This longer development period results in flights of adult brown Arctics only once every two years. The butterflies feed on nectar from various plants as their primary food source. The males exhibit lek territoriality by defending desired territories from other males by challenging them to sparring flights for access to females. The females exhibit hilltopping behavior for finding mates, flying from meadows to higher elevated ridges where they are more likely to find males. Climate change, as well as human activity, has been threatening the habitats of this species. Range and habitat The range of the brown Arctic has been found to spread across the far northwest of North America, including West Alberta, South British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Alaska, and California. Typically, the brown Arctic butterfly seems to prefer mountainous sparsely vegetated environments that are characterized by short summers. They are often found in prairies and steppes, but may drift to mountaintops and the edges of forests. It has been conjectured that they prefer habitats with places fit for perching, like fallen trees, or areas that shelter from harsh winds, such as gulches. They have been observed to be less attracted to sites with more than 50% to 60% plant cover. Males are more likely to be found on elevated ridge tops, usually favoring the highest sites of the ridges, whereas females tend to stay in meadows. Description adult The upperside of the brown Arctic butterfly‚Äôs wings is typically cream to orange brown, with the edges and bases of the wings a darker brown. The underside of the hindwings shows coarse striation of dark brown and light grey, with a broad dark poorly defined median band and veins of light grey. The upperside of the forewing displays two to four black eyespots near the outer margin, while the upperside of the hindwing has zero to two. These are repeated on the underside of the wings. The wingspan can range from 39 to 54 mm. Male adults can be distinguished from females by their dark discal patch on the forewing. Females are also observed to have rounder wings than males, while males have more pointed forewings. Life cycle Egg The adult female brown Arctics typically lay their eggs on dead twigs and leaves on the ground. Their egg-laying sites are fairly ubiquitous as they are not very discriminating. They have also been known to lay their eggs on grasses and sedges, or on the lower branches of Ponderosa Pine with sedges growing below. They typically lay between 30 and 100 eggs, which hatch in about 15 days. Brown Arctic eggs are generally white and barrel-shaped, and ornamented with 19 vertical ribs. Caterpillar The brown Arctic has five larval instars, beginning with the pinkish brown first instar displaying darker magenta longitudinal lines and paired thin pink protrusions on its posterior. The larvae becomes darker as it matures, and the final larval instar has a bifurcated head and ranges in color from pink to light brown, with a black dorsal and dorsolateral stripe, short paired protrusions on its posterior, and small erratic setae over its entire body and head. The larvae feed on grasses, including Festuca idahoensis in Washington, Carex in Colorado, and Danthonia spicata, Oryzopsis pungens, and Phalaris arundinacea in eastern Canada. They remain in the larval stage for about two years, hibernating as the first or second larval instar during the first winter, and as the third, fourth, or fifth instar during the second winter. Pupae Larvae generally pupate in duff or soil, or adhered to twigs, bark, or vegetation. The pupae of this species are dark yellow brown with heavy black coloring on the head and wing cases, and light brown with small black spots on the thorax and abdomen. Adult adult The adult brown Arctics feed on mud and nectar from a variety of flowers, including pearly everlasting, paintbrush, showy phlox, geranium, and puccoon. Due to the timeline of two years for the development of the brown Arctic eggs, the flight of the species is biennial in many regions. Flights in two subsequent years represent two temporally separated populations of adult butterflies. For example, in Vancouver, flights during the even and odd numbered years are two different generations of butterflies. Mating  Courtship  A female brown Arctic flies up to higher ridges and mountains, in a phenomenon known as hilltopping, for mating. This mating mechanism occurs because males can be found at a frequency about 15 to 30 times higher on ridges than in meadows, so females can reduce their energy output and exposure to predation while searching for mates. Because the ridges provide no other benefit such as food, shelter, avoidance of predators, or thermoregulation, males inhabit these areas specifically for mating, as the elevations are easily located by females. The highly contested territories also do not include areas for oviposition, food, or other resources to offer the female. Thus, the female similarly comes to these territories for only mating, with no other visible benefit from the male. \\"Drifters\\", or males who were unable to acquire a territory, enjoy fewer copulations than those who have territories. The darker patch on the dorsal forewing that males of this species possess are scent scales that emit pheremones used in courtship. Males that encounter a female chase her into an upward spiral, and, upon distinguishing the sex of its partner, turns the approach into a courtship flight for the female rather than the sparring it would do for a male. The male spirals around the female more closely than he would during a male-male spiral, while the female does little spiralling. The virgin female may alert the males of her receptiveness to mating by performing a solicitation, or a Lolita flight. If the female lands on the ground, the male attempts to mate. Females are likely to return to the more protected sites like meadows upon mating for oviposition. Virgin females are scarce in this species, as most females mate only once in their lifetime. Lekking/Territoriality The territoriality of male brown Arctic butterflies resembles lekking behavior, in which the majority of the desired territories are highly condensed in specific areas. The males congregate in these specific areas and defend their desired territories from other males. The occupancy of the territories is highly consistent, with males defending their territories successfully for as many as 11 consecutive days. Males are highly territorial, giving chase to anything in the air near their perch site, including non-competitors like moths, birds, falling leaves, and even pebbles tossed near them. Due to the lack of specificity, the chase is most likely due to a fixed action pattern to pursue upon movement via an innate releasing mechanism. It is then switched to ‚Äúsparring‚Äù by intruder males, ‚Äúcourtship‚Äù by females, and ‚Äúbreak off‚Äù by non-conspecifics. Butterflies of a different species are distinguished by wing beat frequency. Male size is generally not correlated with the acquisition of the best territories in this species. But rather, the size of spots on the wings has been shown to be a greater factor in gaining these territories. Female brown arctics are not observed to be territorial, as they do not initiate chases or defend territories. Aggression Male brown Arctics will chase any other butterfly that approaches them. They move in a direct path away from the perch site and turn into spiraling upward flights that can last more than 45 seconds with the intruder. The two or sometimes three individuals involved move in tight circles around each other. The upward spirals can be observed to escalate up to 30 meters above ground, and end with one or both of the butterflies diving sharply toward the ground. Successful defense of the perch site will allow the original butterfly to return to the perch site, while intruders leave quickly. Protective coloring and behavior The brown Arctic butterfly is often described as cryptically colored. Their striated light brown undersides have evolved due to predator pressure. Due to this, the butterflies evolved to camouflage themselves against their background in the Arctic-alpine habitat, including against rock, lichen, and bark. Brown Arctics in hotter, drier regions are generally lighter in color than populations in wetter, cloudier regions. This is most likely because differential lightings leading to different optimal camouflages. The butterfly has been observed to lean sideways to minimize its shadow to be better camouflaged against lichen covered rocks. Physiology  Flight  The peak of the adult flight period of brown Arctics has been observed to be June to July, but ranging from late May to late August. Males rarely take flight spontaneously, only showing activity due to approach of another organism. Males are more likely to display circling flight patterns and prefer to return to the perch site, rarely abandoning their perch to escape into vegetation when disturbed. Females tend to have straighter flight paths with less undulation than males, with a slower wing-beat, only becoming more unpredictable when attempting escape. Conservation The brown Arctic butterfly is considered sensitive to climate change. It is a Regional Forest Sensitive Species in the Washburn District of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, as well State-listed as a Special Concern species in Wisconsin. Continued worsening of climate change is likely to negatively impact the habitats of the brown Arctic. The increase in temperature specifically has the potential to eliminate many alpine habitats in the United States. Paving of roads, as well as other human development, including lodges, parking lots, and picnic grounds, has also led to deterioration of habitats.

The company is a subsidiary of Nilsson Brothers Inc. based in Edmonton, Alberta. From 2009 until 2013, XL Foods' Lakeside Packers Division was located just west of Brooks, Alberta, in Newell County. This facility was the second largest beef-processing operation in Canada. During this period the company was by far the largest employer in Brooks, employing more than 2,200 people in 2012.  History  XL Foods grew from a collection of ranches, feedlots and feed mills into one of the foremost Canadian-owned and operated beef processors in Western Canada. Nilsson Bros. reached an agreement to purchase the core beef assets, along with the company name, on November 22, 1998. In 2009, XL Foods bought Lakeside Packers from its U.S. parent company Tyson Foods, following a bitter strike at Lakeside that lasted through most of 2005 after the workers joined the United Food and Commercial Workers labour union.  XL Lakeside shutdown  XL Foods was temporarily closed on September 27, 2012, by order of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) due to Escherichia coli O157:H7 being discovered in processed meat originating from the plant. The plant was testing incorrectly for E. coli in meat, so the testing procedures were made more stringent. The plant was processing between 2000 and 5000 cattle per day, representing approximately one-third of Canada's 2012 beef slaughtering capacity. According to American regulators and the CFIA, testing practices in place at the plant were not stringent enough to protect consumers from the E. coli contamination. The incident was also linked to increased production at the plant during the time when the E. coli was detected. A total of 18 confirmed cases of infection with E. coli O157:H7 were reported during the subsequent outbreak linked to XL Foods. On October 18, 2012, it was announced that the XL Lakeside plant was to be taken over by JBS USA for 60 days with \\"an exclusive option to buy the Canadian and U.S. operations of XL Foods\\".

At the age of 27, she founded the famous American ballet school, The Littlefield Ballet (later known as the Philadelphia Ballet) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1935. It was the first American ballet company to achieve fame at both the national and international level. Littlefield's establishment was the first American ballet company to tour in Europe and produce the first evening-length (or three-act) edition of The Sleeping Beauty. Littlefield was also known for her production, ‚ÄúMy Bicycle Girl‚Äù as a part of the American Jubilee spectacle at the New York World's Fair of 1940. In 1987, Littlefield became one of the first inductees into the National Museum of Dance‚Äôs Hall of Fame. Early life Catherine Littlefield was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1908. Catherine was the oldest of three siblings: Jimmy, Dorothie, and Carl. Her father, James Littlefield, was a newsreel pioneer and her mother, Caroline Littlefield was a concert pianist. Her mother also opened a dance school after gaining dance experience at the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company by ‚Äúwalking on‚Äù in opera ballets. Caroline trained with the traditional European ballet master, Romulus Carpenter, and began landing actual roles and solos in ballets. The dance school that Caroline started was originally for recreational classes of a local women's club. Caroline could not hire a professional to instruct the classes, so she became the teacher. The school grew and began training dancers for the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company. Education and experience Catherine began training in her mother's studio at the age of three. As she grew older, she worked with a variety of remarkable teachers of the time. When Catherine was a teenager, she danced in Philadelphia Junior League's presentation of Why Not, directed by her mother, Caroline Littlefield. The Broadway impresario, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., provided the costumes for the show and stayed to watch the production. Impressed by Littlefield, Ziegfeld brought Catherine to New York and gave her a role in the Broadway production, Sally, in December 1920. Catherine stayed in New York to sharpen her ballet technique. She studied with Ivan Tarasoff, a Russian ballet master. Between 1922 and 1925, Littlefield starred in five more of Ziegfeld's productions: Follies (1922, 1923), Kid Boots (1923), Annie Dear (1924), and Louie the 14th (1925). While Catherine was away, her mother Caroline was making waves with the Philadelphia Junior League. After her outstanding production of Aida, she became new ballet director of the Philadelphia Civic Opera. Catherine became her principal dancer and assistant choreographer. Catherine was prepared for this role because while she was in New York, she also studied theater dance with Luigi Albertieri, an Italian master of ballet. Her studies focused on the choreography opera ballets at La Scala in Milan, Italy. Every year, The Littlefiled family vacationed in Paris, France for the summer. While in Europe, Catherine studied with Leo Staats, the ballet director of the Paris Opera. She also studied with Lubov Egorova, a former Imperial Russian ballerina. In following years, she returned to Paris to study more with Egorova. Through her studies, she also became close friends Lucienne Lamballe, the leading ballerina of the Paris Opera Ballet. Career Starting in 1928, Catherine and her mother staged movie prologues in the Fox, Earle, Mastbaum, and Stanley theaters in Philadelphia. In 1932, Catherine was given her first opportunity as a choreographer in the production H.P. (horsepower), which was composed of ninety-seven dancers and hosted by the Philadelphia Grand Opera. This role challenged Littlefield to collaborate with Mexican composer, Carlos Chavez and artist, Diego Rivera. The ballet was about Mexican-American trade relations. The work she did earned her an invitation from New York's Roxy Theatre as a choreographer. Littlefield Ballet In 1934, Catherine and her mother began planning opening their own company. Her mother, Caroline, would be the director, Catherine would be the choreographer and the leading dancer, and her sister, Dorothie, would be the first soloist. The company, called Littlefield Ballet, was founded in 1935. The first performance was on October 25, 1935 at Haverford High School in a suburb of Philadelphia that the family lived in. The next year, Caroline became the executive director and Catherine became a director, ‚Äúballet mistress‚Äù, and ‚Äúpremiere danseuse‚Äù. In the first few months, the company produced three brief story ballets called: The Minstrels, The Snow Maiden, and Die Puppenfee (The Fairy Doll). Three months after opening, the company was renamed to The Philadelphia Ballet, but was changed back to Littlefield Ballet in 1940. After a year in business, the Littlefield's produced eighteen complete ballets and twenty-two divertissements. The dances were mostly choreographed by Catherine and the productions were funded by her husband. In 1937, the Littlefield's performed the first American production of Sleeping Beauty. This was one of the highlights of Catherine's career. It was the first three-act version of the musical. Littlefield choreographed the ballet and performed as the main character, Princess Aurora. John Martin, a critic from The New York Times described the production ‚Äúcharming within its limitations.‚Äù Some of Littlefield's most well-known productions were Barn Dance, Caf√© Society, Ladies‚Äô Better Dresses, and Terminal. In spring of 1937, the company toured Europe to perform the routines. They traveled to Paris, Brussels, The Hague, and London. The Littlefield Ballet was the first American ballet company to tour in Europe. Catherine's production earned the medal of the Archives Internationales de la Danse. The Philadelphia Academy of Arts and Sciences also honored the company when they returned to the United States. Bicycle Ballet Catherine was also recognized for putting ballet on wheels. In 1940, Catherine was asked to choreograph dances for the Oscar Hammerstein II-Arhur Schwartz musical production, American Jubilee, during the New York World's Fair. One of her most notable routines was called ‚ÄúMy Bicycle Girl‚Äù and was literally a ballet for cyclists. It was a story that began with a boy asking a girl to join him on a carefree bicycle ride, ‚Äúas life rolls on,‚Äù begging her to be his ‚ÄúBicycle Girl.‚Äù The number consisted of seventy-five male and female cyclists. ‚ÄúLittlefield created figured movement in three registers of dance: within the bodies of the cyclists, in the air with extended limbs and elevation assisted by the use of pedals and handlebars, and in elaborate ground maneuvers by the company.‚Äù Though the dance began in the pouring rain, the dancers didn‚Äôt forget a step on stage. Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City Ballet, described the routine as ‚ÄúA clear if complex blending of human anatomy, solid geometry, and acrobatics offered as a symbolic demonstration of manners.‚Äù The routine was the peak of Catherine's career. Personal life Catherine enjoyed being in the public. At one point, she was named one of the country's ten best-dressed women for her simple yet tasteful style. She was always full of energy, both in and outside of work. Offstage, she was remembered for having a warm personality and a great sense of humor. She was also described as persuasive, witty, and purposeful. One of her contemporaries described her, ‚ÄúShe was dry ice-fiery and cool.‚Äù In 1933, Catherine returned to Philadelphia and married Philip Ludwell Leidy, an attorney. He was the son of Helen C. Leidy, the principal benefactor of the Philadelphia Grand Opera. They never had any children. Leidy showed great support and supplied generous amounts of money to her projects, such as the salaries and transportation of dancers. In 1947, Catherine filed for divorce. In 1948, she married the editor of the Sunday edition of The New York Journal- American, Sterling Noel. Legacy Unfortunately, Littlefield's company only lasted until 1941. The second European tour was cancelled due to many of the male dancers enlisting in the War Effort. Littlefield decided to shut down the company until the war ended, however it was never reopened. Catherine continued contribute to musical theatre. She helped choreograph ice shows, even though she never knew how to skate.

She also helped choreograph Broadway dances including Firebrand of Florence in 1945 and Sweethearts in 1947. Walter Terry, a famous dance critic, remarked ‚ÄúTake skating, dancing, or theatre entertainment in any form of motion as your criterion, and you will be convinced, I think, that Catherine Littlefield is becoming a theater figure of the first rank, a girl who is leaving her mark in the revue, in the ballet and on ice.‚Äù During the late 1940s, Catherine‚Äôs life was cut short. While she was preparing for Hollywood Ice Revue in Chicago, she lost her battle to liver cancer at the age of 47. However, Littlefield‚Äôs legacy lives on. Her achievements are still as remarkable as they once were. She is remembered for introducing ballet as an American art form. In May of 2010, the Perelman Theater of Philadelphia‚Äôs Kimmel Center hosted the Philadelphia Sinfonia performance that highlighted one of Littlefield‚Äôs ballets. An orchestra of students, conducted by Gary D. White, performed in a concert that was accompanied by a documentary featuring pieces of Littlefield‚Äôs Caf√© Society.

He was known for being a capable judge before becoming chancellor, but was considered a partisan power monger as a chancellor, eventually drawing Emperor Dezong's ire and leading to his demotion and later forced suicide.  Background  Dou Shen was born in 734, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His ancestors were originally Xianbei nobles of Northern Wei with the clan name Gedouling (Á¥áË±ÜÈôµ), and further claimed that they were descended from the Han dynasty official Dou Wu and fled to Xianbei realms after Dou Wu was killed in 168 after a failed struggle with powerful eunuchs.See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 56. Dou Shen's Northern Wei ancestors, after assuming the surname of Dou during the change of Xianbei names to Han names regime that Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei instituted, were ancestors in the line to officials of Western Wei and Sui dynasty, before the early Tang dynasty chancellor Dou Kang, who was Dou Shen's great-great-great-grandfather. Dou Shen's grandfather Dou Jin (Á´áÁëæ) was not recorded with any official titles, but Dou Shen's father Dou Shenyan (Á´áÂØ©Ë®Ä) served as a county magistrate.New Book of Tang, vol. 71.  Early career  Dou Shen learned about laws and administrative regulations when he was young. It was said that he had a stern and decisive personality. Because of his heritage, he became an official in his young age, and eventually became the sheriff of Wannian County (Ëê¨Âπ¥), one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang'an. On one night, one of his colleagues was supposed to be on duty in watching the prisoners but asked Dou to fill in for him because his relative was ill. Dou agreed. That night, some prisoners escaped, and his superior, the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) read the rotation schedule and saw that Dou's colleague was to be on duty. He was set to punish Dou's colleague, when Dou stated that it was he who watched the prisoners and should be held responsible. As a result, he was sent out of the capital to be the magistrate of Jiangxia County (Ê±üÂ§è, in modern Wuhan, Hubei),This was considered a demotion since Tang officials prized posts in or near the Chang'an or the eastern capital Luoyang. but received praise for his honesty.Old Book of Tang, vol. 136 . Eventually, he was promoted to be the sheriff of Fengxian County (Â•âÂÖà, near Chang'an). One of the residents of Fengxian, Cao Fen (ÊõπËä¨), was nominally a soldier of the imperial guards, but was known for his violence. On one occasion, when Cao was drunk, he battered his sister; his father tried to stop the battering, but could not, and in distress committed suicide by jumping into a well. Dou arrested Cao and his brothers and sentenced them to death. His subordinates wanted to spare them because their father had just died, but Dou responded: Dou then caned them to death, and this terrified the people of the county. He later became Dali Sizhi (Â§ßÁêÜÂè∏Áõ¥), a judge at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫). On one occasion, he was sent to the Yangtze River-Huai River region to rule on cases in that region. When he arrived at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered at Yang Prefecture), Chen Shaoyou (Èô≥Â∞ëÈÅä), who was arrogant, did not personally welcome him as per regulations but only sent subordinates to do so. Dou rebuked them and refused to meet them. Chen, in fear, apologized. It was further said that Dou served well on this mission. In particular, at that time, Deng Ting (ÈÑßÁèΩ) the prefect of Wu Prefecture (Â©∫Â∑û, in modern Jinhua, Zhejiang) was accused of receiving a large amount of bribes, and his assets were set to be seized to satisfy the penalty. Deng, however, was friendly with the chancellors at that time, and Dou's colleagues largely, wanting to ingratiate the chancellors, wanted to exempt Deng. Dou, however, stood firm and wanted to collect Deng's assets, and he was able to prevail. The next year, he became Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤), an imperial censor. At that time, Ma Yi (È¶¨ÂΩù), the secretary to the governor of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), was falsely accused of crimes, because he had punished a subordinate for receiving bribes and in turn was accused by that subordinate's son. Dou was sent to judge Ma, and he was able to tell that Ma was innocent. Dou later was promoted in his censor rank to Dianzhong Shi Yushi (ÊÆø‰∏≠‰æçÂæ°Âè≤). He then successively served as Jinbu Yuanwailang (ÈáëÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu); Xingbu Langzhong (ÂàëÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisorial low-level official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu); and Shiyushi (‰æçÂæ°Âè≤), a higher level censor. He was yet later promoted to be Yushi Zhongcheng (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û), the deputy chief imperial censor. He was said to be stern in his rulings and unafraid of powerful men. As a result, he gained favor from Emperor Dezong and was often summoned to give Emperor Dezong advice. He often disagreed with the chancellors' suggestions, and the chancellors tried to find fault in him, but could find nothing to damage him with. However, it was also said that, by this point, he was letting his own desires interfere with his enforcement of law. For example, when he was involved in setting salaries for the officials, he set the salary for the Yushi Sizhi higher than that of Yushi Cheng (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏û, secretaries general), who were of the same rank, because he had been Sizhi before. Further, when he was setting regulations on the order of precedence the officials should have when meeting the emperor, he disliked Li Bian (ÊùéÊò™), a staff member of the crown prince Li Song with the title of Taizi Zhanshi (Â§™Â≠êË©π‰∫ã), and therefore had Taizi Zhanshi listed after the deputy mayors of the special municipalities ‚Äî even though Taizi Zhanshi carried a higher rank and traditionally was more honored. For this, he began to receive criticism. Dou soon took on the additional office of deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). There was an occasion when a Chang'an farmer had a pig that had two heads. His subordinates believed that this to be a sign of fortune and wanted to report it to the emperor. Dou responded, \\"This is one monstrous pig. How can it be reported to the emperor?\\" He ordered that the pig be abandoned. In another incident, Chen Shaoyou's son Chen Zhengyi (Èô≥Ê≠£ÂÑÄ), after Chen Shaoyou's death, requested to be allowed to inherit Chen Shaoyou's title. Dou publicly wrote a statement and posted it on the front door of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng): Chen Zhengyi, in fear, left without further requesting to inherit the title. Around this time, the generals Meng Hua (Â≠üËèØ) and Li Jianyu (ÊùéÂª∫Áéâ) were both falsely accused of crimes and set to be sentenced to death, and they could not show their innocence. Dou, however, was able to discern their innocence and obtain their releases. As a result, the popular sentiment at the time had great expectations for Dou.  Chancellorship  Meanwhile, though, Dou Shen drew the attention of the chancellor Li Mi, and Li repeatedly recommended both him and Dong Jin, believing that Dou was capable in financial matters and Dong was morally upright. Emperor Dezong initially did not agree with Li's assessment, but in 789, with Li being seriously ill, he again recommended Dou and Dong, and Emperor Dezong finally agreed. He made Dou Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) as well as the director of financial affairs. He also gave both Dou and Dong the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making them chancellors de facto. Li died shortly after, and it was said that while both Dou and Dong were chancellors, Dou had greater grasp of power and put many of his associates in powerful positions. He often met Emperor Dezong alone, under the guise of discussing financial matters.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. It was said that generals and regional warlords all feared him, and in particular, Li Na the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), sent him gifts, ostensibly to honor him, but instead intending to discredit him. Emperor Dezong's close associates also disliked Dou and often defamed him. In fall 791, Dou, as he disliked Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor, the imperial scholar Lu Zhi, had Lu made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) ‚Äî ostensibly a promotion, but instead a way to cause distance between Emperor Dezong and Lu. Meanwhile, Dou also disliked Wu Cou (Âê≥Êπä) the governor of Fujian Circuit (Á¶èÂª∫, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) ‚Äî a maternal uncle of Emperor Dezong's father Emperor Daizong.New Book of Tang, vol. 159 . Even though Wu had good reputation as the governor of Fujian, Dou reported to Emperor Dezong that Wu had been stricken by arthritis and rendered immobile. Emperor Dezong recalled Wu to Chang'an and had Wu walk before him. He saw that Wu was not immobile, and thereafter began to dislike Dou for his false reporting. He made Wu the governor Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) to displace Dou's associate Li Yi (ÊùéÁøº). Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong's original choice for the director of finances, Ban Hong (Áè≠ÂÆè), who was made Dou's deputy, had been promised by Dou that he would become director after Dou had served for one year, but after one year, Dou continued to hold onto the position with no intent to yield it, drawing Ban's anger. Only after Dou became aware of Emperor Dezong's displeasure with him did he yield the post to Ban, in spring 792. Dou, however, chose Ban's deputy, Zhang Pang (ÂºµÊªÇ) to divide Ban's power.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. Meanwhile, Dou's nephew Dou Shen (Á´áÁî≥), an imperial attendant, was very close to Dou Shen, and Dou Shen often discussed with him personnel movements before they were announced. Dou Shen thus often used this information to extract bribes from others by informing the subjects of promotions in advance ‚Äî such that he gained the nickname of \\"Magpie\\" (because the Chinese believed that magpies were foretellers of good fortune). Even Emperor Dezong heard of Dou Shen's reputation and suggested Dou Shen to send Dou Shen out of the capital, but Dou Shen guaranteed to Emperor Dezong that Dou Shen would not cause trouble. Dou Shen closely associated with his maternal uncle Li Zezhi (ÊùéÂâá‰πã)New Book of Tang, vol. 145 . the Prince of Guo and the imperial scholar Wu Tongxuan (Âê≥ÈÄöÁéÑ), and all of them resented Lu Zhi. They therefore manufactured documents defaming Lu, to try to stop Emperor Dezong from trusting Lu. However, Emperor Dezong found out, and in summer 792 demoted Dou Shen, Li Zezhi, and Wu Tongxuan out of the capital, and soon ordered Wu to commit suicide. Soon thereafter, Emperor Dezong demoted Dou Shen to be the secretary general of Chen Prefecture (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan). Lu Zhi and Zhao Jing were named chancellors.  After chancellorship and death In 792, the former chancellor Jiang Gongfu, a former colleague of Lu Zhi's as an imperial scholar, met Lu to request his help in obtaining a promotion. Lu secretly responded: In fear, Jiang offered to resign and asked to become a Taoist monk. When Emperor Dezong inquired as to the reason and found out that he was fearful, he did not dare to state that Lu had told him this information, and instead claimed that Dou told him the information. Angry that his words had been leaked, Emperor Dezong demoted Jiang to be the secretary general of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), and sent imperial eunuch messengers to Dou, in exile, to rebuke him. Meanwhile, Dou Shen's superior, Li Sun (ÊùéÂ∑Ω) the governor of Hunan Circuit had been demoted when Dou was chancellor. In 793, Li submitted a report about how Dou had received a gift in silk from Liu Shining (ÂäâÂ£´ÂØß) the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and accused Dou of improper association with governors. Emperor Dezong wanted to execute Dou; Lu Zhi opposed on the grounds that this offense was not a death offense. Emperor Dezong therefore demoted Dou to be the military advisor to the prefect of the distant Huan Prefecture (È©©Â∑û, in modern Ngh·ªá An Province, Vietnam). His son Dou Jingbo (Á´áÊôØ‰ºØ) was exiled to Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), while his daughter Dou Zhenru (Á´áÁúüÂ¶Ç), who was a Buddhist nun, was made a servant at Chen Prefecture. His assets were seized. However, Emperor Dezong's eunuchs deeply hated Dou and continued to attack him. Eventually, even as Dou was on the way to Huan Prefecture, Emperor Dezong issued an edict ordering him to commit suicide.

The Remote Touch controller, which is similar to a computer mouse or joystick, allows the driver to operate an on-screen cursor on the vehicle's GPS navigation system screen. Remote Touch utilizes haptic feedback, where the controller provides reaction force, and force feedback, where the on-screen cursor can move to nearby buttons automatically. System functions can be configured by the driver. Remote Touch was first introduced on the 2010 Lexus RX 350 and Lexus RX 450h models, followed by the 2010 Lexus HS 250h. Background Prior to the advent of Remote Touch, Lexus interiors were typically equipped with touchscreen interfaces. Although this system was regarded by many reviewers as easier to use than conventional rotary knob controllers, the need to place the touchscreen within easy reach limited design possibilities for the interior (by forcing placement of the screen in the center dash and in close proximity to the steering wheel). The enhanced technology trend in the automotive industry also resulted in a plethora of ever-increasing buttons and switches on many luxury vehicles. Side view of the Remote Touch controller In response, several luxury brands had switched to rotary knob control devices, with the aim to simplify cabin layout and consolidate multiple controls with a single device. The BMW iDrive, Audi MMI, and Mercedes-Benz COMAND APS interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the rotary knob scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout, while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive. In the mid 2000s, Lexus began developing an alternative to the touchscreen interface, in light of the latter's restrictions on interior styling and instrument panel configuration. Prototype development and consumer testing was conducted to develop a new control device. Consumer research conducted with Lexus supplier Denso corporation indicated that the prototype control system required no more mental or physical effort than a touchscreen, plus offered interior layouts with more screen visibility, was physically more comfortable to operate, and easier to use while in motion. Design Unveiled by Lexus at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show in November of that year, Remote Touch became Lexus' entry into the realm of non-touchscreen human-machine interfaces. Introduced on the third generation Lexus RX, the Remote Touch system differs from previous interfaces in being the first to use a computer mouse (or trackball)-based concept, instead of the rotary knob model. The system allows the operator to freely move the on-screen cursor across any part of the screen. The cursor replaces the role of the driver's hand on the previous touchscreen interface. Remote Touch demonstrator at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show Remote Touch is also the first vehicle interface to incorporate user-adjustable haptic feedback, and utilize movement in two spatial axes. The incorporation of haptic feedback, similar to the Wii Remote, enables the driver to feel the placement of buttons and icons on the screen by touch. The use of force feedback enables the cursor to 'snap-to' buttons, making it easier to select buttons without precise movement. To ease drivers' transition to Remote Touch, the same on-screen layout and menus as the prior touchscreen-based system are used on models equipped with the new control system. The Remote Touch controller, which (including the directional input, buttons, and palmrest) measures in width x in length, and is tall, is placed at the base of the center console. Two large buttons (Enter) on both sides of the controller at thumb level are used to select icons, along with three secondary buttons (Map, Scroll, and Display). With the replacement of the touchscreen, the navigation screen is now recessed and placed closer to eye level on the dashboard. Remote Touch has two motors and an encoder, with the motors programmed to reset the controller to a neutral position when the navigation system is activated. The introduction of Remote Touch on the 2010 Lexus RX was generally well received by reviewers, and the system was described as easier to use than rivals by Autoblog, Car and Driver, Cars.com, CNET, Consumer Guide, Edmunds.com, Motor Trend, PC Magazine, Road & Track, and Winding Road, with Motor Trend predicting that competitors would adopt its design. However, the system remained a controversial interface for some drivers who found it difficult to use, as compared to the previous, Lexus-standard touchscreen. Remote Touch won Popular Mechanics Technical Innovation Award, and was named Popular Science's \\"Best of What's New\\" in Auto Tech for 2009. Functions The Remote Touch system can be used to control a host of vehicle functions, as listed below. Multiple functions can also be accessed via voice commands and for basic or commonly used items, such as stereo and climate control, via dedicated buttons.

As of 2009, the Lexus LS, GS, IS, ES sedans, SC and IS coupes, and the LX(until 2015) and GX sport utility vehicles use a touchscreen interface system, which in new models includes the same menu interface and layout as the Remote Touch-equipped models.

Bush's political positions have been expressed in public statements, and through his actions in the executive roles of governor of Texas and president of the United States. Economic policy Fiscal policy and taxation George Bush supports enacting generous tax cuts in the model of Ronald Reagan's supply-side fiscal policies. He believes this helps the economy at large. Energy policy George Bush supports nuclear power and expanded domestic drilling. Bush pledged to work toward reduced reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.Full text (and video) of 2007 State of the Union address He lifted a ban on offshore drilling in 2008, and said at the time, \\"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\\" Bush had said in June 2008, \\"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\\" In 2008, Bush announced that the United States would commit $2 billion towards an international fund to promote clean energy technologies, saying, \\"along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\\" Entitlement reform Bush supports the privatization of Social Security by allowing individuals to set up personal retirement accounts. He also supported the expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs using private insurance through his Medicare Part D program. Free-market capitalism Bush generally supports free-market capitalism, but claims to understand the importance of government involvements in private financial affairs if they are projected to have a negative impact on the economy as a whole. In November 2008, Bush claimed, \\"Our aim should not be more government. It should be smarter government.\\"Mahnoush H. Arsanjani, et al. (ed.), Looking to the Future, BRILL, 2010, p. 281. During the beginning of his first term, Bush enacted corporate tax cuts in the hopes that the economy would flourish as a result. Later, in 2008, Bush supported major bailout plans for mortgage lenders and auto makers who were facing bankruptcy. Bush also enacted the first major economic stimulus in the face of an economy on the down-turn, which handed free checks to all private tax-paying citizens. Trade Bush is a supporter of free trade, calling on nations to embrace free trade. Health care Bush supports a free-market health care system, and opposes a universal health plan. In 2004, Bush planned a health care program that he said would cover as many as 10 million people who lack health insurance at a cost of $102 billion over the next decade. Foreign policy Iraq War On March 19, 2003, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, launching the Iraq War. That night, he addressed the nation, stating that he decided to invade Iraq \\"to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger\\". The United States and its allies charged that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and thus posed a serious and imminent threat to the security of the United States and its coalition allies.Center for American Progress (January 29, 2004) \\"In Their Own Words: Iraq's 'Imminent' Threat\\" americanprogress.orgSenator Bill Nelson (January 28, 2004) \\"New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction\\", Congressional Record This assessment was supported by the U.K. intelligence services, but not by other countries such as France, Russia and Germany. It was later and after the war revealed that there were never any weapons of mass destruction and this was confirmed by multiple international and national commissions. Axis of evil In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush declared the nations of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, as well as \\"their terrorist allies\\", part of the axis of evil for their alleged support of terrorism. Homeland security After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, President Bush founded the Cabinet Department of Homeland Security. He initially opposed it, arguing that the department placed an unnecessary bureaucratic burden on the U.S. government. Bush changed his mind in June 2002 to approve of the proposal, however its creation was delayed due to disagreements in Congress over labor protection and the role of trade unions in the department. The department was created on November 25, following the passage of the Homeland Security Act. Civil liberties Anti- terrorism and domestic surveillance Bush is a supporter of anti-terrorist surveillance and information-gathering methods. In 2001 he signed into law the Patriot Act. Habeas corpus The November 13, 2001, Presidential Military Order gave the President of the United States the power to detain suspects, suspected of connection to terrorists or terrorism as an unlawful combatant. As such, it was asserted that a person could be held indefinitely without charges being filed against him or her, without a court hearing, and without entitlement to a legal consultant. Many legal and constitutional scholars contended that these provisions were in direct opposition to habeas corpus and the United States Bill of Rights. Gun laws Although generally an opponent of gun control, Bush has shown support for certain gun-restrictive policies. Following a shooting spree in Atlanta in July 1999, Bush announced his support for a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips and an increase of the legal age for firearms from 18 to 21, calling these \\"reasonable measures.\\" As governor of Texas, Bush initiated a program to provide Texas handgun owners with free trigger locks in May 2000, and pledged to push for the initiative on a nationwide scale if elected president. In 2003, Bush declared that he would seek a renewal of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban which was due to expire the following year, however it was later reported that he had \\"seemed disinclined\\" to push for it in Congress. Bush signed into law the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in October 2005. Social policy Education: No Child Left Behind President Bush proposed No Child Left Behind on January 23, 2001, just three days after his first inauguration. It was coauthored by Representatives John Boehner (R-OH) and George Miller (D-CA) and Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Judd Gregg (R-NH). The United States House of Representatives passed the bill on May 23, 2001 (voting 384‚Äì45), and the United States Senate passed it on June 14, 2001 (voting 91‚Äì8). President Bush signed it into law on January 8, 2002. Abortion Bush has a strong pro- life stance, consistently opposing abortion while supporting parental notification for minor girls who want abortions, the Mexico City Policy, a ban on intact dilation and extraction (commonly known as partial-birth abortion), adoption tax credits, and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.OnTheIssues Running for Congress in 1978, Bush had said that the decision to have an abortion should be a woman's personal decision, but he declared that he was pro-life in 1994. Death penalty Bush supports the death penalty. As Governor of Texas, he allowed 152 executions. He commuted the sentence of one prisoner on death row, Henry Lee Lucas, on June 15, 1998. Environment Bush opposed the Kyoto Protocol, saying that the treaty neglected and exempted 80 percent of the world's population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year. Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee. Bush has said that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserts there is a \\"debate over whether it's manmade or naturally caused\\". He announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the United Nations, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \\"this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\\" LGBT issues Bush opposed same-sex marriage. During his 2004 reelection campaign, he called for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage in the United States but allow for the possibility of civil unions on the state level. He also stated in the famous Wead tapes that he would not \\"kick gays\\" and worried his refusal to do so might upset his evangelical supporters, and that \\"I think it is bad for Republicans to be kicking gays.\\"In Secretly Taped Conversations, Glimpses of the Future President, David D. Kirkpatrick, The New York Times, February 20, 2005 Prayer in public schools Bush supported \\"voluntary, student-led prayer\\" but not \\"teacher-led prayers.\\"Positions of the Republican and Democratic party on public school prayer Stem cell research Bush opposes federal funding for research relating to newly derived embryonic stem cell lines.

In 2001, after several years working as a teenage pop journalist in Toronto, Cash decided to focus on writing and producing songs at home on his computer, releasing at least ten known full-length CD-R albums in downtown Toronto and New York City. Though distribution was unofficial and limited, news of the works by the young artist spread. By 2004, Cash had been featured in The Fader magazine and had gained high-profile friends and admirers in the avant-garde pop music scene including James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem and DFA Records. Most of Cash's songs draw on varying elements commonly associated with, hip-hop, rock and electro. In 2004, The Fader's, Knox Robinson, christened Cash's sound \\"afroclash,\\" a play on the \\"electroclash\\" trend sweeping the New York underground. Cash himself claimed in several 2007 interviews that his music was simply rock & roll, though he allowed that it could be dubbed \\"new wave rap\\" if one were desperate to find a correct classification for his musical style. In 2006, Cash released the album On The Bus on his Stereoeagle label. The debut work, which contained the club hits \\"Star Dust\\" and \\"Don't Crash\\", caught the attention of Berlin label boss and dj/producer Headman, who signed Cash to his indie electro imprint Relish. Cash released the album II in 2007 via Relish and had success with \\"Disco Wreck\\" and \\"Hey There\\", while being remixed by Zongamin and Street Life DJs. The album was a hit with critics and audiences alike, garnering raves in The Sunday Times, i-D magazine and NME. Cash spent 2008 touring in Europe, while writing and recording new songs. Freshy Fresh, Cash's third full length effort, was released in May 2010 on URBNET Records in partnership with Stereoeagle. In November 2010, Cash followed up Freshy Fresh by releasing Unbreakable on stereoeagle/URBNET. Containing 15 new songs written and produced by the artist, Unbreakable was Cash's first all rap LP in almost ten years.

He assisted in running a quasi-feudal organisation of regions called the poligar or the palayakkarar system where the regions are divided into palayams (small principalities) and are independently governed by poligars or palayakkarars (petty chiefs). The Aiyaram Kaal Mandapam, or Thousand Pillared Hall, in the famous Meenakshi Temple was constructed by him in 1569. There is a statue of him at the entrance.History&Description; of Sri Meenakshi Temple: By T. G. S. Balaram Iyer, T. R. Rajagopalan ‚Äì Meenakshi Temple ‚Äì 1977 Early life Ariyanatha Mudaliar was born in Meippedu village, Tondaimandalam (the present day Kanchipuram district). According to a modern descendant, he learned Tamil and Mathematics from a teacher for free and in his spare time mastered the ancient Tamil martial art of Silambam and others like sword fight and wrestling. At the age of 16, he was encouraged to go the court of Krishnadevaraya, the king of Vijayanagara. Ariyanatha soon rose to prominence and became the chief accountant of the Vijayanagara empire. Rise to power Aayiram Kaal Mandapam(Thousand Pillar Hall) built by Ariyanatha Mudaliar. A section of the hall in the morning. The process of consolidation of the Tamil region under the Vijayanagara empire began at the start of the 16th century. The regions were brought primarily under the control of the Nayaka kingdoms of Madurai, Tanjore and Senji. Though the different Nayaka regions were autonomous, they all acknowledged the sovereignty of the Vijayanagara and its emperor, Krishnadevaraya. During the process of consolidation, Krishnadevaraya dispatched one of his most successful generals, Nagama Nayaka, on a campaign to punish Virasekhara Chola who had plundered the petty Pandyan regions. The Pandyas were under the protection of the Vijayanagara empire. Having put down Virasekhara, the general Nagama Nayak claimed Madurai for himself. Viswanatha Nayak, the son of Nagama Nayak, was more loyal to the king Krishnadevaraya than to his father. He overthrew his father and handed him over to Krishnadevaraya and as a reward for his loyalty the king appointed Viswanatha Nayaka as the governor of Madurai and other provinces in the neighbouring Tamil country.The New Cambridge History of India By Gordon Johnson, Christopher Alan Bayly, J.

Graphite oxide, formerly called graphitic oxide or graphitic acid, is a compound of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in variable ratios, obtained by treating graphite with strong oxidizers. The maximally oxidized bulk product is a yellow solid with C:O ratio between 2.1 and 2.9, that retains the layer structure of graphite but with a much larger and irregular spacing. The bulk material spontaneously disperses in basic solutions or can be dispersed by sonication in polar solvents to yield monomolecular sheets, known as graphene oxide by analogy to graphene, the single-layer form of graphite. Graphene oxide sheets have been used to prepare strong paper-like materials, membranes, thin films, and composite materials. Initially, graphene oxide attracted substantial interest as a possible intermediate for the manufacture of graphene. The graphene obtained by reduction of graphene oxide still has many chemical and structural defects which is a problem for some applications but an advantage for some others. History and preparation Graphite oxide was first prepared by Oxford chemist Benjamin C. Brodie in 1859, by treating graphite with a mixture of potassium chlorate and fuming nitric acid. He reported synthesis of \\"paper-like foils\\" with 0.05 mm thickness. In 1957 Hummers and Offeman developed a safer, quicker, and more efficient process called Hummers' method, using a mixture of sulfuric acid H2SO4, sodium nitrate NaNO3, and potassium permanganate KMnO4, which is still widely used, often with some modifications. Largest monolayer GO with highly intact carbon framework and minimal residual impurity concentrations can be synthesized in inert containers using highly pure reactants and solvents. Graphite oxides demonstrate considerable variations of properties depending on degree of oxidation and synthesis method. For example, temperature point of explosive exfoliation is generally higher for graphite oxide prepared by Brodie method compared to Hummers graphite oxide, the difference is up to 100 degrees with the same heating rates. Hydration and solvation properties of Brodie and Hummers graphite oxides are also remarkably different. Recently a mixture of H2SO4 and KMnO4 has been used to cut open carbon nanotubes lengthwise, resulting in microscopic flat ribbons of graphene, a few atoms wide, with the edges \\"capped\\" by oxygen atoms (=O) or hydroxyl groups (-OH). Graphite (Graphene) oxide (GO) has also been prepared by using a \\"bottom-up\\" synthesis method (Tang-Lau method) in which the sole source is glucose, the process is safer, simpler, and more environmentally friendly compared to traditionally ‚Äútop- down‚Äù method, in which strong oxidizers are involved. Another important advantage of Tang-Lau method is control of thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayers by adjusting growth parameters. Structure The structure and properties of graphite oxide depend on particular synthesis method and degree of oxidation. It typically preserves the layer structure of the parent graphite, but the layers are buckled and the interlayer spacing is about two times larger (~0.7 nm) than that of graphite. Strictly speaking \\"oxide\\" is an incorrect but historically established name. Besides oxygen epoxide groups (bridging oxygen atoms), other functional groups experimentally found are: carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (-OH), phenol, for graphite oxides prepared using sulphuric acid (e.g. Hummers method) also some impurity of sulphur is often found, for example in a form of organosulfate groups . The detailed structure is still not understood due to the strong disorder and irregular packing of the layers. Graphene oxide layers are about 1.1 ¬± 0.2 nm thick. Scanning tunneling microscopy shows the presence of local regions where oxygen atoms are arranged in a rectangular pattern with lattice constant 0.27 nm √ó 0.41 nm The edges of each layer are terminated with carboxyl and carbonyl groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows presence of several C1s peaks, their number and relative intensity depending on particular oxidation method used. Assignment of these peaks to certain carbon functionalization types is somewhat uncertain and still under debates. For example, one of interpretations goes as following: non-oxygenated ring contexts (284.8 eV), C-O (286.2 eV), C=O (287.8 eV) and O-C=O (289.0 eV). Another interpretation using density functional theory calculation goes as following: C=C with defects such as functional groups and pentagons (283.6 eV), C=C (non- oxygenated ring contexts) (284.3 eV), sp3C-H in the basal plane and C=C with functional groups (285.0 eV), C=O and C=C with functional groups, C-O (286.5 eV), and O-C=O (288.3 eV). Graphite oxide is hydrophilic and easily hydrated when exposed to water vapor or immersed in liquid water, resulting in a distinct increase of the inter-planar distance (up to 1.2 nm in saturated state). Additional water is also incorporated into interlayer space due to high pressure induced effects. Maximal hydration state of graphite oxide in liquid water corresponds to insertion of 2-3 water monolayers, cooling the graphite oxide/H2O samples results in \\"pseudo-negative thermal expansion\\" and below freezing point of water media results in de-insertion of one water monolayer and lattice contraction. Complete removal of water from the structure seems difficult since heating at 60‚Äì80 ¬∞C results in partial decomposition and degradation of the material.Exfoliation of graphite oxide at high temperature, screenshots from video available here: Exfoliation results in tenfold increase of sample volume and formation of carbon powder with grains of few graphene layers thickness. Similar to water, graphite oxide also easily incorporates other polar solvents, e.g. alcohols. However, intercalation of polar solvents occurs significantly different in Brodie and Hummers graphite oxides. Brodie graphite oxide is intercalated at ambient conditions by one monolayer of alcohols and several other solvents (e.g. dimethylformamide and acetone) when liquid solvent is available in excess. Separation of graphite oxide layers is proportional to the size of alcohol molecule. Cooling of Brodie graphite oxide immersed in excess of liquid methanol, ethanol, acetone, and dimethylformamide results in step-like insertion of additional solvent monolayer and lattice expansion. The phase transition detected by X-ray diffraction and DSC is reversible; de-insertion of solvent monolayer is observed when sample is heated back from low temperatures. Additional methanol and ethanol monolayer is reversibly inserted into the structure of Brodie graphite oxide also at high pressure conditions. Hummers graphite oxide is intercalated with two methanol or ethanol monolayers already at ambient temperature. The interlayer distance of Hummers graphite oxide in excess of liquid alcohols increases gradually upon temperature decrease, reaching 19.4 and 20.6 √Ö at 140 K for methanol and ethanol, respectively. The gradual expansion of the Hummers graphite oxide lattice upon cooling corresponds to insertion of at least two additional solvent monolayers. Graphite oxide exfoliates and decomposes when rapidly heated at moderately high temperatures (~280‚Äì300 ¬∞C) with formation of finely dispersed amorphous carbon, somewhat similar to activated carbon.  Characterization  350x350px XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, AFM, TEM, SEM/EDX, etc. are some common techniques to characterize GO samples. Since the distribution of oxygen functionalities on GO sheets is polydisperse, fractionation method can be used to characterize and separate GO sheets on the basis of oxidation. Different synthesis methods give rise to different types of graphene oxide. Even the different batches from similar oxidation method can have differences in their properties due to variations in purification or quenching processes.  Surface properties  It is also possible to modify the surface of graphene oxide to change its properties. Graphene oxide has unique surface properties which make it a very good surfactant material stabilizing various emulsion systems. Graphene oxide remains at the interface of the emulsions systems due to the difference in surface energy of the two phases separated by the interface.  Relation to water  Graphene oxide in liquid water. Graphite oxides absorb moisture proportionally to humidity and swells in liquid water. The amount of water absorbed by graphite oxides depends on the particular synthesis method and shows a strong temperature dependence. Brodie graphite oxide absorbs selective methanol from water/methanol mixtures in certain range of methanol concentrations. Membranes prepared from graphite oxides (recently more often named as \\"graphene oxide\\" membranes) are vacuum tight and impermeable to nitrogen and oxygen, but are permeable to water vapors. The membranes are also impermeable to \\"substances of lower molecular weight\\". Permeation of graphite and graphene oxide membranes by polar solvents is possible due to swelling of the graphite oxide structure. The membranes in swelled state are also permeable by gases, e.g. helium. Graphene oxide sheets are chemically reactive in liquid water, leading them to acquire a small negative charge. The interlayer distance of dried graphite oxides was reported as ~6‚Äì7 √Ö but in liquid water it increases up to 11‚Äì13 √Ö at room temperature. The lattice expansion becomes stronger at lower temperatures. The inter-layer distance in diluted NaOH reached infinity, resulting in dispersion of graphite oxide on single-layered graphene oxide sheets in solution. Graphite oxide can be used as a cation exchange membrane for materials such as KCl, HCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, BaCl2 solutions. The membranes were permeable by large alkali ions as they are able to penetrate between graphene oxide layers. Applications  Optical nonlinearity  Nonlinear optical materials are of great importance for ultrafast photonics and optoelectronics. Recently, the giant optical nonlinearities of graphene oxide (GO) has been proved useful for a number of applications. For example, the optical limiting of GO are indispensable to protect sensitive instruments from laser-induced damage. And the saturable absorption can be used for pulse compression, mode-locking and Q-switching. Also, the nonlinear refraction (Kerr effect) is crucial for functionalities including all-optical switching, signal regeneration, and fast optical communications. One of the most intriguing and unique properties of GO is that its electrical and optical properties can be tuned dynamically by manipulating the content of oxygen-containing groups through either chemical or physical reduction methods. The tuning of the optical nonlinearities have been demonstrated during its entire laser-induced reduction process through continuous increase of the laser irradiance and four stages of different nonlinear activities have been discovered, which may serve as promising solid state materials for novel nonlinear functional devices. It is also proved that metal nanoparticles can greatly enhance the optical nonlinearity and fluorescence of graphene oxide. Graphene manufacture Graphite oxide has attracted much interest as a possible route for the large-scale production and manipulation of graphene, a material with extraordinary electronic properties. Graphite oxide itself is an insulator, almost a semiconductor, with differential conductivity between 1 and 5√ó10‚àí3 S/cm at a bias voltage of 10 V. However, being hydrophilic, graphite oxide disperses readily in water, breaking up into macroscopic flakes, mostly one layer thick. Chemical reduction of these flakes would yield a suspension of graphene flakes. It was argued that the first experimental observation of graphene was reported by Hanns-Peter Boehm in 1962. In this early work the existence of monolayer reduced graphene oxide flakes was demonstrated. The contribution of Boehm was recently acknowledged by Andre Geim, the Nobel Prize winner for graphene research. Partial reduction can be achieved by treating the suspended graphene oxide with hydrazine hydrate at 100 ¬∞C for 24 hours, by exposing graphene oxide to hydrogen plasma for a few seconds, or by exposure to a strong pulse of light, such as that of a Xenon flash. Due to the oxidation protocol, manifold defects already present in graphene oxide hamper the effectiveness of the reduction. Thus, the graphene quality obtained after reduction is limited by the precursor quality (graphene oxide) and the efficiency of the reducing agent. However, the conductivity of the graphene obtained by this route is below 10 S/cm, and the charge mobility is between 0.1 and 10 cm2/Vs. These values are much greater than the oxide's, but still a few orders of magnitude lower than those of pristine graphene. Recently, the synthetic protocol for graphite oxide was optimized and almost intact graphene oxide with a preserved carbon framework was obtained. Reduction of this almost intact graphene oxide performs much better and the mobility values of charge carriers exceeds 1000 cm2/Vs for the best quality of flakes. Inspection with the atomic force microscope shows that the oxygen bonds distort the carbon layer, creating a pronounced intrinsic roughness in the oxide layers which persists after reduction. These defects also show up in Raman spectra of graphene oxide. Large amounts of graphene sheets may also be produced through thermal methods. For example, in 2006 a method was discovered that simultaneously exfoliates and reduces graphite oxide by rapid heating (>2000 ¬∞C/min) to 1050 ¬∞C. At this temperature, carbon dioxide is released as the oxygen functionalities are removed and explosively separates the sheets as it comes out. Exposing a film of graphite oxide to the laser of a LightScribe DVD has also revealed to produce quality graphene at a low cost. Graphene oxide has also been reduced to graphene in situ, using a 3D printed pattern of engineered E. coli bacteria.  Water purification  Graphite oxides were studied for desalination of water using reverse osmosis beginning in the 1960s. In 2011 additional research was released. In 2013 Lockheed Martin announced their Perforene graphene filter. Lockheed claims the filter reduces energy costs of reverse osmosis desalination by 99%. Lockheed claimed that the filter was 500 times thinner than the best filter then on the market, one thousand times stronger and requires 1% of the pressure. The product was not expected to be released until 2020. Another study showed that graphite oxide could be engineered to allow water to pass, but retain some larger ions. Narrow capillaries allow rapid permeation by mono- or bilayer water. Multilayer laminates have a structure similar to nacre, which provides mechanical strength at water free conditions. Helium cannot pass through the membranes in humidity free conditions, but penetrates easily when exposed to humidity, whereas water vapor passes with no resistance. Dry laminates are vacuum-tight, but immersed in water, they act as molecular sieves, blocking some solutes. A third project produced graphene sheets with subnanoscale (0.40 ¬± 0.24 nm) pores. The graphene was bombarded with gallium ions, which disrupt carbon bonds. Etching the result with an oxidizing solution produces a hole at each spot struck by a gallium ion. The length of time spent in the oxidizing solution determined average pore size. Pore density reached 5 trillion pores per square centimeter, while retaining structural integrity. The pores permitted cation transport at short oxidation times, consistent with electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups at pore edges. At longer oxidation times, sheets were permeable to salt but not larger organic molecules. In 2015 a team created a graphene oxide tea that over the course of a day removed 95% of heavy metals in a water solution One project layered carbon atoms in a honeycomb structure, forming a hexagon-shaped crystal that measured about 0.1 millimeters in width and length, with subnanometer holes. Later work increased the membrane size to on the order of several millimeters. Graphene attached to a polycarbonate support structure was initially effective at removing salt. However, defects formed in the graphene. Filling larger defects with nylon and small defects with hafnium metal followed by a layer of oxide restored the filtration effect. In 2016 engineers developed graphene-based films that can filter dirty/salty water powered by the sun. Bacteria were used to produce a material consisting of two nanocellulose layers. The lower layer contains pristine cellulose, while the top layer contains cellulose and graphene oxide, which absorbs sunlight and produces heat. The system draws water from below into the material. The water diffuses into the higher layer, where it evaporates and leaves behind any contaminants. The evaporate condenses on top, where it can be captured. The film is produced by repeatedly adding a fluid coating that hardens. Bacteria produce nanocellulose fibers with interspersed graphene oxide flakes. The film is light and easily manufactured at scale.  Coating  Optically transparent, multilayer films made from graphene oxide are impermeable under dry conditions. Exposed to water (or water vapor), they allow passage of molecules below a certain size. The films consist of millions of randomly stacked flakes, leaving nano-sized capillaries between them. Closing these nanocapillaries using chemical reduction with hydroiodic acid creates ‚Äúreduced graphene oxide‚Äù (r-GO) films that are completely impermeable to gases, liquids or strong chemicals greater than 100 nanometers thick. Glassware or copper plates covered with such a graphene \\"paint‚Äù can be used as containers for corrosive acids. Graphene- coated plastic films could be used in medical packaging to improve shelf life. Related materials Dispersed graphene oxide flakes can also be sifted out of the dispersion (as in paper manufacture) and pressed to make an exceedingly strong graphene oxide paper. Graphene oxide has been used in DNA analysis applications. The large planar surface of graphene oxide allows simultaneous quenching of multiple DNA probes labeled with different dyes, providing the detection of multiple DNA targets in the same solution. Further advances in graphene oxide based DNA sensors could result in very inexpensive rapid DNA analysis. Recently a group of researchers, from university of L'Aquila (Italy), discovered new wetting properties of graphene oxide thermally reduced in ultra-high vacuum up to 900 ¬∞C. They found a correlation between the surface chemical composition, the surface free energy and its polar and dispersive components, giving a rationale to the wetting properties of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. Flexible rechargeable battery electrode Graphene oxide has been demonstrated as a flexible free-standing battery anode material for room temperature lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. It is also being studied as a high surface area conducting agent in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. The functional groups on graphene oxide can serve as sites for chemical modification and immobilization of active species. This approach allows for the creation of hybrid architectures for electrode materials. Recent examples of this have been implemented in lithium ion batteries, which are known for being rechargeable at the cost of low capacity limits. Graphene oxide-based composites functionalized with metal oxides and sulfides have been shown in recent research to induce enhanced battery performance. This has similarly been adapted into applications in supercapacitors, since the electronic properties of graphene oxide allow it to bypass some of the more prevalent restrictions of typical transition metal oxide electrodes. Research in this field is developing, with additional exploration into methods involving nitrogen doping and pH adjustment to improve capacitance. Additionally, research into reduced graphene oxide sheets, which display superior electronic properties akin to pure graphene, is currently being explored. Reduced graphene oxide applications greatly increases the conductivity and efficiency, while sacrificing some flexibility and structural integrity.  Graphene oxide lens  The optical lens has been playing a critical role in almost all areas of science and technology since its invention about 3000 years ago. With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology- driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down. Recently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, giant refractive index modification (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using direct laser writing (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement. As a result, a novel ultrathin planar lens on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method. The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200 nm), which is thinner than all current dielectric lenses (~ ¬µm scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300 nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6 ¬µm in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8 ¬µm, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320 nm at the minimum focal spot using 650 nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500 nm to as far as 2 ¬µm have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.  Energy conversion  Photocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide‚Äôs compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.  Hydrogen storage  Graphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.

The film was originally scheduled to be released in September 1930 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but was shelved. The March of Time would have been one of the many musicals partially filmed in two-color Technicolor. Production The unfinished film was originally titled Hollywood Revue of 1930, later \\"Just Kids\\", and was conceived by producer Harry Rapf as a follow-up to MGM's The Hollywood Revue of 1929, which he had also produced. The film was retitled The March of Time, as it was to consist of three sections which featured past performers from the stage and the vaudeville circuit, then-present-day performers, and up-and-coming performers. Production began in Fall 1929, but by October 1930 MGM had decided to shelve the project, as they considered it to be unmarketable since the audience interest for musicals or musical revues was dead. The first instance of footage from \\"The March of Time\\" hitting movie screens was the short subject \\"Crazy House\\", released February 7, 1931. Among the performers who filmed scenes for The March of Time were Joe Weber and Lew Fields of the Weber and Fields comedy team, Gus Edwards, Fay Templeton, Marie Dressler, Van and Schenck, DeWolf Hopper Sr., Buster Keaton, Albertina Rasch and her dancers, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Benny Rubin, Ramon Novarro performing \\"Long Ago in Alcala,\\" Bing Crosby performing \\"Poor Little G-String,\\"the Duncan Sisters performing \\"Graduation Day,\\" Barney Fagan performing a soft shoe routine, and Raquel Torres performing \\"The Story of An Old Spanish Clock\\". In order to salvage the $750,000 that had already been spent on the film, MGM announced plans to use the footage in a planned project starring Jimmy Durante that was to be released in 1932. That project was also abandoned. The footage from The March of Time later found its way into the musical shorts The Devil's Cabaret (1930), Crazy House (1930), Nertsery Rhymes (1933), Hello Pop! (1933) and Jail Birds of Paradise (1934). MGM's 1931 musical revue Wir schalten um auf Hollywood (We Tune In to Hollywood), produced for the German market, also featured many sequences from The March of Time. MGM considered foreign versions for the French and Spanish speaking markets as well but the box office failure of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 in France eliminated that possibility, although the German film played some South American markets as \\"Hollywood en Revista 1931\\". Broadway to Hollywood (1933) included the Technicolor finale of \\"The March of Time\\" as a sequence mid-film along with other sequences from \\"The March of Time\\" shown in black and white. Footage from the unfinished film also appears in That's Entertainment! III (1994). According to the book \\"The Dawn of Technicolor,\\" by James Layton and David Pierce, surviving Technicolor elements at Warner Bros. include \\"35mm nitrate Technicolor dye-transfer prints (multiple reels, including the \\"Long Ago in Alacala\\" and \\"March of Time Fantasie\\" numbers).\\" A color frame enlargement from the latter number is included in the book.

Vi maintains 10 continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) in six states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, and South Carolina. Founded in 1987 by Penny Pritzker, the privately held company houses over 4,000 residents and employs 2,700 workers as of May 2016. Vi Senior Living is a distinct business entity from Hyatt and Global Hyatt Corporation. History Vi Senior Living, formerly known as Classic Residence by Hyatt, was founded in 1987 by Penny Pritzker. The Pritzker family background in founding the Hyatt hotel chain and Marmon Group inspired Penny Pritzker's vision to bring high- end hospitality to senior living communities across the United States. The Chicago-based company acquired a few high-end independent living rental communities that contained assisted living units. In total, Classic Residence by Hyatt, since rebranded as Vi Senior Living, developed six original communities and acquired another four communities, each of which required additional development. Before Classic Residence by Hyatt rebranded to Vi Senior Living, the first Classic Residence rental communities were located in Monterey, California, Chevy Chase, Maryland, Teaneck, New Jersey, Dallas, Texas, Reno, Nevada, and Chicago, Illinois from 1989 to 1990. Growth and Development As Classic Residence made efforts to expand under Vi Senior Living, its first acquisition of Bentley Village, a continuing care retirement community in Naples, Florida, was completed in 1992. This location has since been renamed Vi at Bentley Village. In 1996, Vi purchased its first residential tower of La Jolla Village in San Diego, California. The same year, Vi at Lakeside Village in Lantana, Florida was acquired. The Lakeside Village community includes two restaurants and cafes, bar and ice cream shop, a beauty salon, fitness center, swimming pool, and hosts regular bus trips for residents. A big part of Classic Residence by Hyatt and Vi Senior Living's lifestyle is the variety of amenities offered to residents, which resemble continuing education in the form of field trips, group discussions, and classes. In the coming years, Vi continued the trend of developing and acquiring retirement communities. The company acquired TidePointe in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina out of bankruptcy in 1998. Vi at Grayhawk, one of two Vi communities in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in 1999. In 2002, Vi at The Glen in Glenview, a suburb of Chicago's North Shore opened its 1,000-acre master-planned community. Between 2003 and 2010, the following communities opened: Vi at Aventura in Aventura, Florida (2003), Vi at Palo Alto in Silicon Valley, California (2005), Vi at Highlands Ranch in Highlands Ranch, Colorado (2008), and Vi at Silverstone in Scottsdale, Arizona (2010). Classic Residence officially rebranded as Vi in June 2010 (pronounced ‚Äúvee‚Äù, derived from ‚Äúvida‚Äù, the Latin word for ‚Äúlife‚Äù). The continuing-care retirement communities were rebranded as Vi, while rental properties were renamed to ‚ÄúClassic Residence, a Vi Community.‚Äù In January 2012, Pritzker announced her resignation as Vi Senior Living chairwoman. As a result, Kevin Poorman, vice chairman of the company, was appointed to fill her role.

Moist foods are commonly preserved using canning and vacuum sealing to kill off any bacteria and molds, and to prevent further growth by removing oxygen. Dry-product containers are often preserved with heating and filling the empty container spaces with an inert nonreactive gas such as nitrogen. Once opened for consumption, the product is immediately exposed to atmospheric oxygen and floating dust particles containing bacteria and mold spores, and all protections from the preservation process are immediately lost. At room temperature, mold and bacteria growth resumes almost immediately, and warmer temperatures can lead to an explosion of growth that rapidly degrades the food product. This organism growth can result in the accumulation of poisonous bacterial substances in the food product such as botulin, that lead to food poisoning, sickness, or death. Cooling the food product to a temperature just above freezing in a refrigerator is generally required to slow the growth of these organisms. This cooling can permit foods to remain safely edible for up to two weeks after opening. Simply loosening the lid of a vacuum-packed food product to break the seal is enough to permit the bacteria and mold growth to resume. The amount of air inhaled into the container when the seal is broken is small, but sufficient to permit slow growth of contaminating and decomposing organisms. This seal is extremely important to the safe preservation of the food product. That is why most preserved screw-top food products use a domed metal cover that emits an audible popping sound as the container is opened. The dome is held down by the vacuum seal and will not make a popping sound when the cover is pressed on a properly sealed container.

A veneer hammer is a woodworking tool used in applying veneer. Drawing of a veneer hammer from The Cabinet Worker's Handybook (1907) Description A veneer hammer is used in conjunction with hot hide glue in applying veneer to a substrate. The term \\"veneer hammer\\" is somewhat misleading, as the \\"hammer\\" is used more like a squeegee than a hammer. The hot hide glue is applied to the substrate, then the veneer is laid onto the glued surface. The hammer itself has a dull blade, approximately three inches wide, on one side of the head, and a square shaped face on the other side. This head is connected to a standard handle, much like a regular hammer. The small square face is designed to push down on, exerting force to the blade side of the head. Workers often make their own veneer hammer, often having a wider \\"blade\\" than the commercially available ones. The blade can be made from metal or wood. The important factor is that the shape of the blade be somewhat tapered, permitting the required force to be applied directly under the blade.  Method  The veneer is pushed into the glue with the wide blade, and the hammer is pushed or pulled, forcing out the excess hide glue. The sheer bulk of the metal head helps to cool the glue, causing it to grab and hold the veneer in place. The glue cures as it cools. The procedure is to work from the center, out towards the edges, forcing the hot excess glue out from under the veneer. Often workers will apply the glue to the face of the veneer as well, using it as a lubricant for the hammer. By applying glue, therefore moisture, on both side of the veneer, the worker also avoid the curling of the veneer. This surface glue can be easily removed, using a cabinet scraper or cold water. In areas where a good bond is not achieved, the glue can be reheated with a common household iron, and reactivated. The veneer can be forced into the reactivated glue using the veneer hammer, and the area where the bond was poor, will become properly adhered to the substrate. Front view of a veneering hammer  History  The process is centuries old, possibly dating back to Egyptian times, as examples of veneered work have survived from that era. The veneer hammer and the method of applying the veneering has been described in early European books on veneering, such as L'Art du Menuisier (1769‚Äì1775) by Andr√© Jacob Roubo.

The film features many of MGM's stars of the time, including Frank Morgan, Alice Brady, May Robson, Madge Evans, Jimmy Durante, Mickey Rooney, and Jackie Cooper. Brothers Moe Howard and Curly Howard of The Three Stooges appear‚Äîwithout Ted Healy and without Larry Fine‚Äîalmost unrecognizably, as Otto and Fritz, two clowns in makeup. It was the first film to feature Nelson Eddy. Plot Ted and Lulu Hackett are vaudeville's The Hacketts, a fairly successful song-and-dance team. They bring their son Ted Jr. up in the business and he soon eclipses them. When the son is offered a starring role on Broadway, he arranges for his parents to join him in the show, but Ted Sr. is embarrassed to learn that he and Lulu are there purely in order to keep their son happy. They return to vaudeville, only to find that their duet act has gone stale with time. Meanwhile, Ted Jr. has married and had a son, but he has also fallen victim to drink. Tragedy strikes the Hackett family, and only the march of time will tell whether Ted III will repeat the failings of his father and grandfather.

He composed it in 1925‚Äì26, at about the same time as he wrote his tone poem Tapiola. Sibelius derived two suites from the score. The music is said to display an astounding richness of imagination and inventive capacity, and is considered by some as one of Sibelius's greatest achievements. He represented individual characters through instrumentation choices: particularly admired was his use of harps and percussion to represent Prospero, said to capture the \\"resonant ambiguity of the character\\".  History  Sibelius had completed his 7th Symphony, which was to be his last, in 1924. The Tempest and Tapiola were to be his last great works, and he wrote little else for the remaining 32 years of his life, which came to be known as \\"The Silence of J√§rvenp√§√§\\". The idea for music for The Tempest was first suggested to Sibelius in 1901, by his friend Axel Carpelan. In 1925, his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen again raised the idea, as the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen was going to stage the work the following year, directed by Adam Poulsen. Sibelius wrote it from the autumn of 1925 through to the early part of 1926, during which time he turned 60. The complete music lasts for over an hour. It originally consisted of 34 pieces, for vocalists, mixed-voice choir, harmonium and a large orchestra. It was first performed in Copenhagen on 15 March 1926. The first night attracted international attention but Sibelius was not present. Reviews noted that \\"Shakespeare and Sibelius, these two geniuses, have finally found one another\\", and praised in particular the part played by the music and stage sets. Only four days later Sibelius set off for an extended trip to work on new commissions in Rome. He did not hear the music for the first time until the autumn of 1927 when the Finnish National Theatre in Helsinki staged the work. For this performance, he composed an alternative Epilogue, bringing the number of items to 35. The Overture has been described as \\"the single most onomatopoetic stretch of music ever composed\\". Sibelius published the Overture as a separate piece, and arranged two suites from the music, comprising 19 pieces. These suites condensed and combined items from the stage music, sometimes in ways that obscure the drama. It is in the form of these suites that the music has been most frequently heard in the concert hall and on recordings. Various recordings do not stick to the formal suites but include other items. The complete Incidental Music was not recorded for the first time until 1992, by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Lahti Opera Chorus, and soloists under Osmo V√§nsk√§, as part of the complete recordings of all Sibelius's works.

It lies just above Jones Point, New York, within Bear Mountain State Park and the town of Stony Point in Rockland County, New York. Dunderberg (also historically Donderberg) is a Dutch word, meaning \\"thunder mountain,\\" so called by the early Dutch settlers because of the frequent thunderstorms in the vicinity. Geography The bulk of Dunderberg projects into the Hudson River, which describes an arc about its eastern side. Tidal marshes of the river, Snake Hole Creek and Iona Island, lie to the north. On the northwestern side is the abandoned hamlet of Doodletown. At Dunderberg's immediate southern slope is the Hudson River, while to the southwest are outlying neighborhoods of Tomkins Cove, a community or segment of Stony Point. The mountain as labeled on current U.S. Geological Survey maps and a widely used hiking map, extends about a mile and a half from its easternmost footing on the river at Jones Point. But several summits lying still farther to the west and southwest are evidently part of the Dunderberg formation, or massif, as described by at least some editions of an influential area hiking guidebook. These include Bald Mountain or Bockberg (1,130 feet (344 m)), as well as the Timp (984 feet (300m)), each of which are, however, separately named by the USGS. The Boulderberg, labeled as such on certain maps of historical interest, lies a short distance to the south of the Timp. As Dunderberg's crest runs inland latitudinally from the river, Timp Brook splits it into northerly and southerly ridges; Bald Mountain lies at the end of the northerly ridge, while the Timp terminates the southerly ridge about two-and a half miles southwest of Jones Point. Timp Brook emerges from a small swamp between the two ridges to flow down steeply to the north around Bald Mountain and thence to the northeast, into the valley known as Doodletown Clove between West Mountain and Dunderberg. Closely following the upper course of Timp Brook was once the main route into Doodletown from the southwest. A half-mile farther west, an old farm road, later used as a fire road and now a foot-path, also enters Doodletown valley, through a narrow gap known as Timp Pass between the Timp and West Mountain. However, since the late 19th century, the main road up the Hudson (now 9W) has circled around the base of Dunderberg near the river. History Revolutionary War Dunderberg was a landmark for British forces during the American Revolutionary War, as troops moved over a pass to the west of the mountain while marching to attack Forts Clinton and Montgomery in 1777. In a report to General William Howe several days after the Oct. 6, 1777 attack, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton wrote that at daybreak, 2,100 troops disembarked from vessels at Stony Point: > The Avant Garde of 500 Regulars & 400 Provincials ... began its March to > occupy the Pass of Thunder Hill; this Avant Garde after it had passed that > Mountain, was to proceed by a detour of seven Miles round the Hill [Bear > Mountain], and Debouch√©e in the Rear of Fort Montgomery, while General > Vaughan, with 1200 Men was to continue his March towards Fort Clinton ... > Major General Tryon with the Remainder, being the Rear Guard, to leave a > Battalion at the Pass of Thunder Hill to open our Communication with the > Fleet... Sir Henry's \\"Pass of Thunder Hill\\" apparently stood between what is now called Bald Mountain and the Timp, about a mile southwest of the westerly summit of Dunderberg. It lies about a half-mile east of what is now called Timp Pass. The modern 1777 Trail commemorates Sir Henry's route, and was built in 1974‚Äì75 as a joint project of the Rockland County Boy Scouts, the Palisades Interstate Park, the Rockland County Cooperative Extension and the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference. The route was determined by Jack Mead of the Trailside Museum at Bear Mountain from British military records and maps drawn by Major Robert Erskine, Surveyor General of the Continental Army.Cundell, Tony, The Capture of Forts Clinton and Montgomery and the 1777 Trail. Anthony Wayne, in his successful attack on Stony Point in 1779, used a route that entirely avoids the Dunderberg area, passing nearly two miles to the west of the Timp. A contemporary trail commemorates Wayne's route and is mapped by the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference.> Spiral Railway Corp. In 1889, the Dunderberg Spiral Railway Corporation formed with the goal of building a hotel at the top of Dunderberg. Tourists were to reach the hotel by means of a steam-powered railway. For the descent, the cars would be powered simply by gravity as the track wound its way back to the base of the mountain, like a roller coaster, affording scenic views of the Hudson and reaching speeds of up to . Directors of the Dunderberg corporation included Henry J. Mumford, who with his brother H.L. Mumford, operated the former Mauch Chunk Railroad of similar design as a successful and well-known tourist attraction during the 1870s in what is now Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. The Mauch Chunk Railroad, originally designed for a coal mine, became the inspiration for modern amusement park roller coasters.Sandy, Adam, Roller Coaster History, Ultimate Rollercoaster. Funding for the Dunderberg project ran out in 1891 and the system was never completed; the reasons for the failure remain unclear. One theory holds that the facility was planned as part of the Columbian Exposition of 1893. Verplanck's Point (south of Peekskill) is said to have been considered as a possible location during the planning stage of the Exposition, and it is possible that the funding for the hotel and the railway collapsed after Congress awarded the location to Chicago instead. Although the theory is persistent, no clear documentation has been found to support it. Today, ruins and some signs of the Spiral Railway construction are still visible. The graded areas can be accessed from the Ramapo-Dunderberg and the Timp-Torne trails, and became somewhat popular for walking following publication of William Howell's two volumes of hiking diaries called \\"The Hudson Highlands\\" in 1933 and 1934, and reprinted by \\"Walking News\\" in 1982.Brennan, Joseph, Diaries of William Thompson Howell, 1997 Edison Mine In 1890 Thomas Edison began to establish an iron mine by acquiring nearly on the north slope of Dunderberg and the base of Bald Mountain. Two years earlier, the inventor had created a method for using electromagnets to separate and refine iron ore. The remains of Edison's mine lie southeast of Doodletown Reservoir south of the abandoned \\"Old Turnpike,\\" between the Cornell Mine Trail and the Doodletown Bridle Path. A tailings pile is on the hillside. The land was eventually acquired by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission on December 31, 1938. Other abandoned iron mines in the immediate vicinity predate Edison's project, and include those on Bald Mountain and West Mountain. \\"Upper Level\\" 9W roadway construction A so-called upper level section of U.S. Route 9W blasted into the side of Dunderberg was opened to traffic in 1931. The lower section of highway had been constructed in 1911 as a roadway. The upper-level project was compared in the 1930s with Storm King Highway and the southeastern approach to Bear Mountain Bridge, two other mountainside highways along the Hudson built in the same era. For the new highway averaged an elevation above the river of between 200 and . The project was undertaken because it reportedly required less excavation and backfilling than that required to widen the lower roadway to four lanes.Scenic Delights at Bear Mountain, June 29, 1930. Funds for the project had been allocated by the state in 1924.Dickinson, Leon, North-South Route All Paved, September 27, 1931. Over a period of years the road was temporarily blocked by landslides on a number of occasions. With the opening of the upper level, the lower highway was to be widened to and carry only northbound traffic, while the upper level, also wide, would carry southbound traffic.New Highway Planned to Bear Mountain, April 22, 1928. Today the lower roadway appears on maps as a minor secondary road labeled \\"Old Route 9W.\\" More than a mile of this route is now called the Jones Point Greenway and is used solely for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.Trailways/Shared Use Paths and Greenway Systems, New York State Department of Transportation. The upper roadway is three lanes and additional blasting has evidently been completed in recent years. Cultural references *In \\"The Storm-Ship\\", Washington Irving portrayed the Dunderberg as home of a malevolent imp, calling up storms against unwary sailors on the Hudson River. \\"The captains of the river craft talk of a little bulbous-bottomed Dutch goblin, in trunk hose and sugar-loafed hat, with a speaking trumpet in his hand, which they say keeps about the Dunderberg.\\" *In the Irving story, skipper Ouselsticker, of Fishkill,‚Äîfor all he had a parson on board,‚Äîwas once beset by a heavy squall, and the goblin came out of the mist and sat astraddle of his bowsprit, seeming to guide his schooner straight toward the rocks. The dominie chanted the song of Saint Nicolaus, and the goblin, unable to endure either its spiritual potency or the worthy parson's singing, shot upward like a ball and rode off on the gale, carrying with him the nightcap of the parson's wife, which he hung on the weathercock of Esopus steeple, forty miles away.Skinner, Charles M., Myths and Legends of our Own Land, (1896), at sacred-texts.com Subsequent folklore apparently built on the Irving story suggests the goblin is imprisoned in Kingston's Old Dutch Church *The New York-built, Civil War-era ironclad was named after this peak.

Its G-number was (G-184).  History   Background  Although in the late 1930s the US Army lacked a clear mechanization policy, the success of the Blitzkrieg in 1939-40 highlighted the need of motorized vehicles for both tactical and strategic maneuver, which meant that towed artillery would need to move at a speed comparable to that of the armored fighting vehicles. To achieve this, a series of ‚Äúhigh speed tractors‚Äù was planned, which would tow the different artillery pieces existing (or planned) in the US Army inventory. The ‚Äúhigh‚Äù speed was considered in comparison with horse-drawn artillery rather than that obtainable with wheeled prime movers or ballast tractors. The models considered in the series included: 7 ton, 13 ton, 18 ton, and 38 ton.  Development   Description  Intended to tow heavy artillery pieces as the 240 mm howitzer M1 and the 8-inch Gun M1, the M6 artillery tractor was larger and heavier than the M4 Artillery Tractor, although they had a similar layout. The main differences between both were in the following areas: * Running Gear (6 running wheels in the M6, instead of 4 wheels in the M4) * Dimensions * Weight * Towing capacity * Engine It was powered by two six- cylinder, in-line, Waukesha 145GZ gasoline engines, each of which gave 190 HP at 2,100 rev/min, with an engine displacement of 13,400 cm¬≥. The running gear consisted on six rubber-rimmed wheels per side, with the drive wheel located at the front and a large tensioning wheel at the rear; a layout similar to the one used in the M3 light tank and later in the M4 Tractor.  Variants   Combat use   European front  The M6 tractor was used in the European theater only in the last months of World War II. In the meanwhile, the movement of large caliber artillery was done by the M1 Heavy Tractor, heavy trucks, or vehicles based on existing hulls, among them: * T16 Heavy tractor, based on the M3A5 tank. It did not pass prototype stage, as the rear engine location prevented even a minimum load of ammunition. * M33 Heavy tractor, based on the M31 recovery vehicle, which in turn was based on the medium tank M3. * M34 Heavy tractor, based on the M32B1 recovery vehicle, which in turn was based on the medium tank M4. * M35 Heavy tractor, based on the M10 tank destroyer  Pacific front  Use of this tractor in the Pacific theater seems to have been limited to training at Oahu, (Hawaii).  Post-war  In the Korean War no heavy artillery was used that required being towed by these tractors. Some vehicles were sold to Israel after being replaced by self- propelled artillery.

The Mahwah River runs on a meandering SSW course for about 11 mi (18 km) from its headwaters just north of the hamlet of Ladentown, New York to its mouth which empties into the Ramapo River in Mahwah, New Jersey, just south of the village of Suffern, New York, and the state line. Its course runs along the length of the Ramapo geologic fault on the eastern edge of Harriman State Park and below the face of the Ramapo Mountain escarpment. Numerous brooks and streams flowing out of the Ramapo Mountains to the west feed the river as it runs south. For most of its length the river's course is roughly paralleled by U.S. Route 202. Course Just south of its source at the foot of Lime Kiln Mountain, the Mahwah passes through the Ladentown Swamp, an extensive wetland area that is one of the last unspoiled aquifers in Rockland County, New York. As it runs south, the river's course is interrupted by numerous dams forming ponds and small lakes. At a number of points, it runs through woodlands and remains in its original natural condition. Approximately 4.5 mi (7.2 km) south of its source the river passes under Sky Meadow Lane and shortly thereafter enters a stretch where it is surrounded by Harriman State Park on both sides. Just south of this the river passes through Kakiat County Park and just beyond the park it passes under Route 202 from west to east. Farther south the river enters Antrim Lake and immediately thereafter it passes under the New York State Thruway, flows through Suffern, south across the state boundary and into the Ramapo River in the town of Mahwah. Wildlife species The Mahwah harbors a population of fish species, including brook trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, pickerel, catfish, bluegills, suckers, and chubbs. It also hosts waterfowl species, including wood duck in its northern reaches, mallards and Canada geese throughout its length. Muskrats, beavers and an occasional otter are seen plying its waters as well. Pileated woodpeckers, wild turkey, whitetailed deer, black bear and coyotes are common in the surrounding woodlands and mountains. Flooding In the Squires Gate section of Suffern there have been significant episodes of flooding during heavy rainfall. There is debate among local politicians and citizens over the best way to remediate the problem. Overdevelopment concerns Recent down-zoning ordinances pushed by local politicians, which allow for high density development in the vicinity of the river, have tripped off a firestorm of protest by local citizens and precipitated the creation of community action groups dedicated to protecting the Mahwah and its watershed against overdevelopment.Preserve Ramapo.

The purpose of the strike was to obtain bonus and increase in wages. Nearly 250,000 workers of 65 textile mills went on strike in Mumbai. History of mills in Bombay Built in 1887, Swadeshi was Bombay's first textile mill, the first of the factories that spread over many parts of the island city in the next decades. Rastriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh was the officially recognized union of the Mills. By 1982, a new militant union leader by the name of Datta Samant had arrived on the scene. Earlier he had got major wage increases for workers of Premier Automobiles and a section of the Mill workers were hoping for the same. The major difference between Premier Automobiles and the Mills was that the former was a very profitable company and the mills were all sick units. Later that year Dutta Samant led the textile strike, over 240,000 people worked in Girangaon. Protests In late 1981, Dutta Samant was chosen by a large group of Bombay mill workers to lead them in a precarious conflict between the Bombay Millowners Association and the unions, thus rejecting the INTUC-affiliated Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh which had represented the mill workers for decades. Samant planned a massive strike forcing the entire industry of the city to be shut down for over a year. It was estimated that nearly 250,000 workers went on strike and more than 50 textile mills were shut in Bombay permanently. Samant demanded that, along with wage hikes, the government scrap the Bombay Industrial Act of 1947 and that the RMMS would no longer be the only official union of the city industry. While fighting for greater pay and better conditions for the workers, Samant and his allies also sought to capitalize and establish their power on the trade union scene in Mumbai. Although Samant had links with the Congress and Maharashtra politician Abdul Rehman Antulay, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered him a serious political threat. Samant's control of the mill workers made the Congress leaders fear that his influence would spread to the port and dock workers and make him the most powerful union leader in India's commercial capital. Thus the government took a firm stance of rejecting Samant's demands and refusing to budge despite the severe economic losses suffered by the city and the industry. As the strike progressed through the months, Samant's militancy in the face of government obstinacy led to the failure of any attempts at negotiation. Disunity and dissatisfaction over the strike soon became apparent, and many textile mill owners began moving their plants outside the city. After a prolonged and destabilizing confrontation, the strike collapsed with no concessions having been obtained for the workers. The closure of textile mills across the city left tens of thousands of mill workers unemployed and, in the succeeding years, most of the industry moved away from Bombay after decades of being plagued by rising costs and union militancy. It is one reason why some industry in India settled in Gujarat Although Samant remained popular with a large block of union activists, his clout and control over Bombay trade unions disappeared. Consequences The majority of the over 80 mills in Central Mumbai closed during and after the strike, leaving more than 150,000 workers unemployed. The textile industry in Mumbai has largely disappeared, reducing labour migration after the strikes. One of the consequences of the strike's failure was that labour laws in the country were mellowed and 'liberalized' since unions lost their foothold. Until 1980s, labour laws were stringent to appease the unions. As labour market became less transparent and unified, exploitative placement agencies popped up in the city, so a large population moved to contractual employment, which lacked all the benefits of organised sector like provident funds or even job security. This job insecurity also pushed a lot of the youth, especially Maharashtrian youth into the arms of regional party Shiv Sena, so even if their parents had been communists, the children became Shiv Sainiks. The industries in Mumbai shut down and moved to the periphery or to other states as the land became real estate gold mine. Mumbai's functional nature changed from being industrial to commercial. Popular culture The city was remade by the Dutta Samant-led textile strike. Many Bollywood film directors started making politically relevant films on textile strikes in Bombay, and textile mill strikes have become an important theme of modern-day Indian films. Producer Sangeeta Ahir, who is also a co-founder of the NGO Shree Sankalp Pratisthan is making a film on the Great Bombay Textile Strike worker movement of the city. * Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai, a 1980 film directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza * City of Gold (2010 film) - directed by Mahesh Manjrekar * Bombay Velvet, a 2015 film by Anurag Kashyap See also *History of Mumbai *Growth of Mumbai References Further reading *Murder of Mills from Girgao Bachao Andaolan (26 April 2000) *Ripping the Fabric: The Decline of Mumbai and its Mills by Darryl D‚ÄôMonte.

Claudine Munari Mabondzo (born 1954\\"Munari Claudine\\", Congo Brazzaville: Les Hommes de Pouvoir n¬∞1, Africa Intelligence, 29 October 2002 .) is a Congolese politician. She was Director of the Cabinet of President Pascal Lissouba from 1992 to 1997. Although Munari fled into exile when Lissouba was ousted, she later returned to politics in Congo-Brazzaville; she was a Deputy in the National Assembly from 2002 to 2009 and was also the Second Secretary of the National Assembly from 2007 to 2009. From 2009 to 2015, she served in the government as Minister of Trade. Background and early career Munari was born in Pointe-Noire, Congo-Brazzaville's second city and main port. She obtained a degree in econometrics and worked at Citro√´n, an automobile manufacturer in France, from 1976 to 1981. Subsequently she returned to Congo and was the Administrative and Financial Director of CIATA, a French consultancy firm, from 1982 to 1991.Nancy France Loutoumba, \\"Qui est Claudine Munari ?\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 25 September 2009 . 1990s political career, exile, and 2001 corruption trial Munari met Pascal Lissouba at the 1991 Sovereign National Conference, and soon afterward Lissouba appointed her to a leading position in his newly created political party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), as Assistant for Finance and Material. After Lissouba won the August 1992 presidential election, he appointed her as Director of the Cabinet of the President. In that post, Munari held the rank of Minister.Paul Soni-Benga, La guerre inachev√©e du Congo-Brazzaville (2001), L'Harmattan, page 84 . She additionally became the Mayor of Mouyondzi in 1996. An advocate for women, Munari promoted the cause of increasing women's participation in the decision- making of society,Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Assembl√©e nationale : passation de service entre Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou et Claudine Munari\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 December 2009 . and she founded the Femme 2000 association, a non-governmental organization working for improvement of the socioeconomic status of women, on 24 March 1993.Lydie Gis√®le Oko, \\"L'association Femme 2000 fait don de vivres √† des personnes vuln√©rables\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 30 December 2008 . Munari remained in her post as Director of the President's Cabinet for five years. When Lissouba was ousted at the end of the June- October 1997 civil war, Munari--like Lissouba--went into exile, living in France. She was included in the Patriotic Front for Dialogue and National Reconciliation (FPDRN), a moderate exile group created in France in October 2000; the group favored peace and reconciliation, choosing not to challenge the legitimacy of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who had toppled Lissouba.Ousmane Sow, \\"Des exil√©s press√©s de rentrer au pays\\", Jeune Afrique, 14 November 2000 . Munari returned to Congo-Brazzaville as part of a FPDRN delegation to participate in the March-April 2001 inclusive national dialogue.Jean-Dominique Geslin, \\"Retrouvailles √† Brazza\\", Jeune Afrique, 24 April 2001 . Munari testified at the trial of Lissouba and some of his ministers in absentia in December 2001. At the trial, it was said that the 150 million dollars paid by Occidental Petroleum as part of an allegedly corrupt 1993 oil deal with Lissouba's government was paid into Munari's personal bank account. According to Munari, the money was used to cover costs associated with the 1993 parliamentary election and to pay salary arrears to civil servants.Paul Michaud, \\"First Congo leader to be convicted of treason\\", Dawn.com, 10 January 2002. Munari herself also initially faced charges during the trial, but they were dismissed on 27 December 2001 on the grounds that she had merely followed Lissouba's orders.\\"Congolese ex-leader guilty of treason\\", BBC News, 29 December 2001.

In the National Assembly, Munari focused on cooperation with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Network of Female Parliamentarians of Africa. Munari also founded a political party, the Movement for Unity, Solidarity, and Work (MUST), and serves as its President. Munari supported Sassou Nguesso's candidacy in the July 2009 presidential election. When the National Initiative for Peace (INP)--an organization designed to support Sassou Nguesso's re-election bid while emphasizing the importance of peace--was launched on 28 February 2009, Munari was included on the INP's 91-member National Coordination.Thierry Noungou, \\"Plusieurs personnalit√©s proches du pr√©sident Denis Sassou Nguesso s'organisent autour du concept de paix\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 March 2009 .

She met with Jeanne Dambendzet, her predecessor as Minister of Trade, on 24 September to discuss issues facing the ministry, including Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union and internal trade issues, such as rising food prices. Munari said that she would continue to consult with Dambendzet when needed.Nancy France Loutoumba, \\"La nouvelle ministre du Commerce consciente de la charge du d√©partement qui lui a √©t√© confi√©\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 24 September 2009 . Having been appointed to the government, it was necessary for Munari to leave the National Assembly. On 22 December 2009, Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou officially succeeded her as Second Secretary of the National Assembly. On that occasion, Munari stressed to Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou the importance of continuing to work with the IPU and the Network of Female Parliamentarians of Africa. She joked that she was \\"not asking [him] to wear a skirt\\" but expressed confidence that the network would listen to him. In the July-August 2012 parliamentary election, she was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate in Mouyondzi constituency. She won the seat in the second round of voting, receiving 60.02% of the vote.\\"R√©sultats du deuxi√®me tour des √©lections l√©gislatives\\" , La Semaine Africaine, 11 August 2012 . Munari came out in opposition to changing the constitution to allow Sassou Nguesso to run for another term and participated in an opposition dialogue, which was held to express objections to constitutional change, in July 2015. Apparently as a consequence, she was dismissed from the government on 10 August 2015.\\"Remaniement au Congo-Brazzaville : deux ministres oppos√©s √† la modification constitutionnelle exclus\\", Jeune Afrique, 11 August 2015 .

It is owned and maintained by the Table Mountain National Parks Board, along with the City Parks Department of Cape Town, and includes a Fire Station, Nursery and Reservoir. The forest itself is a popular walking and jogging destination (See trail map below), close and easily accessible from the city's southern suburbs. Due to its location on the mountain slopes, there are impressive views eastward over the Cape Flats. Fauna and Flora Newlands Forest lies at a natural transition zone between endangered Granite Fynbos and Peninsula Shale Fynbos, in an area that also originally supported large indigenous forests. In the late 1800s, much of the indigenous forests were felled, and the fynbos cleared, to make way for commercial pine plantations, which still remain and account for the remainder of the land. Peninsula Granite Fynbos This is an endangered vegetation type, which can still be found on the southern edges of Newlands Forest. This ecosystem is endemic to the city of Cape Town and occurs nowhere else in the world. Existing only on the Cape Granite Formation, it naturally assumes the form of medium-dense tree vegetation, dominated by a variety of Protea and daisy species. The striking and iconic Silvertree grows in this vegetation type and a small population of these massive proteas can still be seen at Newlands forest. Historically this ecosystem supported a great many wild animals and there are at least 9 plant species which occur nowhere else in the world. This vegetation is severely threatened, mainly by invasive alien plants. A total of 13 of this ecosystem's plant species are classed as endangered, two of them critically. One local species, the Wynberg Conebush, is now extinct. * Leucadendron grandiflorum (The Wynberg Conebush, a tall protea that is now extinct) * Hermannia micrantha (Small-flowered Dolls Rose, a flowering shrub) * Gnidia parvula (Small-flowered Saffron Bush, a low shrub) * Cliffortia carinata (Crown Climbers Friend) * Polycarena silenoides (Granite Cape Flax, a small herb) * Erepsia patula (The Spreading Ever-fig, a succulent shrub) * Lampranthus curvifolius (Bakoven Brightfig, succulent) * Aristea pauciflora (The Unistem Aristea, a geophytic herb) * Willdenowia affinis (The Table Mountain Window Reed, a graminoid) File:Newlands Forest - Endangered Granite Fynbos and Silvertree with Pine plantation in background.JPG File:Fynbos enclave surrounded by Pine plantations - Newlands Forest Cape Town 7.jpg File:Fynbos enclave in Newlands Forest Cape Town 2.jpg File:Leucadendron argenteum young Silvertree - Newlands Forest Fynbos CapeTown 2.jpg Peninsula Shale Fynbos This is actually a type of Cape Winelands Shale Fynbos, which is mainly found far to the east of Cape Town in the \\"Boland\\" region. The patch that occurs around Newlands Forest is a natural outlier, isolated in the middle of Cape Town. The soils are naturally poor and slightly acidic but the biodiversity is incredibly rich. The vegetation consists of a diverse array of Protea, Erica, geophyte and daisy species, as well as some endemic species. In the moister areas, the Ericas predominate over the other plant groups. Along with the Granite Fynbos, this is by far the most diverse and richest in species of the ecosystems at Newlands Forest. As it typically grows on lower mountain slopes, which tend to be developed for housing or cultivated for farming, this vegetation is incredibly vulnerable. A total of 23 of this ecosystem's plant species are officially threatened, 7 of which are classified as endangered. File:Peninsula Shale Fynbos - DevilsPeak Cape Town.jpg File:Fynbos at Newlands Forest Erica flower 5.JPG File:Fynbos on peninsula shale - Newlands Forest CT.jpg File:Podalyria calyptrata - Waterblossompea Tree - Cape Town.jpg Indigenous Afrotemperate Forest Newlands Forest lies in an area that used to naturally support large, dense, shady indigenous forests. Such forests proliferated on the Cape Peninsula in areas that were partially or totally protected from seasonal fires. Wherever fires are naturally more frequent, the forests give way to various types of fynbos. However, the streams and kloofs of Newlands ensure that fires are relatively infrequent here. Several patches of indigenous forest survive at Newlands, mostly higher up the mountainside where historically they were safer from logging. Mature examples of this forest are dominated by several species of massive tree which compose the tallest canopy; smaller trees which form lower layers of foliage; and a variety of ferns, herbs, bushes, bulbs, vines and lianas (e.g. Asparagus scandens, Rhoicissus tomentosa). Though not as rich in biodiversity as the various types of Cape Fynbos, these woodlands still contain a wide variety of plants and animals, some of which occur nowhere else in the world. The Newlands Forest Nursery is engaged in a project to grow indigenous trees and plant them out, with the aim of eventually rehabilitating the original forests. The major threats come from invasive alien plants such as Australian Cheesewood, Bugweed, Black Wattle, Lantana, Privet and Pine trees. Indigenous afrotemperate forests such as those at Newlands have a significant socio- economic value, due to their use for recreation such as hiking, their role in preserving the Western Cape's water supply, and their natural production of an enormous range of medicinal plants.Campbell, B.M. & Moll, E.J. 1976.

Over many decades, large swaths of the Cape Peninsula were cleared of their indigenous vegetation types to make way for commercial logging, and these two species were imported and cultivated en masse to supply the Cape timber industry. These species were chosen for their fast growth, the quality of their wood and their straight uniform growth which made them easy to harvest. However, they rapidly spread and became invasive. When the logging was eventually stopped, the final crop of trees was allowed to remain un- harvested, and today forms an important recreational area for the inhabitants of the surrounding suburbs. Both the pines and the eucalyptus(\\"gum\\") trees are Category 2 invasive weeds. They rapidly seed into the surrounding indigenous forests and fynbos, then gradually outgrow and kill these ecosystems. Consequently, on-going maintenance is necessary, to keep these invasive trees contained within the plantations.Tackling invasive aliens  Cape Town Green Maphttp://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/invasives/Assignment1/Binns.pdf In addition, the leaf-litter of pines and gums changes the pH of the surrounding soil, poisoning other plant life. The trees may have evolved this feature to kill competing plants, and it is so effective that pine or gum forests in southern Africa eventually turn into monocultures or \\"green deserts\\".CIB DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology Consequently, there is also a policy in place to regularly \\"thin\\" the remaining plantations, in order that some other species can survive in between the pines.http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/library/2006/tokai_cecilia/annexC.pdf File:Pine trees planted for timber at Newlands Forest Cape Town 3.JPG File:Pine Plantations at Newlands Forest - Cape Town 9.JPG File:Pine Plantations at Newlands Forest - Cape Town 8.JPG File:Commercial Gum plantations at Newlands Forest Cape Town 7.JPG History The original inhabitants of the area were the Khoi-khoi, who migrated and herded their cattle over much of what is now the city of Cape Town. Jan van Riebeeck (the first Dutch governor of the Cape Colony) came across the extensive indigenous forests on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain and called them collectively \\"Boschenheuwel\\". Due to the need for timber, the local afro-temperate forests were, by the late seventeenth century, being severely over-exploited, and the colonial government issued a series of (largely ineffectual) laws to protect the forests. By the close of the eighteenth century most were gone, excepting a few pockets on the steep upper slopes of the mountain.Immelman, Wicht and Ackerman. 1973. Our Green Heritage. The South African Book of Trees. Tafelberg, Cape Town. As indigenous wood supplies declined, the authorities decided to clear the eastern slopes of Table Mountain for commercial plantations. Fast-growing tree species such as Eucalyptus and Pinus radiata were chosen, and imported for cultivation. These trees also had the advantage of being tall, uniform and straight ‚Äì all the more suitable for efficient logging.Zahn, G A & Neethling B A. 1926. Notes on the Exotic trees in the Cape Peninsula. South African Journal of Science. Vol 26:211‚Äì234. The two World Wars each caused a boom in the timber industry and the size of the forests grew. After the subsequent decline in Cape Town's logging industry, some of the plantations were removed to allow for the return of the original natural vegetation. In other places such as Newlands Forest, the final crop was allowed to remain, unharvested, and the area recently took on a new function as a recreational area.Campbell, B M & Moll, E J. 1977.

The Fire Station also serves as the Headquarters of the growing Volunteer Wildfire Services (VWS) fire fighting group. http://www.capefires.co.za The City Parks Nursery (see Map Image) is maintained and ran to supply the public areas of Cape Town with a wide range of flora. Including four large green houses and a large expanse of growing land, the City Parks team grow a wide range of plants to be used in the centre islands of Cape Town's highways and public service areas. It has also recently begun a project to grow and reintroduce indigenous species of tree to Newlands Forest, with the long-term aim of rehabilitating the original afro-temperate forests. The Newlands Reservoir (see Map Image) was built in the 60's by the then Afrikaans Government. A tribute to South African engineering and construction of the time, it serves as the main potable water source of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town. Water is stored, treated and distributed from this site. Also included in the conservancy land are a number of Council Houses owned by the City Parks Board. Of the eight houses, one is particularly well known for its classical design and scenic location. The original building, constructed in 1965, underwent minor alterations between 2000‚Äì2003. However a large part of the original building was maintained. The home, affectionately known by residents as \\"The Reservoir\\", has been home to a few well known Cape Town residents since it was built. Perhaps the best known resident being Father Kevin Robarts, a popular figure well known in the Newlands Parish. Since Father Robarts' passing in late 2007, the house has been maintained by his remaining family. In 2010, Father Pearce took over from the Father Robarts officially. Father Pearce has long been known in the region for accompanying his sermons with his guitar playing. On 1 January 2010, to mark the occasion of being appointed as the parish leader officially, Father Pearce is said to have walked the entire length and breadth of the forest, blessing it as he went.The People of Cape Town: A Concise History, Sandra Hansen(2008) The People of Cape Town: A Concise History, 2nd Edition, Sandra Hansen(2011)  References  Further reading * Von Maltitz, G., Mucina, L., Geldenhuys, C.J., Lawes, M., Eeley, H., Adie, H., Vink, D., Fleming, G. & Bailey, C. 2003.

She was also a senior Republic of Ireland international. Curtis, a prolific goalscorer, played mainly as a forward, but also spent time playing as a midfielder. Club career Curtis began her footballing career playing for South Bristol Wanderers as a teenager before joining Bristol Rovers Women in 1999. The club (which is now known as Bristol City W.F.C. and not to be confused with an entirely new Bristol Rovers W.F.C. which has been founded since then) was still in its infancy at this point, having been launched just a year earlier, and was playing in the South West Combination Women's Football League. She quickly established herself as a prolific goalscorer and by 2004, still aged only 19, had established herself as one of the top scorers in English women's football. As well as a talent for finding the back of the net Curtis showed remarkable adaptability, moving into midfield later in her career and providing cover in other positions, even playing as an emergency goalkeeper on one occasion. Bristol Rovers Women had changed their name to Bristol Academy in 2005 due to the Bristol Rovers men's club no longer being able to cover their running costs and the Bristol Academy of Sport stepping in to fund them, but financial problems were never far away and by the summer of 2009 the need to cut costs led to the departure of Manager Gary Green and several leading players. Corinne Yorston left for Arsenal, Gwennan Harries for Everton, and Curtis for Chelsea after having spent a decade at her home town club. She made an immediate impact with her new team, even scoring a hat-trick against her former club in Chelsea's fourth game of the season. In December 2010, after spending a year with the Blues, Curtis was named as a member of Birmingham City's squad for the brand new FA WSL, which replaced the Women's Premier League as the top level of Women's football in England in 2011. After a campaign disrupted by injury, during which she made just four league appearances, her return to Bristol Academy was announced in March 2012, however she failed to make any further appearances after returning to Bristol. International career Curtis played international football for the Republic of Ireland women's national football team. In October 2009 she suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury during a 2011 Women's World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan. References External links *Stef Curtis at the UEFA website.

History The Warmian village of Schmoleinen was founded in 1290 near Guttstadt (Dobre Miasto) and Allenstein (Olsztyn) by Ermland (Warmia) Bishop Heinrich Fleming. From 1350 it served as the summer residence of the prince-bishops of Warmia. It was destroyed by war in 1414, 1454, 1519‚Äì21 and 1709 and was rebuilt each time. In 1945, after the collapse of Nazi Germany, Warmia and Schmoleinen were taken over by the Soviet Union, then transferred to Poland as part of the Recovered Territories. Smolajny has since remained part of Poland. In 1975‚Äì98 Smolajny belonged administratively to Olsztyn Voivodeship.

She was the daughter of Swabian, Henry I, Count of Berg (d. 1116) and his wife Adelheid of Mochental (d. 1127), a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold II of Vohburg. Adelheid's elder brother, Margrave Diepold III, was a loyal follower of Emperor Henry V; his daughter Adelaide married the Hohenstaufen duke (and later Emperor) Frederick Barbarossa in 1147. Richinza was named after her maternal great-grandmother Richwara, wife of Duke Berthold I of Z√§hringen. About 1110/1111 Richeza married Vladislav, who ruled the Duchy of Bohemia since 1109; her sister Sophia married another P≈ôemyslid prince, Otto II the Black, in 1114.

Initially one example was ordered in 1904 from Freudenstein & Co. in Berlin. This tank engine weighed only 9.4 t when empty and could carry 1.2 m¬≥ of water and 0.35 tonnes of coal. It had a well tank and the coal bunkers were on the left and right hand side of the boiler. The engine drove the second axle and the locomotive had the number 3. In 1910 a somewhat heavier and larger locomotive was ordered from Hanomag. It weighed in at 12.2 tonnes (service weight). Because this engine acquitted itself well, in 1913 another one was ordered. These two locomotives were given numbers 4 and 5. After the formation of the Reichsbahn the engines were taken over, classified as DRG Class 99.02 and given the numbers 99 021‚Äì023. In 1942 locomotives 99 021 and 99 022 had to be handed over for wartime duties at the Eastern front where they disappeared without trace. Number 99 023 remained on Wangerooge and underwent a minor rebuild. It was given larger water tanks, wooden window shutters and an electrically operated lantern. It was retired in 1957.

The station was rebuilt between 1953 and 1955 upon plans designed by to replace a prewar structure destroyed by Allied air raids in early 1945, when the Upper Carniola region was occupied by German Wehrmacht forces. Architecturally, the new building is unusually distinctive for a train station in the area, being a stark modernist box faced in white marble and featuring hexagonal windows.

Migration African Americans, who are largely descended from Africans of the American Colonial Era, have lived and worked in France since the 1800s. Unofficial figures indicate that up to 50,000 free blacks emigrated to Paris from Louisiana in the decades after Napoleon sold the territory to the United States in 1803. Paris saw the beginnings of an African-American community in the aftermath of World War I when about 200,000 were brought over to fight. Nine tenths of the soldiers were from the American South. Many black GIs decided to stay in France after having been well received by the French, and others followed them. France was viewed by many African Americans as a welcome change from the widespread racism in the United States. It was then that jazz was introduced to the French, and black culture was born in Paris. African American musicians, artists and Harlem Renaissance writers found 1920s Paris ready to embrace them with open arms. Montmartre became the center of the small community, with jazz clubs such as Le Grand Duc, Chez Florence and Bricktop's thriving in Paris. World War II brought all of the fanfare to an abrupt halt. The Nazi German invasion of Paris in June 1940 meant the suppression of the \\"corrupt\\" influence of jazz in the French capital and the danger of imprisonment for African Americans choosing to remain in the city. Most Americans, black as well as white, left Paris at the time. The political upheavals surrounding the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War protests in the United States were mirrored by civil unrest in France. The African-American journalist William Gardner Smith was a novelist (Last of the Conquerors) who also worked for Agence France-Presse. That French news service reported the events of the student uprising during the May 1968 protests. Many blacks supported the movement, which escalated into a virtual shutdown of the entire country. Once order was restored, however, a notable increase in repressive tendencies was observed in the French police and the immigration authorities. Following World War II, the arrival of black immigrants from former French colonies had offered African Americans in France the chance to experience new forms of black culture. Interpretation Tyler Stovall, a history professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has said: > In many ways, African Americans came to France as a sort of privileged > minority, a kind of model minority, if you will‚Äîa group that benefited not > only from French fascination with blackness, but a French fascination about > Americanness.

R. Williams. Distributed by Newspaper Enterprise Association, the cartoon series was noted for its depiction of American rural life and the various activities and regular routines of families in small towns.University of Wyoming, American Heritage Center: Rural Images Virtual Exhibit The panel introduced a cast of continuing characters, including the cowboy Curly and ranch bookkeeper Wes. Out Our Way ran from 1922 to 1977, at its peak appearing in more than 700 newspapers.  Publication history  Out Our Way first appeared in a half-dozen small-market newspapers on March 20, 1922.Lambiek Comiclopedia Williams used Out Our Way as an umbrella title for several alternating series, including The Bull of the Woods, Why Mothers Get Gray, Born Thirty Years Too Soon, The Worrywarts and Heroes Are Made - Not Born. The success of the daily panel prompted a Sunday feature, but it was not a grouping of panels, as in the Sunday Grin and Bear It. Instead, the characters of Why Mothers Get Gray were expanded into a Sunday strip, Out Our Way with the Willits (aka The Willets). Williams' assistants on the Sunday strip were Neg Cochran and George Scarbo (whose own strip The Comic Zoo sometimes ran next to The Willets as a Sunday sidebar feature). In 1957, Williams died at age 69. Out Our Way was continued by Neg Cochran, Walt Wetterberg, Paul Gringle, and Ed Sullivan until 1977.Strickler, Dave. Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index. Cambria, CA: Comics Access, 1995. Characters and story The content of Out Our Way was based on Williams' own life experiences, as noted by Michael H. Price in the Fort Worth Business Press: Rotating themes J. R. Williams' Out Our Way (November 6, 1940) Williams used Out Our Way as an umbrella title for several alternating series, which carried the subtitle hand-lettered within the panel border. These included The Bull of the Woods, with gags focusing on the foreman of a machine shop, and a depiction of small town family life in Why Mothers Get Gray. Don Markstein, in describing Williams' settings and themes, lists the other subtitles: Toppers Starting February 27, 1927, a topper, or subsidiary strip, appeared over the Sunday page: Wash Tubbs, a gag comic strip by Roy Crane. The regular Wash Tubbs feature began as a gag-a-day strip in 1924 but quickly evolved into an action-adventure strip; the topper over Out Our Way was a return to the original concept. The topper shifted focus to become A Wash Tubbs Game from September 4, 1932 to January 29, 1933. After this, the comic strip returned for a few weeks, and then became Wash Tubbs Comical Jigsaw Puzzle from March 19 to May 7, 1933. The topper was then renamed Goofy-Ginks, and ran until September 24, 1933. Reprints Williams' strips and cartoons were collected in several books. The Worry Wart had his own comic book in 1956. Leonard G. Lee's Algrove Publishing reprinted Williams' work in more than a dozen volumes of its Classic Reprint Series. In addition to Out Our Way Sampler: 20s, 30s & 40s (2005), their catalog includes U.S. Cavalry Cartoons, The Bull of the Woods (six volumes) and Classic Cowboy Cartoons (four volumes).Algrove Publishing: J.

SOVA is located within the traditional territory of the Tr'ond√´k Hw√´ch'in First Nation in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada. SOVA offers a Foundation Year Program, which is the equivalent of the first year of a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree. The school offers an experimental, integrated curriculum that is studio-based with liberal arts courses. Successful students continue their degrees at their choice of four partnering art schools across Canada, including the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto, the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver, the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University in Halifax. YSOVA is a partnership between the Dawson City Arts Society, Yukon University and Tr'ondek Hwech'in. Each founding organisation has equal representation on the governing council. Yukon School of Visual Arts changed its name from KIAC School of Visual Arts in the Fall of 2010 to avoid confusion between the school and the community arts organisation KIAC. Location Tombstone Mountains in March YSOVA is located in Dawson City, an extremely remote location with a rich history. Home to the Han people for millennia, at the turn of the 20th Century Dawson City became the centre of the Klondike Goldrush and was suddenly the largest city north of San Francisco and west of Winnipeg at the time. Today, the town is home to many national historic sites, a self-governing First Nation, an active mining industry, and a diverse international community. During the summer months, tourism reaches a peak of 60,000 annual visitors, providing a major source of revenue for the town. The border of Alaska is only a few kilometres away to the west, and the Tombstone Mountains are only 45 minutes north along the Dempster Highway en route to the Beaufort Sea. Curriculum Video conferencing with Toronto The curriculum includes studio classes in 2D, 3D, and 4D (new media), as well as liberal arts classes in English and Visual Culture Studies. The design of the curriculum and the intimacy of the school creates an integrated curriculum with themes and issues crossing over from course to course. Facilities The school is located in a historic building in downtown Dawson City. This two-story structure was custom designed specifically for the needs of the foundation year program with studio facilities, a lecture room, a media lab, indoor/outdoor common areas, woodshop, a library and digital resource centre, a student gallery and an art supplies store. Laptop computers and a digital still camera are assigned to each student for use in both their academic and studio coursework, and wireless internet is available throughout the facility. KIAC & YSOVA The Klondike Institute for Arts and Culture (KIAC) is a community-based arts centre offering a rotating schedule of workshops, screenings, festivals, exhibitions, and non-accredited courses. YSOVA is a post-secondary institution offering accredited courses and articulation agreements with colleges and universities across Canada. Closely associated, but different organisations, YSOVA and KIAC mutually support resident artists, special events, and facilities. KIAC is located on 2nd and Princess in the ODD Fellows Hall. YSOVA is located on 3rd and Queen. Over The Wire Over the Wire is a project series that creates an exchange between an established artist and the Yukon School of Visual Arts. Celebrating the extreme remoteness of the school, the project mediates the geographical distance by fostering a correspondence‚Äîboth literally and aesthetically‚Äîbetween the artist and the students. Each semester, a set of instructions created by a distant Artist is delivered to the students in order to produce a new work. The students in turn interpret the instructions and create the work locally for exhibition. In addition to the exhibition of the work, each project is archived by a publication or multiple that is distributed in return across the country.

Although popular in Italy, she had a particularly devoted fanbase throughout South America. A light lyric soprano with a pure and agile voice, Ferraris sang a wide repertoire that encompassed the verismo operas of Puccini, the Italian grand opera of Verdi, and the German operas of Richard Strauss. She is particularly remembered for portraying the role of Lisette in the world premi√®re of Puccini's La rondine in 1917.J.B. Steane: \\"Ina Maria Ferraris\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed November 17, 2008), (subscription access) Career Ferraris was a child prodigy and began her career as a professional concert pianist at the young age of 12 after studying piano with Antonio Quartero. She later became interested in opera and began studying singing with Vittorio Vanzo in Milan. She gave her first professional performance as a vocalist in a concert in London in 1906. She made her professional operatic d√©but two years later in Bologna as Philine in Mignon. In 1911 Ferraris debuted at La Scala as Carolina in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto. That same year she sang Sophie at La Scala in Italy's first production of Der Rosenkavalier, a role she later reprised at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in 1914.Ines Maria Ferraris biography from Operissimo.com (In German) She remained at La Scala for over 20 years, singing numerous roles mostly from the lighter lyric and soubrette repertoire. She became a favorite of Arturo Toscanini under whom she sang numerous parts at La Scala including Violetta in Verdi's La traviata and Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff. She was also a close friend of Conchita Supervia, with whom she performed many roles, including the role of Gretel opposite Supervia's H√§nsel in H√§nsel und Gretel. During this time she also frequently performed throughout Italy and in South America where she gained a big following. She notably sang the title role in South America's premiere of Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's Il segreto di Susanna at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Her other roles in that house include Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, the title role in Catalani's La Wally, and H√©l√®ne in Une √©ducation manqu√©e among others. In 1916 Ferraris sang the role of Violetta at the Teatro Massimo Palermo. The following year she created the role of Lisette in the world premi√®re of Puccini's La rondine at the Op√©ra de Monte- Carlo. She also made several appearances at the Teatro di San Carlo in 1920-1921 and 1924, including the role of Gilda in Rigoletto. Ferraris retired from the stage in 1934, after which she taught singing for many years at numerous conservatories including the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello in Venice, the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna, the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, and lastly at the Milan Conservatory. Her remains are at the Riparto 202 of the Cimitero Maggiore di Milano, inside the niche number 96. Recordings Ferraris was among the first generation of musicians to be recorded. Most notably she can be heard on highlight recordings of Der Rosenkavalier as Sophie and Hansel and Gretel as Gretel with Conchita Supervia, mementos of their association in both operas at La Scala. She also recorded the role of Gilda in the first complete recording of Rigoletto in 1916 with Cesare Formichi in the title role.

BSM is established by two complementary process cycles each grouping a number of activities. The first cycle is the semantic reconciliation cycle, and the second cycle is the semantic application cycle. The two cycles are tied together by the unification process. This double process cycle is iteratively applied until an optimal balance of differences and commonalities between stakeholders are reached that meets the semantic integration requirements. This approach is based on research on community-based ontology engineering () that is validated in European projects, government and industry. Semantic reconciliation Semantic reconciliation is a process cycle constituted of four subsequent activities: scope, create, refine, and articulate. First, the community is scoped: user roles and affordances are appointed. Next, relevant facts are collected from documentation such as, e.g., natural language descriptions, (legacy) logical schemas, or other metadata and consequently decomposing this scope in elicitation contexts. The deliverable of scoping is an initial upper common ontology that organizes the key upper common patterns that are shared and accepted by the community. These upper common patterns define the current semantic interoperability requirements of the community. Once the community is scoped, all stakeholders syntactically refine and semantically articulate these upper common patterns. Unification During unification, a new proposal for the next version of the upper common ontology is produced, aligning relevant parts from the common and divergent stakeholder perspectives. If the semantic reconciliation results in a number of reusable language-neutral and context-independent patterns for constructing business semantics that are articulated with informal meaning descriptions, then the unification is worthwhile. Semantic application Semantic application is a process cycle constituted of two subsequent activities: select and commit where the scoped information systems are committed to selected consolidated business semantic patterns. This is done by first selecting relevant patterns from the pattern base. Next, the interpretation of this selection is semantically constrained. Finally, the various scoped sources and services are mapped on (read: committed to) this selection. The selection and axiomatization of this selection should approximate the intended business semantics. This can be verified by automatically verbalization into natural language, and validation of the unlocked data. Validation or deprecation of the commitments may result in another iteration of the semantic reconciliation cycle. Business semantics Business semantics are the information concepts that live in the organization, understandable for both business and IT. Business semantics describe the business concepts as they are used and needed by the business instead of describing the information from a technical point of view. One important aspect of business semantics is that they are shared between many disparate data sources. Many data sources share the same semantics but have different syntax, or format to describe the same concepts. The way these business semantics are described is less important. Several approaches can be used such as Unified Modeling Language or object-role modeling. This corresponds to Robert Meersman‚Äôs statement that semantics are \\"a (set of) mapping(s) from your representation language to agreed concepts (objects, relationships, behavior) in the real-world\\". In the construction of information systems, semantics have always been crucial, also a concept known as Double articulation. In previous approaches, these semantics were left implicit (i.e. In the mind of reader or writer), hidden away in the implementation itself (e.g., in a database table or column code) or informally captured in textual documentation. According to Dave McComb, \\"The scale and scope of our systems and the amount of information we now have to deal with are straining that model.\\" Nowadays, information systems need to interact in a more open manner, and it becomes crucial to formally represent and apply the semantics these systems are concerned with. Application Business semantics management empowers all stakeholders in the organization by a consistent and aligned definition of the important information assets of the organization. The available business semantics can be leveraged in the so-called business/social layer of the organization. They can for example be coupled to a content management application to provide the business with a consistent business vocabulary or enable better navigation or classification of information, leveraged by enterprise search engines to make richer semantic web ready websites, etc.. Business semantics can also be used to increase operational efficiency in the technical/operation layer of the organization. It provides an abstracted way to access and deliver data in a more efficient manner. In that respect, it is similar to Enterprise Information Integration (EII) with the added benefit that the shared models are not described in technical terms but in a way that is easily understood by the business. Collibra is the first organization to commercialize the idea behind business semantics management. Collibra's approach to Business Semantics Management is based on DOGMA, a research project at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

It is notable for having passed closer to Earth than any other comet in recorded history, approaching to a distance of only .Kronk, G. Cometography: D/1770 L1 (Lexell), accessed November 20, 2008.Kronk, G. The Closest Approaches of Comets to Earth, accessed November 20, 20, 2008. It was thought that C/1491 B1 may have approached even closer on February 20, 1491, but its orbit was retracted in 2002 due to a misunderstanding of the records. See Approximate Orbits of Ancient and Medieval Comets: 3. Remarks and Discussion The comet has not been seen since 1770 and is considered a lost comet. Lexell's Comet's 1770 passing still holds the record of closest observed approach of Earth by a comet. However, if approaches deduced from orbit calculations are included, it has been beaten by a small sungrazing comet, P/1999 J6 (SOHO), which passed even closer at about from Earth on June 12, 1999, albeit unobserved.  Discovery  Charles Messier, who discovered Lexell's Comet The comet was discovered on June 14, 1770, in the constellation Sagittarius by Messier, who had just completed an observation of Jupiter and was examining several nebulae. At this time it was very faint, but his observations over the course of the next few days showed that it rapidly grew in size, its coma reaching 27 arcminutes across by June 24: by this time it was of magnitude +2. The comet was also noted by several other astronomers. The comet was observed in Japan. Surviving records identify it as an astronomical and historical phenomenon.Hall, John. (1955). Tanuma Okitsugu, 1719‚Äì1788, p. 120. It was observed in the Hejaz in Safar 1184 AH (June 1770), where some believed it to be the comet predicted by the poet al-Fasi, portending future events.  Close approach to Earth  On July 1, 1770, the comet passed 0.015 astronomical units from Earth, or approximately 6 times the radius of the Moon's orbit. Charles Messier measured the coma as 2¬∞ 23' across, around four times the apparent angular size of the Moon. An English astronomer at the time noted the comet crossing over 42¬∞ of sky in 24 hours; he described the nucleus as being as large as Jupiter, \\"surrounded with a coma of silver light, the brightest part of which was as large as the moon's orb\\". Messier was the last astronomer to observe the comet as it moved away from the Sun, on October 3, 1770.  Orbit  Scientists at the time largely believed that comets originated outside the solar system, and therefore initial attempts to model the comet's orbit assumed a parabolic trajectory, which indicated a perihelion date (the date of the closest approach to the Sun) of August 9‚Äì10. When it turned out that the parabolic solution was not a good fit to the comet's orbit, Anders Johan Lexell suggested that the comet followed an elliptical orbit. His calculations, made over a period of several years, gave a perihelion of August 13‚Äì14 and an orbital period of 5.58 years. Lexell also noted that, despite this short- period orbit, by far the shortest known at the time, the comet was unlikely to have been seen previously because its orbit had been radically altered in 1767 by the gravitational forces of Jupiter.Leverington, D. Babylon to Voyager and Beyond: A History of Planetary Astronomy, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.193 It is, therefore, the earliest identified Jupiter family comet (as well as the first known near-Earth object).Valsecchi, G. 'A comet heading towards Earth: the first NEO' , in Tumbling Stone, Issue 2, accessed November 21, 2008 The comet was never seen again. Lexell, after conducting further work in cooperation with Pierre-Simon Laplace, argued that a subsequent interaction with Jupiter in 1779 had further perturbed its orbit, either placing it too far from Earth to be seen or perhaps ejecting it from the Solar System altogether. The comet likely no longer approaches any closer to the Sun than Jupiter's orbit. Although Comet Lexell was never seen again, it remained interesting to astronomers. The Paris Academy of Sciences offered a prize for an investigation into the orbit of the comet. Johann Karl Burckhardt won in 1801, and confirmed the calculations of Lexell. He calculated that the 1779 close approach to Jupiter drastically altered its orbit and left it with a perihelion of 3.33 AU. In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier carried out further work on the comet's orbit and demonstrated that despite potentially approaching Jupiter as close as three and a half radii from the planet's centre the comet could never have become a satellite of Jupiter.Valsecchi, G. 'Le Verrier's computations and the concept of Chaos' , in Tumbling Stone , Issue 3, accessed February 11, 2011 He showed that after the second encounter with Jupiter many different trajectories were possible, given the uncertainties of the observations, and the comet could even have been ejected from the Solar System. This foreshadowed the modern scientific idea of chaos. Lexell's work on the orbit of the comet is considered to be the beginning of modern understanding of orbit determination.Valsecchi, G. '236 Years Ago...' in Near Earth Objects, Our Celestial Neighbors: Opportunity and Risk : Proceedings of the 236th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, Cambridge University Press, 2006, xvii‚Äìxviii 2018 recalculation In a 2018 paper, Quan-Zhi Ye et al. used recorded observations of the comet to recalculate the orbit, finding Le Verrier's 1844 calculations to be highly accurate. They simulated the orbit forwards to the year 2000, finding that 98% of possible orbits remained orbiting the Sun, 85% with a perihelion nearer than the asteroid belt, and 40% crossing Earth's orbit. The numbers remain consistent even when including non-gravitational parameters caused by pressures from a comet's jets. Based on its apparent brightness in 1770, they estimate the comet to be between 4 and 50 kilometers in diameter, most likely less than 30. Additionally, based on a lack of meteor showers, they suggest that the comet may have ceased major activity before 1800 AD. Identification The aforementioned 2018 paper also attempted to identify if any discovered object may be a remnant of Lexell's comet. With an assumed size of >4 kilometers, it is highly unlikely that this comet would remain in the inner solar system and be undiscovered. Most new asteroids discovered even in the asteroid belt (as of 2018) are only 1‚Äì4 kilometers across. If Lexell's comet remains in the inner Solar System, it would most likely be an unidentified asteroid. The paper identified four potential asteroids which could be related: ' (99.2% chance), (74% chance), (0.2% chance), and (~0% chance). The longitude of perihelion of these asteroids are 2.32¬∞, 6.22¬∞, 356.98¬∞, and 351.62¬∞, respectively. For comparison, the longitude of perihelion of Lexell's comet was 359.48 ¬± 0.24¬∞. They find that is very likely to be a remnant of Lexell's comet, although due to a number of close approaches with Jupiter as well as uncertain non-gravitational parameters, a definite link cannot be made.

It is a sequel to Cherryh's Cyteen, and was published in hardcover by DAW Books in January 2009. The teenage clone of a top scientist and political leader unravels the decades-old murder of her \\"genemother\\", while also dealing with threats to her own welfare. Plot summary Ariane Emory is the eighteen-year-old clone of an extraordinary woman who was both a preeminent research scientist and the leader of the Expansionist Party, which has controlled Union since its inception. Her predecessor had some very powerful friends and enemies. However, as her genemother had died under suspicious circumstances before she was even born, Emory is unsure who they are. She is not without resources though. A breakthrough experiment in \\"psychogenesis\\" has recreated in her the genius of her parent. Everyone knows that she will one day follow in her mother's footsteps and take charge of Reseune, a sovereign Administrative Territory and the premier azi research facility in Union, one of the three spacefaring factions of humanity. In the meantime, she takes measures to protect herself, assembling a trusted staff with the assistance of her azi bodyguards and companions, Florian and Catlin. When she discovers that her new azi security chief has been tampered with, her list of possible enemies grows to include key men inside Reseune itself: Yanni Schwartz, the Director, and Adam Hicks, the head of security. Adding to the discord is the return of a bitter Jordan Warrick from a twenty-year exile at an isolated research facility. He had been pressured into confessing to killing the original Emory. The murder of Dr. Sandur Patil, a top scientist recruited by Schwartz to head up the terraforming of Eversnow, turns out to be but one step in a plot by Emory's unknown enemy that shakes Union to its core. As she struggles to deal with the escalating situation, she also unravels the decades-old mystery of her genemother's death.

The genealogy site indicates that his great-grandfather changed the original name from Haworth to Hayworth. was an American actor, playwright and screenwriter who began in weaselly and milquetoast roles and aged into dignified character parts.Biography, Answer.com He appeared in over 90 films during his career, as well as on numerous television shows. He is most likely best known for his final role, that of General Winfield Schaeffer in the fourth and fifth seasons of the sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. He is the uncle of Rita Hayworth, as well as being the uncle (by marriage) of Ginger Rogers. Career Born in Washington, D.C., he began acting in his late teens. He was a pioneering radio announcer in the early 1920s, first in Washington, later in New York City, and then in Chicago. Subsequently, he appeared on numerous radio programs in various roles. He played Fred Andrews on Archie Andrews, was an announcer on Chaplain Jim, played Philip Roberts on It's Higgins, Sir, played Port on Lone Journey, played Alonzo Smith on Meet Me in St. Louis, and played Jack Arnold on Myrt and Marge. He entered movies in 1933, under the stage name Jack Arnold and made appearances in small roles, usually played comically good-natured, sneaky characters. However, he did occasionally have larger parts, such as the starring role in 1937's China Passage, billed as Vinton Haworth. His appearances as Jack Arnold ended in the early 1940s and he did a two-year stint on Broadway from 1942 to 1944 before returning to California. He made appearances in film from the late 1950s onward. Hayworth was also one of the founders of AFRA (later AFTRA), the union representing radio and television artists, of which he was also the president from 1951‚Äì54. Hayworth began appearing on television in the 1950s. In 1953‚Äì1954, he was an announcer on The Buick-Berle Show on NBC. He appeared in Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Gunsmoke, Perry Mason, Dennis the Menace (as Mr. Cramer in 1960 episode \\"Out of Retirement\\"), Petticoat Junction, Ripcord, Hazel (6 episodes), The Munsters, Green Acres (1965) and Dick Tracy (1967). He played Magistrado Carlos Galindo on Disney's Zorro (1957‚Äì1959). His final role was as General Winfield Schaeffer on I Dream of Jeannie between 1969 and 1970. Hayworth replaced Barton MacLane, who had played General Martin Peterson until his death in 1969. Coincidentally, both Hayworth and MacLane died before the final episodes in which they appeared had been broadcast. Death Hayworth died of a heart attack on May 21, 1970, shortly after completing his recurring role of General Winfield Schaeffer in I Dream of Jeannie. Personal Hayworth was married to actress Jean Owens whose sister was Lela Owens, mother of actress Ginger Rogers. Hayworth's elder sister was Volga Hayworth, mother of screen star Rita Hayworth, making Vinton Hayworth maternal uncle of both Rita Hayworth and Ginger Rogers.

Between 1970 and 1988, Emmrich won 46 German Democratic Republic (GDR) titles (17 singles and 29 in the doubles and mixed). Unfortunately, he entered the tennis scene after the GDR had decided to promote only those sports which were relevant for the Olympics‚Äô medals table. Thus, he was barred from international competitions outside the Eastern bloc countries and had to keep the status as an amateur. However, he gained some points at an ATP tournament in Sofia as GDR functionaries had not noticed that it had become part of the ATP tour. After this tournament, the ATP ranked him number 482‚Äîthe only entry of a GDR tennis player in the ATP rankings. Martina Navratilova claimed that he could have become a top-ten player in the 1970s. After the German reunification in 1990, Emmrich proved that he could compete on a high international level as he won several titles, i.e. runners-up in the European Championships of the 35+ Seniors (1996), runners-up in the Doubles World Championships in 2003 (50+), European Champion (50+) in 2006. In addition, he gained many national titles after 1990 in senior competitions. His daughter Manuela Emmrich also picked up the tennis sport and played college tennis in the US. She won the National Championship in 2005. His son, Martin Emmrich, is a professional tennis player and is successful on the doubles pro circuit.

The album was recorded during September 2008 in Manchester's Futureworks Studio. Musical style Andrew Craighan stated that the feel of the album is, in his words, \\"heading for empty and bleak with flashes of rage.\\" Vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe stated in an interview that For Lies I Sire is \\"quite possibly the most depressing thing we've created to date\\", and that it's an album that unites the past of the band with the future. The album is the first since 1996's album Like Gods of the Sun to feature a violin, this time performed by new keyboardist and violinist Katie Stone. The idea of using violin again has been described by Stainthorpe as adding \\"a deep range of feeling\\".Ultimatemetal.com The violin parts were well received by critics. \\"A Chapter in Loathing\\" begins with the same riff that closed the band's last album, A Line of Deathless Kings.

Stone resigned from the post to focus on her studies soon after the release of the album, to be replaced by Shaun MacGowan for the upcoming tour and Bring Me Victory EP. Critical reception The album was well received by critics. Thom Jurek of Allmusic especially praised Aaron Stainthorpe, calling his vocals \\"better than ever\\" and his lyrics \\"beautifully poetic and streamlined\\". Jurek also pointed out the entire band being on top-notch, with several good hooks in all instruments, and called the album both a good introduction to the band for new fans, and a good follow-up to fans of all the previous albums.[ allmusic.com For Lies I Sire review] David E. Gehlke of Blistering.com called For Lies I Sire to be My Dying Bride's second best album after 1999's The Light at the End of the World, and especially praised the work of new drummer Dan Mullins, noting that he put out an \\"inspired performance, even getting colossal drum roll treatment on My Body, A Funeral and the death metal-tinged A Chapter in Loathing\\". At the same time, several critics have noted the departure of death grunts on the later albums, including For Lies I Sire. Trey Spencer of Sputnik Music feels it has the album lacking important parts and calling it \\"a shame [...] because musically this is some of the best material they‚Äôve released in over a decade\\". He also adds that he enjoys the album, but is \\"constantly waiting for a little extra kick that never comes\\".My Dying Bride ‚Äì For Lies I Sire review ‚Äì sputnik music Especially the return of the violin, as performed by Katie Stone, has been praised by critics; the aforementioned Sputnik Music critic noted that Stone often performed in style of past violinist Martin Powell, only using the violin sparsely on certain passages, to surprise the listener.

It is located between the larger centres of Dapto and Albion Park.  History  In 1829 Henry Osborne, a wealthy Irish immigrant, was granted in the Dapto district known as Marshall Mount, where he settled with his wife Sarah Osborne (n√©e Marshall) in 1833. By the 1840s Henry had added to his estate by securing Charles Throsby Smith's \\"Calderwood\\" , Elyard's \\"Avondale\\", William Browne's \\"Athanlin\\" (Yallah), Brook's \\"Exmouth\\" and numerous smaller grants. Marshall Mount was expanded to reach from Mullet Creek in the north to the Macquarie Rivulet in the south. In 1841, Marshall Mount House was completed as the Osborne's new residence and in 1843, Osborne held a cattle show at his property which led to the founding of the Illawarra Agricultural Association. By the 1850s the Osbornes had become one of the most powerful families in the region, and in 1851 Henry Osborne was elected to the Legislative Council as member for East Camden, representing his constituency in the first Legislative Assembly. (McDonald, 1976; Dowd, B.T., 1960; Hagan, 1997.) A school opened at Marshall Mount in 1859, and after the death of Henry Osborne in the same year, Marshall Mount road became a public thoroughfare. Marshall Mount remained primarily the property of Osborne's descendants until 1890, when Hamilton Osborne sold twenty-two lots of property to new owners. Marshall Mount is an agricultural/rural district and it had a population of 142 at the . Under the West Dapto Local Environmental Plan, Marshall Mount is currently being considered for residential development by the NSW State Government.  Notable attractions  Marshall Mount is the site of the Marshall Mount Old Time Dance, a fortnightly gathering run by the Marshall Mount Progress Association. The Marshall Mount Public School and Schoolmaster's Residence, opened in 1859, are still standing on Marshall Mount Road and offer an example of typical architectural style of the period. Marshall Mount House, a colonial-style built on the original site of the Osborne residence, has been a heritage listed building since 1978, due to the significance of its original owner.

Life  Comb√©s was born in Zaragoza (Spain) in 1620. When he was twelve, he joined the Jesuit order as a novice at Tarragona, harbor city near in Catalonia. Before finishing his priesthood, after only six years of study, he expressed the desire to become part of the expedition to the Philippine Islands. He was assigned to Mexico, and from there he joined a group of Roman Catholic missionaries bound for the East Indies. In 1643, eleven years after entering the Jesuits, together with forty-six other friars he was sent to the Philippines in an expedition by Diego de Bobadilla. Comb√©s finished his theological studies in the Philippines, and was ordained as a Jesuit in 1645. He was assigned to Zamboanga in Mindanao where he ministered for more than a decade to the religious needs of the natives. In the twelve years that he served there he grew to acquire strategic function, and prestige as a leader, becoming ambassador to the Muslim chieftains, among them Sultan Corralat, and the sultans of Jolo. He traveled to Manila in 1657, and stayed there for two years. He was assigned to Leyte where he remained for three years. He gained deep insights into the history, the customs and traditions, and the language of the island. Comb√©s was again recalled to Manila in 1662. Sensing the decline in the Spanish hold on the Muslim areas of Mindanao, he tried to persuade the Spanish government, and religious authorities to strengthen or hold on government fortifications in the island. While on voyage to Madrid, and then to Rome as procurator of the Jesuit order, Comb√©s died on board on December 29, 1665. He was 45 years old. Comb√©s wrote a book, Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes ... (Madrid, Herederos de Pablo de Val, 1667) that contains a three-paragraph section on the voyage of Fern√£o de Magalh√£es (i.e. Ferdinand Magellan) in Philippine waters in March‚ÄìApril 1521. It talks of Magellan and his fleet anchoring in Butuan and planting a cross at a mountain there. From Butuan, Magellan and crew sail for Cebu making a brief stopover at an island named \\"Limasaua\\". Today, Comb√©s story is seen differently. Instead of anchoring at Butuan, Magellan's fleet is anchored at Limasaua. A mass, which is not mentioned in Combes' story, is held at Limasaua. This phantom mass is celebrated in the Philippines every year and the island Limasaua (now universally spelled with a w in place of u, \\"Limasawa\\") is known as the site of the \\"First mass in the Philippines\\".

The field is located at a distance of from Ghotki in Sindh Province. Discovered in March 1990, it is a joint venture between Oil and Gas Development Company, KUFPEC Pakistan B.V., PKP Exploration Ltd (Premier Oil), PKP2 Exploration Ltd (KUFPEC) and Petroleum Pakistan Limited, each holding 75%, 8.5%, 4.75%, 4.75% and 7% respectively. The Qadirpur gas field is currently one of OGDCL largest operated gas producing fields, accounting for 34%, 32% and 29% of OGDCL net gas production for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The field is located 8 km from Ghotki, 70 km northeast of Sukkur and 100 km east of Jacobabad in Sindh province.its it is located from main (90km,sadiqabad = karachi, 540km) highway road stop ahmed ki , 4 km away inside. Gas production on this field commenced in September 1995 by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto after the installation of gas gathering facilities and processing plants. Of the 70 wells that have been drilled at this field, 57 are currently producing wells. Six have been abandoned, five are shut-in and two are water disposal wells. For FY 2015-16, average net daily production at this field was per day at standard conditions of purified gas with per day of permeate gas. The field‚Äôs main customers are Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited near Ghotki and Liberty Power Limited Daharki (320 mw power supply generating). A gas processing facility of per day at standard conditions was installed at Qadirpur during 2006-7. In order to address declining reservoir pressures, gas compression facilities were being installed at the field to maintain sales gas supply at contractual delivery pressures. The natural gas is purified by a membrane separation process that removes water vapor and carbon dioxide. The processing equipment was supplied by Honeywell‚Äôs UOP Separex‚Ñ¢ Membrane Systems division. The process consists of ten trains of membrane skids, each containing many spiral-wound membrane elements. During the second quarter of 2009-10, average daily sales from Qadirpur was per day at standard conditions purified gas and per day dehydrated gas, which was sold to SNGPL, per day raw gas sold to Liberty Power and of condensate. The field was developed in three phases, increasing its capacity from per day at standard conditions. A project was completed in December 2007, to enhance sales per day. Development drilling at Qadirpur is continuing to maintain the gas supply to Southern Natural Gas PL. In 2009, gas flow was declined from per day at standard conditions. Thus a front end compression project was initiated to maintain the pressure of extracted gas and completed in 2011. As a part of project, 14 Waukesha engine driven Reciprocating compressors were installed by Valerus company. Later, 3 solar turbine driven centrifugal compressors were also installed which were previously working at Pirkoh gas field (Balochistan). These compressors increase the pressure of gas from . Later in 2010, Qadirpur gas field started supplying per day at standard conditions of permeate gas to Engro powergen (previously Engro power limited), which is generating 270 MW supply With the passage of time, field is depleting and gas flow has been further declined to per day in 2017.

National Power Training Institute (NPTI) , an ISO 9001 & ISO 14001 organization under Ministry of Power, Government of India is a National Apex body for Training and Human Resources Development in Power Sector with its Corporate Office at Faridabad. NPTI had been providing its dedicated service for more than five decades. NPTI has trained over 3,20,000 Power Professionals in regular Programs over the last 5 decades. NPTI is the world's leading integrated power training institute. NPTI is the only institute of its kind in the world with a wide geographical spread and covering a wide gamut of academic and training programs in Power Sector. NPTI's committed faculty is providing excellent training in the Power Sector, which is the most important sector among various infrastructure sectors. Training provided by NPTI on Generation Simulators has improved Plant Load Factor of Generating Units, has increased the availability of Transmission & Distribution Systems and has decreased Aggregate Technical & Commercial Losses. This in turn is providing more power to the country. Thus the training being provided by NPTI is having a cascading effect in the growth of GDP and economy of the country. History The Central Water and Power Commission (Power Wing) established Thermal Power Station Personnel Training Institutes in 1965‚Äì1975 at Neyveli (1965), Durgapur (1968), Badarpur, Delhi (1974) and Nagpur (1975) for training the engineers of thermal power stations which were being established in the country during that time. It also established the Power Systems Training Institute (PSTI) in 1972 and Hot Line Training Centre (HLTC) in 1974 at Bangalore. With the bifurcation of the Central Water and Power Commission into the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Central Water Commission (CWC) in the 1970s, the Institute came under the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). In the late 1970s the Raj Dekshya Committee set up by the Government of India to improve the power sector of the country recommended among many things formal training for the personnel employed in the power industry. Accordingly, the Indian Electricity Rule was amended to make training mandatory for the personnel employed in the generating stations and associated sub stations. With this the Thermal Power Station Personnel Training Institutes under the Central Electricity Authority were carved out and formed into a separate autonomous body under the Ministry of Power as the Power Engineers Training Society (PETS) in 1980 to give more importance to Power Training and to have an accelerated growth of the Institutes. Later, in 1993 Power Engineers Training Society (PETS) was renamed as National Power Training Institute (NPTI). Power Systems Training Institute (PSTI) and Hot Line Training Centre (HLTC) was merged with NPTI in 2002. The National Power Training Institute (NPTI) grew continuously through the tenure of Indian governments. The Institute, which previously conducted training only in thermal power generation has now equipped itself to conduct training in all segments of the power sector i.e. generation, transmission and distribution. In the last four decades of its existence NPTI has trained thousands of engineers, supervisors and technicians from most of the Electricity Boards, public and private sector utilities and personnel from developing nations.

Critical reception The critical reception to the song was mixed. MusicOMH described \\"Colours\\" as \\"one of the album's woozier numbers\\" and stated it had \\"layers of smile- inducing vocal harmonies and twinkly synths\\". Boomkat.com stated that Hot Chip's approach to the song was similar to \\"Boy from School\\" by \\"tak[ing] a thudding electro heart and pump[ing] it full of indie melancholy\\", while Contactmusic.com said \\"Colours\\" \\"transcends its initial child-like innocence to seem both gorgeous and, somehow, profound.\\" The group chorus harmony was compared to Brian Wilson, while the drum rhythms were said to \\"sit between Stereolab and The Beta Band\\".

Although many of the remixes were praised, it was said by Clickmusic.com that the DFA remix of \\"Colours\\" \\"failed to match the brilliance of their version of the band's 'Just Like We (Breakdown)'\\" with Inthemix.com stating it represented \\"perhaps the only slight miss-step\\" on the Australian EP and described it as having \\"kitschy retro synth stabs and lifeless prog- Krautrock rhythms only starting to really rear into Italo-house tinged life near the very end\\".

Biography He was born in 1863 in Akron, Ohio. In 1886, he was sentenced to four years in prison in Oregon state for stealing from a partner in a horse-trading venture in Canada. Political connections of the Barnette family saw the sentence commuted after one year, on the condition that Barnette never return to Oregon. Stampede to Dawson Barnette was in Helena, Montana in the summer of 1897 when he received the news of gold strikes in the Klondike. On August 2, 1897, he arrived in Seattle, Washington, where with 160 other passengers, he boarded the steamer Cleveland, bound for St. Michael, Alaska on the Bering Sea. At St. Michael, Barnette partnered with other stampeders to purchase another steamer, the St. Michael, with the intention of steaming up the Yukon River to Dawson. Barnette was nominated the captain. He was henceforth known as \\"Captain Barnette\\". The St. Michael only made it as far as Circle, Alaska, before a series of misfortunes including a breakdown, a fire, an outbreak of disease among the crew, and the freezing over of the Yukon halted any further progress. Barnette set out for Dawson by dogsled, but he arrived to find himself months too late: Every creek already had been staked. Barnette took a job in Dawson managing mines for the North American Trading and Transportation Company (NT&T;). At NT&T;, he made the acquaintance of John Healy, an entrepreneur from Montana. Healy laid out a plan to build a railroad from Valdez, Alaska, to Eagle, Alaska, what he called an \\"All-American Route\\" to the Klondike. Barnette came away with the idea of establishing a trading post at the halfway point, where the railroad would cross the Tanana River (near modern-day Tanacross, Alaska). Barnette imagined such a settlement could grow to become the \\"Chicago of Alaska\\". Barnette returned to Helena in 1898, where he married Isabelle Cleary. Up the Tanana In 1901, Barnette partnered with Charles Smith, an acquaintance from Circle, arranging for $20,000 in supplies to be shipped from San Francisco, California, to St. Michael. Back in Circle, he purchased the 124-foot steamer Arctic Boy, steaming down the Yukon to meet the cargo with the intention of carrying it back up the river to establish the trading post. At St. Michael, the Arctic Boy was loaded with 130 tons of merchandise, but the steamer ran aground before reaching the mouth of the Yukon and had to be beached in order to save the cargo. Having no other means to transport the merchandise further, Barnette and Smith sold it to local entrepreneurs, only to repurchase it when customs officer James H. Causten invested $6,000 in the enterprise in return for a third share of profits. =The Lavelle Young= Barnette and Smith used the $6,000 from Causten to hire Charles Adams, captain of the 150 foot sternwheeler, the Lavelle Young. Captain Adams agreed to carry E.T. and Isabelle Barnette, Charles Smith, their employees and their cargo to the head of navigation of the Tanana River, at least as far as the Chena Slough. This was 200 miles short of Tanana Crossing, where Captain William R. Abercrombie had just completed the U.S. Army's trail between Valdez and Eagle. The construction of the Valdez-Eagle Trail seemed to confirm Healy's vision of the \\"All-American Route\\" to the Klondike. But it was late in the year, when Alaska's glacier-fed rivers run shallow, and Adams doubted that the heavily laden steamer could make it that far. In August 1901, the Lavelle Young set out from St. Michael. Late in the month, it reached the shallow Bates Rapids (near Big Delta, Alaska) of the Tanana River and could proceed no further. Barnette convinced Adams to attempt a detour. Believing that it was possible to use the Chena River to bypass the Bates Rapids, Barnette directed Adams to return to the Chena Slough. But the plan failed when they ran up against sandbars only 6‚Äì8 miles above the mouth of the Chena River. Adams refused to proceed further. At 4 p.m. on August 26, the passengers and cargo were unloaded on a spruce-covered bluff on the south side of the river. \\"We left Barnette furious,\\" Adams recalled. \\"His wife was weeping on the bank.\\" Barnette's disappointment was somewhat relieved when an Italian prospector named Felice Pedroni(Felix Pedro) and his partner Tom Gilmore arrived on the site and immediately purchased a winter's worth of supplies, including beans, bacon and flour. Pedroni and Gilmore were working the Tanana Hills, searching for a creek that had yielded gold some years earlier, when they caught sight of smoke from the Lavelle Young. =Chenoa City= Barnette and his crew set about constructing a temporary trading post consisting of two log buildings: A 26 by 54 foot store called \\"Barnette's Cache\\" (later, \\"Barnette's Trading Post\\"), and a small cabin to serve as the Barnettes' residence. The buildings were raised on the site of what would later become the heart of downtown Fairbanks, between Cowles Street and Cushman Street. Barnette named the post \\"Chenoa City.\\" He decided to pass the winter there, continuing up river to Tanana Crossing the following summer. During the winter, Barnette sent Dan McCarty, one of his hired hands, to Valdez in order to escort Isabelle's brother, Frank J. Cleary, back to the post. McCarty and Cleary returned on February 20, 1902. Cleary was charged with taking care of the post while the Barnettes made a trip to Seattle to purchase additional supplies as well as a flat-bottomed boat capable of proceeding further up the Tanana. On March 10, E.T. and Isabelle set out by dogsled, crossing the Saint Elias Mountains to reach the port of Valdez. In Seattle, Barnette purchased a boat he named Isabelle, ordering it shipped in pieces to St. Michael. The Isabelle was assembled to incorporate whatever machinery could be salvaged from the wrecked Arctic Boy. While Barnette was in St. Michael, overseeing the process, he made the acquaintance of district judge James Wickersham, who had been appointed to the judgeship of the Third District by President William McKinley in 1900. Wickersham suggested to Barnette that he name his post on the Tanana after Wickersham's mentor, up-and-coming Indiana Senator Charles W. Fairbanks. In his July 19, 1902 diary entry, Wickersham recorded that Barnette \\"promised to do so.\\" The Isabelle was completed in September, but once again it proved to be too late in the year to reach Tanana Crossing. The Isabelle could not even make it as far as Chenoa City, grounded by sandbars 4 miles downstream. When Barnette reached the post, using small boats to ferry supplies from the Isabelle, he was informed that Pedroni had finally located the rich vein that he had been looking for. Pedroni, who had been grubstaked by Cleary in April, had returned in late July to confide his discovery. The Fairbanks Gold Rush Barnette abandoned his plan to continue to Tanana Crossing. On September 27, 1902 he was elected recorder for the newly formed Fairbanks Mining District. At the end of December, with the most immediately profitable claims recorded, Barnette dispatched an employee, a Japanese adventurer named Jujiro Wada, to Dawson to spread the news of Pedro's strike in order to drum up business. January 17, 1903, Dawson's Yukon Sun newspaper published a story entitled Rich Strike Made in the Tanana. Within two days, the story made the front page of The New York Times. The Fairbanks Gold Rush was on. Abe Spring, a resident of the Tanana Valley since 1900, and an eventual mayor of Fairbanks, counted \\"seven or eight hundred people\\" who braved deadly cold to arrive in the Fairbanks Mining District during the winter of 1902‚Äì1903. But the first prospectors to reach Fairbanks were frustrated by creeks that could not be mined in winter and squeezed by price gouging at Barnette's Trading Post. Barnette's monopoly allowed him to set his own prices and bundle products together in whatever fashion yielded the most profit. Prospectors who wanted to buy a bag of flour were also required to buy three cases of canned goods. Hungry and destitute, an angry mob of stampeders threatened to lynch Wada, whose story had lured them from Dawson and Circle. Then they marched on Barnette's store. Barnette, expecting trouble, met the mob with a dozen riflemen at his side. Barnette eventually agreed to cut the price of flour by half and dropped the requirement to buy canned goods. =Mayor of \\"an American Dawson\\"= James Wickersham, traveling from Dawson to Fairbanks in March, noted crowds of \\"stampeders\\" on the road. Wickersham arrived on April 9 to swear in J. Tod Cowles as the Justice of the Peace. He described the town as \\"just now in its formation period,\\" with a tent city of 500 people. \\"Miners, sourdoughs, cheechacos, gamblers, Indians, Negroes, Japanese, dogs, prostitutes, music, drinking! It is rough but healthy & the beginning, I hope, of an American Dawson.\\" On May 4, 1903, Barnette made a trip to Seattle, where he was commissioned as postmaster of Fairbanks. In San Francisco, he sold a two-thirds interest in Barnette's Cache to the Northern Commercial Company (NCC). Some years later, NCC would purchase the store entirely. Barnette invested the proceeds in the Fairbanks Banking Company. Lucrative discoveries of gold in Cleary Creek, Fairbanks Creek and Ester Creek created a boom economy. On November 10, 1903, the residents of Fairbanks voted to incorporate. An election was also held for the mayor and city council. Despite winning only 67 votes to John L. Long's 73 votes, Barnette insisted on being named the first mayor of Fairbanks, pressuring the city council until he got his way. 1904 was a landmark year for Barnette and his city. In the summer, Isabelle gave birth to Virginia, their first child. Barnette's Trading Post, only three years old, was demolished to make way for the Northern Commercial Company's expanded store. Barnette initiated the installation of a telephone system. Judge Wickersham, confirmed in his earlier assessment of the settlement, moved the seat of the Third Judicial District from Eagle to Fairbanks. In November, the city's namesake was elected Vice President of the United States. By 1905, the city had a church (St. Matthew's Episcopal Church), a hospital, and a bridge at Cushman Street spanning the Chena. The Tanana Mines Railway (later, the \\"Tanana Valley Railway\\") connected the city with the neighboring settlement at Chena. Barnette purchased the Fairbanks News newspaper. By 1906, gold production had risen to $6,000,000 a year, and with a population which had surpassed 5,000, Fairbanks rivaled Nome as Alaska's largest city. =Causten v. BarnetteCausten v. Barnette, 49 Wash. 659, 96 P. 225 (1908).= On May 22, 1906, Fairbanks was ravaged by a fire that destroyed most of the buildings. The same year, Barnette was brought to court by James H. Causten, Barnette's backer from 1901. Barnette had not honored his promise to share a third of profits from the venture which in five years had made him a wealthy man. Before the Washington State Supreme Court, Causten demanded a half of the assets Barnette had accumulated since the time of Causten's investment. Barnette protested that Causten was only entitled to one-third of what had been earned or acquired during the first winter at Chenoa City. During proceedings, Barnette's 1886 imprisonment became public. The Fairbanks Daily Times (which had only begun publishing a daily edition that year) ran a banner headline: \\"EX-CONVICT\\". On June 26, 1908 the court ruled in favor of Causten, ordering Barnette to pay Causten a third of any assets acquired since he arrived in the Tanana Valley. Among other things, the court observed that ‚ÄúThe conduct of appellant Barnette in connection with the suit is not calculated to inspire the greatest confidence.‚ÄùCausten, 49 Wash. at 670-71, 96 P. at 229. =The Washington-Alaska Bank= Barnette purchased the Washington-Alaska Bank in 1909, just as Fairbanks gold production reached its peak. In August 1910, he merged the Fairbanks Banking Company into the Washington-Alaska Bank. Barnette was named the president of the amalgamated bank. Isabelle Barnette conceived a second child in 1910. Anticipating a difficult birth, she moved to Washington State, where there were better medical facilities. In 1911, a second daughter, Phyllis, was born. On January 4, 1911, the Washington-Alaska Bank went bankrupt, abruptly closing its doors. Depositors in Fairbanks were out for $1 million. In the dark of March 27, 1911, Barnette fled Fairbanks, taking with him an estimated $500,000 ($10.5 million in 1990 dollars) of dubious provenance. Less than a week later, Barnette was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with embezzling $50,000. The trial took place in Valdez. In December 1912, Barnette was found not guilty on all accounts except for a misdemeanor charge of falsifying a financial report. Barnette was fined $1,000. Fairbanks Daily News-Miner editor W. F. Thompson called the trial \\"the rottenest judicial farce the North has ever witnessed.\\" Effigies of Barnette's attorneys were burned at the foot of Cushman Street. Although officially exonerated, Barnette's reputation as a swindler was sealed. Newspapers in the city he had founded took up \\"Barnette\\" as a verb meaning \\"to steal\\" or \\"to defraud\\". Later life and legacy The Barnette family resettled in Los Angeles. In 1918, Isabelle filed for divorce after finding love letters to E.T. from another woman. In 1920, Isabelle was granted custody of the two daughters. E.T. Barnette lived for a time on a palatial estate in Mexico. He died in Los Angeles on May 22, 1933 after injuries sustained in a fall. Isabelle Cleary Barnette died in September 1942 at Agnews State Hospital in San Jose, California. Barnette Street in Fairbanks is named for E.T. Barnette. The north-south streets of the original Fairbanks townsite were named for the prominent early residents of Fairbanks. The street began at the western edge of Barnette's trading post and ended at the townsite's southern boundaries, where Paul Rickert's farm began. In later years, this southern end of Barnette Street was very near the eastern end of Weeks Field. The development of Bjerremark Subdivision starting in the 1950s extended Barnette Street into South Fairbanks. The two Barnette Streets do not connect, however. In 1960, E.T. Barnette Elementary School was constructed in Fairbanks, one of several schools built by the Fairbanks Independent School District (the immediate predecessor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) to handle the population boom in Fairbanks which followed World War II. Isabel Pass in the Alaska Range north of Paxson is named for Isabelle Cleary Barnette. Barnette is usually remembered by his initials, and there is some doubt about his first name: There are sources which record him as \\"Eldridge\\" or \\"Ebenezer T. Barnette.\\" He appears in some contemporary official documents as \\"Elbridge T. Barnette\\". Common folklore in Fairbanks recalls his name as Ezra Thompson Barnette; the name being coaxed from him during a rather drunken argument in one of the many bars in the red light district on present day 1st St. References ;General * * ;Specific Bibliography * Category:1863 births Category:1933 deaths Category:American fraudsters Category:American people convicted of fraud Category:Businesspeople from Fairbanks, Alaska Category:Mayors of Fairbanks, Alaska Category:Politicians from Akron, Ohio Category:Steamship captains ","title":"E.

Anjika's father, Satvick, forces her into an arranged marriage with a business associate's son, Hardick. Satvick's chauffeur, Don Flowers, realises Anjika is not happy with her father's plans and says he will help her out, on the condition she spends the night with him. Anjika hates him, so she refuses at first, but reluctantly agrees eventually. Hardick collapses on a date with Anjika, and Flowers seizes the opportunity and takes him back to his flat, scattering illegal drugs everywhere, making Hardick look like a dealer. Anjika's parents call off the marriage, but Flowers reminds her she needs to keep up her end of the deal. Reluctant, she visits the hotel room Flowers booked and allows him to flirt with her, touch her and smell her, before the pair have sex. Anjika wakes up the next morning and quickly leaves; Flowers awakes and thanks her. Things are not simple from then on. Anjika makes up the excuse that if Flowers stops providing her brother with drugs, she will bed him again. Flowers realizes Anjika has feelings for him, and makes her beg to take her to bed. The pair continue in their affair, obviously strongly loving each other. Things complicate, however, when Alex and Anjika reveal their relationship and her parents strongly approve, even arranging a marriage for the two. Anjika becomes stressed, realizing her heart belongs with Flowers despite the age difference, yet she's in denial and insists she still loves Alex.

This differs from normal Player versus Player combat in that Realm versus Realm usually involves a combat-based game, as opposed to one where sporadic Player versus Player combat occurs. In this context, \\"realm\\" generally means a geographic territory or political affiliation. This concept is also referred to as Group versus Group, Race versus Race, Nation versus Nation, or Faction versus Faction depending on the specific implementation in the game under discussion. Contrast with \\"Guild versus Guild\\" games (or GvG, in an alternate usage from Group versus Group), such as Shadowbane or Age of Conan, in which players organize themselves into factions of their own creation and design rather than realms which are prebuilt by the game developers. Origin In 2001, Mythic Entertainment introduced a new team-based form of PvP combat with the release of Dark Age of Camelot and called it Realm versus Realm. In Realm vs Realm the rules would be similar to PvP combat. Where a single combatant or a group faces one another in PvP. RvR introduces entire factions fighting each other. RvR was also made more interesting by bypassing the normal \\"red vs blue\\" type team battles seen in most games at the time. For RvR, they created a third faction to bring about a large scale \\"Rock-Paper-Scissors\\" experience. Last they chose to allow Realm vs Realm to be played out in an open world PvP environment known as the RvR zone. The RvR zone was a free to roam map where players had the choice of where to attack, when to attack, and with how many players. Complete battlefield freedom (even the freedom to not take part) allowed for RvR and DAoC to become one of the most successful MMOs of its time. Other games Mythic's second MMORPG, Warhammer Online, was also an RvR game. It featured the conflict between the realm of Order and the realm of Destruction as a core gameplay aspect. Mark Jacobs has more recently led a team re-imagining the Dark Age underpinnings of RvR with a new game called Camelot Unchained due for release in TBD. Many other MMORPGs include RvR elements without classifying themselves as a RvR game. Such titles include: * Anarchy Online : Three groups of characters that fight in designated PvP areas. * The Elder Scrolls Online : Three factions fight over the central region of Cyrodiil. * EVE Online : Factions fight over specific regions. : The different player created alliances fighting for control of regions of low security space also resembles RvR. * Final Fantasy XI : Players of different nations can fight in Ballista battles. * Gloria Victis : Players choose between 3 nations, Midland, Ismir, and Sangmar to fight for dominance on a medieval open world map. Gloria Victis is a MMORPG with skill-based combat mechanics similar to Mount and Blade: Warband * Guild Wars 2 : World vs. World combat. Three servers fight for control of an area called The Mists. This resembles Dark Age's system closer than any other to date. Including Warhammer Online. * Jumpgate Evolution : Three nations fight for control of certain sectors. * Legend of Edda : Players choose between the Olympus and Titan gods and fight for crystals in Sacred Wars. * Lineage : Players organize into bloodpledges that fight over control of castles. * Pirates of the Burning Sea : The three nations and the pirates fight over the control of certain ports. * Regnum Online : Three Realms fight against each other in war zone invading Forts and Castles. * Shattered Galaxy : Three factions fight over the control of all battlegrounds. * PlanetSide : Three factions, The Terran Republic, The Vanu Sovereignty, and The New Conglomerate fight in islands for control over bases that lock and give bonuses to the side that owns them.

The house was designed by Maurice Herman Finkel, and in 1925 it was bought by its second owner, physician Ossian Sweet, an African American. Soon after he moved in, the house was the site of a confrontation when a white mob of about 1,000 gathered in protest of the Sweet family moving into the formerly all-white neighborhood. Rocks thrown by the mob broke windows, and someone in the house fired out at the mob, killing one man and wounding another. Sweet and ten other persons from the house were arrested for murder. Contacted by the NAACP, nationally known attorney Clarence Darrow joined their defense team. After a mistrial, in the second trial the first defendant was acquitted. The prosecution dropped charges against the remaining defendants. The case was considered important as part of the civil rights movement and establishing freedom of residence. The house was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Ossian Sweet Ossian Sweet was born in Florida and earned a medical degree from Howard University.Patricia Zacharias, \\"'I have to die a man or live a coward' -- the saga of Dr. Ossian Sweet\\", The Detroit News, 12 February 2001 He practiced medicine briefly in Detroit, then continued his medical studies in Vienna and Paris before returning to Detroit in 1924 to accept a position at Dunbar Hospital. He began saving money for a home, and by the spring of the next year had saved $3500. Sweet used the $3500 as a down payment on a $18,500 house located on Garland Street in east Detroit. The Ossian Sweet House The house Sweet purchased is a 1¬Ω-story brick house,Ossian Sweet House from the National Park Service built in 1919,Home of Dr. Ossian Sweet from Detroit1701.org and is typical of many homes in working-class Detroit neighborhoods.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 2002, , p. 282 It is a bungalow-style structure with a full basement, an open porch on the first floor, and an enclosed sun porch on the south side.Sweet, Ossian H., House from the state of Michigan The second story is covered with brown shingling, and atop the house is a simple gable roof with a central dormer. The house is enclosed by an unpainted silver aluminum fence. The house is located on the corner of Garland and Charlevoix, in what was at the time an all-white neighborhood. Sweet chose a home in an all-white neighborhood because housing options in black neighborhoods were in general older and substandard, and he wanted better accommodations for his wife and daughter. Racial Tension in the 1920s and the events in September 1925 In the 1920s, white residents of Detroit tended to define themselves by the racial homogeneity of their neighborhoods. They also prided themselves in homeownership and interpreted the movement of blacks into their communities as a threat. Detroit's African American migrants were usually forced to locate to the east side where landlords took advantage of overcrowding and charged high rents. Barriers to black homeownership usually took the form of real estate agent's refusal to sell homes to blacks, threats of violence to enforce segregated barriers, and restrictive covenants that legally barred the movement of blacks into a neighborhood. The Sweets purchased their home in a mostly white immigrant area from an interracial couple. Since the couple was interracial, the Sweets had lessened fears about a violent retaliation from the white neighbors. However, the white neighbors believed that the previous couple had been white due to their lighter complexion. When the neighbors learned that the house was sold to an African American couple, they organized \\"The Waterworks Park Improvement Association\\" to oppose their presence in the neighborhood. Like other neighborhood groups, they banned together to preserve racial homogeneity and intended to maintain \\"the present high standards of the neighborhood.\\" Aware of tensions in the area, The Sweets delayed their move in until September and on September 8, 1925, Dr. Ossian Sweet and his wife Gladys moved into the area. The white neighborhood group that was aware of Sweet's imminent arrival had vowed to keep blacks out of the neighborhood. Sweet knew of the neighbors' animosity. He told his brother that he was \\"prepared to die like a man\\", and him arranged for some friends and relatives to stay with him for a few days. Along with company, he brought along guns and ammunition to protect himself against the looming confrontation. The neighborhood was tense, and groups of people gathered outside Sweet's home. The Detroit Police, sensing a grave situation, posted officers at the scene day and night. The following day, September 9, Sweet and his friends went to work. When they returned, the crowd had grown into a mob, throwing rocks and bottles. A Detroit News reporter, Philip A. Adler, later testified that the mob consisted of \\"400 and 500\\" people, throwing stones that hit the house \\"like hail.\\" This lasted until around 10pm, when shots rang out from the second-floor window, killing a man on a porch and wounding another in the crowd. The police arrested all the occupants of the house, charging each with murder. Aftermath The NAACP promised to help the defense, and brought in Clarence Darrow as chief counsel. He was assisted by Arthur Garfield Hays and Walter M. Nelson. Frank Murphy was the presiding judge. The jury consisted of twelve white men. Despite this, Darrow built an impressive case arguing self-defense, and the case ended in a hung jury. The prosecution decided to try the defendants individually the second time, and started with Ossian's brother Henry, but he was acquitted. Believing it could not gain convictions, the prosecution dropped charges against Ossian Sweet and remaining defendants. After the trials, Ossian Sweet rented the home on Garland to a white couple until 1930, when he moved back into the house. However, both his wife and two-year-old daughter Iva had died of tuberculosis in 1926. Sweet remarried twice, and divorced each time. In 1946, he sold the house, moving into the flat above a pharmacy he owned. In 1960, in failing health, Sweet took his own life. A state of Michigan historical marker stands in front of the house at 2905 Garland.Dr. Ossian Sweet/Home from michmarkers.com This marker reads: \\"Ossian Sweet House: African American physician Ossian Sweet and his wife, Gladys, purchased this home in May of 1925. When the Sweets moved into their home on September 8, white residents who objected to blacks moving into the neighborhood formed a crowd on the street. The next day hundreds of people converged on the corner of Charlevoix and Garland Streets intent on driving the Sweets from their home. The mob threw rocks and bricks at the house while the Sweets and nine others took refuge inside. In the evening shots rang out and a white man was killed. The police charged the people inside the Sweet house with murder. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored people hired attorney Clarence Darrow, who argued that people, regardless of their race have a right to protect their homes.\\"  Future for the Ossian Sweet House  The trial of Ossian Sweet and ten family members and friends for murder after defending their Detroit home captured media attention in the 1920s. The Ossian Sweet case exposed racial tensions in Detroit following the Great Migration and marked a legacy in the history of challenging segregation in the court system. On August 13th, 2018, Detroit city officials announced that they would grant 500,000 to purchase and rehabilitate the Sweet home and the two houses across the street. The Ossian Sweet Historic area is the site of deadly 1925 racial incident after the black family moved into the all-white neighborhood on Detroit's east side. The plan of action in transforming the space is in the preliminary stages. Currently, the Baxter family privately owns the home, but officials intend on making arrangements with the homeowner to preserve living quarters as well as place museum installments on the first floor for public visitations. Right now, there is a historic post on the lawn of the house that tours and visitors tend to frequent, but with the installation many more can learn about the importance of the case through scheduled visits. Mayor Mike Duggan said in the announcement of the grant: \\"As Detroit continues to move forward, we cannot forget where we‚Äôve been. Preserving the Dr. Sweet home and expanding the historic district will give us a chance to reflect on the struggles many African-American families have faced and celebrate champions like Dr. Sweet and others, who stood up for what is right.‚Äù *History of the African-Americans in Metro Detroit References Category:African-American history in Detroit Category:Houses in Detroit Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1919 Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:1919 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Ossian H.

Starting from 1682 he worked on a series of paintings ordered by Elector Palatine. These paintings depict scenes from the quotidian life of the Prince and his second wife, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici (Scenes from the life of the Court of D√ºsseldorf). Van Douven played a major role in the establishment of the Painting Gallery of the Palace of D√ºsseldorf. Van Douven also travelled to Vienna, accompanying the Elector Palatine on a journey. On this occasion he painted the portraits of the Emperor and the Empress. He also painted portraits of other princes and aristocrats or celebrities, such as the renowned musician Arcangelo Corelli.

History Hemming was formerly of early 1990s indie band She Talks to Angels, which included actor Paddy Considine, film director Shane Meadows and bassist Richard Eaton. Hemming wrote and performed music for the films A Room for Romeo Brass and Dead Man's Shoes. He was also a member of The Telescopes. In 2006 Hemming moved to London to work with multi-instrumentalist and producer Christian Hardy; the pair have subsequently built a live band drawn from members of Brighton's Willkommen Collective and further afield, notably Mike Siddell who previously played violin with Hope of the States and The Miserable Rich and currently performs with Lightspeed Champion and Troubles. Other members of the band played with The Miserable Rich and currently play with Sons of Noel and Adrian and more. The Leisure Society have been recipients of critical acclaim, being dubbed the English answer to popular U.S acts such as Grizzly Bear, Department of Eagles and Fleet Foxes. Their debut single, The Last of the Melting Snow, was honoured with a 2009 Ivor Novello nomination for Best Song Musically & Lyrically. In July 2009 the band signed with UK label Full Time Hobby, prompting the re-release of The Sleeper with a bonus EP entitled A Product of the Ego Drain. In September 2009, Brian Eno cited the band as \\"The only other thing I've been listening to lately with enthusiasm\\", calling it \\"Such a beautiful album\\". This prompted a meeting between Hemming, Hardy and Eno at Eno's London studio. The third single from The Sleeper, \\"Save It For Someone Who Cares\\", was also nominated for the Ivor Novello in the same category as the previous year, making the band one of very few consecutive nominees. The band covered children's song \\"Inchworm\\" from Hans Christian Andersen for American Laundromat Records charity CD Sing Me To Sleep ‚Äì Indie Lullabies, released in May 2010. Nick Hemming and Christian Hardy also play with childhood friend Tim West in The Climbers, whose debut album was released in May 2010. The band's second album Into The Murky Water was released in May 2011 and received glowing critical praise and gave the band their first chart position. The first single from the album, \\"This Phantom Life\\", was released with a video starring Green Wing's Mark Heap. In June 2011, the band were approached by Ray Davies to collaborate on his new songs, resulting in a performance as part of his Meltdown festival. In April 2013, the band's third studio album Alone Aboard the Ark was released, once again receiving a strong critical reaction from journalists and DJs. In April 2015, the band's fourth studio album The Fine Art of Hanging On was released, receiving the strongest critical reaction since their debut. In January 2019, the band announced that their fifth studio album, Arrivals & Departures would be released on 12 April 2019, via their own label, Ego Drain Records. Touring The Leisure Society's debut headline show at London's Bush Hall in January 2009 prompted a 5-star review from The Independent. Over the summer of 2009, the band performed across the UK and Europe, including at The Big Chill, the Green Man Festival and the End of the Road Festival. The band finished 2009 with a tour of Europe and the UK, culminating in a sold-out performance at St Giles' Church, London, and a session for BBC Radio 2's Janice Long. In January 2010, The Leisure Society toured The Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland, going on to play various festivals over the summer, including Glastonbury, The Big Chill, Summer Sundae and Vintage at Goodwood. The band performed a sell out UK and European tour through summer 2011 in support of Into The Murky Water, culminating in a performance at London's Barbican Centre backed by the 40-piece Heritage Orchestra. In October 2011, the band were asked by Laura Marling to accompany her on her tour of UK cathedrals. In August 2012, the band played at Greenbelt 2012.

It was founded in 1992 with the intention to establish an institution for ensuring efficient humanitarian aid to Polish victims of the Nazi- occupation and terror-rule. For these activities the foundation could use a financial budget pieced by different reparation payments to Poland, mainly form institutions financed by the German government and industry but also from Austria and various NGOs. These humanitarian aids financed by the reparation- budget were mainly paid out during the period from 1992-2005. Since that time the Foundation has permanently widened its activities. Currently there are four major fields of work: *Humanitarian aid, including medical support for victims of Nazi-crimes during the occupation of Poland in World War II *Historical education to improve the public knowledge about World War II, slave and forced labour (unfree labour) and the German occupation of Polish soil. Within this workfield, the foundation also organises permanent and non- permanent exhibitions in Germany and Poland.

Based in Los Angeles, California, the band are noted for their unusual sound, described as having the ability to make \\"'everyday sounds' become alluringly other\\". Lucky Dragons' performances include live music, video projection, and sounds created in collaboration with the audience. They have performed at the Smell, Echo Curio, Dublab, KCHUNG at major international art institutions and at the 2008 Whitney Biennial. History Lucky Dragons were formed in 1999 and have created 19 albums as of November 2008. As well as making music as part of the Lucky Dragons, the band also run a \\"weekly collaborative drawing society\\" called Sumi Ink Club and an internet community called Glaciers of Nice. Fischbeck explained that the duo were a band before they began creating just sounds. He said, \\"everything we've done since the beginning was to change the simple thing of what it means to be a band. This often, but not always, means making or rearranging sounds.\\" Style Though their songs have been described as having \\"entered the postsong age\\", Rara said that she felt music was \\"still very much in a song age\\" as \\"very few people are making work without a specific duration or end point\\". Rara said that the structure of Lucky Dragons' songs were very different, with some songs lasting only for \\"a few sputters\\" and with others that \\"revolve around shepherd tones and expand for hours\\". She stated that many of their songs \\"begin with improvisation\\" and said it was \\"like a game where the only rule is that each action must generate a kind of response or new action\\". The improvisation enables them to \\"keep moving in several new directions at once\\". Fischbeck said \\"a song in my mind is something that is completed once it is distributed and can come back in a changed form through a listening reaction\\" and was the element that enabled him to continue to call the band's music songs, as opposed to what he called \\"the much more technologically neutral 'tracks,' which [don't] imply any human interaction at all\\". The Stranger described two of the band's older albums, Norte√±as and Future Feeling, as \\"employ[ing] a scrappy indietronica approach that sounds like Icelandic cuties M√∫m if they were raised on UK post-punk spazzes Swell Maps and hit \\"record\\" while buzzed on Jolt.\\" Fischbeck noted that he felt the band's music was \\"maybe a mix between political and healing‚Äîmeditative punk...\\" Music production Rara stated that Lucky Dragons sometimes create two albums simultaneously, each with \\"completely different sensibilities\\", and upon completion decide which is better and release only that one. Fischbeck said that he liked \\"newness and creative reuse and multiple points of view\\" as the band edit sound to \\"isolate and amplify these aspects of everyday sounds.\\" The band use acoustic instruments to produce all of their sounds, though \\"the more 'pure' electronic sounds are processed recordings rather than generated from scratch\\". For a project entitled, Make a Baby, Luke Fischbeck attached a number of wires together so that when two people hold two different wires and touch, it creates sound. The project was said to be \\"like when Tom Hanks jumps on the keyboard steps in Big. Or when you go to the aquarium for the first time and you realize that's what a starfish feels like, self discovery, science and a taste of natural sorcery.\\" Live performances Rara said that the band's live performances are created with the idea that they should \\"generate equal power-sharing situations between members of the audience and ourselves.\\" This technique was described as \\"radical\\" as it was said to \\"encourage connections between show-goers over the standard-issue connection between a band and their creation and the audience's emotions\\".

History The RPG-30 was unveiled in 2008 by the State Research and Production Enterprise, Bazalt, as a modern anti-tank grenade launcher designed to address the challenge of reactive armor and active protection systems (APS) on tanks. Active protection systems such as ARENA-E, Drozd and Trophy defeat anti-armor munitions by destroying them before they reach their target. The RPG-30 is an intended response to the introduction of these systems. The RPG-30 cleared its testing program and entered service in 2012‚Äì2013 and was immediately put on the Pentagon's list of \\"asymmetrical threats to the US armed forces.\\"http://vpk.name/news/95505_oao_npo_bazalt_gotovo_obespechit_potrebnosti_minoboronyi_v_kratnom_uvelichenii_uchebnyih_strelb.htmlhttp://sputniknews.com/russia/20150918/1027179302/russia- grenade-launcher.html#ixzz3mAywiNFkhttp://tass.ru/en/defense/820411 Description The RPG-30, like the RPG-27, is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. Unlike the RPG-27 however, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a side tube, in addition to the main round in the main tube. The precursor round is fired shortly before the main round and acts as a decoy, tricking the target's active protection system (APS) into engaging it. The APS is not ready to engage again until 0.2‚Äì0.4 seconds later, allowing the main round time to hit the target. The PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a 105 mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 10.3 kg (22.7 lb) and has a range of 200 meters and a stated penetration capability in excess of 600 mm (24-in) of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA), 1,500 mm of reinforced concrete, 2,000 mm of brick and 3,700 mm of soil. Defenses In 2012 Israel Defense reported that the Rafael military-industrial corporation has developed a defense system, \\"Trench Coat\\", against the RPG-30, to supplement the existing Trophy. It consists of a 360-degree radar that detects all threats and launches 17 projectiles, of which one should strike the incoming missile.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/153102#.T0icm_WAna8 Israel7 Users * See also * Rocket-propelled grenade * RPG-7 * RPG-27 * RPG-29 * RPG-32 * List of Russian weaponry References External links *News article announcing the RPG-30. *The Firearm Blog Diagram, photo and video.

She was the only child of Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons, Sire d'Oisy, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt when she was a baby, leaving her the sole heiress to his titles and estates. In 1430, at the age of fifteen, Jeanne was one of the three women placed in charge of Joan of Arc when the latter was a prisoner in the castle of John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny, Jeanne's stepfather. She was the first wife of Louis of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, de Ligny, and Conversano, Constable of France. From their marriage descended Mary, Queen of Scots, King Henry IV of France and the subsequent Bourbon kings of France. Coat of arms of the Bar family.  Family  Jeanne was born in 1415, the only child of Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons, Sire d'Oisy (1390- 25 October 1415), whose own mother was Marie de Coucy, Countess of Soissons, granddaughter of English King Edward III of England. Her mother was Jeanne de B√©thune, Viscountess of Meaux (c.1397- late 1450). On 25 October 1415, her father was killed in the Battle of Agincourt, leaving Jeanne, who was a baby, as sole heiress to her father's titles and estates. In 1418, her mother married secondly John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny and de Guise (1392 ‚Äì 5 January 1441), son of John of Luxembourg, Sire de Beauvois and Marguerite of Enghien, Countess of Brienne and of Conversano. The marriage was childless. It was Jeanne's stepfather John who received Joan of Arc as his prisoner, and kept her at his castle of Beaurevoir. Joan, who was three years Jeanne's senior was placed in the care of Jeanne, her mother and Jeanne of Luxembourg, John's elderly aunt. The three ladies did all they could to comfort Joan in her captivity, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade her to abandon her masculine clothing for feminine attire. They earned Joan's gratitude for their kind and compassionate treatment of her. Despite the pleas of Jeanne and the other two women, John sold Joan of Arc to the English, who were his allies, for 10,000 livres. Louis of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, de Ligny, and Conversano, Constable of France, was the husband of Jeanne de Bar  Marriage and issue  On 16 July 1435, at the age of twenty, Jeanne married Louis of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Brienne, de Ligny, and Conversano, Constable of France (1418 ‚Äì 19 December 1475). The marriage took place at the Chateau de Bohain. She was Louis' first wife. Louis was the eldest son of Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Brienne, and Conversano, by his wife Margaret de Baux. Louis had been brought up by his paternal uncle, who was Jeanne's stepfather, John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny and Guise; therefore the young couple were well-acquainted with one another. John designated Louis as his heir to the counties of Ligny and Guise, but upon John's death in 1441, King Charles VII of France sequestered the estates and titles. The title of Ligny was eventually restored to Louis. The title and estates of Guise were given to Louis' youngest sister, Isabelle as her dowry, which passed to her husband, Charles, Count of Maine, upon their marriage in 1443. Jeanne succeeded as Viscountess of Meaux suo jure upon the death of her mother in late 1450. Jeanne and Louis had seven children: * John of Luxembourg, Count of Marle and Soissons, Governor of Burgundy (killed at the Battle of Morat on 22 June 1476) * Jacqueline of Luxembourg (died 1511), married Philippe de Croy, 2nd Count of Porcien, by whom she had issue. * Pierre II de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, de Ligny, Marle and Soissons (1448 ‚Äì 25 October 1482), on 12 July 1466, married Marguerite of Savoy (1439 Turin ‚Äì 9 March 1483 Bruges), the daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy and Anne de Lusignan of Cyprus, and widow of Giovanni IV Paleologo, Margrave of Montferrat, by whom he had issue, including Marie de Luxembourg (c. April 1467 ‚Äì 1 April 1547), wife of Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Count of Vend√¥me, and from whom Mary, Queen of Scots, King Henry IV of France, the subsequent Bourbon kings of France, and the Lorraine Dukes of Guise were directly descended. * Helene of Luxembourg (died 23 August 1488), married Janus of Savoy, Count of Faucigny, Governor of Nice (1440‚Äì1491), the brother of her sister-in-law, Marguerite of Savoy, by whom she had a daughter, Louise of Savoy (1467 ‚Äì 1 May 1530). * Charles of Luxembourg, Bishop of Laon (1447 ‚Äì 24 November 1509), had several illegitimate children by an unknown mistress. * Anthony I, Count of Ligny, Brienne, and Roussy (died 1519), married firstly Antoinette de Bauffr√©mont, Countess de Charny, by whom he had issue; he married secondly, Fran√ßoise de Cro√ø-Chimay, by whom he had issue; he married thirdly Gillette de Co√©livy. His last marriage was childless. By his mistress, Peronne de Machefert, he had an illegitimate son, Antoine of Luxembourg, Bastard of Brienne, who married and left descendants. * Philippe of Luxembourg (died 1521), Abbesse at Moncel  Death  Jeanne died on 14 May 1462 aged about forty-seven years. Her husband married secondly Marie of Savoy (20 March 1448 ‚Äì 1475), daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy and Anne of Cyprus , by whom he had three more children.

It existed under several different sponsored names but was most commonly known as the Citizen Cup (1987‚Äì1995) or the Betty Barclay Cup (1999‚Äì2002). It was held in Hamburg, Germany and was played on outdoor clay courts. It existed as a lower tier tournament in the first five years of its run but in 1990 was promoted to Tier II status which it maintained for the rest of its run. Steffi Graf holds the record for the most wins at the event, winning it six times consecutively from 1987‚Äì1992. She also finished runner-up a further two times. The event is also infamous for being the location where Monica Seles, then- world No.1, was stabbed on April 30, 1993 by a disorderly local tennis fan during a quarterfinal match with Magdalena Maleeva. Seles never played in Germany again after the incident.

The township of Wycheproof is located on the hillside, and a unique geological substance known as Wycheproofite is exclusive to the local area. History The township of Wycheproof is located on the hill's south western slopes The settlement was started as early as 1846, but the township was not surveyed until 1875. The name 'Wycheproof' originates from the local Aboriginal language, 'wichi- poorp', meaning 'grass on a hill'. The hill plays a role in the local community, with annual races to the hilltop. There are many walking tracks in the area, and local wildlife such as emus and kangaroos can be seen. Geology Mount Wycheproof is a granite outcrop. Located in a flat grassland area, the rounded terrain of Mount Wycheproof is consistent with that of the surrounding area. Sharing several similarities to nearby Pyramid Hill, Mount Wycheproof is part of the low-lying Terrick Terrick range. The mountain rises to a height of above sea level or only above the surrounding plains, The hill is characterised by a rocky, conical peak, common in the western areas of Victoria. Phosphate materials are relatively rare in Victoria, yet the Wycheproof area is known to have its own unique mineral, known as Wycheproofite. Wycheproofite can be characterised by its pinkish colour and its transparency.

A Twenty20 International (T20I) is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having T20I status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The first T20I was played between Australia and New Zealand on 17 February 2005. Bermuda played their first T20I under the captaincy of Irving Romaine at the Civil Service Cricket Club, Stormont, Belfast, on 3 August 2008, against Scotland. This match took place during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, which took place between 2-5 August 2008. Bermuda played a total of three matches during this tournament and lost them all, failing to qualify for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. Bermuda later lost their T20I status after the 2009 World Cup Qualifier, in which they finished ninth. In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

The CZ 550 series is available with a medium or magnum sized action. The CZ 550 rifle resembles the Mauser 98 rifle series, though it is not an exact copy. Since the CZ 550 magnum size action can be chambered for super magnum cartridges some elephant gun wildcat cartridges were tested (see .585 Gehringer) and others specially designed (see .600 Overkill) with and for this action. Design details As a modern civilian offspring of the Karabiner 98k service rifle the CZ 550 series offers several features and factory options, that are also typical for sporterised Mauser Karabiner 98k ex-service rifles, ranging from various technical departures from the basic Mauser service rifle on to luxury wood grades. Some of the available options were originally developed and introduced by John Rigby & Co. on Rigby Mauser hunting rifles. Operating mechanism The operating mechanism of the CZ 550 series is based on the Mauser M 98 controlled-feed bolt action system though it is not an exact copy. The original Mauser M 98 is a simple, strong, safe, and well-thought-out design that inspired other military and hunting/sporting rifle designs that became available during the 20th century. For the CZ 550 series the action system is machined out of high- grade steel. It also features a double square bridge for mounting a telescopic sight. Features CZ 550 elephant gun/stopper rifle chambered for the .585 Gehringer wildcat cartridge. The CZ 550 system consists of a receiver that serves as the systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three locking lugs, two large main lugs at the bolt head and a third safety lug underneath the bolt handle acting as a backup. The bolt handle is permanently attached to the bolt and is turned-down and backwards for use with optical sights. Another distinctive feature of the CZ 550 system is the controlled- feed mechanism, consisting of a large, non-rotating claw extractor that engages the cartridge case rim as soon as the round leaves the magazine and firmly holds the cartridge case until the round is ejected by the ejector, mounted inside the receiver. The CZ 550 bolt action will cycle correctly irrespective of the way the rifle is moved or positioned during the bolt cycling action or if the cartridge has been fired or not. Only if the bolt is not brought back far enough, sharply enough, in a controlled round feed bolt action the cartridge case may not be cleanly ejected and a jam may result. The bolt houses the firing pin mechanism that visually and tactilely protrudes from the rear of the bolt indicating if the action is cocked or not. A small disassembly button offers the possibility to access the firing pin and spring. The action features a large gas relief hole at the bolt body designed to protect the user's head in case of a primer or cartridge rupture or detonation. When the action suffers a catastrophic failure it is designed to deflect the debris away from the operator's face. The CZ 550 bolt group can be easily removed from the receiver simply by pushing the disassembly button, located at the left wall of the receiver, and then by rotating and pulling the bolt out. Safety A horizontal two-position safety is mounted on the right side just behind the bolt system. The safety locks the bolt and sear. The user interface consists of a rather compact grooved button that should ensure good operability of the safety with low mounted aiming optics. Trigger The single set trigger on a CZ-550 operates as a single stage during normal operation. However, when it is desirable to have less trigger pull, such as for longer range or very accurate shooting, the trigger can be pushed forward, making it a set trigger. These rifles are factory set with the trigger pull set at approximately in standard mode and approximately in the set mode. Both settings are adjustable. Barrel The rifles have hammer forged steel barrels. Ammunition feeding For some models the internal magazine of the CZ 550 series M 98 system consists of an integral box machined to match the cartridge for which the rifle was being chambered, with a detachable floorplate, that can hold up to 5 standard sized rifle cartridges. Other models are fed by detachable box magazines, that can hold up to four standard-sized rifle cartridges. The detachable magazines are released by a magazine release located at the front of the trigger guard. Sights Depending on the model various open sight are mounted as standard. All CZ 550 receivers, except the Minnesota and Scandinavia models, have a 19 mm dovetail rail milled into the top of the front and rear of the receiver as factory preparation for telescopic sight mounts (bases in square bridge) or complete mounts for telescopic sights with or without a mounting rail. Stock The stocks vary from model to model and can be made out of wood or polymers. On CZ 550 MAGNUM STANDARD, HA 550 HUNTER, CZ 550 MAGNUM LUX and CZ 550 SAFARI MAGNUM models one or two steel cross bolts are mounted to distribute the forces and hence the effects of recoil on the stock bedding, reducing the chance to split the stock.

He had linkages with the Varkari tradition as well as the Nath tradition of Maharashtra. He preached the omnipresence of God and thus denounced idol-worship. Though a staunch Shaiva, Visoba has composed verses in praise of the god Vithoba, the patron deity of the Varkari faith. He has also composed a metaphysical treatisecalled the Shatsthala. Etymology The name Visoba is derived from the word vi·π£·πáein, which means to relax and relates to the meeting of Visoba with Namdev. The latter part of the name Khechara (lit. \\"one who is moving in air\\") relates him being a Siddha, a Tantric master possessing magical powers and his linkage to the Nath tradition of Maharashtra. Another theory relates his name khechara, literally meaning a mule in Marathi, as the name Dnyaneshwar and Muktai called him in contempt, when Visoba refused to believe in their powers.Ranade p. 189 Life Visoba either lived in Amvadhya or Barshi. The story of Visoba's transformation is told in Mahipati's Bhaktivijaya. In the text, Visoba's real name is said to be Visoba Chati. He is described as a Panchal Brahmin, who was jeweller by profession, and hated J√±ƒÅne≈õvar and his siblings and created obstacles in their path. Once, when J√±ƒÅne≈õvar's sister Muktabai went to get some earthenware from the potter, Visoba struck her angrily and disallowed the potter to sell her his pans. Disheartened, Muktabai returned home and told the tale to J√±ƒÅne≈õvar. The text says he heated his back by his yogic powers and Muktai baked the food on his back. Astonished by seeing this miracle, Visoba repented and asked for forgiveness from J√±ƒÅne≈õvar. Initially, J√±ƒÅne≈õvar calls Visoba \\"a mule\\", which gave him the name \\"Visoba Khechara\\".Mahipati pp.152-6 Visoba had refused to acknowledge J√±ƒÅne≈õvar and Muktabai, but after knowing their spiritual greatness he became their disciple. Even though older than J√±ƒÅne≈õvar, he is described as his servant (\\"Kimkara\\") by Bahinabai.Mahipati p. xxxvii According to the text Dnyandev Gatha, J√±ƒÅne≈õvar and Muktabai instructed Namdev to journey to Aundha Nagnath Temple in search of a proper guru. In the temple, Namdev finds Visoba resting with his feet on the sacred lingam, the symbol of Shiva. Namdev reproached him for having insulted Shiva. Visoba asked Namdev to place his feet elsewhere, wherever Namdev placed Visoba's feet a Linga sprang up. Thus, through his yogic powers, Visoba filled the whole temple with Shiva-lingas and taught Namdev the omnipresence of God. Other texts which record Visoba as the guru of Namdev are the Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism. Some texts call him Visoba Khecharnath Nathpanthi, linking him to the Nath tradition.Callewaert p. 19 He also accompanied J√±ƒÅne≈õvar and Namdev on their pilgrimages. He died in Barshi on Shravana Shuddha Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the Hindu month Shravana, in 1309. Teachings and literary works Visoba denounced idol-worship and advises Namdev to not worship God as a stone image. He says: Visoba wrote abhangs in praise of the god Vithoba, the patron-deity of the Varkari tradition.Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1987) p. 40 The J√±ƒÅndev GƒÅtha also mentions Khechara as playing at the Gopal-kala festival in the Pandharpur where Vithoba's chief temple is located along with the brothers J√±ƒÅne≈õvar, Nivruttinath and Sopan. This also suggests Visoba being a devotee of Vithoba. Visoba has also written a manuscript called Satsthal.Callewaert p. 35 Notes References * The Sants By Karine Schomer, W. H.

The city is a commune and a da√Øra of the wilaya of Tissemsilt. It was known as Moli√®re during the French occupation of Algeria (1830‚Äì1962), and then as Beni Hendel until 1975. The city is elevated 1098 m above sea level and is attached to Sid Aamar (le Grand Pic) of the Ouarsenis mountains, which rises to 1985 m. After independence from France, the city held the name Beni Hendel, which was a Berber tribe living in the area several centuries ago. After 1975 the city took its current name, Bordj Bounaama, in memorial to the martyr Si M'hamed Bounaama (also known as Djilali Bounaama) who was born in the city in 1926, and who was the head of the fourth region during the Algerian War of Independence against the French Army (1954‚Äì1962) before being killed in Blida on August 8, 1961. Bordj Bounaama was part of the Departement d'Oran during the French occupation, before joining Al-Asnam (now Chlef) after independence. With the change of name in 1975, it joined the wilaya of Tiaret, before becoming part of the wilaya of Tissemsilt created during administrative redistribution in 1984.

He is currently a free agent. Adeyemi started his professional career at Championship club Norwich City in 2008, having progressed through the club's youth ranks, and made his professional debut for the club in 2009. During his five-year spell at the club as a professional, he made eleven league appearances. He spent the 2010‚Äì11 season on loan to League Two club Bradford City, where he made 34 league appearances, and the next season on loan to Oldham Athletic of League One, making 36 league appearances. He was sent out on loan again for the 2012‚Äì13 season, this time to League One club Brentford, where he made 30 league appearances. He joined Championship club Birmingham City in July 2013 on a free transfer, having been released by Norwich, and a year later moved again, to fellow Championship club Cardiff City. After struggling to establish himself in the first team, he spent time on loan with Leeds United and Rotherham United before being released and joining Ipswich Town. Early life Adeyemi was born in Milton Keynes, moving to Norwich with his family at the age of five after his father started a job in the area. He attended Norwich School. He declined a university offer from the University of Cambridge to pursue his footballing career, subsequently gaining A* grades at Advanced Level in Biology and Chemistry and an A grade in Mathematics. Club career Norwich City Adeyemi began his career with Norwich City, joining the club's youth system at the age of nine. He grew up supporting the club and was a season ticket holder alongside his father and grandfather before joining the playing staff. Having progressed through the youth ranks, he signed his first professional contract in November 2008 and made his debut for Norwich's first team on 8 August 2009, as a substitute for Matthew Gill during their heavy 7‚Äì1 defeat to Colchester United on the opening day of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Three days later, he was handed his first start in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Yeovil Town in the League Cup. Manager Glenn Roeder, who gave him his professional contract, described him: > \\"He's very athletic, technically very gifted and one of the nicest young men > that I've ever dealt with. He comes from a lovely family, and academically > he's incredibly intelligent ‚Äì I don't think he got anything less than an A > grade in his GCSEs. My son goes to the same school and the headmaster told > me if Tom decides at any point he doesn't want to play football he can go > back to Norwich School, get his A levels and end up at Oxford or Cambridge, > and I don't think he means their football teams!\\" In March 2010, Adeyemi was named League One Apprentice of the Year at the Football League Awards. He made seventeen appearances for Norwich during his first season, helping the club win promotion to the Championship, and was rewarded with a new contract set to run until 2012. In July 2010, following Norwich City's promotion to the Championship, Adeyemi joined League Two club Bradford City on an initial six-month loan deal, later extended to a full season loan. He scored on his debut in a 3‚Äì1 loss against Shrewsbury Town. He featured heavily for the club, making 34 league appearances, as they endured a difficult season, finishing 18th. =Oldham Athletic (loan)= Adeyemi signed for League One club Oldham Athletic on a five-month loan deal in August 2011. Adeyemi made his debut for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw with local rivals Huddersfield Town. He scored his first goal for Oldham against Milton Keynes Dons in a 2‚Äì1 win. During Oldham's FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool at Anfield, Adeyemi claimed he was the target of racist abuse from an individual in the stands. With ten minutes of the match remaining, he became involved in an altercation with fans after the alleged incident and was restrained by the match referee and teammates. An arrest was made, but the Crown Prosecution Service found \\"insufficient evidence to bring any criminal charges\\". His loan deal was extended by a further month in January 2012 and extended again in February. On 11 April 2012, at the end of Adeyemi's loan deal, Oldham decided not to extend his deal until the end of the season and allowed him to return to parent club Norwich City. He made 45 appearances and scored three goals. Adeyemi stated that he was open to the possibility of a permanent move to Oldham. =Brentford (loan)= He joined League One club Brentford on a six- month loan deal on 29 August 2012, signed by Uwe R√∂sler. Adeyemi impressed in the centre of midfield and extended his loan until the end of the season. He played in the dramatic final match of the regular season, against Doncaster Rovers, in which Brentford's Marcello Trotta missed a last-minute penalty which would have earned Brentford automatic promotion, only for Doncaster to run up to the opposite end of the pitch and score a winner. Brentford entered the play-offs, in which they beat Swindon Town in the semi-final only for Adeyemi to be on the losing team in the final, beaten 2‚Äì1 by Yeovil Town. Towards the end of the season, Adeyemi stated his desire to return to Brentford on loan for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Birmingham City On 24 June 2013, following his release from Norwich, Adeyemi signed a two-year contract with Championship club Birmingham City. Manager Lee Clark described him as \\"a terrific young lad who is a powerful and athletic midfield player who can get forward and score goals.\\" He made his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to Watford on 3 August, and remained a regular member of the starting eleven. He scored the winning penalty during a shootout, albeit off the crossbar and the goalkeeper's back, to defeat Yeovil Town in the second round of the League Cup, and scored his first goal in the third round as Birmingham beat holders Swansea City 3‚Äì1. He stole the ball on the edge of Swansea's penalty area and knocked it to Chris Burke; Burke's return pass left Adeyemi a tap-in. In the latter part of 2013, Birmingham went ten games unbeaten with a team built around a \\"spine\\" of Adeyemi and loanees Kyle Bartley, Dan Burn and Jesse Lingard, but the loanees were recalled, Adeyemi suffered a back injury which appeared to restrict his physicality when he was fit to play, and the team struggled. He was able to produce a strong performance on the final day of the season, when Birmingham avoided relegation on goal difference. He was chosen as the club's young player of the season, and felt that his increasing maturity was allowing him to take on more responsibility. Ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Clark appointed Adeyemi vice-captain. Ten days later, amid interest from Cardiff City, he submitted a transfer request. Birmingham manager Clark called losing Adeyemi \\"gutting\\". Cardiff City Adeyemi playing for Cardiff City in 2015 Adeyemi signed a three-year contract with Championship club Cardiff City, managed by Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r, on 7 August 2014. The fee was undisclosed, but reported in the Birmingham Mail as \\"in excess of ¬£1 million, with add-ons [and] a sell-on clause\\". Solskj√¶r later revealed that he followed Adeyemi's career for several years after spotting him playing for Norwich's youth team. On 26 December, Adeyemi scored his first goal for Cardiff with a header that earned his team a point in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Charlton Athletic. On 20 January 2015, he received the man of the match award in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Middlesbrough. However, he fell out of favour following Solskj√¶r's dismissal and struggled to establish himself in the first team under new boss Russell Slade, making just ten starts for Cardiff. =Leeds United (loan)= On 14 July 2015, Adeyemi joined Championship rivals Leeds United on a season-long loan with the option of a permanent deal, which would potentially be worth ¬£1m. The move to Leeds saw Adeyemi link up with his former Brentford manager Uwe R√∂sler. Adeyemi made his debut for Leeds in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Burnley on the opening day of the season. On 29 August, he scored his first competitive goal for Leeds with a header in the first half of the 2‚Äì1 win over Derby County. Having featured regularly during the first half of the season, he struggled for playing time following the appointment of Steve Evans as manager. He made only two late substitute appearances in January, which led Evans to deny speculation that the loan spell could be terminated early and Adeyemi expressed a desire to fight for his place. However, he made only three further appearances during the season and, at the end of the season, Leeds rejected to take up their option to sign him on a permanent basis. =Rotherham United (loan)= On 18 August 2016, Adeyemi joined Championship club Rotherham United on a season-long loan, making his debut two days later in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Brentford in the club's first league win of the season. Following the appointment of Paul Warne as manager, Adeyemi enjoyed an upturn in form, netting his first goal for the club in Warne's first match on 3 December 2016 during a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Burton Albion. Having not scored prior, Adeyemi went on to score a further six goals in twenty appearances under Warne and, at the end of the season, he was named Rotherham's Player of Year as the club suffered relegation to League One. With Adeyemi's contract with Cardiff coming to an end, he attracted interest from several clubs and Rotherham manager Warne confirmed that the club had offered him a \\"brilliant deal\\" but expected the bid to be rejected due to Adeyemi's desire to remain in the Championship. Ipswich Town Adeyemi moved to Ipswich Town on 30 June 2017, signing a two-year contract after rejecting offers from several other clubs. His debut for the club was delayed after he contracted an illness soon after his arrival, followed by a calf strain on his return to training. He eventually made his first appearance for the club as a substitute in place of Flynn Downes during a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Queens Park Rangers. After making four further appearances, Adeyemi struggled to return to fitness for the club, being ruled out until January with a hamstring injury. On his comeback from his initial injury, he suffered a further blow after lasting just 32 minutes of an under-23 fixture. After three further months out, Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy confirmed that Adeyemi would miss the remainder of the 2017‚Äì18 season, having made only five appearances throughout the year. During the club's preseason training the following season, Adeyemi suffered further injury problems after damaging his achilles. Newly appointed Ipswich manager Paul Hurst expressed his frustration over Adeyemi's injuries but claimed that it was time to \\"grit his teeth\\", also stating \\"There's obviously something (an injury) there but there's another player in the squad that has something very similar who has trained every day. [...] We all have different pain thresholds but I'm wanting people I can rely on and go to war with.\\" However, Adeyemi failed to make an appearance for the club during the 2018‚Äì19 season. He was released by the club at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season following the expiration of his contract. International career The son of a Nigerian father, Adeyemi is eligible for both the Nigeria and England national teams. He has previously represented England at under-17 level. Style of play Adeyemi was described by Birmingham manager Lee Clark as a \\"powerful and talented midfielder\\". R√∂sler assessed him as composed. Solskj√¶r expected him to be \\"a top, top player\\" for Cardiff, as \\"a box to box midfielder [who] can attack and defend. He wins the ball really well for us, switches the play and scores goals as well\\". Adeyemi has described his own playing style, stating \\"With my size, I bring a physical presence. I can break up play and I like to think, as all players do, that I can play a bit too. I think I'm quite an all-round midfielder in how I can impact a game.\\" Career statistics { class= style=text-align:center +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=4Norwich City 2009‚Äì10 League One 110002040170 - 2011‚Äì12 Premier League 00colspan=2‚Äî00colspan=2‚Äî00 - 2012‚Äì13 Premier League 00colspan=2‚Äî00colspan=2‚Äî00 - !colspan=2Total !110002040170 - Bradford City (loan) 2010‚Äì11 League Two 345101010375 - Oldham Athletic (loan) 2011‚Äì12 League One 36240colspan=2‚Äî51453 - Brentford (loan) 2012‚Äì13 League One 30251colspan=2‚Äî40393 - Birmingham City 2013‚Äì14 Championship 3511042colspan=2‚Äî403 - Cardiff City 2014‚Äì15 Championship 2012010colspan=2‚Äî231 - Leeds United (loan) 2015‚Äì16 Championship 2321000colspan=2‚Äî242 - Rotherham United (loan) 2016‚Äì17 Championship 2961100colspan=2‚Äî307 - rowspan=3Ipswich Town 2017‚Äì18 Championship 500000colspan=2‚Äî50 - 2018‚Äì19 Championship 000000colspan=2‚Äî00 - !colspan=2Total !5000000050 - !colspan=3Career total !223191528214126024 } Honours Club Norwich City *Football League One: 2009‚Äì10 Individual *Birmingham City Young Player of the Year: 2013‚Äì14 *Football League One Apprentice of the Year: 2009‚Äì10 References External links * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:People from Milton Keynes Category:Sportspeople from Buckinghamshire Category:Sportspeople from Norwich Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Rotherham United F.C. players Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:People educated at Norwich School Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English people of Nigerian descent ","title":"Tom Adeyemi"},{"id":"20307692","text":"John Macdonell Sir John Macdonell (1 August 1846 - 17 March 1921) was a British jurist.

Early life  R√≥ger P√©rez de la Rocha‚Äôs parents were Teresa P√©rez Rocha and Luis Franco Cort√©s. He was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church as R√≥ger Antonio. As P√©rez himself explains, his name, following the usual practice in Spanish-speaking countries, should actually be R√≥ger Antonio Franco P√©rez, but since his father was married to another woman at the time of his birth, he assumed both his mother‚Äôs surnames and even added the ‚Äúde la‚Äù to make it sound better. In 1957, R√≥ger was sent to live with his grandmother, Josefa Rocha, when his mother‚Äôs epilepsy made it impossible for her to care for her son. Josefa Rocha‚Äôs alcoholic husband, Gonzalo P√©rez Estrada, was dead, leaving her widowed and needing to work hard for a living, as she had eight children to care for ‚Äì seven of her own and R√≥ger. R√≥ger did not see much of his father when he was a boy, and in 1961, Luis Franco Cort√©s found himself in Cuba, obliged as he then was to spend time in exile.  Career  P√©rez entered the National Academy of Fine Arts in Managua in 1964. He continued his studies at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid in 1968. He was director of the Upper School of Fine Arts at the Autonomous University of Nicaragua in Le√≥n in 1971. That same year, he joined the Praxis Group, a group of artists centred at the gallery of the same name. It was active from 1963 to 1972.http://www.artnet.de/library/06/0692/t069271.asp Artnet He was a founding member of the Asociaci√≥n Sandinista de Trabajadores de la Cultura (ASTC; ‚ÄúSandinista Association of Workers in Culture‚Äù) and director of the Uni√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes (‚ÄúNational Union of the Fine Arts‚Äù) once the Sandinistas came to power in the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979. P√©rez furthermore completed studies in metal engraving at the Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City. From the 1970s and, especially, through the 1980s, working from photographs, P√©rez painted a whole series of portraits of Nicaragua‚Äôs national hero, Augusto C√©sar Sandino as well as his generals and soldiers, creating a whole Sandinista iconography. El Nuevo Diario A portrait of Sandino can be seen in the background of the video under External links. He has exhibited with other artists in Panama, Cuba, Brazil, the United States, Peru, Spain, France, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, Mexico and Central America, and alone in Spain, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Mexico. R√≥ger P√©rez de la Rocha also had a hand in setting up the artists' colony in the Solentiname Islands in Lake Nicaragua. In 1990 he was honoured with the Orden de la Independencia Cultural Rub√©n Dar√≠o, conferred by the Government of Nicaragua.

After taking part to a popular insurrection in Modena and participating to a military campaign of the Savoy army, he was forced to expatriate. He moved to Paris in 1834, remaining there for 14 years. In the famous Caf√© de la R√©gence he played many games with the foremost French players, being recognized as a strong master. In 1845 he drew a match with Lionel Kieseritzky (+7 ‚Äì7 =1).

The articles included many diagrams with exercises and endgame studies, most of them composed by himself. He is regarded as the first composer to treat with some depth the theme of underpromotion. In 1848 he returned to Italy and enlisted in the Piedmont army, taking part in many military campaigns for the cause of Italian unification. In December 1849 he played a series of matches in Modena against the strongest local players, winning most of them: Francesco Discart (+10 ‚Äì5 =2), Carlo Bonetti (+8 ‚Äì8 = 4), Francesco Luppi (+4 -0 =0), Marchisio (+2 -0 =0). In 1859 he was appointed to command the Florence stronghold of the Piedmont army and afterwards he was sent to Parma as an aid to the army general Zucchi.

His work is best known for the way in which it examines the intersections between different philosophical schools and traditions, bringing together thinkers and philosophical insights that would otherwise remain separated by the analytic/continental divide in 20th century philosophy. The pragmatic and dialogical ethos that pervades his works has also been displayed in a number of philosophical exchanges with other contemporary thinkers like Hannah Arendt, J√ºrgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, Agnes Heller, and Charles Taylor. Bernstein is an engaged public intellectual concerned not only with the specialized debates of academic philosophy, but also with the larger issues that touch upon social, political, and cultural aspects of contemporary life. Throughout his life Bernstein has actively endorsed a number of social causes and has been involved in movements of participatory democracy, upholding some of the cardinal virtues of the American pragmatist tradition, including a commitment to fallibilism, engaged pluralism, and the nurturing of critical communities. Early life and education Bernstein was born May 14, 1932 in Brooklyn to a second-generation Jewish immigrant family. The youngest of three children, he attended Midwood High School, a public high school in Brooklyn where he first met his future wife Carol L. Bernstein. Too young to be drafted into the Second World War, Bernstein enrolled as an undergraduate in the University of Chicago, where he fell in love with philosophy, eventually writing an honors thesis entitled ‚ÄúLove and Friendship in Plato: A Study of the Lysis and the Phaedrus‚Äù. His classmates included Susan Sontag, Philip Roth, Mike Nichols, George Steiner, and the person who would become one of Bernstein's closest friends and philosophical interlocutors, Richard Rorty. Upon graduation, and partly because he needed more credits to begin graduate studies, Bernstein returned to New York City for a couple of years to study at Columbia University where he took courses on a variety of subjects, ranging from ancient Greek to book binding, and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree, graduating summa cum laude. In 1953, following Rorty's advice, he went to Yale University to pursue graduate studies in philosophy, writing a dissertation on John Dewey's Metaphysics of Experience. This was a time when interest in Dewey was reaching an all-time low, partly due to the rising influence of analytic philosophy and the prejudiced conviction that there was not much to be learned from the Classical American Pragmatists. Indeed, for many philosophers under the sway of the analytic wave, the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey was just a half-baked version of the real philosophical inquiries being conducted by analytic philosophy. From early on, however, Bernstein became more and more aware of the damaging consequences of what he labeled ‚Äúanalytic ideology‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúthe belief that the analytic style is the only game in town and the rest of philosophy is to be dismissed as simply not really worthwhile.‚Äù Of course, this ‚Äúanalytic ideology‚Äù should not be confused with the hard-won results of analytic philosophy. One of the reasons he decided to go to Yale was because it was one of the few departments that resisted this questionable ideology, offering a stimulating atmosphere where thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche were read with the same enthusiasm and seriousness as Wittgenstein and Carnap. There, he studied under a remarkable group of teachers, including Carl Gustav Hempel, John Smith, George Schrader, and Paul Weiss. Career Bernstein began to teach his first courses at Yale around 1954, when he was 22 years old. In 1958 after a year as Fulbright lecturer in Hebrew University, he returned to Yale as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy. His return coincided with the arrival of a new member of the faculty, a thinker that would greatly influence Bernstein's own work and his approach to philosophy, Wilfrid Sellars. As Bernstein recalls: ‚Äúit was Sellars who taught me that one could employ analytic techniques to deal with fundamental philosophic issues. I strongly admired the way in which he combined a sophisticated understanding of the history of philosophy with the ‚Äònew way of words‚Äô and I attended many of his seminars during a highly creative stage of his philosophic development.‚Äù In 1964 he became the editor of The Review of Metaphysics, the philosophic journal founded by Paul Weiss, and one of the few that accepted contributions from different traditions and schools of thought. In its pages one could find articles from prominent analytic thinkers like Quine and Sellars side-by-side with articles by Leo Strauss and even translations of Heidegger. That same year he joined a group of faculty to participate in the Civil Rights Movement and anti-Vietnam War protests, and in the summer he traveled to Mississippi to take part in the Freedom Summer Project of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1965, after teaching at Yale for almost ten years, and in spite of having the unanimous support of the entire philosophy faculty and a large number of students, he was denied tenure by the Yale Tenure Committee. This event, which is sometimes referred to as the Bernstein Affair, sparked a number of student protests and eventually led to reforms in the tenure system at Yale.. Professor Paul Weiss summed up the inconformity of the philosophical community when he stated that ‚Äúthe committee came to its conclusion slowly and conscientiously, but that does not mean that its decision was not stupid, unfair, dismaying, and one from which it will take this university and the department a long time to recover.‚Äù Other philosophy departments soon tried to recruit the young Bernstein, who after considering offerings from more than thirty institutions decided to go to Haverford College, a prestigious liberal arts college where he taught for the following 23 years. During his time at Haverford, Bernstein published some of his most famous books, including Praxis and Action: Contemporary Philosophies of Human Activity (1971), The Restructuring of Social and Political Theory (1978), Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics and Praxis (1983), and Philosophical Profiles: Essays in a Pragmatic Mode (1986). In 1972 he met J√ºrgen Habermas, establishing a friendship that has grown over the years and that is reflected in the exchanges and projects they have undertaken in the last forty years. In 1976, while spending a semester in Haverford, Habermas asked Bernstein to join him in directing a seminar to be held in Dubrovnik in support of eight dissident Yugoslavian Marxists of the Praxis group who had been dismissed from Belgrade University because of their political views. This rather informal gesture of solidarity became an international institution, attracting, over the years, a group of intellectuals including Albrecht Wellmer, Charles Taylor, Anthony Giddens, Cornelius Castoriadis, Richard Rorty, Alain Touraine, Agnes Heller, and the young graduate students Seyla Benhabib, Nancy Fraser, and Judith Butler. Bernstein's involvement in the Dubrovnik seminar expanded when, in 1980, he became the founding co-editor of Praxis International, the successor of the important Yugoslav journal Praxis, where critics of Stalinism and proponents of a ‚ÄúMarxist humanism‚Äù would write. In 1989 Bernstein was elected president of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, delivering a presidential address entitled ‚ÄúPragmatism, Pluralism, and the Healing of Wounds‚Äù. That same year he was invited to join the Graduate faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York City, which at the time was experiencing great hardships and desperately needed to recreate itself. Together with Agnes Heller and Reiner Sch√ºrmann, Bernstein led the reconstruction of the philosophy department, and he served as chair from 1989 to 2002. During his time at the New School Bernstein has written books on Hannah Arendt, Sigmund Freud, Radical Evil, Pragmatism, Violence, and Irony. Philosophical themes Fusion of philosophical horizons Bernstein work embodies the pragmatist ethos that he has tirelessly articulated since his first publications. For him, engaged pluralism, fallibilism, and public deliberation are not abstract philosophical concepts but practical guidelines that must orient responsible action. Thanks to this dialogical approach, he has played a crucial role in broadening the philosophical horizon of American philosophy. Bernstein ‚Äúhas the rare capacity to weave a coherent vision out of the disparate strands of seemingly conflicting intellectual traditions. He has regularly showed us how to see past surface contradictions to the underlying problems we share and to the sometimes common assumptions that animate contemporary sensibilities.‚Äù Moreover, Bernstein has ‚Äúopened pragmatism to international intellectual currents, including phenomenology, deconstruction, and critical theory. The result has been a more cosmopolitan pragmatism, one less centered on the United States and more appropriate to a globalizing world.‚Äù It is Bernstein's conviction that many of the themes of classical American pragmatism have resurfaced in the work of some of the most prominent twentieth and twenty- first-century philosophers. This is what he calls the Pragmatic Turn in philosophy, a subtle but important shift that has brought together thinkers as diverse as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Putnam, Habermas, Honneth, and Brandom. Overcoming the Cartesian anxiety In his 1983 book Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis, Bernstein diagnosed a serious issue that affects much of modern philosophy as it oscillates unendingly between two untenable positions; on the one hand, the dogmatic search for absolute truths, and on the other, the conviction that ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù when it comes to the justification of our most cherished beliefs and ideas. According to Bernstein, what underlies this predicament is a deep longing for certainty, the urge ‚Äúto find some fixed point, some stable rock upon which we can secure our lives against the vicissitudes that constantly threaten us.‚Äù This is what he calls the Cartesian anxiety, a mostly unacknowledged existential fear that seems to lead us ineluctably to a grand Either/Or: ‚ÄúEither there is some support for our being, a fixed foundation for our knowledge, or we cannot escape the forces of darkness that envelop us with madness, with intellectual and moral chaos‚Äù. Although in philosophy this Cartesian anxiety mostly shows up in the discussion of epistemological issues, Bernstein is pointing to something much deeper and universal with this notion, something that permeates almost every aspect of life and has serious ethical and political consequences. After all, it has been in the name of religious and ideological absolutes that some of the greatest atrocities and injustices in human history have been perpetrated. Bernstein's strategy to exorcize the Cartesian Anxiety is to challenge its underlying assumption, namely, that the only type of foundations that can support our knowledge of the world and our everyday practices must be unshakeable and eternally fixed. Appealing to the ancient tradition of practical philosophy, and some of its contemporary proponents like Hannah Arendt, J√ºrgen Habermas, and Hans-Georg-Gadamer, Bernstein is able to show that acknowledging our finitude and the fallibility of our beliefs and convictions is not incompatible with truth, knowledge, or getting things right. Pragmatic fallibilism For Bernstein, ‚Äúthe spirit of critical pragmatic fallibilism represents what is best in the American tradition and has global significance.‚Äù Although, for the most part, fallibilism is seen as an epistemological doctrine, Bernstein argues that we can extrapolate its significance to other realms of human existence. ‚ÄúFallibilism is the belief that any knowledge claim or, more generally, any validity claim‚Äîincluding moral and political claims‚Äîis open to ongoing examination, modification, and critique.‚Äù Indeed, more than a specialized scientific or epistemological doctrine, fallibilism is an ethical and political stance, the outlook on life we need to cultivate if we want to exorcise the Cartesian Anxiety and overcome the grand Either/Or between relativism and foundationalism that affects contemporary culture. Bernstein has consistently explored the consequences of pragmatic fallibilism in both philosophical thought and also in broader cultural debates about evil (Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation and The Abuse of Evil: The Corruption of Politics and Religion since 9/11 ) and violence (Violence: Thinking Without Banisters). Judgment Throughout his work, Bernstein has defended the importance of practical judgment (phronesis) for dealing with the complex social, political, ethical, and cultural issues that confront us in our everyday life. The fact that there are no algorithms or ahistorical decision procedures to deal with these issues must not be a motive of despair (i.e. the Cartesian Anxiety), but rather a first step in the realization that, when it comes to human affairs, the type of reasoning appropriate to praxis is the ability to do justice to particular situations in their particularity. This is what Aristotle called phronƒìsis or ‚Äúpractical wisdom‚Äù, a form of reasoning and knowledge that involves a distinctive mediation between the universal and the particular. ‚ÄúThis mediation is not accomplished by any appeal to technical rules or Method (in the Cartesian sense) or by the subsumption of a pregiven determinate universal to a particular case. The ‚Äòintellectual virtue‚Äô of phronƒìsis is a form of reasoning, yielding a type of ethical know-how in which what is universal and what is particular are codetermined.‚Äù Moreover, one can view Bernstein's project as an attempt to democratize phronƒìsis and show the great importance of cultivating dialogical communities where different arguments and opinions are taken into consideration and decisions are the result of a process of serious communal deliberation. Engaged pluralism and democratic ethos In addition to pragmatic fallibilism and judgment, Bernstein also highlights the importance of cultivating an engaged pluralism, an ethos that was also central for the classical American pragmatists, particularly James and Dewey. In his 1988 Presidential Address to the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, Bernstein defined engaged pluralism as the genuine willingness to listen to others, ‚Äúbeing vigilant against the dual temptations of simply dismissing what others are saying by falling back on one of those standard defensive ploys where we condemn it as obscure, wooly, or trivial, or thinking we can always easily translate what is alien into our own entrenched vocabularies.‚Äù As James observed in his essay ‚ÄúOn a Certain Blindness in Human Beings‚Äù, we tend to be egocentric and insensitive to the feelings, opinions, and convictions of those who are really different from us. ‚ÄúHence the stupidity and injustice of our opinions, so far as they deal with the significance of alien lives. Hence the falsity of our judgments, so far as they presume to decide in an absolute way on the value of other persons‚Äô conditions or ideals.‚Äù To really listen becomes one of the most important virtues in a true democratic community. But of course, listening is always much more than just hearing or even paying attention to what the other is saying; openness, in the words of Gadamer (another of Bernstein‚Äôs closest interlocutors), ‚Äúinvolves recognizing that I myself must accept some things that are against me, even though no one else forces me to do so.‚Äù Pluralism, in this ethical sense, is intimately related to democracy, understood not as a set of institutions or political procedures but rather as an ethical way of life, as John Dewey used to say. As such, democracy, more than a form of government, is an ongoing practical endeavor, a task that always lies before us and forces us to continually rebuild and reenergize the public space where we meet to discuss the ‚Äúproblems of men‚Äù. This, as Bernstein emphasizes, requires commitment, hard work, and the cultivation of certain habits, attitudes, feelings, and institutions. Ultimately, a healthy democracy turns out to be the most effective antidote against the Cartesian anxiety and the quest for absolutes, and the best way to reach concrete, yet non-relativist, communal solutions to our public concerns.

It was originally formed by a merger of the National Religious Party, Moledet, and Tkuma in November 2008. However, Moledet broke away from the party after its top representative was placed only 17th on the new party's list for the 2009 Knesset elections, and instead ran on a joint list with Hatikva. Tkuma later also left to join the National Union. For the 2013 elections, the Jewish Home and Tkuma parties ran a joint list under the leadership of the chairman of the Jewish Home, Naftali Bennett. The party ran with Tkuma again in the 2015 elections. In April 2019, Jewish Home ran on a joint list with Tkuma and Otzma Yehudit. The parties registered under the name Union of Right-Wing Parties. The party ran on a joint list (named Yamina) with Tkuma and the New Right in the September 2019 Israeli legislative election, though the joint list split into two factions on 10 October. Yamina ran again in the 2020 Israeli legislative election. History The National Religious Party and the National Union originally allied in order to run a joint list for the 2006 elections. On 3 November 2008, it was announced that the NRP and the Moledet and Tkuma factions of the Union would merge to form a new party. However, the Ahi and Hatikva factions of the Union rejected the merger ‚Äî their leaders, Effi Eitam and Aryeh Eldad, respectively, were both opposed to the party being a purely religious one, while Eitam was also unhappy that the new party would not hold primaries. The party was initially nameless. Five names were proposed: HaBayit HaYehudi (\\"Jewish Home\\"), Shorashim (\\"Roots\\"), Atzma'ut (\\"Independence\\"), Shalem (\\"Whole\\"), and Amihai (\\"My Nation Lives\\"). In an on-line ballot, the members chose \\"Jewish Home\\".. Ya'akov Amidror was chosen to head a public committee formed to choose the party's list for the 2009 elections. On 8 December 2008, Rabbi Professor Daniel Hershkowitz, a mathematician from the Technion, was chosen to head the new party. When Jewish Home announced its candidate list for the upcoming elections, five of the top six slots went to ex-NRP members. MK Uri Ariel of Tkuma was the sole exception: He received the third slot. Polls then indicated Jewish Home would get five to seven seats, thus making the first six spaces highly contested. The ex-National Union members again complained. Ex-Moledet MK Benny Elon stated that he would not seek re- election, and was replaced on the candidate list by American immigrant Uri Bank. The remaining Moledet members broke away, and allied with Hatikva in a revived Union (Bank also later switched to the Union.) On 25 December, Tkuma MK Ariel left Jewish Home, and joined the Union. This left Jewish Home as little more than a renamed NRP, which was also reflected in its motto 'New Mafdal' (◊û◊§◊ì\\"◊ú ◊î◊ó◊ì◊©◊î). In the 2009 election, the party won three seats. The Jewish Home election poster: \\"Something new begins\\", 2013 In November 2012, the Jewish Home held separate primaries for the leadership of the party. My Israel leader Naftali Bennett won over incumbent MK Zevulun Orlev, winning more than two-thirds of the vote, and Orlev announced he was resigning from politics. A week later, primaries for the remaining members of the list were held, and Nissan Slomiansky, Ayelet Shaked, and Uri Orbach reached the top spots. With the National Union breaking up, Uri Ariel officially re-united Tkuma with the Jewish Home to run on a joint list in the 2013 Israeli elections. A few Moledet candidates were included. In the elections that were held on 22 January 2013, the Jewish Home won 12 seats. The Jewish Home entered the thirty-third government of Israel under prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and has 3 ministers (Bennett, Ariel, and Orbach) and 2 deputy-ministers (Ben- Dahan and Wortzman). As part of its 2013 coalition agreement, the Jewish Home had the right to veto any laws that change the status quo on religious issues. In December 2013, the party vetoed a Yesh Atid-proposed bill that sought to give gay fathers equal tax benefits, saying it would have far-reaching implications on marriage laws. Currently, mothers receive more benefits than do fathers under the law, and thus, couples composed of two men are ineligible for certain tax breaks. In December 2016, the party's member Shuli Mualem proposed the so-called Regulation Bill. The law seeks to legalize dozens of small outposts of settlements built in the occupied Palestinian territories on private ground of individual Palestinians. The Regulation Law passed legislation on 6 February 2017. The law exclusively refers to Palestinians, and allows the government to expropriate land from individual Palestinians against their will for compensation up to 25% above the land's value.The law in Hebrew as passed by the Israeli Knesset at the official website of the Knesset. http://fs.knesset.gov.il//20/law/20_ls2_pb_367832.pdf On 16 November 2018, the Jewish Home issued a statement claiming that the party intended to withdraw from Netanyahu's coalition government, and demanded an early election \\"as soon as possible\\". This threat came after Netanyahu denied party leader Naftali Bennett's request to become the Defense Minister. On 18 November, Netanyahu reneged on an earlier pledge to remove Jewish Home member Eli Ben- Dahan as Deputy Defense Minister. Bennett afterwards reneged on this pledge to withdraw on 19 November 2018 and agreed to abandon his push to become Defense Minister and keep the party in the coalition. In December 2018, three Jewish Home MKs, including Bennett, left the party to form the New Right.Bennett, Shaked quit Jewish Home, announce formation of ‚ÄòHaYamin HeHadash‚Äô The Times of Israel, 29 December 2018 Rafi Peretz was elected leader of the party on 4 February 2019. In the build-up to the April 2019 elections, the party agreed to run on a joint list with Tkuma, and later joined the Union of Right-Wing Parties (URWP) alliance alongside Otzma Yehudit. Prior to the September 2019 elections, the Jewish Home joined the Yamina alliance alongside New Right and Tkuma. Following the elections, the bloc split into separate Knesset factions on 10 October, one consisting of the Jewish Home and Tkuma, and the other New Right. However, the parties reunited to reform Yamina prior to the 2020 elections. On 22 April 2020, it was reported that Bennett was now \\"considering all options\\" for the Yamina alliance's political future, including departing from Netanyahu's government, which had just agreed to a coalition with the leader of the opposition Blue and White party Benny Gantz, and joining the opposition. Bennett was reported to be unhappy with the new coalition government's decision to hold back on the issue of judicial reform. On 14 May 2020, the Jewish Home unofficially left Yamina and joined the Netanyahu government, with Peretz becoming Jerusalem Minister. The party officially split from Yamina on 14 July 2020. Ideology The party primarily represents Modern Orthodox as well as Chardal Jews. For many years, this community has been politically fractured. In the 2013 elections, the party was led by Naftali Bennett, a charismatic high-tech millionaire, who appealed to both religious and secular Israelis. The party's pro-settlement message and Bennett's personal appeal helped it increase popularity among a broader segment of the population. The attention that Bennett received also apparently had an effect on Likud's 2013 election strategy, pushing it to the right. Along with Yesh Atid, the Jewish Home surged in popularity by promising to end the controversial system of draft exemptions given to many ultra-Orthodox seminary students, and to \\"ease the burden\\" on middle-class Israelis who serve in the military, work, and pay taxes. These two parties became the two largest coalition parties in Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, and leaders of both parties were able to force Netanyahu to promise that the ultra-Orthodox political parties will not be in the new coalition. Despite Bennett's alliance with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid on many domestic issues, the two differ sharply over peace efforts and settlement building. Bennett is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state, and has called for Israel to annex Area C of the West Bank and offer citizenship to the Palestinians living there. Their alliance ended during their time as coalition partners, before the 2015 Israeli legislative election. Most of the party's candidates for the 2015 elections were opposed to same-sex marriage. Some of the remarks made by its candidates have been called homophobic by Yair Lapid; Zehava Gal-On and Mickey Rosenthal also criticized the comments. Despite this, in a 2016 poll conducted for the Hiddush organization, 57% of Jewish Home voters said they back same- sex marriage or partnerships. The party is considered to be part of the national camp in Israeli politics, a group of political parties that share nationalist views and often form governments together.  Criticism  In response to the party's short-lived 2019 alliance with Otzma Yehudit, Rabbi Benny Lau, a modern Orthodox rabbi from Jerusalem, said: \\"A vote for Bayit Yehudi is a vote for the racism of [Meir] Kahane.\\" The rabbi equated Kahanism with Nazism.

This band is the governing body for people descended from several different historic groups, hence the plural, nations, used in the band's name. In August 2019, there were 2,960 members of this band, of which 1,322 lived within five reserves, about large within the province of Alberta. The D√´nes≈≥≈Çin√© of Cold Lake occupy the territory around present-day Cold Lake, Alberta, in the northeast of the province close to the Saskatchewan border. They are the only Chipewyan community who are signatory to Treaty Six and are somewhat isolated from other Chipewyan. Their closest Chipewyan neighbors are situated at Ejer√©sche or Dillon, Saskatchewan and K'√°i K'oz Des√© or Janvier, Alberta, both of which are approximately 5 hours away by motor vehicle.  History  Traditional territory of Cold Lake First Nations (CLFN) as recognized and agreed to by the governments of Canada, Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Early history  Oral traditions of the Cold Lake First Nations reach back in time and in traditions similar to those we can expect at the end of the last ice age.Cp. (PDF, 88 kB): N. A. Janvier: The Dene of Cold Lake, o. J. Prehistoric artifacts, such as stone tools and pottery, have been dated to over 5,000 years old. Researchers have also discovered a pre-Columbian campsite covering about 1,200 square metres along the lakeshore at English Bay. Locally known as Berry Point, the area has been used by the Denesuline for fishing, hunting and gathering medicines since time immemorial. The bones of their ancestors are buried in grave sites there.  Fur trade  The Denesuline of Cold Lake were traditionally a nomadic people who lived off the land by hunting and gathering. Wetlands, prairie and boreal forest made up their homelands in this eco-region and was indeed plentiful in food. During the fur trade era, they trapped in and around Primrose Lake and Cold Lake where there was an abundance in fur-bearing animals such as beaver and muskrat In 1716, the peoples in the Cold Lake area were supposedly attacked for the first time by fur trading Cree, who had become owners of firearms by trading with Europeans. Not before 1800 the groups around Cold Lake started to trade with Europeans on their own, but then they travelled to the trading posts on the Hudson Bay and even to Hochelaga on the Saint Lawrence River.  Treaty No. 6 of the Numbered Treaties  The Government of Canada negotiated with Woodland and Plains Cree, and some Nakota as well as with the Denesuline Peoples around Cold Lake. Treaty 6, which covers modern-day central Alberta and Saskatchewan, was signed in 1876 at Carlton and Fort Pitt. A Cree decided to go to a piece of land at Willow Point, a territory reaching about south and westwards. It included the Cold Lake, which the Denesuline called or and where they spent the summers, while the winters were spent on Primrose Lake (called in the Chipewyan language ). When chief Uldahi died in June 1882, he had no successor. Consequently, the group dwelling at Heart Lake elected its own chiefs and headmen. They also tried to get a reserve of their own. On a hill above Reiter Creek they gathered in the summer of 1913 and elected Alexi Janvier (Nanuchele) as their chief. At the end of the First World War people coming back from Europe's battlefields brought with them the Spanish flu. Nearly half of the population died. The Cold Lake Nations had been forced to give up their nomadic lifestyle. At the beginning they were quite successful farmers but meanwhile a large part of the land is leased to white farmers with more money.  North-West Rebellion  After the Frog Lake Massacre of May 1885, the band's main group fled to the Cold Lake in fear of revenge. Despite moderation of a priest, the militia disarmed the tribe. Women and children were sent to a camp on Reiter Creek, while the men stayed in the army's camp. When the band returned to the Cold Lake, they met another armed unit there. The oral tradition tells about a mass execution, which was averted in a last-minute decision. In 1890 many Chipewyan families went from Heart Lake (Saskatchewan) to Primrose Lake, as they were used to do traditionally, but this time they stayed there permanently. When land surveys started in 1902 the Indians of Cold Lake were still suspected to have participated in the North-West Rebellion, so that they lost their treaty rights. In addition, the responsible Indian agent believed that their territory was much too large for only 330 members of the tribe. Their territory was reduced to . Consequently, they could no more live by fishing, hunting and trapping. In exchange for not losing their fishing rights, they swapped their of land in the south of the Beaver River with a piece of land on the Cold Lake, to be more precise the English Bay. At the same time French settlers came to the French Bay.  Forced assimilation  The Canadian residential school system was also introduced for the Cold Lake First Nations. The children had to attend residential schools like Onion Lake or Blue Quills Residential School. The legacy of the schools on aboriginal people of today has been referred to as a \\"collective soul wound.\\"Colliness, Shari. \\"The Intergenerational Legacies of Saskatchewan Indian Residential Schools: Social Workers, and the Medicine Wheel.\\" Unworthy Dominance. 7 November 2010. Web. 1 March 2014.  Cold War and Cold Lake Air Weapons Range  In 1930 provisions of the Alberta and Saskatchewan Acts were used to allow the confiscation of any militarily important area. During the Cold War the Royal Canadian Air Force was looking for a test area and found it around Primrose Lake. The people living there were offered a small amount of compensation for 20 years. While the most modern techniques were introduced on CFB Cold Lake, the first power line was not installed before 1964. The residential schools were not closed before 1971, a system for which Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized in 2008.  Reserves  The largest reserve today is Cold Lake 149 in the east of Bonnyville (145.281 km2). There are other reserves, like the one of 4134 ha on the Beaver Creek (149B), 96.2 ha of the territory of the Blue Quills First Nation Indian Reserve, 71.6 ha on the southern shore of Cold Lake (149A) and 149C, and the land meant as a kind of compensation for the Air Base, which consists of 2023.5 ha.

He is best known for the poem, The Guy in the Glass, written in 1934. Earlier in his career, he created several musical recordings in the still-young recording industry, and was known as \\"The Del-Mar-Va Songster\\". He occasionally recorded with a quartet of musicians known as the \\"Rubeville Tuners\\", and he was also sometimes known as Peter Dale. allmusic.com AMG Artist ID P 337111 Biography Early life and education Peter Dale Wimbrow was born June 6, 1895, in Whaleyville, Maryland, the son of Nutter Jerome Wimbrow ( 1867-1957) and Sallie Mary Wimbrow, n√©e Dale (1873-1951). He studied at Western Maryland College until World War I, although no source can be supplied. Career Wimbrow's early career was in music and radio. Under his own name and as Old Pete Daley of Whaleysville, he became known for his records and radio performances with orchestras. His credits include a number of recordings in the 1920s, in which he performed as the solo vocalist, and often as his own accompanist (on the ukulele). The majority of those songs were his own creation, and he began turning to songwriting almost exclusively in the later part of the decade. Perhaps his best-known musical composition was the 1930 jazz tune entitled \\"Accordion Joe\\". Played by Duke Ellington's band, it appeared that same year as the soundtrack to an animated short film of the same name, starring Betty Boop. The tune has appeared several times over the years in Duke Ellington compilation albums. Wimbrow established the Indian River News newspaper in June 1948. It was published until September 1966, 12 years after his death in 1954, carried on by his wife. =The Guy in the Glass= Wimbrow wrote The Guy in the Glass for publication in The American Magazine in 1934. It is often mistitled The Man In The Glass. The poem became a popular clipping passed between people, and the author's credit was often dropped, leading to inquiries as to the author in newspapers as early as 1938. Ann Landers printed the poem in her column on October 5, 1983, incorrectly attributing it to an anonymous man who died as a result of struggles with drug abuse. Landers received numerous letters that attributed or claimed different authorship of the poem, but only one of the letters published in her December 5, 1983, column correctly identified the author as Wimbrow and it was credited by Ann Landers as the true author. Marriage and children Wimbrow married Dorothy Livezy, a radio writer and producer. The couple had two children, Sally Dale Wimbrow and Peter Dale Wimbrow, Jr. Death and afterward Peter Dale Wimbrow died on January 26, 1954, in Sebastian, Florida and was interred at Dale Cemetery in Whaleyville, Maryland. Dale Wimbrow Park, in Roseland, Florida, is named in his honor. Dale Wimbrow in popular culture The poem, The Guy in The Glass, was famously recited by Nigel Adkins, manager of Southampton Football Club in October 2012 during an interview with BBC South following a 4‚Äì1 defeat to West Ham United.

The whole elected council was up for election. The councillors were elected from the 77 wards, which return one each by first-past-the-post voting for a four-year term of office. The wards were the same as those used at the previous election in 2005. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 4 June 2009 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Summary The Conservative party retained and reinforced its control of the council with a net gain of 9 seats, and maintained an electoral stranglehold on the east of the county winning all seats in Broxbourne District, East Herts District, Hertsmere District & North Herts District. The Conservative party made significant gains in Stevenage District (3 seats), Dacorum District (3 seats), Welwyn Hatfield District (2 seats), Hertsmere District (2 seats) and North Herts District (2 seats). The Labour Party lost 13 seats, notably 3 in Stevenage District. This result left them with only 3 seats at County Hall. The Liberal Democrats gained 3 seats overall with a particularly strong performance in St Albans District at the expense of the Conservatives. The British National Party gained a seat in South Oxhey at the expense of Labour. It is also notable that the BNP came 2nd in the popular vote in Broxbourne District.

Early life Katz was born in Zwickau, Germany on October 20, 1922, where his father owned a department store. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Nazi Germany implemented rules stripping the family of their German citizenship. His father obtained a Czechoslovakian passport, which he used to leave Germany and travel to Prague as a 16-year-old. He made it to New York City through Italy and England, with his parents and brother joining him in the United States in 1940.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Dr. Jay Katz, 86, Dies; Explorer of Ethics Issues\\", The New York Times, November 19, 2008. Accessed November 20, 2008. He graduated from The University of Vermont in 1944 and was awarded his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1949 from Harvard Medical School. He completed internship and residency programs in New York, and then enlisted in the United States Air Force. He served as a First Lieutenant and Captain at the Air Force Hospital at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama.\\"Yale Law School Mourns Professor Jay Katz; Read Dean Koh Memorial Remarks\\" , Yale Law School press release dated November 17, 2008. Accessed November 20, 2008. Career Katz began his four- decades-long affiliation with Yale University in 1953 when he became Chief Resident at the Yale School of Medicine's outpatient clinic. He started teaching psychiatry in 1955 and became an assistant professor of psychiatry and law at Yale University in 1958, teaching psychiatry and law. He continued to teach as an emeritus professor after his retirement from Yale in 1993. He served on the committee which established the terms of patient privilege in Connecticut for psychotherapists and their patients. Enacted in 1961, it was used to establish comparable terms in the Federal Rules of Evidence that apply across the United States. Katz was named to serve on a federal inquiry into the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, an experiment started in 1932 by the United States Public Health Service in which about 400 black men in Alabama infected with syphilis were left untreated, with at least 28 of the study subjects dying from the untreated disease and many more suffering severe injury. The group concluded that the research was \\"ethically unjustified\\", that the participants should have been given penicillin and called for greater federal oversight and protection of subjects in medical studies. Katz protested that the group should have issued a stronger response, noting that the subjects were \\"exploited, manipulated and deceived\\". Dr. Katz noted that the question of when \\"can human beings be used for purposes of acquisition of knowledge\\" must be answered and that the disadvantaged and disempowered are often deliberately chosen as subjects.Wilkerson, Isabel. \\"Medical Experiment Still Haunts Blacks \\", The New York Times, June 3, 1991. Accessed November 20, 2008. After efforts were made by scientists to make use of data from Nazi human experimentation, conducted on concentration camp inmates against their will, Katz emphasized that \\"however hard we might try, we cannot separate the data from the way they were obtained\\".Wilkerson, Isabel. \\"Nazi Scientists and Ethics of Today\\", The New York Times, May 21, 1989. Accessed November 20, 2008. He was appointed to serve on the 1994 Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, established by President Bill Clinton to investigate some 30 experiments in which individuals were unwittingly exposed to radiation. Katz issued a statement as part of the committee's report, stating that his \\"most serious reservations\\" were about the issue of protections to study subjects, and that the existing informed consent process invites \\"repetitions of the dignitary insults which unconsenting citizen-patients suffered during the Cold War\\".Statement by Committee Member Jay Katz, Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments. Accessed November 20, 2008. In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration implemented changes that allowed doctors to perform medical studies on patients without their consent in certain situations where the patient has a life-threatening condition and cannot offer consent, where the community has been notified about the experiment and where the FDA has reviewed the plans in advance and approved of the protocol. Katz insisted that these changes violated the Nuremberg Code enacted in response to Nazi human experimentation conducted on unwilling prisoners during World War II, noting that \\"here we are making exceptions\\" to the first sentence of the Code's first point, which states that \\"The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential\\".Kolata, Gina. \\"Ban on Medical Experiments Without Consent Is Relaxed\\", The New York Times, November 5, 1996.

He determined that although Rhoads' racist and inflammatory letter was reprehensible, Rhoads did not actually murder or inject cancer into anyone, or participate in medical misconduct. Nonetheless, due to Rhoads' racism, which denigrated Puerto Ricans and Italians, the award was renamed. Writings Dr. Katz wrote extensively on subjects of medicine, law and their interconnections. His books included The Family and the Law (1964, with Joseph Goldstein), Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and Law (1967, with Alan Dershowitz and Joseph Goldstein), Experimentation with Human Beings (1972), Catastrophic Diseases: Who Decides What? (1975, with Alexander M. Capron) and The Silent World of Doctor and Patient (1984).

A student of Jacques-Louis David, Fleury-Richard and his friend Pierre R√©voil were precursors of the Troubador style.  Life  The son of a magistrate, Fleury Fran√ßois Richard studied at the coll√®ge de l'Oratoire in Lyon then at the √©cole de Dessin under Alexis Grognard. At the latter he met Pierre R√©voil. In 1796 he joined the Paris studio of Jacques-Louis David. His first paintings had major success and he mingled with the Paris intelligentsia, among whom the Troubador style was highly favoured. He became the favourite painter of empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, who bought many of his paintings, so that the European renown gained by his first works was recognised by Madame de Sta√´l. In 1808 he set up his own studio at the palais Saint-Pierre at Lyon, having been granted it by the city for the benefits he had brought to it by his reputation. He was initiated into the Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge of Isis in 1809, and in 1814 married a banker's daughter, Blanche Menut. He was made a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1815. Seeking inspiration, he visited Geneva, Milan, Turin and the Dauphin√©. He served as a professor at the √âcole des beaux-arts de Lyon from 1818 to 1823. In 1851 he set himself up at √âcully, devoting himself to writing. He edited his Souvenirs, lives of painters and a work on painting in the second-order towns of France, Quelques r√©flexions sur l'enseignement de la peinture dans les villes de second ordre.  Critique  Young girl at a fountain, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon Fleury-Richard received his first lessons in Lyon, a silk- producing town, but he was mainly formed by his time in the neoclassical atmosphere of David's studio. Like other English and German artists of the era Fleury-Richard was passionate about history and fascinated by medieval chivalry and the Renaissance. His visit to the Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais, where he saw the tomb of Valentina Visconti on display, inspired his first major work in a utopian and melancholic Troubadour style, which also originated in David's studio. This style would impose a powerful historicist current on the masters of the 14th and 15th centuries, a more anecdotal that truly historical iconography. Fran√ßois-Ren√© Martin presents this tendency as \\"a retreat into the private sphere.\\"To the exasperation of public thematic works and heroic virtue, of which Davidian painting was the highest expression, they had been succeeded ‚Äì at least among the inhabitants of Lyon ‚Äì by the cult of sentiment, the desire to approach the private life of historical people\\" ‚Äì Fran√ßois-Ren√© Martin, Historicisme et utopie √† Lyon au XIXe si√®cle, in Le Temps de la peinture, op. cit., p. 152. Richard was notably amazed by the works attributed to the king-poet \\"bon Roi Ren√©\\" and most particularly by his art history treatise Le Cuer d‚Äôamours espris. On his return to Lyon, he cultivated his friendship with Pierre R√©voil and, with R√©voil and a small inner-circle, discovered nature and the archaeological remains around Lyon, in Fourvi√®re, Saint-Just or the √éle Barbe. It was in this context that R√©voil, in 1798, showed both nature and remains in a drawing he offered to his \\"brother\\". To the Troubadour painters' historicism he blended \\"a poetry of nature\\" and \\"researches into distance or loneliness\\". Fran√ßois- Ren√© Martin, ibidem. Also the abandoned crypt of Saint Ir√©n√©e at Saint-Just was used by Fleury-Richard in his studies for \\"A Knight in prayer in a chapel, preparing himself for combat\\"; the construction used in \\"Young girl at a fountain\\" was a Roman sarcophagus at √éle-Barbe; also at √éle-Barbe, associated to the cloister of Notre-Dame-de-l'Isle at Vienne in The Hermitage of Vaucouleurs. When some scholars at the start of the 20th century sought to connect him to the √©cole lyonnaise despite his training in Paris, his national career and his painting ‚Äì the historical genre was not specific to Lyon.Alphonse Germain, cited by Pierre Vaisse, Le Temps de la peinture, op. cit. p. 21. In Fleury-Richard's critical writings scholars find a reflection prefiguring his attachment to Symbolism before it existed: \\"Painting is not an imitation of reality. It is a symbol, a figurative language which presents the image of thought; and thought rises to the source of infinite beauty, there finding the archetypical forms signalled by Plato, of which created beings are only copies.Quoted by Stephen Bann, Le Temps de la peinture, op. cit., p. 57.\\"  Works  Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband Louis of Orl√©ans (c. 1802) Hermitage Museum, Saint-Petersburg :See also :Category:Paintings by Fleury Fran√ßois Richard * Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband Louis of Orl√©ans (c. 1802), Hermitage Museum, Saint-Petersburg * Charles VII writing his farewell to Agn√®s Sorel (1804) mus√©e national des ch√¢teaux de Malmaison et de Bois-Pr√©au, Rueil-Malmaison * A Knight in prayer in a chapel, preparing for combat (1805), mus√©e des beaux- arts de Lyon * The death of saint Paul the hermit (1810) mus√©e Gassendi Digne * Tannegui du Chastel saving the Dauphin (1819) mus√©e national du ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau * The Hermitage of Vaucouleurs (1819), mus√©e du Louvre, Paris * Little Red Riding Hood (c. 1820), mus√©e du Louvre, Paris * Montaigne Visiting Torquato Tasso in Prison (1821), Lyon * Vert-Vert (1821) Lyon * The death of the prince de Talmont (c. 1822), mus√©e de Brou, Bourg-en-Bresse * The Charterhouse of St Bruno (1822) mus√©e de Grenoble * Young girl at a fountain (1825) Lyon * Comminges and Ad√©la√Øde at the couvent de La Trappe (1844), Lyon * Interior of a convent (Couvent des Cordeliers de l'Observance), Lyon * Scene in a ruined chapel, Lyon * Entrance to a convent, Lyon * Jacques de Molay, grandmaster of the Templars, Rueil-Malmaison * Madame Elisabeth in her garden of Montreuil, mus√©e national du ch√¢teau et des Trianons, Versailles Gallery Image:Comminges et Ad√©la√Øde.jpgComminges and Adala√Øde in the couvent de La Trappe Image:Int√©rieur de couvent.jpgInterior of a convent (Couvent des Cordeliers de l'Observance) Lyon Image:Sc√®ne dans une chapelle ruin√©e.jpgScene in a ruined chapel, Lyon  Bibliography  * Fleury Richard et Pierre R√©voil : la peinture troubadour, Marie-Claude Chaudonneret, Arth√©na, Paris (1980) 217 pp. * Le Temps de la peinture, Lyon 1800‚Äì1914, sous la direction de Sylvie Ramond, G√©rard Bruy√®re et L√©na Widerkher, Fage √©ditions, Lyon (2007) 335 pp.  Notes   Sources  * Le Temps de la peinture ‚Äì Lyon 1800‚Äì1914, op. cit. pp. 305‚Äì306, 6 et ss. * Base Joconde * Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Lyon  External links  * Notices on base Joconde Category:1777 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Artists from Lyon Category:18th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:19th-century French painters Category:Faculty of the √âcole des Beaux- Arts Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David ","title":"Fleury Fran√ßois Richard"},{"id":"20307960","text":"During the 2006‚Äì07 season Cardiff City played in the Football League Championship.

She is also the founder of The ReThink Group. Shull focuses on the positive contribution of feelings and emotion in high-pressure decisions. She is the author of Market Mind Games which explains how Wall Street traders act out Freudian transferences in reaction to market moves. Shull postulates that human perception contains fractal elements in the same manner as the fractal geometry of nature.  Education  * Master of Arts 1995 Neuropsychoanalysis at University of Chicago * Executive Education in Behavioral Finance at Kennedy School of Government Shull graduated from Kennedy's executive program in \\"Investment Decisions and Behavioral Finance\\" in 2009. She holds a Master of Arts from The University of Chicago. Her thesis research, \\"The Neurobiology of Freud‚Äôs Theory of the Repetition Compulsion\\" was published in 2003 in the Annals of Modern Psychoanalysis and was cited in 2013 as one of the first papers ever written in the emerging field of neuro- psychoanalysis.  Career  * 1983-1988 Marketing Representative at IBM * 1994-2009 short term technical trading, Member CME Group * 2003‚Äìpresent Founder, CEO and Lead Performance Coach at The ReThink Group Shull began working as a short-term trader and trading desk manager in 1994 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and later began trading futures as a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. During this period Shull began to formulate her application of neuropsychology to investment and trading at banks, hedge funds, and proprietary funds, working in the budding interdisciplinary field of neuroeconomics. In 2003, Shull created The ReThink Group to address the challenges of slumps, repetitive mistakes and confidence crises in portfolio managers and traders. In 2016, ReThink added Olympians, pro poker players and professional athletes to their roster. She filed a copyright claim against Showtime Networks in 2018, claiming their show Billions plagiarized her 2012 book Market Mind Games.https://nypost.com/2019/03/02/showtimes-billions- ripped-off-hedge-fund-performance-coach-suit/ Her claim was updated in October 2019 to include a claim of false endorsement. It was dismissed.  Publications  Shull's book Market Mind Games: a Radical Psychology of Investing, Trading and Risk (2012) was translated into Chinese in 2013. She served as the lead author of the chapter on trading psychology in Investor Behavior: The Psychology of Financial Planning and Investing (Wiley, 2014). Shull's first article \\"Freud's Path to Profits\\" was published in SFO magazine in 2004, and she has since written articles for Psychology Today, Hedge-Fund Intelligence, Thomson Reuters, CME Group, All About Alpha, and many hedge fund sites as well as her own blog.

It contains historical essays, excavation reports, and book reviews, as well as society notes and accounts of field visits. The journal has included \\"much valuable material on the manuscripts, genealogy, heraldry, toponymy, folklore and literature of Wales\\". Scope \\"The journal covers a broad range of multi-disciplinary topics relating to the archaeology and history of Wales and the Marches.\\" Article topics range from the earliest prehistoric discoveries to the industrial archaeology and landscape history of the 19th and 20th centuries. Occasionally, and particularly in the earlier years, articles have been published on the archaeology of other Celtic lands (Brittany, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Ireland). In the 19th century, articles tended to concentrate on prehistoric monuments (particularly cromlechs, chambered tombs and hill-forts), Roman sites, inscribed stones and other discoveries of the Early Middle Ages, and the architecture of medieval Wales, especially of churches, castles, and monasteries. The range of opinion presented in the 19th century volumes also serves as a source of evidence for historians of the period. As the 20th century progressed, and into the 21st century, the journal has carried longer articles on excavations and field surveys in Wales. Many of these articles have been grant-aided by Cadw. The journal has also carried more synoptic articles treating particular topics in greater depth; for example, the 2005 themed issue largely devoted to the Cistercians.Britnell, William, ed. (2005). Archaeologia Cambrensis. 154: 17‚Äì214. Domestic architecture figures prominently, ranging from stately homes to the vernacular architecture of the Welsh countryside, as does the landscape of parks and gardens.

Early life Elisabeth Coit Gilman was born in New Haven, Connecticut on December 25, 1867 to Daniel Coit Gilman and Mary Ketcham Gilman. Elisabeth was the second child, and had an older sister named Alice. Their mother, Mary, died in 1869 and, as a result, were cared for by Daniel's sister Louise. At the age of seven, Elisabeth's father took the post as the first president of Johns Hopkins University and the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. She was cared for by a governess until her father remarried. In 1877, Daniel married Elisabeth Dwight Woolsey (1838‚Äì1910) of the New England Dwight family, with whom Elisabeth Gilman developed a close relationship. Gilman attended Miss Hall's School until age eleven, when due to eye trouble, she was tutored by her governess at home. When her eyesight improved, Elisabeth attended the Springside School in Philadelphia at age seventeen. It was planned that she would attend Bryn Mawr College. Political life Instead of attending Bryn Mawr, Gilman traveled to France as a representative of the National Committee on Surgical Dressings. While in France, she also worked for the YMCA. It was at this time that she was introduced to the concepts of Socialism. When Gilman returned to the United States at the age of twenty, she entered into social work at the request of her father.Elisabeth Gilman Vertical File. Maryland Department Collection. Enoch Pratt Free Library Central Branch, Baltimore, MD. Eventually, in 1921, she earned her degree from Johns Hopkins University. Gilman officially joined the Socialist Party of America on March 1, 1929. She ran for Governor of Maryland in 1930. After running for Governor, she traveled to Russia in 1931 to study the Soviet system. She returned and ran for the United States Senate in 1934 and 1938, Mayor of Baltimore in 1935, and Sheriff of Baltimore in 1942. Platform Gilman campaigned for many causes; however, she was mainly involved in workers' rights, civil liberties, and racial equality. In 1921, Elisabeth helped to form The Maryland Civil Liberties Committee; this committee was a precursor to the Maryland Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1931, the ACLU would officially establish an affiliate in the state of Maryland; the meeting was held in Gilman's home. Gilman also hosted the first public interracial dinner in Baltimore at her home in 1928 when local hotels refused to allow the dinner on their properties. Gilman was also a core member of the National Mooney-Billings Committee, which was \\"organized to help secure the pardon of Thomas J. Mooney and Warren K. Billings, serving life sentences in California prisons\\". Death Elisabeth Gilman died on December 14, 1950 at the age of 82. She is buried at Druid Ridge Cemetery in Pikesville, Maryland.

LOTIS has large, thermally stabilized vacuum chamber, vibration-isolated optical benches, and a large 6.5 meter telescope (run backwards as a collimator) to create images for the test optics to view. It can generate images from the visible through the mid- wavelength IR. The fabrication error in the Hubble Space Telescope main mirror is the classic example that shows the need for such testing. In this case, a test facility such as LOTIS was not easily available, so the completed optics were not tested as a unit, and instead relied on careful testing of the individual components. Unfortunately, due to a mis-assembled null corrector, one of the tests was wrong, and a mis-figured mirror was not discovered until the telescope was placed into service. This is exactly the type of problem that LOTIS can detect, since it is designed to test large optical systems as a unit by creating realistic inputs and operating conditions for them.

The Israeli government and the JNF ultimately did drain a majority of the Hula wetlands to prevent the spread of malaria and to create agricultural land.The Fight to Preserve Israel's Environment has Just Begun After 40 years of SPNI campaigning, some 10% of the Hula wetlands were re-flooded in the early 1990s. In 1980, SPNI, together with Azaria Alon, Amotz Zahavi and Yoav Sagi, was awarded the Israel Prize for its special contribution to society and the State for the environment. Major divisions Best known to the public for sponsoring hikes (today, SPNI's hikes are guided in Hebrew - the only regular nature tours in English are through SPNI-Jerusalem branch), SPNI is also active in political and environmental improvement efforts. Projects have included working out an agricultural management plan for the Hula Valley to insure the health of migrating common cranes, and preventing the draining of a large area of salt pans, the last breeding site in Israel for Nubian nightjars.Bird Life International The campaign to create the 2004 Coastal Law, which forbids new development in any area within 300 meters from the coastline was a notable accomplishment. With almost 800 employees, SPNI is an enormous non-profit organization, with a wide range of activities, thus SPNI is known as well by its various divisions' names as it is by the name \\"SPNI\\".  Environmental Protection Division  SPNI's Environmental Protection Division (EPD) is the watchdog and advocate for the little remaining open space left in Israel. Mass immigration has contributed to a drain on water resources, increased land usage for housing and industrial development, and major transportation congestion and pollution issues. Israel today is highly urbanized, with one of the world's highest population density rates. On a national level, the number of persons per square kilometer is very close to that of Japan, while the Tel Aviv area's density is higher than that of Hong Kong. SPNI is dedicated to finding creative solutions to preserve Israel's fragile ecosystem. *Rivers ‚Äì Israel's rivers are in a state of crisis. Problems include drainage ‚Äì draining water from the waterways for industrial, agricultural and residential use; sewage dumping ‚Äì sewage and other waste, often toxic, is being dumped in the rivers; lack of enforcement ‚Äì plans to protect the rivers and streams are postponed; and rapid development ‚Äì unsustainable land development along stream banks cause serious harm to rivers, streams and water habitats. SPNI's River Rehabilitation Campaign strategically researches the problems, suggests solutions and networks with the various organizations to agree on a master plan, while running a public awareness campaign on river, stream and water management issues. *Integrated Coastal Management ‚Äì The Mediterranean coast is one of the country's greatest recreation and tourist assets. The creation of marinas, coastal housing, and private beaches limit the enjoyment of this asset by the general public. SPNI is working at every level to keep Israel's beaches clean, ecologically natural, and accessible to all. *Sea of Galilee & the Kinneret Trail ‚Äì Israel's main source of fresh water is the Sea of Galilee. A major beauty spot for Israelis and visitors, the Kinneret has been threatened for years by overuse of its water and commercialization of its beaches. SPNI's Lake Kinneret Project enlists the cooperation of all involved parties in maintaining the Kinneret water levels and in keeping its shoreline accessible to the public for future generations. *Metropolitan Parks ‚Äì SPNI promotes conserving and establishing new Metropolitan Parks and recreation areas in central Israel. Lobbying for the legal establishment, infrastructure in public areas, for the purpose of using them as parks in population-dense areas that lack parks. The success of this project will ensure that there will be 8 open spaces in Israel's densely populated central region that will act as recreation, nature and sport areas close to place of living. *Legal/Lobbying ‚Äì the Unit for Law and the Environment enables SPNI to address legal questions as they arise and to incorporate legal tools into strategic plans for SPNI campaigns to defend Israel's most precious natural resources. The legal arm also provides legal services to SPNI projects, among them: regional coordinators representing environmental interests on regional planning committees, EPD planner representing environmental interests on the National Planning and Construction Council and its various subcommittees, wildlife, mammal and ornithological centers, and more. *Transportation/Air Quality ‚Äì Congestion, traffic and the resulting air pollution have created a public health crisis. SPNI is working to develop a sustainable urban transportation policy involving alternative means of public transportation and promoting new criteria for road construction.  Open Landscape Institute (OLI)  Land has become a precious commodity; the economic incentive for developers is highly enticing. SPNI is at the frontline, preserving the untouched land, still in its natural state, for wildlife, birds, and recreation, while promoting sustainable development, allowing residential areas to expand without clear- cutting the forests Israel has spent so many years planting.  Birding Division  With five hundred million birds migrating through Israel's skies twice a year, nature lovers have begun to take note of Israel's unique potential as an ornithology superpower. SPNI, through its Israel Ornithological Center (IOC) and International Center for the Study of Bird Migration (ICSBM), leads Israel's partnership in the world of wildlife preservation and protection of bird species threatened by urbanization and economic development. SPNI sponsors the Champions of the Flyway, an international birding competition and fundraiser that raises money for BirdLife International partners around the Mediterranean in an effort to stop illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds. Israel Ornithological Center (IOC) - founded in 1980, the IOC works toward preserving endangered species such as the Lesser Kestrel, cranes, and Houbara Bustard. The IOC has several successful ongoing projects, including rehabilitating and conserving habitats for birds; leading research and surveying activities; and running numerous educational programs in schools throughout Israel. International Center for the Study of Bird Migration (ICSBM) - the center at Latrun was founded by Yossi Leshem who was the Executive Director of the SPNI from 1991 to 1995, and is the center's director and a Senior Researcher at the Department of Zoology in the Faculty of Life Sciences at Tel Aviv University. ICSBM - Latrun is the joint initiative of SPNI and the Tel Aviv University. The center deals with many cutting edge and creative educational projects, such as migration research, flight safety, eco-education, eco-tourism, and international cooperation.  Education  SPNI's education programs reach Israelis of every age and sector - over 50% of Israeli children and teens are involved in SPNI education programs! SPNI believes that by fostering young people's connection to the land, heritage and to their own communities, we grow a generation that gives back to Israel in establishing a strong society, concerned with preserving Israel's natural treasures for all time. *Children Make a Difference ‚Äì Lively student participation in SPNI's Children Make a Difference program and the connections developed between students from across Israel during large events like the annual children's conference have resulted in the development of a national network of environmentally active young people that take part in environmental campaigns and events. For their part, participating schools are obliged to adopt environmental thinking and green management in cooperation with the community and the neighborhood. *A Beautiful Israel - All across Israel, children and youth are working to clean up the environment. A Beautiful Israel incorporates adoption of sites, intelligent use of resources, and litter clean-up actions into the eco-education process. *Obligated to the Environment ‚Äì All Israeli 10th grade students are obligated to volunteer in their local communities, a minimum of sixty hours throughout the school year through the national education program \\"Personal Accountability\\", which teaches youth consciousness of civic responsibility. SPNI's \\"Obligated to the Environment\\" program extends students' options to the realm of environmental work. *Orienteering - SPNI's youth organization uses nature education to nurture future influential leaders for a sustainable Israel. From Afula to Beer Sheva, Orienteering groups meet weekly and offer about 18 hikes a year. *Multicultural Orienteering ‚Äì Programs vary from on-site lessons and field trips for Ethiopian and Caucaucus youth, helping them integrate and to come to truly know Israel. Donor-sponsored Multicultural Orienteering activities provide opportunities to strengthen the feeling of personal and social belonging and personal empowerment by dealing with physical and emotional challenges. *Eco-Community Centers ‚Äì (in Hebrew known as MaLaShim, which is an abbreviation for \\"Merkaz Limudei Sadeh\\") ‚Äì SPNI operates a network of about a dozen Environmental Community Centers primarily serving development towns with limited social services, whose populations face multiple difficulties such as unemployment and poverty. Malashim offer in-school and after-school fun activities that relate to the environment and nature, including occasional nature trips for the whole family. Over the past three decades, Malashim have become a vital part of local educational and extracurricular programming. Some Malashim bring together underprivileged Jewish and Arab children and some serve populations heavily affected by terrorism, for example in Sderot.  Urban Branches  Spearheading environmental activities in Israel's major metropolitan areas is integral to SPNI's overall endeavors. Field-based and hands-on, SPNI staff run urban eco-centers from which they work with residents to raise awareness of environmental issues and run educational activities for children, youth and adults to promote a sense of pride and belonging to the land. These centers also serve as the core from which SPNI assembles and coordinates grassroots activities, takes part in regional planning activities and promotes environmental issues with local government bodies. SPNI's major branches are located in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Be'er Sheva, Haifa and Modi'in. In 2011, the Russian government asked the organization to vacate its offices in Jerusalem in the Sergei Courtyard complex.Russia demands Israeli group vacate historic Jerusalem building, Haaretz  Ecotourism  SPNI is probably best known for its network of field schools, established adjacent to Israel's Nature Reserves and National Parks. Tens of thousands of Israelis and tourists participate in SPNI guided hikes and walks focusing on nature study. SPNI's Field School system combines three main areas of activity: education ‚Äì teaching youth and adults about the region; conservation ‚Äì protecting the region's natural environment; and research ‚Äì gathering information about the region in conjunction with SPNI's various departments. Field Schools are an integral part of SPNI's operations, a focal area for local eco-activities, and play a leading role in Israeli environmental tourism and education. English- language tours are offered by the Jerusalem Bird Observatory.  Israel Trails Committee (ITC)  The ITC marked and actively maintains 10,000 kilometers paths, 950 kilometers of which represents the Israel National Trail. A few full-time SPNI employees out in the field mark and repair trail markers, from the Galilee to the Negev.

Pert was also known as Alert and City of Windermere at times. Design and construction Pert was built at Golden, British Columbia, by Fred Wells, who named the vessel Alert. The vessel seems to have been originally built as a bateau, that is, an unpowered river vessel propelled by oars or by poling along the river. An engine and sidewheels were installed in 1890. Operations The tramway at Columbia Lake In 1891, Capt. Frank P. Armstrong started operating Pert as part of his steamboat line, the Upper Columbia Navigation & Tramway Co. (UCN&T;) to operate on the headwaters of the Columbia River above Golden, an area which is known as the Columbia Valley. From 1892 to 1898, Armstrong ran Pert on Columbia Lake. Use on Columbia Lake The river flowing out of Columbia Lake was often too shallow for a steamboat, and so UCN&T; built a mule or horse-drawn tramway extending to the northern end of Columbia Lake. Cargoes bound south to the valley of the upper Kootenay River would be loaded on the tramway, and pulled to the wharf on the lake, then loaded on Pert. The steamboat would then paddle south across the lake to the portage at Canal Flats. The cargo would then be unloaded and portaged over to the Kootenay River. When Pert was running on the river, a canal and lock connected Columbia Lake with the Kootenay River. The canal was not much used; only three steamboat transits were ever made. Sale In 1898 Armstrong sold Pert to Capt. Alex Blakely, who rebuilt the vessel into a propeller- driven towboat with a new name, City of Windermere. In 1903, Blakely sold it to Capt. E.N. Russell, who changed the vessel's name back to Pert and ran her on Windermere Lake and the upper Columbia River from 1903 to 1905. Abandonment Pert was abandoned in 1905 on Windermere Lake.

Its name comes from the Latin insula barbara, \\"Barbarians' Island\\", suggesting that it was one of the last locales to be occupied (two centuries after the banks of the Sa√¥ne at the foot of the hill of Fourvi√®re).  Geography   History  An abbaye was founded on the island in the 5th century. This was the first monastic establishment in the Lyon region and one of the oldest in all of Gaul. Charlemagne gave it a beautiful library. The monastery, pillaged several times ‚Äì (in 676 and 725 by the Saracens, and in 937 by the HunsLyon Historique - L'√Æle Barbe), adopted the Rule of Saint Benedict r√®gle de saint Beno√Æt in the 9th century and gradually was enriched.

In 1549, the abbey was secularised and the monts became a college of canons chanoines (coll√©giale). In 1562, it was looted and burned by Protestant troops troupes protestantes of the Baron des Adrets baron des Adrets. The chapter of canons chapitre des chanoines finally was suppressed in 1741, and an establishment for aged or infirm priests was established, which was suppressed in its turn in 1783. At the Revolution, everything remaining on the island was sold and dispersed.

Only the northern part of the Ile may be visited (about one-half of the island) which consists of old private homes and a few vestiges of religious buildings. One also may find a gastronomic restaurant, of the chain Relais & Ch√¢teaux, the ¬´ Auberge de l'√éle ¬ª. Also intact are some remains of a lodging reconstructed in about 1840 as the ch√¢teau de Saint-Rambert-l'Ile-Barbe or ch√¢teau du Fresnes, also the ch√¢teau du Chastelard of the 15th century, reconstructed in the 16th century. A dwelling place for several persons, posh and privileged, the Ile is reached by a 10-minute bus ride from the gare de Vaise (bus TCL 31 et 43 c√¥t√© Lyon-St Rambert), and 15 minutes from the Place Bellecour (bus TCL 40 c√¥t√© Caluire). The Ile is composed of a public part ‚Äì terrains for p√©tanque, a large lawn, a children's playground ‚Äì and a private part reached via two roads, l'impasse Saint-Loup for reaching the Auberge and the chemin du Bas- Port leading to the Sa√¥ne). These two paths are not joined, the impasse Saint- Loup ends at the door to a private courtyard.

Konstantinov has spent much of his career singing roles with the Sofia National Opera where he has appeared as Mephistopheles in Gounod's Faust, Raimondo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Count Walter in Verdi's Luisa Miller, Sparafucile in Verdi's Rigoletto, Fiesco in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, Sarastro in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, both Don Pedro and the title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni, and as Timur in Puccini's Turandot among other roles. Family Konstantinov's younger brother, Plamen Konstantinov, is a former volleyball player and captain of the Bulgaria men's national volleyball team and last played for Iraklis VC in the Greek A1 Volleyball League. Controversy On May 20, 2012, Konstantinov allegedly has assaulted a Bulgarian journalist, Kiril Hristov, after seeing the latter turning up his SUV's wipers. Mr. Hristov apparently did this as a protest for having Konstantinov's car improperly parked. The incident gained fast publicity among the Bulgarian online community. Both Mr. Hristov and Mr. Konstantinov wrote their versions of what happened.

Portrait by Jean-Michel Grobon Pierre Henri R√©voil (12 June 1776, in Lyon ‚Äì 19 March 1842, in Paris) was a French painter in the troubadour style.  Biography  His father was a furrier. Although he was needed at home, his family allowed him to receive a proper education. He first studied art at the √âcole centrale in Lyon, under the direction of Donat Nonnotte. In 1793, increasing poverty forced his family to send him to work with a manufacturer of patriotic wallpapers. Two years later, he managed to find a place at the studios of Jacques-Louis David at the √âcole des Beaux- arts.Web Gallery: Brief biography Initially, he found himself fascinated by Greek vase paintings and found some notoriety for his scenes of the Revolution. He also did many large-scale religious paintings, but soon focused almost exclusively on historical scenes from the Middle Ages, in what would later be somewhat derisively called the \\"Troubadour Style\\". Henry IV and His Children (before 1825) In 1802, when Napoleon, laid the foundation stones for the Place Bellecour, R√©voil celebrated the occasion with a large allegorical drawing, \\"Napoleon Rebuilding the Town of Lyon\\", which became the basis for a painting exhibited at the Salon in 1804. Three years later, he was named a Professor in the √âcole des beaux-arts at the palais Saint-Pierre (now the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon). By 1811 he had amassed a huge collection of Medieval armor, chests, vases, wall hangings, paintings and manuscripts. This personal museum was used as a teaching tool for his students at the √âcole. By this time, it was also quite famous and was described in detail for the ' by Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison. He also wrote Medieval-style chansons, some of which became popular in the Lyon region. Bayard (1817) When the First Empire fell, he rallied to the cause of the Restoration and destroyed his painting of Napoleon. The following year, he married the eighteen-year-old daughter of a cousin and moved to Provence in 1818. He returned to Lyon in 1823 and served as Director of the √âcole until 1830. Some of his best-known students there were Claude Bonnefond, Hippolyte Flandrin and Victor Orsel. In 1828, he donated his collection to the LouvreLarousse: Brief biography and had just finished transferring it to Paris when the July Revolution broke out. This put an end to his career and he left for Provence again, never to return to Lyon. Years later, alone and penniless, he moved into a loft on the Rue de Seine in Paris, where he died. His sister was the poet Louise Colet and his son, Henri R√©voil, was a well-known architect who restored many churches and other public buildings.

It currently has thirty open National Rail stations, though there were once well over a hundred. Between 1959 and 1970 much of the network was closed, including more than two thirds of Norfolk's railway stations, several main lines and most of the branch lines - leaving only a core network in place. Several of the former routes have since been re-opened as heritage railway lines, such as the North Norfolk Railway and the Mid-Norfolk Railway. History Arrival of the railway The railway first arrived in Norfolk in 1845 with a major extension of an existing line from London which previously had stopped short of Cambridge at Bishop's Stortford. The extension had been built in sections by three different companies: the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER;) ‚Äî Bishop's Stortford to Newport; the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) ‚Äî Newport through Cambridge to Brandon); and the Norwich & Brandon Railway (N&B;) ‚Äî Brandon via Wymondham to Norwich. However, the ECR had already held on lease the N&ER;'s line from Stratford to Bishop's Stortford, and it continued to operate all the services over the expanded route, whose parts were opened simultaneously. Its original terminus was at Trowse on the outskirts of Norwich. In 1849 this route was joined by the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) line from Haughley to Norwich, extending its own lines from Colchester via Ipswich, creating a new terminus at Norwich Victoria. This route is now the Great Eastern Main Line. Journey times to the capital were shorter on this route, and it soon became very profitable. King's Lynn had been linked to the country's growing railway network in 1846, and in 1862 the line was extended on to Hunstanton. Expansion of the network The creation of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, a combined venture between the Midland railway and the Great Northern Railway merged several smaller schemes into a larger proposal of creating a new main line from the Midlands into Norfolk. The M&GNR; created a hub at Melton Constable, which served as a junction for the route with lines heading west to the Midlands, north to Cromer, south to Norwich and east towards Great Yarmouth as well as housing a major engineering works. In the late Victorian era with the new waves of holiday passengers during the summer months, and the increased routes for cross-Britain trade, Norfolk boomed thanks to the new rail network. Despite this some stations such as Bluestone railway station and Starston railway station closed shortly after opening, as traffic was considered too low to justify keeping them open. Other schemes, such as a proposed branch line extension to Blakeney, were dropped when they appeared uneconomical. Groupings and nationalisation In 1923 the Railways Act 1921 came into force which resulted in British railways being merged into four main companies. Much of the county's routes came under the control of the London and North Eastern Railway, though the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway maintained its independence, and remained one of the few routes outside of the new system. In 1947, all British rail companies were nationalised and Britain's railways came under state control. Until 1997 all of Norfolk's stations were under the control of British Rail. Beeching Axe Middleton Towers were closed in the wake of the Beeching Axe. A number of the cuts to the Norfolk network predated the Beeching Axe by several years. In 1959 the Main Line of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway was closed, on economic grounds. Essential maintenance work was considered too much to be justified. As car ownership increased, the need for rural routes was considered lessened, and the least profitable were screened for closure in order to save money. Beeching issued a report in 1962, recommending that a large number of stations and lines be closed. In Norfolk, on the principal routes, such as the Great Eastern Main Line, a number of the intermediate stations at small rural towns and villages were closed, to speed up journey times. Smaller branch lines like the Waveney Valley Line were closed completely. Many of the former trackbeds were tuned into pathways such as Marriott's Way, which remain open to cyclists and pedestrians. Many of the former stations were converted for private use. A few routes managed to survive the initial cuts, such as the line between Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth which survived until 1970. The Bittern Line was not proposed for closure, and stayed open. But King's Lynn-Hunstanton and King's Lynn-Dereham- Wymondham closed despite not being proposed for closure in the Report. A second report by Beeching had proposed even more severe cuts to the East Anglia rail network, leaving only the Main Line into Norwich, but it was rejected by the government. Heritage railways Several Heritage Railways operate in Norfolk, including the North Norfolk Railway. Class 101 DMU on the Mid-Norfolk Railway Norfolk is home to around five Heritage railways and various preserved train stations. North Norfolk Railway The North Norfolk Railway operates a preserved five-mile route between Holt and Sheringham (via, Weybourne) on the Norfolk coast. It was preserved in the 1960s/70s, and the extension to Holt opened in 1987.http://www.nnrailway.co.uk/visit.htm Mid-Norfolk Railway The Mid- Norfolk Railway operates a preserved fifteen-mile route between Wymondham and Worthing, A further two and a half mile extension to County School station is planned. It is also proposed to extend south to Wymondham Junction, to connect services with the National Rail main line at nearby Wymondham. Bure Valley Railway The Bure Valley Railway is a 15 inch gauge railway that runs for nine miles between Aylsham and Wroxham.http://www.bvrw.co.uk/ Wells and Walsingham Light Railway The Wells and Walsingham is a 10¬º in gauge railway which runs for four miles from Wells-next-the-Sea to Walsingham (via, Wighton). Whitwell and Reepham Railway The Whitwell and Reepham Railway, is a newcomer to the UK Preservation Movement, it currently only runs just a few yards of newly relayed track, based at Whitwell Station, itself. Existing network There are currently thirty working National Rail stations in Norfolk. Most of the major towns and settlements are served by trains. Norwich railway station is the busiest station, being used by around two and a half million passengers a year. The network is currently administered by Network Rail: services in the east of the county are mainly provided by Abellio Greater Anglia with regional services by East Midlands Railway; and in the west by Great Northern with a weekday peak-hours commuting service by Abellio Greater Anglia.

The Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF) is created by the US Federal government Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to allow federal agencies to assess and report their enterprise architecture activity and maturity,Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework, Office of Management and Budget, USA. and to advance the use of enterprise architecture in the federal government.Pallab Saha (2009) Advances in Government Enterprise Architecture. Idea Group Inc (IGI). p.133 The version 2.2 of the framework was released in October 2007,OMB (july 2007) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program EA Assessment Framework 2.2. (Online copy here) and version 3.1 in June 2009.  Overview  The OMB Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (the Framework) helps OMB and the agencies assess the capability of enterprise architecture programs to guide IT investments.Federal Enterprise Architecture, Office of Management and Budget, USA. It also helps to better understand the current state of an agency‚Äôs EA, and assists them in integrating it into their decision-making processes. By applying the assessment themselves, agencies can identify strengths and weaknesses within their programs and adjust them accordingly. Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF) version 3.1 identifies the measurement areas and criteria by which agencies are expected to use the EA to drive performance improvements that result in the following outcomes: * Closing agency performance gaps identified via coordinated agency strategic planning and performance management activities; * Saving money and avoiding cost through collaboration and reuse, productivity enhancements, and elimination of redundancy; * Strengthening the quality of agency investment portfolios by improving security, inter-operability, reliability, availability, solution development and service delivery time, and overall end- user performance; * Improving the quality, availability and sharing of data and information government-wide; and * Increasing the transparency of government operations by increasing the capacity for citizen participation and cross-governmental collaboration. While agencies have clearly demonstrated a degree of maturity and competency in developing and using their EAs, EAAF seeks to advance the practice of EA, particularly through the development and use of agency segment architectures, aimed at driving the kinds of government- wide outcomes.US OBM (2009). Improving Agency Performance Using Information and Information Technology : Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework v3.1 June 2009  Performance Improvement Lifecycle  Government agencies are continually assessing current performance, identifying opportunities for improvement, and translating them into specific actions. Enterprise architecture is an integrated management practice that maximizes the use of an agency‚Äôs resources to achieve their goals. Architecture describes the pathway from strategic goals and objectives, through investments, to measurable performance improvements for the entire enterprise or a portion. Information and IT-Enabled Performance Improvement Lifecycle Continuous performance improvement is the principal driver connecting EA program staff with key business stakeholders across each phase of the Performance Improvement Lifecycle. Agency Chief Architects and EA program staff: * identify and prioritize enterprise segments and opportunities to improve mission performance, linked to agency goals and objectives; * plan a course of action to close performance gaps, using common or shared information assets and information technology assets; * allocate agency resources supporting program management and project execution; * measure and assess performance to verify and report results; and * assess feedback on program performance to enhance architecture, investment and implementation decisions. Opportunities to improve mission performance are prioritized in terms of their relative value to the agency‚Äôs strategic goals and objectives in the enterprise transition plan (ETP) and segment architecture.  Architect  Enterprise architecture describes the current (baseline) and future (target) states of the agency, and the plan to transition from the current to the future state, with a focus on agency strategy, program performance improvements and information technology investments. Agency EAs are organized by segments ‚Äì core mission areas (e.g., homeland security, health), business service (e.g., financial management, human resources), and enterprise services (e.g., Information Sharing). Segments are defined using the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) reference models .  Invest  Performance improvement opportunities identified during the ‚ÄúArchitect‚Äù process are ideally addressed through an agency portfolio of IT investments. This step defines the implementation and funding strategy for individual initiatives in the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) and described in the segment architectures. Program management plans are created to implement the individual solutions.  Implement  Projects are executed and tracked throughout the system development life cycle (SDLC). Achievement of the program / project plan within acceptable variance for schedule and budget is measured and reported through Earned Value Management (EVM) process.  Measure, assess and improve  EAAF assessment table describing how agency EAs will be assessed. Information and information technology, as critical enablers of program performance improvements, must be assessed and evaluated in the context of agency missions and outcome-oriented results defined in the enterprise-wide performance architecture. Performance improvement plans and priorities, including those previously gathered under the PART and Performance Assessment Report (PAR) programs, are reflected in the agency EA, particularly the performance architecture and ETP. Performance metrics previously gathered are used to evaluate the results in agency performance improvement plans, identifying a program‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses and addressing ways to improve the program performance.  Agency submission data quality  OMB collects a significant amount of IT investment data and other related data from executive agencies during each phase of Performance Improvement Lifecycle. OMB uses the information for development of an IT investment portfolio as a part of the President‚Äôs budget request to Congress.

He was educated at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania. He later became an educator, athletic manager and coach, administrator and mentor to countless young men. Early life Alfred M. Venne was born near Leroy, Pembina County, Dakota Territory, in 1879. His Native American name was Soangetaha (Fiero: Zoongide'e, \\"Strong Hearted\\"). After early education at local Indian Schools, Alfred entered Carlisle in 1899. He was an excellent football and baseball player under their famous Coach Glenn S. \\"Pop\\" Warner. Venne graduated from Carlisle in the class of 1904. Warner coached Carlisle 1899-1903 and 1907-1914. The 1904-06 football teams were Indian coached with great success by Eddy Rodgers and Bemus Pierce, both former Carlisle All- Americans. Upon his graduation, Alfred was highly regarded and retained on staff at Carlisle as an athletic trainer and coach. His extraordinary skills were also utilized as football team business manager, band manager, museum curator, and photography lab instructor and manager. He was a member of a group from Carlisle which took part in the President Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Parade in March, 1905 in Washington D.C., at which time he met and became friends with the great Apache War Chief Geronimo. The legendary Jim Thorpe arrived at Carlisle in 1904 at age 16. He had played baseball, ran track, etc., but had not played football. Alfred trained and coached Thorpe in several sports and was instrumental in preparing him to play football in 1907 when Pop Warner returned to Carlisle from Cornell as head coach. Family Alfred was the son of Michel Venne, an Ojibwa tribal chief and farmer. After graduation from Carlisle, Alfred married Sarah Williams, a Seneca from New York. She was also a Carlisle graduate and trained as a nurse. They had a son, Alfred M. Venne, Jr. (1908‚Äì1939), who died from TB after a long illness in Missouri. They also had a daughter Victoria Haskell Venne. Later life Alfred was transferred from Carlisle to the Chilocco Indian School, Oklahoma in 1909, where he served briefly. He then spent a number of years as Athletic Manager and Coach at Haskell Indian Institute in Kansas, and later worked as a YMCA Director. He retired in 1946 as athletic director at the Kansas City Athletic Club. He then moved to Austin, Texas, and worked for the Capitol Area Council of boy scouts serving as Ranger at Camp Tom Wooten. He also developed the Tonkawa Lodge Indian Dance Group. In late 1953, Chief Venne relocated to Sebastopol, California, and continued to be involved with several boy scout councils. Chief Venne died in January, 1971 in California at the age of 91. He had cherished his Carlisle experience, with the belief that his people needed to become educated and assimilate into American society. He was proud of his Native American roots, embraced his culture and remained a devout Christian during his entire life. Albert A.

The crime became the subject of the Academy Award-winning film Boys Don't Cry. 2000 *Amanda Milan, a 25-year-old trans woman, was walking by Times Square, Manhattan, New York City, when Dwayne McCuller walked up and began to harass and threaten her. Milan stood up to him and asked him if he wanted to fight. Witnesses said he declined. As he walked away, another young man, Eugene Celestine, told McCuller he had a knife. McCuller grabbed it, and stabbed Milan in the neck. A man named David Anderson reportedly helped McCuller escape from the scene. Milan died soon after at St. Vincent's Hospital. Transgender activist Sylvia Rivera worked towards seeing that Milan's death was investigated and organized Milan's political funeral along with other demonstrations claiming a disconnection of transgender rights from the larger LGBT communities. After Milan's murder, Rivera reformed a transgender activist group, Street Trans Activist Revolutionaries (STAR). Rivera cited the crime among the reasons to add a broad definition of gender to the New York City Human Rights Law. 2002 * Gwen Araujo of Newark, California (died October 2002), a Latino-American teenage trans woman, was killed by four men, two of whom she had sexual relations, who beat and strangled her after discovering she was transgender. Two defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, but not convicted on the requested hate crime enhancements. The other two defendants pleaded guilty or no contest to voluntary manslaughter. In at least one of the trials, a trans panic defense ‚Äì an extension of the gay panic defense ‚Äì was employed. 2003 * Nireah Johnson was a 17 year old African American trans woman who was murdered along with friend Brandie Coleman in Indianapolis, Indiana by Paul Moore, who was initially sexually attracted to Johnson and then discovered that she was transgender so he lit her car on fire while she was with Coleman inside. * Janice Roberts was an American transgender woman who was kidnapped by serial killer William Devin Howell on 18 June.

According to Patel, while having sex with her he noticed her surgery scars and he panicked as a result and strangled her. The prosecutor attempted to classify her death as a hate crime, but Supreme Court of British Columbia Justice Patrick Dohm ruled that the crime was not motivated by hate because he did not know of her transgender identity when meeting her and thus could have not targeted her for it. Patel's defense attorney used a gay panic defense as part of his defense of Patel, who pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in jail. 2006 * Gisberta Salce J√∫nior, a Brazilian transgender woman, was murdered in Oporto, Portugal, by a group of 14 youths between 12 and 16 years old, who tortured and raped her for three days, and finally threw her, still alive, into a well over 15 m deep, where she drowned. Eleven of the minors received minimal sentences of under 13 months in a semi-open education center of the Instituto de Reinser√ß√£o Social, and two received sentences of additional education. Her death became a symbol of the violence against women and the LGBT community, and shortly after laws protecting trans women were introduced in Portugal. 2007 * Roberto, a transgender man, was killed by two women that had found refuge in his apartment, in Madrid, Spain. Both women had been mistreating Roberto physically and psychologically for a year, before they killed him on 29 August 2007 with a brutal hit on the head. Both women were condemned to 19 years of prison. 2008 * Latisha King was shot twice in the back of the head in a class at a computer lab on February 12, 2008 at E. O.

Miami Police claimed the murder resulted from an argument and not a transgender hate crime, however Fantroy's mother, whom she lived with, and others who knew her disagreed. Fantroy was reportedly headed home from a party with a group when a teenage male, 17, approached her and propositioned her for sex, which she declined, after which he began shooting at another member of the group. Fantroy ran, pursued by the young man, who then opened fire and murdered her. On 5 August, the suspect was arrested in connection with an unrelated case, and admitted to the murder in police custody.

Kuhnhausen had previously been missing since 5 June (reported 10 June) when she left with a male suspect, 25, who has since been charged (second-degree) in her murder. The suspect's account cites trans panic as his reason for the murder. Authorities currently believe the suspect, looking for a sexual encounter, became enraged upon learning of Kuhnhausen's transgender status. Spurred by the case, on 26 February 2020, the Washington State Legislature passed the Nikki Kuhnhausen Act, outlawing the use of panic defenses based on gender and sexual identities. The Act preempts the trial of Kuhnhausen's alleged killer and thus prevents the use of that defense. =Mexico= *Carly VG, a transgender woman and sex worker was stabbed to death by a group of people in the downtown of Oaxaca on July 15. *La Becky, a 52-year-old transgender woman who owned the local gay bar La Esquina del Chacal, was killed in the Minatitl√°n shooting on April 19.

Located near Place des Terreaux, it is housed in a former Benedictine convent which was active during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was restored between 1988 and 1998, remaining open to visitors throughout this time despite the restoration works. Its collections range from ancient Egyptian antiquities to the Modern art period, making the museum one of the most important in Europe. It also hosts important exhibitions of art, for example the exhibitions of works by Georges Braque and Henri Laurens in the second half of 2005, and another on the work of Th√©odore G√©ricault from April to July 2006. It is one of the largest art museums in France. Buildings Abbey Until 1792, the buildings belonged to the Royal Abbaye des Dames de Saint-Pierre, which was built in the 17th century. The abbess always came from the high French nobility and here received the personalities of the kingdom. The institution had a particularly aristocratic slant, as is shown by its renovation by Louis XIV of France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The present state of the palais Saint-Pierre is largely down to these renovations, which included the construction of the baroque refectory and monumental honour-staircase, said to be by Thomas Blanchet. Since then, the refectory has been renovated and now serves as the reception for group visits, as well as housing two monumental paintings on the subject of dining, The Multiplication of the Loaves and The Last Supper, both by Pierre-Louis Cretey. The rest of its current layout was designed by Nicolas Bidaut and Simon Guillaume and is made up of sculptures. The Palais du commerce et des Arts The expulsion of the nuns and the destruction of the √©glise Saint-Saturnin date to the French Revolution, though the abbey's other church (the √©glise Saint-Pierre) still exists and now houses 19th and 20th century sculptures. After the Revolution, the remaining buildings housed the Palais du Commerce et des Arts, at first made up of works confiscated from the clergy and nobility but later becoming more multi-disciplinary. For example, it gained archaeology and natural history collections and those of the Acad√©mie des Sciences et des Lettres. The imperial drawing school was created in 1805 in the Palais du Commerce et des Arts to provide Lyon's silk factories with designers, giving birth to the famous Lyon School. In 1860, the Chambre de Commerce left the Palais Saint-Pierre and the establishment became the Palais des Arts. From 1875, the museum's collections underwent a major expansion and had to be expanded ‚Äî the staircase by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes dates to this era. The Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts The collections were opened up considerably at the start of the 20th century, leading to the Palais des Arts becoming the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts. The building acquired its present layout in the mid-1990s after the completion of several restoration projects.

Antiquities =Egypt= Ancient Egypt is the main theme of the museum's antiquities department, due to the historic importance of egyptology in Lyon, encouraged by men like Victor Loret, whose family gave over 1000 objects to the museum in 1954. From 1895, the mus√©e du Louvre provided nearly 400 objects (unguent vases, funerary figurines etc.) to form the foundation of the department; other objects (canopic vases, jewellery, material from Antino√∂polis) were added later to complement this initial donation, and were augmented in 1936 by objects from the artisans' village of Deir el-Medina. The highlights of the collection are its display of sarcophaguses and the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the temple of Medamud dug by the Lyons archaeologist Alexandre Varille in 1939 and donated by the French Institute of Oriental Archeology of Cairo. The remaining objects shed light on everyday life in ancient Egypt. The collection has 600 works displayed in 9 rooms, in a thematic and chronological sequence: Fragment of the funerary bas-relief probably from Deir-el-Bahari, 20th Dynasty. * Room 1 : Life After Death The development of funerary practices are explored via a display of Old Kingdom to Late Period coffins, canopic vases, organs, shabtis and 155 amulets on a variety of subjects. There is also a fragment of the tomb of Bakenranef found at Saqqarah, dating to the 26th Dynasty, as well as a Roman-era shroud. Fragment of a bas-relief from the temple of Cleopatra VII and Caesarion, Koptos, 1st century BC * Room 2 : The divine and its rites Decorations from a temple are recreated along the length of this room, culminating with the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the late temple at Medamud (the former is fragmentary but retains part of its original polychromy, whereas the latter is nearly complete). The other bas-reliefs in this room come from Koptos - eight are dated to the Middle Kingdom and come from a temple to Min. They were discovered by Adolphe Reinach in 1909 in the foundations of a late building. 11 other fragments come from the end of the Ptolemaic era, and more precisely from the reign of Cleopatra VII. Even if Pharaonic statuary is underrepresented in the museum, the fragment of the statue of Ramses VI in pink granite and the outline of the statue of Commodus as pharaoh document this aspect of Egyptian art. * Room 3 : The cult of the divine Entered through the gate of Ptolemy IV, at the centre of this room is a support from a barque or statue dating to the reign of Ptolemy II. On the walls are 3 fragments of bas-reliefs from the 28th Dynasty, also found in Koptos. Green sandstone head of a king of Nectanebo II. * Room 4 : Images and emblems of the divine This room's three cases contain a collection of bronze statuettes of Gods from the Egyptian pantheon, with a rare representation of Hapy, god of the Nile, dating from the Late Period. One whole case is devoted to representations of Osiris and another to those of the pharaoh. In this room is the head of a pharaoh of the 30th Dynasty, attributed to Nectanebo II, a Middle Kingdom bust (characterised by its over-large ears), and a scarab with the name of Amenhotep II.

They represent scenes from everyday life such as grazing cattle, or beer-making. In the opposite case are two displays: one on writing, and the other on the pharaoh's servants. The latter has, among other objects, a limestone statue of an anonymous Old Kingdom couple, a Ptolemaic male bust, and a fragment of a statuette of a kneeling scribe. * Room 6 : Stelae Arranged around a wooden statue of Osiris are four Middle Kingdom stelae, eight New Kingdom stelae, and four from the Roman era. One of the most beautiful is that of Ptahmose, high priest of Amon, vizir of Thebes and chief of works under Amenophis III, which retains traces of its polychromy. * Room 7 : Everyday life One case contains 14 protohistoric and pre-dynastic vases, whilst another shows a selection of vases spanning the New Kingdom to the Late Period. The main display in this room contains many unique pieces, such as the 2nd Dynasty stela of Nes-Henou, or the magnificent wooden male head of the 28th Dynasty, perhaps part of the ornamentation of a harp. It also contains everyday objects like sandals, mirrors, jewellery, and even a stool. * Room 8 : Egypt and the Greeks - Egypt and Rome This room explores Greek and Roman influences on Egyptian art. This is especially prevalent in private works of art such as a series of terracotta figurines of Egyptian Gods with Hellenistic traits, and five 2nd and 3rd century funerary stelae from Koptos showing Palmyrenean influence. * Room 9 : Egypt and the Roman Empire - Coptic Christianity This room houses gold-plated funerary masks from the Roman period; and bas- reliefs, pateras and textiles from the Coptic civilisation, including a fragment of the famous \\"shawl of Sabina\\". =Near East and Middle East= One room contains cylinder seals, clay tablets and bas-reliefs from the Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian civilisations, as well as Luristan bronzes, ceramics and statuettes from Cyprus and a fine collection of Syrian objects (including an anthropoid sarcophagus and a marble bas-relief). =Ancient Greece and Italy= A single room is devoted to the main work in this department, the 6th century BC marble kore from the Acropolis of Athens. A second room is dedicated to ancient Greece, containing a series of Attic vases in black-figure or red-figure, bronzes and terracotta Tanagra figurines. Finally, a small room is devoted to Magna Graecia, with many ceramics and bronze helmets. Roman sculpture is also presented across several rooms - marble statues (a torso of Venus, a child on a cockerel, statues of draped figures etc.) and also small bronze figurines of Gods from the Roman Pantheon such as Mercury, Venus, Mars etc. The Gallo-Roman collections of the city of Lyon, previously presented at the Museum of Fine Arts and the Antiquarium, were transferred in 1975 at the Lugdunum museum on the hill of Fourvi√®re near the Roman theatre and Odeon. Objets d‚ÄôArt This department's collection ranges from the Middle Ages to the 20th century and includes: * Byzantine ivories * Limoges enamels * Renaissance faience and maiolica * Art Nouveau room by Hector Guimard * Islamic art * Far East ceramics * Chinese, Korean and Japanese stoneware (since 1917) - rare pieces illustrating the tea ceremony, displayed next to the Art Nouveau ceramics they inspired. *The Death of Polydorus, tapestry *Silk fabrics produced by Lyon's silk manufacturing trade, including works by Jean-Fran√ßois Bony. Coins and medals Lyon's \\"m√©daillier\\" is the second largest one in France after that in Paris, with nearly 50,000 coins, medals, seals and other objects. It is known at a European level and has held a prominent place in the numismatic world from its beginnings in the 19th century to recent discoveries of the treasuries of the Terreaux and the C√©lestins. Graphic arts This department was created at the start of the 19th century and includes works on paper - drawings, prints, engravings, watercolours etc. - based on line rather than colour. In all it more than 8,000 works, including ones by Filippino Lippi, Parmigianino, Fra Bartolomeo, Leonetto Cappiello, Nicolas Poussin, Fran√ßois Boucher, Ingres, Th√©odore G√©ricault, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Honor√© Daumier, Odilon Redon, Puvis de Chavannes, Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Fernand L√©ger and a remarkable study by Albrecht D√ºrer. Magazine On the initiative of Ren√© Jullian, in 1952 the Bulletin des mus√©es lyonnais was created, and 8 years later changed its name to Bulletin des mus√©es et monuments Lyonnais. In 2003 it changed to an annual publication and again changed its name, to Cahiers du mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.  Collection  * Cloth of St Gereon, a fragment the museum has in its inventory.

Weil is best known as being the former chairman and chief executive officer of Global Wealth Management & Business Banking at UBS AG. Weil eventually became a member of UBS's group executive board. During Weil's tenure at UBS, the bank became embroiled in the 2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy, which led to Weil's voluntary departure from the bank after he was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly offering help to thousands of UBS's U.S. clients who failed to pay their federal income taxes. Arrested in October 2013 during a trip to Italy, Weil has been extradited to the United States. On December 16, 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail by the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014, and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014. Early life Weil was born in Switzerland. Weil graduated from the University of Basel with a degree in economics. He also earned a master's degree in economics with a specialization in national economics and business administration.  Charitable Activities Raoul Weil is a member of the Optimus Foundation, a charitable foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world. In 2008, Weil was elected chairman of the Optimus Foundation's board, pledging the foundation to the goal of becoming the largest charitable organization in Switzerland in the next decade. In September 2008, Weil led the Global UBS Philanthropy Forum, which brought together philanthropists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and representatives from civil society from around the world to consider the theme of ‚ÄúBuilding Change Communities.‚Äù Banking career After he finished active duty in the Swiss military in 1984, Weil was hired by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), and worked in SBC's private banking division in Basel, Zurich, Monaco, New York City, and Hong Kong from 1984 until 1998. When SBC and UBS merged in 1998, Weil joined UBS as part of its private banking division for Asia and Europe, becoming head of UBS's Wealth Management International unit in 2002. In July 2007, Weil became CEO of WM&BB.; On November 12, 2008, Weil voluntarily relinquished his duties with UBS to focus on his defense after being indicted in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business by the United States Department of Justice. The United States issued an international arrest warrant for Weil in 2008. On May 23, 2008, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (EBK, the predecessor to FINMA) opened an investigation into UBS's role in facilitating tax evasion by its US clients. The EBK concluded, among other things, that UBS's ‚Äútop management‚Äù was not aware of the bank's US clients‚Äô fraudulent conduct, and were not ‚Äúaccessories or accomplices‚Äù to UBS's violations. The EBK also found that the US cross-border business's managers at the time ‚Äì Martin Liechti and Michel Guignard ‚Äì were the principal architects of UBS's wrongdoing and had actively concealed their misconduct from Weil. After leaving UBS, Weil was hired as a consultant in 2010 by Reuss Private Group (Pf√§ffikon, Schwyz, Switzerland), eventually becoming a managing partner. At the beginning of 2013, he succeeded Adriano B. Lucatelli as chief executive officer of Reuss Private Group. In February 2013, FINMA granted Reuss a license to deal in securities and certified that Reuss management, including Weil, was engaged in ‚Äúproper business conduct‚Äù (Gew√§hr f√ºr eine einwandfreie Gesch√§ftst√§tigkeit). As part of the application process, Weil confirmed in writing that he had not concealed anything with respect to the US-UBS tax dispute. On December 2, 2013, Weil was replaced by Felix Brem as CEO of Reuss Private Group. US Tax Evasion Controversy In 2008, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation began probing a multimillion-dollar tax evasion case involving UBS due to disclosures made by Brad Birkenfeld, a former UBS banker in Switzerland, who was arrested entering the United States and cooperated with the US Department of Justice, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and the US Internal Revenue Service. Concurrently, a United States Senate subcommittee accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts, which it estimated cost of the U.S. excess of US$100 billion annually. In response, UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008. As part of its investigation into the conduct of UBS's US cross-border business, DOJ demanded client banking records from UBS. Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, UBS was prohibited from turning over such documents. The Swiss government interceded and began negotiating with DOJ in an effort to persuade DOJ to stop trying to force UBS to violate Swiss law. On November 6, 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS, and DOJ obtained an order from the court there placing the indictment under seal. On November 10, 2008, Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz and head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police Eveline Widmer- Schlumpf sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen asking that DOJ go through the information-sharing provisions of the US-Switzerland Double Taxation Treaty if it wanted to obtain information regarding UBS's clients. Weil's indictment was unsealed two days later, on November 12, 2008. According to one high-level Swiss source, ‚Äú[t]hat was a clear message . . . One can imagine that without the letter they would have at least delayed the indictment of Weil.‚Äù Weil soon thereafter left the bank to focus on the criminal case. On February 18, 2009, UBS agreed to pay a fine of US$780 million to the U.S. government and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the Internal Revenue Service. Retrieved on July 11, 2014. Weil's charges were not dismissed as part of UBS's deal, and he continued to face charges even after UBS had settled its criminal case and a subsequent dispute with the US government and IRS in the Fall of 2009, which resulted in UBS's agreeing to turn over thousands of US customer files to the US. On 6 January 2014, the National Whistleblowers Center claimed that Weil \\"will make a sweetheart deal with the DOJ\\" because he has \\"information that would be extremely embarrassing to wealthy and powerful people\\" in the United States and elsewhere.\\" Notwithstanding this claim, no such deal has apparently been reached. Weil is preparing for trial. Legal Issues Weil was declared a fugitive by Judge James Cohn on January 13, 2009.\\"Ex-UBS Executive Raoul Weil Named Fugitive by U.S. Judge\\" Bloomberg News, 14 January 2009 Weil has maintained his innocence of the charges against him. Weil, who remained in Switzerland, his home country and place of residence, after being indicted, maintains that he did not run from the United States. Extradition to U.S. On October 19, 2013, Weil was arrested in Bologna, Italy while on a trip from Switzerland.\\"Ex-manager svizzero Ubs accusato di frode fiscale arrestato a Bologna\\", Oct. 9, 2013, la Repubblica, at Elisa Martinuzzi & Elena Logutenkova, \\"Fugitive Ex-UBS Wealth Management Chief Weil Arrested in Italy,\\" Oct. 21, 2013, Bloomberg News, at . Weil's request for house arrest was turned down by Italian authorities, and Weil decided not to contest extradition to the United States. Weil's willingness to return to the U.S. raised the suspicion that he may have been offered a \\"sweetheart deal\\" by the U.S. Department of Justice, which treated another UBS conspirator, Martin Liechti, extremely leniently, according to Bradley Birkenfeld's lawyer, Stephen M. Kohn of the National Whistleblower Center. Birkenfeld worked several levels below Weil at UBS, and apparently did not know him. According to Kohn, Weil \\"knows where all the skeletons are buried. Kohn claims that, \\"Weil can clearly bargain inside information he has that could be embarrassing to American officials or institutions for leniency.\\" Weil has said in filings with the court that the wrongdoing was committed by people below him, who concealed their own misconduct from Weil. He has also contended that the EBK investigation and decision exonerating Weil confirm that version of events. Arraignment and Trial Charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in his appearance before the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on 16, December 2013, Weil was released on bail under house arrest with friends in New Jersey by US Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt. At his January 7, 2014 arraignment, Weil pleaded not-guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $20 billion in offshore assets. The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014, and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014. Jurors deliberated just over an hour before returning a not guilty verdict. The acquittal is final as prosecution cannot appeal in this case.

It spans the Ganter River valley and is located along the Simplon Pass road about south of Brig in the canton of Valais, Switzerland.Billington, 1983, p.260 It was designed by renowned Swiss civil engineer Christian Menn and completed in 1980. It is notable for its innovative design and its stylish geometric profile in its spectacular Alpine setting.  Design  Ganter Bridge: elevation (top) and plan (bottom) The bridge's form consists of an S-curve roadway, high above the Ganter River and at about above sea level, supported by two main towers and five smaller piers. They sustain a total of eight spans with lengths of, from north to south, respectively: , , , , , , , and . The main and longest span between the two towers, P3 and P4, is straight, while most of the remaining spans lie along curves with a radius of . The overall length is with a main span of , and a maximum tower height of . Ganter Bridge: concrete sails and walls across tower tops Its innovative design combines elements of a cable-stayed bridge and a prestressed cantilever hollow-box girder bridge, which has become to be referred to as an extradosed bridge. The Ganter Bridge is the first of its type to use triangular concrete walls above the roadway to encase the prestressed cable-stays into sails, which protects the cables from corrosion and gives the bridge a distinctive stylish geometric appearance. From some drivers' view, these triangular concrete walls plus the one across the top of the towers made the main span feel too much like a tunnel entrance. Whatever its pros and cons, the innovative and unique Ganter Bridge is one of Switzerland's ground-breaking bridges. In the words of David P. Billington: ‚ÄúGanter bridge ... represents one of those rare events where a new form arises‚Äù.  Construction  Approaching Ganter Bridge from the north side Construction began in 1976. The locations of the piers were based on geological conditions as well as symmetry and uniformity of span lengths. The shaft for pier P4 was approximately 40m deep. The south valley side was susceptible to creep movement, so the feet of the south valley piers P4 to P7 were mounted on pot bearings and regularly monitored. After the piers were complete, the balanced free cantilever construction method was employed. By autumn 1979, the entire substructure and approximately 60% of superstructure were complete. By December 1980 the construction was completed on schedule. Ganter Bridge under rehabilitation (2008) Between 2006 and 2008 the Ganter Bridge was given a complete rehabilitation as the piers on the south side of the bridge had shifted 105mm southward. Measures were taken to address further movement of the south side piers.  References  * Billington, David P. The Tower and the Bridge.

In 1925 it was codified in the United States Code as 28 U.S.C. 41(26) (1925). History  The Act allowed an insurance company, or fraternal benefit society subject to multiple claims on the same policy to file a suit in equity by a bill of interpleader in United States District Courts and providing nationwide service of process. It was introduced to overcome the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in New York Life v. Dunlevy , that for a party to be bound by an interpleader that party must be served process in a way that obtains personal jurisdiction. The policy must have a value of at least $500 is claimed or may be claimed by adverse claimants; which is less than the amount in controversy of $3,000 in Judicial Code ¬ß48(1) then required for general diversity jurisdiction. Two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states. This Act was amended in 1925 by approved February 25, 1925 dividing it into three sections, eliminating the words \\"may claim\\" that were in the 1917 act and clarifying the venue provisions . This element of civil procedure was subsequently in 1926 was repealed and replaced by, approved May 8,1926, which added to those who can bring suit casualty company and surety company, empowered the court to enjoin claimant from proceeding in any state or other federal court on the same liability, adding provisions as to the proper venue for the interpleader in cases were the claimants are in different districts. In 1936 the Federal Interpeader Act was again repealed and replaced by the Federal Interpleader Act of 1936 , , approved Jan. 20, 1936, drafted by Zechariah Chafee which codified it in as United States Judicial Code ¬ß41(26), and established the modern statutory interpleader allowing suite to be brought by any person, firm, corporation, association or society having custody of money or property or insurance policy or instrument valued at $500 or more which there are two or more adverse claimant who are citizens of different states, whether or not the claims have common origins, identical, adverse or independent of each other, and allowed it to be an equitable defense in actions at law, Judicial Code ¬ß274b.

Unlike the Homestead Act of 1862 or the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, land homesteaded under the 1916 act separated surface rights from subsurface rights, resulting in what later became known as split estates.Split EstatePrivate Surface / Public Minerals: What Does it Mean to You? , a 2006 Bureau of Land Management presentation The subsurface rights, also known as mineral rights, are the foundation of recent oil and gas law in the United States. Under the act no cultivation of lands was required, but some range improvements were mandated as necessary. By 2006, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and subsequent legislation and other legal changes resulted in the federal government administering the subsurface rights to about of land, of which have surface rights owned privately or by a U.S. state. Text of the Stock-Raising Act CHAP. 9. --An Act To provide for stock-raising homesteads, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the passage of this Act it shall be lawful for any person qualified to make entry under the homestead laws of the United States to make a stock-raising homestead entry for not exceeding six hundred and forty acres of unappropriated unreserved public land in reasonably compact form: Provided, however, That the land so entered shall theretofore have been designated by the Secretary of the Interior as \\"stock-raising lands.\\" SEC. 2.

That during such suspension the land described in the application shall not be disposed of; and if the said land shall be designated under this Act, then such application shall be allowed; otherwise it shall be rejected, subject to appeal; but no right to occupy such lands shall be acquired by reason of said application until said lands have been designated as stock-raising lands. SEC. 3. That any qualified homestead entryman may make entry under the homestead laws of lands so designated by the Secretary of the Interior, according to legal subdivisions, in areas not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, and in compact form so far as may be subject to the provisions of this Act, and secure title thereto by compliance with the terms of the homestead laws: Provided, That a former homestead entry of land of the character described in section two hereof shall not be a bar to the entry of a tract within a radius of twenty miles from such former entry under the provisions of this Act, subject to the requirements of law as to residence and improvements, which, together with the former entry, shall not exceed six hundred and forty acres: Provided further, That the entryman shall be required to enter all contiguous areas of the character herein described open to entry prior to the entry of any noncontiguous land: Provided further, That instead of cultivation as required by the homestead laws the entryman shall be required to make permanent improvements upon the land entered before final proof is submitted tending to increase the value of the same for stock-raising purposes, of the value of not less than $1.25 per acre, and at least one-half of such improvements shall be placed upon the land within three years after the date of entry thereof.

Repeal of Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 Sections 291, 300, and 302 were repealed by the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Amendment to Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 Section 299 was amended by the enactment of Public Law 103-23 pertaining to the reservation of coal and mineral rights on April 16, 1993.

He was the second son of Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet of Parham also in West Sussex.'Henfield: Manors and other estates', A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3: Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town (1987), pp. 140-145. Henry at first fought for King Charles I, but was reconciled with parliament in 1647, after spending two years in Virginia. In the meantime his Rectory estate in Henfield had been sequestered. However, he was restored to royal favour in 1660 and served as postmaster-general between that date and 1663. At his death in 1692 (N.S.) his Rectory estate in Henfield passed to his great-nephew Sir Cecil Bishopp, 4th Baronet. Postmaster General Before the creation of the position of Postmaster General, control of the post was in the hands of \\"Master of the King's Post\\". In 1660, at The Restoration, Henry Bishop paid ¬£21,500 per year to farm the Post Office for a term of seven years. This was more than double the previous payment. Bishop's letters patent gave him the monopoly to carry letters within the kingdom. His appointment was to start on 25 June 1660, but was delayed until 29 September when the Act of Parliament reconstituted the General Post Office. Bishop claimed no less than ¬£500 in compensation for the loss of income because several independent posts had been started between London and the country but were not suppressed until the act was passed; they infringed on his monopoly to carry letters. Bishop was the first officially appointed Postmaster General to Charles II but within a year of taking office he was accused of abuses. In reply, he mentions the improvements he instigated including the stamping of letters, on 2 August 1661. He served in the position until April 1663 at which time he gave up the remainder of his lease to Daniel O'Neill. Bishop mark Bishop Mark Henry Bishop introduced the world's first known postmark in London in 1661. The \\"Bishop Mark\\" was designed to show the date on which a letter was received by the post and to ensure that the dispatch of letters would not be delayed. These were the world's first handstruck postage stampsThe story of the Bishop Marks is traced in Robson Lowe, Handstruck Stamps of the Empire, (1939), Appendix 2. Bishop announced, The postmarks were usually on the back of the letter and are known initially used in the Chief Office in London but were introduced later in Dublin, Edinburgh and New York City.

Cf. Robson Lowe, The Encyclopaedia of British Empire Postage Stamps, 1639-1952, vol. V, pp. 23, 29, 57-8 (1973) In 1673, a new mark was brought into use which had a diameter of between 13 and 14 mm. The type used from this point was sans-serif and this continued in use until 1713. In 1713, larger handstamps were introduced which ranged in size from 14 to 20 mm. The layout of these was also changed, with the month appearing at the base. This type remained in use until 1787, when it was replaced by the double circle type.

The most commonly used version of super QCD is in 4 dimensions and contains one Majorana spinor supercharge. The particle content consists of vector supermultiplets, which include gluons and gluinos and also chiral supermultiplets which contain quarks and squarks transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This theory has many features in common with real world QCD, for example in some phases it manifests confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The supersymmetry of this theory means that, unlike QCD, one may use nonrenormalization theorems to analytically demonstrate the existence of these phenomena and even calculate the condensate which breaks the chiral symmetry. Phases of super QCD Consider 4-dimensional SQCD with gauge group SU(N) and M flavors of chiral multiplets. The vacuum structure depends on M and N. The (spin-zero) squarks may be reorganized into hadrons, and the moduli space of vacua of the theory may be parametrized by their vacuum expectation values. On most of the moduli space the Higgs mechanism makes all of the fields massive, and so they may be integrated out. Classically, the resulting moduli space is singular. The singularities correspond to points where some gluons are massless, and so could not be integrated out. In the full quantum moduli space is nonsingular, and its structure depends on the relative values of M and N. For example, when M is less than or equal to N+1, the theory exhibits confinement. When M is less than N, the effective action differs from the classical action. More precisely, while the perturbative nonrenormalization theory forbids any perturbative correction to the superpotential, the superpotential receives nonperturbative corrections. When N=M+1, these corrections result from a single instanton. For larger values of N the instanton calculation suffers from infrared divergences, however the correction may nonetheless be determined precisely from the gaugino condensation. The quantum correction to the superpotential was calculated in The Massless Limit Of Supersymmetric Qcd. If the chiral multiplets are massless, the resulting potential energy has no minimum and so the full quantum theory has no vacuum. Instead the fields roll forever to larger values. When M is equal to or greater than N, the classical superpotential is exact. When M is equal to N, however, the moduli space receives quantum corrections from a single instanton. This correction renders the moduli space nonsingular, and also leads to chiral symmetry breaking. Then M is equal to N+1 the moduli space is not modified and so there is no chiral symmetry breaking, however there is still confinement. When M is greater than N+1 but less than 3N/2, the theory is asymptotically free. However at low energies the theory becomes strongly coupled, and is better described by a Seiberg dual description in terms of magnetic variables with the same global flavor symmetry group but a new gauge symmetry SU(M-N). Notice that the gauge group is not an observable, but simply reflects the redundancy or a description and so may well differ in various dual theories, as it does in this case. On the other hand, the global symmetry group is an observable so it is essential that it is the same, SU(M), in both descriptions. The dual magnetic theory is free in the infrared, the coupling constant shrinks logarithmically, and so by the Dirac quantization condition the electric coupling constant grows logarithmically in the infrared. This implies that the potential between two electric charges, at long distances, scales as the logarithm of their distance divided by the distance. When M is between 3N/2 and 3N, in the theory has an infrared fixed point where it becomes a nontrivial conformal field theory. The potential between electric charges obeys the usual Colomb law, it is inversely proportional to the distance between the charges. When M is greater than 3N, the theory is free in the infrared, and so the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the product of the distance times the logarithm of the distance between the charges. However the theory is ill-defined in the ultraviolet, unless one includes additional heavy degrees of freedom which lead, for example, to a Seiberg dual theory of the type described above at N+1<M<3N/2.

He is remembered in devotions by the people of Craco in the province of Matera, the Basilicata Region, Italy along with immigrants and their descendants from that town who settled in North America. San Vincenzo Martire di Craco's feast day is celebrated on the fourth Sunday of October in Craco, Italy and Manhattan, New York. History San Vincenzo is said to have been one of the Theban Legion, a legion of soldiers who converted en masse to Christianity and who were martyred for refusal to participate in sacrifices to the Roman emperor prior to battle in the year 286 AD.National, 9550, reproduced in Louis Dupraz, Les passions de st Maurice d'Agaune: Essai sur l'historicit√© de la tradition et contribution √† l'√©tude de l'arm√©e pr√©-Diocl√©tienne (260-286) et des canonisations tardives de la fin du IVe si√®cle (Fribourg 1961), Appendix I. Dupraz writes to confirm the historicity of the Theban Legion. Devotion  The village of Craco, in the modern province of Matera, is the site of a former friary of the Franciscans. The building of the friary began on April 3, 1620 by a Roberto, then Bishop of Tricarico, and was finally completed in 1630. The Friary bore the name of St. Peter, and was entrusted to the care of the Franciscan Friars who retained it until the Italian Government suppressed it in 1866. Next to this friary was a church to the left of which, in 1777, a rather large chapel was built. This chapel was dedicated to San Vincenzo Martire in the year 1793. San Vincenzo Reliquary 1769 On February 6, 1769, a small bone relic of San Vincenzo was sent to Craco from Rome. Then in 1792, Fr. Prospero, a Franciscan from Craco, finding himself in Rome, and wishing to return home with a relic of some glorious martyr, obtained from Pope Pius VI, through the Sacred Congregation of Rites, a relic which was said to be that of a Roman soldier as well as a glorious martyr, by the name of Vincenzo ‚Äì a name signifying \\"winner\\" or \\"conqueror.\\" The \\"sacred body with a flask of blood\\" of San Vincenzo Martire was exhumed at the cemetery of St. Ciriaca, in Rome. Fr. Prospero enclosed the precious relic in an artistic crystal-sided casket. Inside the casket was set the waxen body of the martyr, dressed as a Roman soldier and lying in a reclining position. Stopping at various places during the course of its journey from Rome, the remains were carried all the way to Craco where it was received with great pomp and honor by the local clergy and townspeople. The great devotion of the faithful in the region and neighboring towns rendered great honor to the soldier martyr San Vincenzo. In large measure, this was due to the many miracles reportedly performed by the Saint for the suffering multitudes that sought his help. The holy relic of San Vincenzo arrived in Craco on June 4, 1792. The clergy and the people of Craco decided to choose San Vincenzo, along with San Nicola of Bari, as their patron and protector of the town. The religious and civil festival of San Vincenzo was fixed for the fourth Sunday of October to coincide with the important annual fair which takes place after the harvest. On April 4, 1793 the relic of San Vincenzo was installed in the chapel at the Friary and remained there until the late 1980s when structural instability required the relic to be relocated to a small chapel in the Sant'Angelo section of Craco where it resides today. Although the Friary dedicated to St. Peter served as his home, the overwhelming majority of the population of Craco still calls it \\"the Convent of San Vincenzo.\\"  Feast of San Vincenzo Traditionally, the feast in Craco celebrating San Vincenzo began nine days before the fourth Sunday in October with the recitation of solemn afternoon novenas. On one of those evenings, a small procession took place, with a statue representing the upright figure of the relic, starting from the Chapel and moving around the \\"Cross\\", then located at the entrance to the town. On Friday evening, after the novena, the statue of the saint was brought into the Chiesa Madre [Church of San Nicola] located in the heart of the old town. On Saturday evening, before the feast day, the statue was carried in procession back to the chapel that served as its home. All celebrations culminated on Sunday with the Mass at the Friary and the procession that crossed the entire town. That evening, in front of the Palazzo Rigirone, there were bright fireworks displays. San Vincenzo processional statue in Craco.  Fair The feast in honor of San Vincenzo was always preceded on the Saturday before by a fair, a proud tradition carried out since the end of the 18th century until today. The fair, traditionally known by all the nearby people and neighboring towns, brought many people from Salandra, Fernandina, Montalbano and Pisticci. The fair branched from the entrance of Craco to the other end of the town, at the drinking trough. It was held at the time of the year when workers of the earth were engaged in preparing land for planting or harvesting olives. But on that day, all work ceased so the people could make major purchases at the fair. Animals of all types, as well as foodstuffs: dried beans, \\"winter\\" apples, and dried peppers that would be used to season salami were available. This served as a way for people to purchase provisions for the long winter that awaited the rural population. Confraternity of San Vincenzo Martire Until the early decades of the 20th century a confraternity of devout worshippers of San Vincenzo existed in Craco. Those belonging to the confraternity were characterized by wearing a white tunic with a turquoise cape and belt. This group took part in the Mass, processions, and upon request also at funerals. San Vincenzo Martire in New York With immigration to northern America at the turn of the 20th century, the Crachesi brought the devotion to their patron saint with them. In 1899 they formed a mutual aid society, the Societ√† San Vincenzo Martire di Craco, in New York City. One of the founding members of the Societ√†, Pasquale Marrese had a tailor shop in Manhattan and employed several fellow townspeople along with family members. They fashioned a copy of the San Vincenzo relic using a woodcut print image that had been carried from Craco of the saint. S. Vincenzo Woodcut Meanwhile, another member of the Societ√† was dispatched to Craco to obtain a copy of the novena so it could be used in America for the feast day celebration. That individual also returned with the bone reliquary from 1769 that had been kept in Craco. In 1901 this group associated itself with St. Joachim's Church, providing the church with a statue that is a copy of the reclining relic of San Vincenzo in Craco, the 1769 bone relic from Craco, and a handwritten copy of the original novena as said in Craco. The first celebration of the feast of San Vincenzo Martire in New York City's Little Italy was held on Saturday and Sunday October 24‚Äì25, 1901. The Societa San Vincenzo Martire di Craco continued to maintain the traditional celebration of the feast on the fourth Sunday of October and was always preceded by a large banquet the evening before. The last celebration sponsored by the Societ√† was in October 1941. With the onset of World War II, the celebration of the feast was suspended although the religious celebration of a special Mass continued. In 1952, the Societ√† San Vincenzo Martire di Craco was dissolved. Individual devotees, all descendants of the Crachesi immigrants, continued sponsoring the religious celebration of a special Mass for San Vincenzo Martire at St. Joachim's Church. In 1957, an urban renewal project, ordered by the City of New York, dictated the closing of the church in 1958, and required the relocation of the statues before the church was demolished. The statue, which is a copy of the reclining relic of San Vincenzo in Craco, and the bone relic from 1769 were relocated to the Church of St. Joseph, 5 Monroe Street, Manhattan where arrangements were made for the religious celebration of a special Mass annually. The upright processional statue was placed at St. Rosalia ‚Äì Regina Pacis Parish in Brooklyn, but was lost to the effects of time. St. Joseph's Church maintained the annual feast day celebration holding a special Mass on the fourth Sunday in October through 2014. In 2016 the Archdiocese of New York reorganized the parish structure closing St. Joseph's Church on July 31. The reclining statue of San Vincenzo in St. Joseph's Church, New York City. The historic statue of San Vincenzo and relic were relocated to the Shrine Church of the Most Precious Blood, also in Manhattan. It resides there along with several historic Italian American statues of patron saints and the annual feast day continues to be celebrated there.

Rather than needing to tighten one large bolt, MJTs use several smaller jackbolts to significantly reduce the torque required to attain a certain preload. MJTs range in thread sizes from to and can achieve or more. MJTs only require hand-held tools, such as torque wrenches or air/electric impacts, for loading and unloading bolted joints.Steinbock, Rolf. \\"The Multi- Jackbolt Tensioning System.\\" Handbook of Bolts and Bolted Joints. Ed. John H. Bickford and Sayed Nassar. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1998. 507-533. Basics of multi-jackbolt tensioners Multi-jackbolt tensioners (MJTs), registered under the trademark Superbolt or Supernut, are designed to decrease the torque required to tighten large bolted joints. One of the major problems associated with traditional bolt tightening methods is as the diameter of the bolt increases, the amount of torque required to tighten it increases in the third power of the diameter. Because of this, the largest size bolt a person can typically tighten by hand is .Steinbock, Rolf. \\"Mechanical Tensioners Tame High-temperature Joint Failures.\\" Power Engineering. August 1997, p. 46-50. Multi-jackbolt tensioners reduce the amount of torque required to clamp the joint by using multiple jackbolts threaded through the nut or bolt head.Kane, Joe. \\"Revisiting Superbolt's Super Torquenut: Since Our Last Visit, Many More Compressor Related Applications of the Torquenut Have Been Uncovered.\\" Compressor Tech Two. September, 2004. The jackbolts, which are small enough to be tightened by simple hand tools, thrust against a hardened washer and generate clamping force on the joint. Loads up to and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA. Types of tensioners *Nut type **Nut type MJTs, otherwise known as Torquenuts, can be retrofitted onto existing bolts or studs.Kane, Joe. \\"Superbolt - A Sure and Safe Bolting System.\\" Compressor Tech Two. May/June 1997. p. 50-52. Because of this, they are the most common type of MJT. *Bolt type **Bolt type MJTs, otherwise known as Torquebolts, have a ring of jackbolts almost touching the bolt shank. They typically have a smaller outside diameter than Torquenuts. With Torquebolts, it is possible to have very close spacing even at high preloads. *Thrust-collar type **Thrust- collar type MJTs are used in applications where it is difficult to use threaded tensioners, such as on rolling mills where the joint would typically need to be tightened by crane wrenching. Jackbolts push a threadless nut against a retainer ring, which is fitted into a groove and transfers the jacking force to the main bolt or stud. Because there are no threads, they can also be used in press column applications, eliminating the problems and hassles associated with large nut threads. Mechanical advantage MJTs have a high mechanical advantage for tightening large nuts. To calculate mechanical advantage over standard hex nuts, the following formula is used: :MA = \\\\frac {T}{T_j}= \\\\frac {nDA}{d} Where: :{ border=\\"0\\" - MA = overall mechanical advantage - T = main thread torque - Tj = jackbolt torque - n = number of jackbolts - D = main thread pitch diameter - d = jackbolt pitch diameter - A = torque advantage of jackbolts over tension bolts (with graphite lube A = 1.37) } Safety MJTs are a relatively safe bolting method because only small hand or air tools are required for tightening. Other methods, including thermal tightening, crane wrenching, hydraulic wrenches and sledgehammers, can cause serious worker injuries due to heat, electricity, highly pressurized hydraulic fluid and brute force. Back and other injuries can also be avoided because no heavy tightening equipment needs to be lifted onto the bolt. Safety is also increased because MJTs prevent parts from becoming loose. Downtime Due to dynamic loads, bolted joints have a tendency to loosen. Downtime is significantly reduced because MJTs are able to easily achieve the large clamping forces required to prevent bolted components from vibrating loose. Therefore, less time is spent tightening joints repeatedly and fixing problems caused by loose joints. MJTs also reduce the likelihood the bolted joint will fail, which reduces downtime caused by needing to replace damaged components. Installation time Even though more individual jackbolts must be tightened, installation is still fast in comparison to other methods. Because the torque required to tighten each small jackbolt is exponentially less than the torque required to tighten one large nut, it takes less time and effort overall to tighten the larger number of jackbolts. Also, no additional time is spent moving around heavy equipment to tighten each nut. Installation processes have been developed using air tools, which also greatly reduces installation time. Additionally, multiple workers can work on a joint simultaneously since the tooling required is inexpensive. Another common method, thermal tightening, can take a long time because the stud must be heated, and clamping force is not obtained and cannot be checked until it is cooled since it depends on shrinkage. If the stud is not at proper stretch, the heating process must be repeated. Versatility MJTs are very versatile tools. They can be used in tight spaces because no bulky equipment is required to tighten the bolts. MJTs can also be engineered to specifications for almost any application. There are few size limitations, and they can be used with extremely large thread sizes (as high as thread diameter). They can also be used effectively in high temperature applications, given proper materials are used. Overall, the unique properties of MJTs created by the use of jackbolts can simplify complicated applications, especially for large thread sizes. Joint integrity Thread galling and seizing is significantly reduced because mating bolts or studs are loaded in pure tension without twisting. In many applications, elasticity in a bolt significantly helps to keep a joint held together. Tests have shown turbine- type MJTs increase the elasticity of the average bolting system by the equivalent of four stud diameters, and nut-type MJTs increase the elasticity by 4 to 12 diameter equivalents, which would triple or quadruple the elasticity of the bolting system. In other words, MJTs increase elasticity by adding up to 2 to 4 equivalent bolt effective lengths. This is particularly advantageous in high-temperature bolting applications where bolts are subject to creep, because elastic bolting systems will take longer to reach a given relaxation stress than in a rigid system. Elastic bolting systems can also improve the integrity of gasketed joints by compensating for temperature changes, joint movement and changes in internal pressure.Kane, Joe. \\"Multi- Jackbolt Tensioners Designed for Superior Tightening.\\" Diesel & Gas Turbine Worldwide. November 1997. p. 49-50. Stress relief‚ÄîMost bolts fail at the bottom of the nut in the first two or three threads. Hoop stresses on the nut in MJTs cause an increase in diameter at the bottom and decrease at the top, distributing thread stress more evenly and reducing the likelihood the stud or bolt will fail. Disadvantages MJTs may not be cost effective for bolts smaller than diameter, low-stress applications, and in plants where the number of studs/bolts to retrofit is difficult to justify versus prior investment in existing tightening equipment. Common applications Presses Multi- jackbolt tensioners can be used on many press column applications, especially where large thread sizes are required. Thrust collars ease assembly and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, die cushions, cylinder ram bolting, and anchor bolts. Mining Mining applications often require high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, which can cause joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts ‚Äì MJTs can be useful in these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint. Hydro power Multi-jackbolt tensioners are used in several hydro applications, including turbine couplings, blade bolts, turbine wheel to shaft bolting, pelton turbine nozzles, servo piston nuts, bearing housings, and ball valves. Multi-jackbolt expansion bolts provide additional benefit for shaft couplings, because they generate both radial and axial forces, creating the interference fit necessary. MJTs can also easily achieve the high preloads required on Kaplan turbine crossheads and servo piston rods. Steam power In steam power plants, MJTs are used on boiler feed pump head and barrel casings, boiler circ pump main flanges, stop valves, control valves, turbine couplings, stay rods, manway doors, inlet flanges, and feedwater heaters. MJTs can save a lot of time during scheduled downtime or maintenance because they require less time to install and remove than other bolting methods. Steel MIll Multi-jackbolt tensioners have a number of uses in the Steel industry. Thrust collars can be used on rolling mills, which makes changing the rolls much easier than other methods, and frees up crane time because only hand tools are required. Other MJTs are used on mill motors, bearings, shaft mounts, anchor bolts, and slitter knives. Petrochemical In the petrochemical industry, multi-jackbolt tensioners have been used on reactor vessels, heat exchanger heads, turbine control valves, turbine joints, pipe flanges, anchor bolts, couplings, compressors, and pumps. Gas compression Special multi-jackbolt piston end nuts and crosshead jamnuts are used to ease the installation of piston rods, especially considering space limitations. Other applications include anchor bolts, flexible disk couplings, dehydration towers, compressor cylinders, compressor doghouse bolting, end plates, and gas compression engines.

Botanical Research Institute of Texas, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.A.) that is commonly misapplied to this species.  Etymology  Tejocote, the Mexican name for this fruit, comes from the Nahuatl word texocotl which means \\"stone fruit\\". The alternative (and ambiguous) name manzanita means \\"little apple\\" in Spanish. The generic name, Crataegus, is derived from a Latinized Greek compound word literally meaning \\"strong sharp,\\" in reference to the thorny habitus of several species.  Description  The plant is a large shrub or small tree growing to 5‚Äì10 m tall, with a dense crown. The leaves are semi- evergreen, oval to diamond-shaped, 4‚Äì8 cm long, with a serrated margin. The flowers are off-white, 2 cm diameter. The fruit is a globose to oblong orange- red pome 2 cm long and 1.5 cm diameter, ripening in late winter only shortly before the flowers of the following year. Mexican hawthorn tree laden with fruit  Uses  The fruit is eaten in Mexico cooked, raw, or canned. It resembles a crabapple, but it has three or sometimes more brown hard stones in the center. It is a main ingredient used in ponche, the traditional Mexican hot fruit punch that is served at Christmas time and on New Year's Eve. On Day of the Dead tejocote fruit as well as candy prepared from them are used as offerings to the dead, and rosaries made of the fruit are part of altar decorations. A mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called rielitos, because it resembles a tiny train rail. Due to its high pectin content, the fruit is industrially processed to extract pectin for the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, textile and metal industries. Other uses include food for livestock (for which the leaves and fruits are used) and traditional medicinal uses; a Mexican hawthorn root infusion is used as a diuretic and as a remedy for diarrhea, and fruit-based preparations are a remedy for coughing and several heart conditions. The Mexican hawthorn tree's wood is hard and compact, it is useful for making tool handles as well as for firewood.Conabio (Mexico) species profile  Importing  It is legal to import Tejocote into the U.S. from Mexico as of 2015.  Botanical nomenclature  The name C. pubescens Steud., published in 1840, is a better- known name for this species, but is illegitimate under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. It is a later homonym of C. pubescens C.Presl which was published in 1826 as the name of a species from Sicily.

As a reserve force unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. Formation The Regiment de la Rey was established in 1934 as one of the new Afrikaans language Citizen Force units of the Union Defence Force. The regimental badge depicts a lion's head, in memory of Boer General JH de la Rey, the Lion of the West after whom the regiment is named. Before the Second World War, battalion headquarters were at Rustenburg in the Transvaal. The unit had company headquarters at Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp and Ventersdorp, with a support company at Brits. Mrs J E Morkel, daughter of General De la Rey, became the first honorary colonel of the regiment. The regiment was affiliated to the Northamptonshire Regiment of the British Army. World War II RDLR was called up for full-time service on 18 July 1940. Because the commanding officer, Lt-Col (later Brig) H P van Noorden, was by then commanding a battalion of the Field Force Brigade, command of the regiment passed to Lt-Col WD Basson. Badge worn by Wits-delaRey battalion after amalgamation. The regiment was amalgamated with the Witwatersrand Rifles Regiment. After training in Egypt, the new unit, Wits-delaRey (WR/DLR) made a name for itself as one of the motorised infantry battalions of the 12th Motorised Brigade in the 6th South African Armoured Division in Italy in 1944‚Äì45. For almost the entire Italian campaign RDLR was commanded by Lt-Col Jack Bester, until he was appointed to command the newly formed 13th Motorised Brigade. The regiment distinguished itself particularly in taking Allerona on 15 June 1944, in fighting on Monte Querciabella and Monte Fili, and in forcing the River Greve in July 1944. WR/DLR were the first on Monte Stanco in the Apennines in October 1944 and scored a spectacular success in the final offensive in Italy when they took Monte Caprara on 16 April 1945. The unit's casualties were among the heaviest in the division. During the Italian campaign 119 soldiers were killed, 576 wounded and 17 were posted missing in action. On 1 January 1960 the regiment was renamed Regiment Wes-Transvaal with headquarters at Potchefstroom. After objections and strenuous efforts it resumed its original designation as Regiment De la Rey on 1 September 1966.  Captain 'Doempie' Cloete Capt MDV Cloete , Chaplain to RDLR, 1945. Captain MDV Cloete, nicknamed Doempie, was a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church who served as regimental chaplain from February 1943 until the end of the war. He was a talented rugby player with a most devastating tackle, an enthusiastic hockey player and, on route marches, would outperform many of the tough infantrymen. In June 1944, the chaplain captured two German soldiers who had been deliberately left behind near the village of Allerona to harass officers of the Allied High Command. Upon discovering their hidden position behind some bushes to the side of a road, Doempie pushed the bush aside and shouted to the two men in Afrikaans: Kom uit k√™rels ‚Äì die oorlog is op 'n einde ('Come out, guys ‚Äì the war is over'). They heeded his instructions and surrendered. The only ‚Äòweapon' the chaplain had with him was his short officer's cane. After World War II, he remained in the Union Defence Force and served as chaplain in various units. From November 1950 to December 1953, he accompanied 2 Squadron SAAF, 'The Flying Cheetahs', to Korea which was South Africa's contribution to the United Nations war effort. In 1960, the Minister of Justice and the Commissioner of Police determined that there was a need for a well-organised Chaplain Corps in the South African Police (SAP). Cloete was appointed Chaplain-General with the rank of colonel to establish the Corps. He retired from the South African Police in February 1975 with the rank of major- general. On his retirement, he was the most highly decorated member of the SAP. In addition to the 'usual' 1939‚Äì1945 campaign medals, he had also been awarded the Military Cross, the Korean Order of Military Merit, 'Ulchi', the American Bronze Star and numerous SAP medals and decorations. The Border War The regiment participated in the South African Border War, also known as the Namibian War of Independence, the conflict that took place from 1966 to 1989 in South-West Africa (now Namibia) and Angola between South Africa and its allied forces (mainly UNITA) and the Angolan government, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO), and their allies the Soviet Union and Cuba. Operation Packer Ratel 90 with Ratel 20 on the right, busy with an exercise in Lohatla in 2003 Operation Hooper, in which the main participants were Permanent Force and National Service members, officially ended on 13 March 1988. A Citizen Force call up provided fresh troops into the SADF-UNITA force which had been tasked to drive People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) forces from Cuito Cuanavale. This injection of fresh troops allowed Operation Hooper to move seamlessly into Operation Packer. The objective of the operation was to drive the combined FAPLA/Cuban force back across the Cuito River to the west bank. 82 Mechanised Brigade Operational Badge field and office versions of which this Regiment was part of The primary assault force which was to 'drive the enemy' out of Tumpo consisted of 13 Olifant tanks with crews from Regiment President Steyn, a squadron of Ratel 90's from Regiment Mooirivier (RMR), a mechanised infantry battalion from Regiment de la Rey and from Regiment Groot Karoo, three companies from 32 Battalion, three UNITA regular battalions and two semi-regular UNITA battalions plus a number of other components. Post-1994 The regiment is one of only six mechanised units in the SANDF Reserve Force. 1 RDLR took part in the 50th anniversary parade of Regiment Mooirivier in Potchefstroom on 23 July 2004.

But his father, a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, died in the Vietnam War when Park was three, and he has never met his father's family. Though he is nearly twelve, his mother still avoids answering any questions about his father. Finally, to satisfy his curiosity, Park goes and gets on a bus for the short ride from his home to the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC. There he finds his father's name. There he also resolves to get some of his questions solved. After Randy, Park's mom, writes to Park's dad's side of the family, Randy sends him on a bus for a two- week vacation in south-western Virginia where his grandfather and Uncle Frank maintain the farm on which his father grew up. His grandfather has had 2 strokes and is now inarticulate, able to communicate in only the most rudimentary ways. His uncle has a Vietnamese wife, and shares his home with a Vietnamese girl about Park's age whose origin and status is not clear to Park until he discovers, after a number of uncomfortable encounters, that she is his half-sister, and that because of his father's infidelity, his mother divorced him before his second, and fatal, term in Vietnam.

It was founded in 1969 by a group of parents interested in creating a progressive school in the then-struggling Central West End area of St. Louis. It is housed in a renovated turn-of-the-century school building.  About/History  New City School was founded in 1969 to help stabilize the then-struggling neighborhoods of the city's Central West End. A group of neighbors‚Äîmany of whom had small children‚Äîbegan meeting to discuss the possibility of opening a school.  1960s  * The genesis of New City School was sparked when two venerable schools in the Central West End‚ÄîBarat Hall and City House‚Äîclosed in 1966, deflating real estate values and leaving the neighborhood without first-rate schools. * In 1969, New City opened under the leadership of head of school Jerry Glynn, six teachers and nearly 100 children from three-year-olds to fourth graders, and began class in the First Unitarian Church located at Waterman Blvd. and Kingshighway Blvd.  1970s  * New City moved to the old Mary Institute building at Waterman Blvd. and Lake Ave. Built in 1901 at the then-edge of the city, the building was the home of Mary Institute until 1937. It then became Lutheran High School until being abandoned in the early 1960s. * Head of School, Charlie Rathbone, took over after the school's first two years, and remained for one year. Board members played leadership roles during the transition between Heads of School. Len Marks became head in 1974. * Full accreditation was received from the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS).  1980s  * University City elementary school Principal Tom Hoerr became Head of School in 1981. * In 1983, New City was named an A+ School by Instructor Magazine. * In 1989, $93,901 in need-based scholarships was distributed to 18.9% of the students. * From 1987‚Äì1988, a $1,000,000 capital campaign is launched to renovate the building so that all three floors can hold classroom spaces. * The faculty begins to pursue implementing multiple intelligences (MI) in 1988.  1990s  * In 1992, a $1,200,000 capital campaign enabled the school to acquire land to the west to create a new playground and soccer field, and land to the south to create a parking lot and playing field. * The Financial Aid Endowment Fund was created in 1993 ($3,422,000 as of July 2013). * Four multiple intelligence conferences were held at New City, and the faculty wrote two books, Celebrating Multiple Intelligences: Teaching for Success and Succeeding with Multiple Intelligences: Teaching through the Personal Intelligences. * In 1998 the theater was renovated and renamed Founders Hall. * In 1999, $351,597 in need-based scholarships was distributed to 26.7% of the students. 2000s: * The New City Centennial Garden was opened on the playground in 2001. * In 2005, Howard Gardner, creator of multiple intelligences theory, joined us to open the world's first Multiple Intelligences Library. * In 2009, $749,873 in need-based scholarships was distributed to 34.9% of the students. * In 2009, a green roof was created on top of the dining hall. * In 2010, Jossey-Bass publishes the faculty's book, Celebrating Every Learner. * In 2011, the Betsy Blankenship Plaza on Waterman Blvd. is created. * In 2015, Tom Hoerr retired. * In 2016, Alexis Wright became the new principal of the school  Diversity efforts at New City School  New City School was founded on the belief that students of various socio-economic and racial backgrounds should have the opportunity to come together to learn and play. This remains a core value of the school. The New City student body is composed of 37% students of color, come from 48 different zip codes, and 40% of students receive need- based scholarships.  Multiple intelligences  Since 1988, the theory of multiple intelligences (MI), conceived by Harvard University Professor Howard Gardner, has been used as a tool for teaching and learning at New City School. This unique academic learning approach capitalizes on students‚Äô strengths and creates a deep level of understanding that allows children to use what they've learned in new and different situations. Teaching and learning go beyond the traditional approaches; too often schools only consider the linguistic and mathematical subjects when talking about how intelligence is measured. The theory of multiple intelligences (MI) advocates that there are eight intelligences that need to be nurtured and developed in children: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalist, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. These all reflect different ways of interacting with the world of thinking, solving problems, and learning. Proponents of multiple intelligences believe everyone has all of the intelligences; it is just that each person has his/her own unique multiple intelligences profile. Multiple intelligences is a tool which allows New City teachers to expose students to new concepts and skills in multiple ways, and also allows students to demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways. While the school ensures its students are capable learners who often exceed the grade level expectations on standardized measures, New City strives to challenge its students to go above and beyond those measures. Multiple intelligences serves as a vehicle by which this is accomplished. Some examples of how multiple intelligence theory is being used in the classroom setting at New City School are: * groups working together to solve a complex problem * students acting out a historical event * students sharing a book or story by using one or more of their intelligences * students giving and/or receiving thoughtful and constructive feedback * students using different percussion instruments to represent each component of the digestive system * students building models of a new insect species * students creating bar graphs to illustrate the many similarities and differences in skin color * students making Venn diagrams comparing themselves to a story character * students planting Native American crops in the garden  Green efforts at New City School  Since the 1990s, New City has made a conscious effort to \\"go green.\\" These efforts began with a student recycling program, and have progressed to the installation of a green roof on the cafeteria roof in 2009, and most recently, the installation of solar panels in 2013. Throughout this period, students and teachers have worked to be more environmentally aware. Students recycle food products, school supplies, paper, cardboard, plastic, and cans, and the school has instituted a policy of using sustainable materials whenever possible. New City's Green Committee and popular River Kids program lead the school's efforts towards sustainability. Green efforts at New City include but are not limited to the following endeavors: * Rain barrels in the garden area and on the green roof * Lights changed from T12 to T8 * Programmable thermostats throughout the building * Auto-flush urinals and toilets throughout the building * Auto on/off faucets * Hand dryers * Paper & plastic recycle bins for community and parent use * Low-E argon gas insulated glass windows * Green cleaning products used * Washable coffee mugs * Motion sensors installed in select locations to turn off lights when a room is not in use * Vending machine control to turn off machine when not in use * E-mail signatures to encourage readers not to print e-mail  Faculty and staff   Head of School  Thomas R. Hoerr, PhD, has been the Head of School at New City since 1981. Prior to coming to New City, Tom was the principal of Pershing Elementary School in the School District of University City. Tom founded and directed the Washington University Non-Profit Management Program, co-facilitated the ASCD Scholars Program. He facilitates the ASCD Multiple Intelligences Professional Interest Community and leads the ISACS New Heads Network. Following the words of playwright Edward Albee, who said, ‚ÄúI write to find out what I am thinking,‚Äù Tom has written more than 100 articles and four books: Becoming A Multiple Intelligences School, The Art of School Leadership, School Leadership for the Future, and Fostering Grit. He writes a monthly column, ‚ÄúThe Principal Connection,‚Äù for Educational Leadership, one of the country's premier educational publications. Tom will retire as of July 1, 2015. Faculty New City School has 40 full-time and five part-time faculty members, including classroom teachers and specialists in science, library, Spanish, art, movement and music, performing arts, physical education and technology, in addition to a learning specialist and school counselor. New City School teachers have an average of 13 years teaching experience with an average of 11 years spent teaching at New City School. 50% of teachers have advanced teaching degrees. New City maintains a 9:1 student teacher ratio in its classrooms. Performance based pay plan New City School is one of very few schools in the country to use a performance-based pay plan for teachers. Teachers are evaluated in five key areas: * Knowledge of subject matter. * Knowledge of child development and the learning process. * Rapport and enthusiasm with students. * Presentation skills. * Professionalism and collegiality. Tuition and Scholarship Aid New City's primary tool for attaining economic diversity is through need-based scholarships, awarded to 39% of its families for the 2012-2013 academic year. These scholarships help off-set the cost of tuition based on a family's individual income levels.

It concerns a native farmer besieged by a tree-bound leopard that has apparently broken his fences, torn his medicine bags and stifled his wives' sensuality. Featured in such poesy anthologies as An Introduction to East African Poetry, The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry and Over This Soil, it has been subjected to a wide range of interpretations, most of them erotic. The poem begins with the line that also constitutes its title, adding that the leopard's gaze is fixed on the home of the speaker, whose lambs(read children) are born with speckles and whose wives \\"tie their skirts tight / And turn away\\" (4-5), fearing that (presumably through the leopard's voracious attentions) they might spawn similarly stippled offspring. Nonetheless, while bathing late at night, \\"when the moon is high\\" (7), they make an exhibition of themselves, splashing the \\"cold mountain stream water on their nipples\\" (9), removing their skirts and imprecating loudly. Realizing that he is besieged and resolving to fell the Muu tree, the speaker walks about \\"stiff / Stroking my loins.\\" (14-15) From its residence outside his homestead, the leopard is seen eyeing the women. The speaker recalls addressing it as \\"elder\\" (18) and \\"one-from-the-same-womb\\" (18), but it holds its head high and merely peers at him \\"with slit eyes\\" (19). The speaker's sword has corroded in its sheath, and his wives, whenever the owls emit their mating call, do nothing but purse their lips. Again the speaker deplores his besieging. Although the wives \\"fetch cold mountain water\\" (25) and \\"crush the sugar cane\\" (26), they decline to touch their husband's \\"beer horn\\" (27). With his fences broken, his medicine bags torn and the post at his gate fallen, the speaker's pubic hair is singed (burnt, charred). Presently, the leopard arches over the homestead, and the wives become frisky. The final two lines detail the former's lamb feast, which resuscitates it. The speaker uses the imagery of a leopard to mean stealthy and dangerous, he goes further to suggest that they are of the same womb, from which we can infer that he speaks of a brother; older, and with more status than he. The persona's lambs are born with speckles, suggesting that the lecherous elder brother has already spawned children with the persona's wives; and, the persona has not had conjugal relations with them, as his elder visits upon his home frequently. This is suggested by the lines: \\"The upright post at the gate has fallen / My women are frisky / The leopard arches over my homestead\\".  Bibliography  *Moore, Gerald, and Ulli Beier.

Constantine's earlier novels followed the exploits of police chief Mario Balzic and detective Rugs Carlucci of the Rocksburg police department; this one departs from the pattern by shadowing three beat cops: William Rayford, Robert Canoza, and James Reseta.

For nearly two decades, the cop was Mario Balzic, a rumpled, shrewd, and decent chief of police. But Constantine retired Mario a few books ago and replaced him with the equally sympathetic Detective Ruggerio \\"Rugs\\" Carlucci. Now, in the seventeenth in the series, Constantine changes structure and focuses on three Rocksburg cops who patrol the Flats, an area of the city known for domestic disputes that often become deadly. Officer William Rayford prays for a thunderstorm that will keep the feuding Bucyks and Hornyaks, not to mention the certifiable Scavellis, indoors. His prayers aren't answered, however, and Rayford and fellow cops Reseta and Canozza all find themselves drawn into a lunatic situation that ends tragically. As in all the Rocksburg novels, there are few heroes and even fewer real villains--just ordinary people coping with inner demons, personal tragedies, and a bewildering world that has passed them by. One effect of the ensemble approach this time is that interior monologues of the three featured cops largely replace the achingly authentic dialogue that has driven the previous books. But rest assured that Constantine's monologues are every bit as effective as his superb dialogue.

The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency as the wilderness is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from from one USGS project,United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographical Names Information System(GNIS) to via the NOAA. This seems to be the latest and most accurate measurement from the U.S. Geodetic Survey. Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California.Atkinson, Ron p.224 The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at elevation and extending to the summit.Atkinson, Ron p.227 The smaller volcanic cone of Shastina (12,270 ft)USGS-GNIS lies one mile (1.6 km) west of Mount Shasta and was formed after the ice-age glaciers melted. The wilderness protects both pristine forests and areas that were intensively logged and roaded in the past. Although less than half of the mountain remains roadless, Mount Shasta Wilderness is still the premier destination for a variety of activities from mountaineering, day-hiking, and backpacking to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ski mountaineering. It is valued for the many scenic, geologic and recreational attributes including glaciers, lava flows, hot springs, waterfalls and forests of Shasta red fir, sugar pine and other conifers. Recreation Being a high, solitary and very large mountain with a base diameter of ,Adkinson, Ron p.224 Mount Shasta can create its own weather patterns which hikers must be aware of. Also, falling rocks are a major danger above timberline. The best time of year for hiking Mount Shasta is June and July, when routes are still snow-covered. Although there is no designated trail to the summit, many cross-country routes ascend to the mountaintop and all require experience in traversing ice and snow. There are ten trailheads giving access to the wilderness and several short trails leading up the slopes of Mount Shasta with the so-called Shasta Summit Trail (or Avalanche Gulch) being the most popular. This trail, although the \\"easiest\\" of the routes, still requires the use of ice axe and crampons. There are four major glaciers and three smaller glaciers radiating from the summit in addition to lava flows on the northern flank composed of andesite and basalt. A parking permit is required as well as a free wilderness permit and, if attempting a hike above , a Summit Pass for each climber must be purchased.Shasta-Trinity National Forest Wilderness page. Human waste must be packed out, and all principles of Leave No Trace etiquette employed. Some restrictions include no dogs in the wilderness, a limit of 10 people in a group and no wood campfires.Shasta- Trinity National Forest regulation document. Flora and fauna Forested areas include pure stands of red fir as well as mixed conifer forests of white fir, Douglas-fir, sugar pine, incense cedar and at higher elevations, western white pine. The lava flows on the northeast flank have mountain mahogany and juniper. Underbrush consists of pinemat manzanita, greenleaf manzanita, tanoak, chinquapin, and snowbrush. From to timberline are krummholz forms of whitebark pine. Wildlife include the ubiquitous black bear, coyote, ground squirrel, deer, golden eagles, prairie falcons and red-tail hawks. Common wildflowers are Shasta lily, miner's lettuce, showy phlox and mountain violet among others. Notable rare plants in the Mount Shasta Wilderness and surrounding area include Mt. Shasta arnica (Arnica viscosa), Siskiyou Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata ssp. elata) and Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus). The Siskiyou Indian paintbrush is hemiparasitic, meaning that the plant obtains water and nutrients from the roots of other plants, then manufactures food by photosynthesis. The Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus) of the family Scrophulariaceae is critically imperiled and was believed to be extinct. First described in 1848 by Harvard University botanist Asa Gray, the plant was not collected again until 1913. Known only from two reports from the Shasta Valley of northern California, it could not be relocated despite repeated searches of the moist meadows and vernal pools where it was thought originally to have been found. In May, 1996, botanist Dean Taylor of the University of California, Berkeley, rediscovered the evasive plant on the higher, drier ground of a sagebrush-covered hillside. But even in this habitat the wildflower appears to be extraordinarily rare. Taylor was able to find only eight individual plants of the owl‚Äôs-clover.

It is used as a base camp for summit attempts, and offers a shelter called the Shasta Alpine Lodge, dedicated in 1923 and built from surrounding volcanic rock and Shasta red fir wood. Horse Camp is staffed during the climbing season from May to September, has a seasonal spring for water and is a traditional destination of many elementary school trips from Siskiyou County schools.Sierra Club website.

Since 2002 he has been a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He represents the 88th district in the Virginia Piedmont, made up of parts of Fauquier, Spotsylvania and Stafford Counties, and the City of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Personal Cole grew up in Monticello, Kentucky. He has a bachelor's degree in civil engineering technology from the Western Kentucky University, an associate degree in computer information systems from Germanna Community College and a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Mary Washington. Military service After graduation from Western Kentucky University in 1980, Cole entered the United States Navy and was commissioned as an officer. He served on USS Mississippi (CGN-40) as Ordnance Officer and Assistant Combat Systems Officer. He left active duty in 1985 but continued to serve in the United States Naval Reserve where he retired as a Commander in 2004. Professional career After leaving the Navy in 1985, Cole was employed as a systems analyst and manager by Northrop Grumman supporting the Navy at Dahlgren, Virginia until 2012. In 2013 he was hired by Spotsylvania County, Virginia as deputy county administrator. Political career Cole was elected to the Spotsylvania County, Virginia Board of Supervisors in 1999, where he served until 2002 when he took office in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was the chairman of the House Privileges and Elections Committee until the Democratic Party took the majority in the Virginia House of Delegates in the 2019 election. He is also is a member of the House Finance and Education Committees. Positions Cole describes himself as a fiscal and social conservative that supports individual rights while opposing tax increases. He opposed Republican initiatives to raise taxes in 2007 and 2013. Cole voted against Medicaid expansion, HB5001, in the 2018 legislative session. The bill passed 68-30 in the House of Delegates with bipartisan support. =Microchip implantation= Cole was criticized in February 2010 for comments made by him about his sponsorship of HB53, a bill in the House of Delegates which would ban involuntary implantation of microchips into humans by their employers: Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said of this on MSNBC that \\"the sort of paranoid strain of thinking among these folks just‚Äîit advances to meet the new technology that we have.\\" Despite MSNBC's crusade against Delegate Cole, calling him \\"Mark of the Beast Cole\\" his bill (similar to one passed in other states) passed the House on a bi-partisan vote 88 to 9. =Bathroom bills= In 2016, Cole sponsored House Bill 663, a bathroom bill restricting public restroom use according to a person's \\"anatomical sex\\", defined as \\"the physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person's anatomy\\", with violators liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. HB663 was introduced on January 11, 2016 and died in committee in February 2016. It was widely reported that HB663 would require adults to inspect the genitals of children before they were allowed to enter the appropriate facilities, but this was dismissed by Snopes as a misleading interpretation of the bill's text, which states that administrators \\"shall develop and implement policies that require every restroom ... that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation.\\" Cole sponsored House Bill 781 one day later on January 12, 2016, which used the same wording but substituted \\"biological sex\\" for \\"anatomical sex\\". The use of \\"biological sex\\" allowed for an update via amended birth certificate. HB781 also died in committee in February. =Voter registration= In 2017, Cole sponsored House Bill 1598, which would require those registering to vote after January 1, 2018 for state and local elections to provide proof of citizenship. HB1598 passed the House of Delegates on a 64-37 party line vote in February 2017. =Fornication laws = Cole voted against a bill to eliminate a law banning sexual intercourse before marriage in the 2020 legislative session. The bill passed 91-5 with bipartisan support in the house. = Committee Memberships = Cole is a member of the Education, Privileges and Elections, and General Laws Committees.

Serote's poems about places, particularly his Alexandra poems, grapple with the problems of squalor, violence, death, destitution, exploitation and the Black People's quest for identity and a sense of community. In the poem Alexandra, the speaker's inner-child addresses his 'mother'; \\"Alexandra, my beginning was knotted to you, just like you knot my destiny\\". Alexandra (the place) is forever connected to the speaker, just like a mother would be forever connected to her child.

The Olivists had their strongholds in Northern Italy, and especially in Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont, but however Bindi, who obtained 12.9% of the vote in the primary election nationally, had her best result in Calabria (31.3%) thanks to Loiero's support.Documento senza titolo In July 2008 Bindi and her group (Giovanni Bachelet, Gianfranco Morgando, Roberto Zaccaria, Marina Magistrelli, Nando Dalla Chiesa) broke with the core Olivists, who were much more critical of the political line of Walter Veltroni's party leadership and of the lack of internal democracy within the party. In the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election the faction supported Pier Luigi Bersani. Bersani won and Bindi was elected president of the party.

It also stars Patrice Wymore, who married Flynn in 1950. The film is set near the end of the American Civil War.Crowther, Bosley. \\"\\"'Rocky Mountain' (1950).\\" The New York Times. Retrieved: January 26, 2015. Filmink magazine called it \\"a hidden gem, one of Flynn's best Westerns.\\" Plot A car pulls up to an historical marker in the desert that reads: > ROCKY MOUNTAIN, also known as Ghost Mountain. On March 26, 1865, a > detachment of Confederate cavalry crossed the state line into California > under secret orders from Gen. Robert E. Lee to rendezvous at Ghost Mountain > with one Cole Smith, with instructions to place the flag atop the mountain, > and though their mission failed, the heroism displayed by these gallant men > honored the cause for which they fought so valiantly. In 1865, eight horsemen trek across the California desert, arriving at Ghost Mountain. Led by Captain Lafe Barstow (Errol Flynn) of the Mississippi Mountain Rifles. The eight soldiers encounter a man who calls himself California Beal (Howard Petrie). As a last desperate effort to turn the tide of the war, Barstow's mission is to persuade Cole Smith and his 500 men to raid California on behalf of the Confederacy. From their vantage point on the mountain, the men see a Shoshone war party attack a stagecoach. Barstow's men charge and drive off the Shoshone after the stage overturns, rescuing driver Gil Craigie (Chubby Johnson ) and the only surviving passenger, Johanna Carter (Patrice Wymore), traveling to join her fianc√©, Union Army officer Lt. Rickey (Scott Forbes). That night, the Indians burn the stage. Next morning, a detachment of four Union soldiers and three Shoshone scouts examine the ashes. Barstow's men ambush the detachment, killing one and capturing the rest, including Lt. Rickey. From them, Barstow learns that the Union knows about their presence in California and that California Beal is actually Cole Smith himself. Smith leaves, promising to return in two days with his men. Craigie talks with the Shoshone scouts and learns that they are really a chief, Man Dog, and his sons. He warns Barstow that they will escape and return with their tribe. That night, while Jimmy (Dickie Jones) is on watch, the Indians try to escape. The soldiers kill two of them, but Man Dog evades their bullets. In the morning, Rickey suggests that he take Johanna to a nearby garrison before the Indians arrive. Barstow, however, hopes that Smith's men will come before the Indians do and rejects the suggestion. Near dawn, Rickey's men jump their guards. One dies in the attempt, and another's recaptured, but Rickey makes his escape. The Southerners find a riderless horse but it turns out to be Smith's, not Rickey's, and they realize that help is not coming. Barstow decides to use all his men to lure the Indians away from the mountain while Johanna, Craigie and the Union trooper escape. The greatly outnumbered Rebels ride into a box canyon and turn to fight, charging the Shoshone. During the battle, Rickey returns with a troop of Union cavalry, and Johanna tells Rickey what has happened. The cavalry attempt to save Barstow's men but are too late; all the Southerners have been killed. Rickey raises their rebel flag on top of Rocky Mountain to salute the bravery of their fallen foes.

Biography The daughter of the London merchant Henry Dewell (d. in or after 1655), no details of Elizabeth's life prior to her marriage to John in or before September 1641 (shortly after his release from prison) are known. Already involved in London separatist circles at the time of her marriage, she was one of the thirteen women and sixteen men arrested in September 1641 for their attendance at John Spilsbury's Baptist congregation in Stepney. Her husband's politically active life, leading to frequent spells in prison (often with Elizabeth alongside him) and some time in exile, dominated her life and made for much lobbying and hardship for her. During John's time serving as a captain in Lord Brooke's regiment he was captured at the Battle of Brentford (1642) by royalists and threatened with execution. Elizabeth not only managed to petition parliament to threaten tit- for-tat executions of royalist prisoners if her husband was executed, but also carried a letter of this news from the Speaker of the House of Commons to the Royalist court in exile in Oxford whilst pregnant. After John's release she spent a few quieter months in Boston, Lincolnshire while he was serving with the army of the Eastern Association, though he became more and more disaffected with the dominant parliamentary factions. Heavily pregnant, she joined him in Newgate Prison in August 1645 when he was sent there for attacking William Lenthall and it was there that their daughter Elizabeth was born and (maybe against the couple's wishes) baptised. Elizabeth's childbed linen was in the meantime stolen from the couple's London home by parliamentary officers hunting for \\"dangerous Bookes\\". Between then and 1649 they also had two sons. John was imprisoned again in 1646-48 for attacking presbyterian and parliamentarian authoritarianism and in March to July 1649 - during the former period Elizabeth was herself arrested for circulating John's books, and it was her catching smallpox (as did the couple's 3 children - the two sons died but the daughter survived) that led to his bail at the end of the latter. Elizabeth recovered and went on to have seven more children, though only two of these (plus their first daughter) reached adulthood. She became ill again in October 1649 and was unable to be present on John's acquittal of treason by a London jury. The following 18 months were peaceful for the couple, living partly off the proceeds of confiscated Durham church lands John had been granted in compensation for his 1630s punishments, but they came to ruin through the exile and ¬£7000 fine imposed on John in January 1652 after his conviction for libel by parliament after an attack on Sir Arthur Haselrig's administration of sequestered north-eastern estates. The prominent Baptist William Kiffin was an old friend of John and a former political ally, and it was to him that Elizabeth was entrusted during John's exile. She tried to convince him to reconcile himself to Oliver Cromwell, if only for their family's sake, visiting him in Bruges and convincing him to return to England in June 1653. He was, however, imprisoned on arrival and remained there until his death apart from brief paroles, though two more children were born in 1652-53 (he criticised her for being \\"perfectly distracted\\" by the death of one of their children in this period). John's father and Elizabeth tried and failed in July 1655 to have him released, with themselves as guarantors of his good behaviour, and he was moved from Jersey to Dover before dying in Eltham on 29 August 1657 on bail after his wife's last confinement.  Later years  In his last years John became a Quaker but it seems from his writings that he was not joined in this by Elizabeth. In his exile writings he called her arguments to him to return to be \\"mournful\\", the terms on which she recommended compromise as \\"sneaking terms [that] my soul abhorres [sic]\\" and Elizabeth herself as \\"my poor credulous wife\\". However, her arguments were vindicated after his death when she eventually managed to gain from Cromwell the lifting of the 1652 fine, the renewal of a weekly pension of 40s. for herself and her children and help in settling disputes over the Durham property. Her pension was still being paid in March 1660, though the improvement in her fortunes probably ended with the English Restoration. With John's obstinacy now removed, she also managed to resolve the Lilburnes' complex property disputes in Durham, so much so that Hesilrige became an ally in Parliament (in return for her giving him all the papers relating to his original dispute with John).

Shortly after the event in 2013, WJE was retained to investigate the failure and to design a temporary stabilization structure. Over the past two decades, National Park Service personnel noticed discoloration and streaking at the stainless steel exterior of the iconic Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. During several phases from 2005 to 2015, WJE investigated and documented the history and conditions of the Gateway Arch. As part of a phased corrosion study to determine the source of distress, a team of WJE staff utilized industrial rope access techniques to access surfaces of the structure not seen up close since the 630-foot monument was completed in 1965. =WJE Projects 2000-Present= Following the 2007 deadly collapse of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) retained WJE to lead their investigation into the cause of the collapse. * 2001 - Poplar Street Complex - East St. Louis, Illinois - Seismic and Redundancy Retrofit Projecthttp://www.iti.northwestern.edu/publications/fine_vaynman/Fine_and_Vaynman-2003-Development_and_Commercialization_of_High- Performance_Steel.pdf * 2005 - Hurricane Katrina - New Orleans, Louisiana - Damage Inspection * 2006-2007 - Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts) - Stem-to- Stern Safety Audit * 2007 - Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum - Austin, Texas - Plaza Investigation and Repair Services * 2007 - Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial - Put-in-Bay, Ohio - Investigation and Repair of Monument * 2007 - I-35W Bridge - Minneapolis, Minnesota - Collapse Investigation * 2007 - Illinois State Capitol - Springfield, Illinois - House Chamber, Art Glass Laylight Reconstruction * 2007 - Blackstone Hotel - Chicago, Illinois - Exterior Facade Investigation * 2007 - Aloha Stadium - Honolulu, Hawaii - Structural Certification * 2007 - MacArthur Maze - Bay Area, California - Condition Assessment and Materials Evaluation * 2011 - The Washington Monument - Washington, D.C. - Condition Assessment and Repair Recommendation Due to Earthquake * 2012 - Hurricane Sandy - New Jersey and New York - Investigation of Storm Damage Claims * 2013 - Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge - Green Bay, Wisconsin - Failure Investigation and Temporary Stabilization Design * 2015 - Gateway Arch - St. Louis, Missouri - Corrosion Investigation and Historic Structure Report Firm and Project Awards * Alcatraz Cellhouse - San Francisco, California - California Preservation Foundation: Design Award in the Craftsmanship category, 2005; International Concrete Repair Institute: Award of Excellence in the Repair of Historic Structures category, 2005http://www.sikaconstruction.com/cs-cpd-alcatrazcellhouse-us.pdf *Blackstone Hotel - Chicago, Illinois - Chicago Landmark Award for Preservation Excellence from the Commission of Chicago Landmarks, 2008; Excellence in Masonry (gold award) from the Illinois Indiana Masonry Council, 2008; Design Award (silver medal) from the Association of Licensed Architects, 2008; Project of the Year from Midwest Construction, 2008 * Eldridge Street Synagogue - New York, New York - The New York Landmarks Conservancy: Lucy G.

During the summer of 1995, the director of Frontline, Ken Baugh, began to preach during the services while Solomon was on vacation for the summer. Baugh, the former Young Adults Pastor at Saddleback Church in California, was a success and remained the permanent teaching pastor. Baugh oversaw steady growth of this new ministry from an average attendance of 300 in 1995 to 2000 in 2000. The new worshippers credited this growth to Baugh‚Äôs efforts to make Frontline relevant to young adults through music, sermons and videos.Julia Duin,\\"Meeting on the Frontline\\" , Christianity Today, April 1, 1999 Ken Baugh became pastor of Coast Hills Community Church in California, which led to Todd Phillips‚Äô promotion to pastor of Frontline in January 2005.

Background Alfred Bryan Willie was the oldest son born into an Anglo-Irish family, at 21 Westland Row, Dublin, to Sir William Wilde and his wife Jane Francesca Wilde (n√©e Elgee) (her pseudonym being 'Speranza'). Their second son, Oscar, was born in the same house in 1854. Jane Wilde was a successful writer, being a poet for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848 and a lifelong Irish nationalist.Literary Encyclopedia ‚Äì Oscar Wilde Sir William was Ireland's leading Oto-Ophthalmologic (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services to medicine. William also wrote books on archaeology and folklore. He was a renowned philanthropist, and his dispensary for the care of the city's poor, in Lincoln Place at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. In June 1855, the family moved to 1 Merrion Square in a fashionable residential area, where Wilde's sister, Isola, was born in 1856. Here, Lady Wilde held a regular Saturday afternoon salon with guests including Sheridan le Fanu, Samuel Lever, George Petrie, Isaac Butt and Samuel Ferguson. In February 1864, Willie and Oscar were sent to board at the Portora Royal School at Enniskillen in Ulster, where Willie became known for his good- humour and friendliness, later being described by a classmate as \\"clever, erratic and full of vitality\\".Quoted in James Holroyd's 'Brother to Oscar', Blackwood's Magazine, March 1974 Oscar became known to his school fellows by the nickname 'Grey Crow', which he disliked, while Willie was 'Blue Blood'. Willie was \\"an accomplished pianist and an artist of little talent'Burke's Irish Family Records (London: Burke‚Äôs Peerage 1976) p.1217 Oscar Wilde later recalled that the headmaster, Dr Steele, had told him that ‚ÄúIf I went on studying as I had been during the last year I might yet do as well as my brother Willie, and be an honour to the school and everyone connected with it.‚Äù Willie was already a student at Trinity College, Dublin when Oscar joined him in 1871, the two sharing rooms during their second and third years there. In 1876 'Willie' published several of his poems in the College magazine Kottabos, which he also edited. Life Alfred Bryan after the failure of Oscar Wilde's play Vera; or, The Nihilists in America After graduating from Trinity College Willie Wilde studied law and was called to the Irish Bar, but he never actually practised law. His father died in 1876, and in early 1879 Willie and Lady Wilde moved to London, where he became a journalist, serving as a drama critic for Punch and Vanity Fair, as a leader writer for The Daily Telegraph, and as editor of Christmas numbers of several magazines.Willie Wilde on the Oscar Wilde website Willie was a regular guest at the Fielding Club, which during its short life opened its doors at eight o'clock in the evening and remained open all night. The club was famous for its grills, its brandy and its Pol Roger '74, but its tripe and onions on Saturdays were an especial draw. One member listed Willie among those who were \\"constant guests\\" on Saturdays, along with Henry Irving, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, J. Comyns Carr, Edward Dicey, Carlo Pellegrini, Frederic Clay and Oscar Wilde.Sir Vincent Corbett, KCVO, Reminiscences, Autobiographical and Diplomatic, Hodder & Stoughton n.d (preface dated July 1927) p. 38. Ralph Nevill, the son of Lady Dorothy Nevill, said of Willie Wilde: > \\"Willie Wilde was a clever journalist who, had he been less careless in his > habits, might have achieved considerable success. As it was, a number of the > articles which he wrote for the Daily Telegraph were little short of > brilliant, while as a talker, few could equal him. He was, however, his own > enemy, and could not resist the attractions of the moment or settle down > long to regular work ‚Äì in truth, though not very old in years, he belonged > to the now almost extinct school of journalists which, taking ‚Äòsufficient is > the day for the evil there of‚Äô as their motto, never gave a thought to the > future (or anything else) if they happened to have a few pounds in their > pockets.\\"Ralph Nevill, The World of Fashion 1837‚Äì1922, Methuen 1923, p. 70. By the time of Oscar's marriage, in 1884, Willie was seriously in debt and drinking heavily. On 4 October 1891, aged 39, Willie married a wealthy widow, Mrs Frank Leslie (1836‚Äì1914), the owner of the Frank Leslie Publishing Company in New York. She was initially attracted by Willie's humour and wit. He proceeded to spend much of his time in New York drinking at the fashionable Lotos Club, gossiping about London Society and reciting parodies of his brother's poems, which perhaps suggests that he was jealous of Oscar's success. His marriage was short-lived, Mrs Leslie starting divorce proceedings within a year on the grounds of Willie's drunkenness and adultery. They were finally divorced on 10 June 1893.The New York Times 11 June 1893Madeleine B. Stern, Purple Passage: The Life of Mrs. Frank Leslie, 1953. It was Mrs Leslie who approached Oscar Wilde with the idea that he give a series of lectures in the United States. Oscar lectured throughout the year 1882, so this attribute to Mrs. Leslie can't possibly be accurate. On his return to London, early in 1892, Willie found that Oscar was the toast of the town for his successful play Lady Windermere's Fan. It is believed that Willie wrote the ambivalent review of the play that was published unsigned in Vanity Fair on 27 February 1892 (he had previously been a drama critic for the magazine). The reviewer, whoever he really was, wrote that \\"The play was 'brilliantly unoriginal,' but the dialogue was 'uniformly bright, graceful and flowing.' He concluded that it was 'an undeniably clever piece of work; and even though it has its weaknesses, it reflects credit on its author. ... It is emphatically a play to see.'\\"Review in Vanity Fair, 27 February 1892 Oscar, believing that he recognised his brother's hand behind the anonymous review, was by then writing A Woman of No Importance, in which one character says: \\"After a good dinner, one can forgive anybody, even one's own relations.\\" By now Willie Wilde was in serious financial difficulties and Oscar began giving him money, but bad feeling between the brothers heightened when Oscar discovered that Willie was pestering their mother for money even though she was far from well-off. Oscar once said of Willie, \\"He sponges on everyone but himself.\\" Max Beerbohm saw the brothers as mirror images and portrayed them as such in his caricatures of them. In a letter to the painter William Rothenstein Beerbohm wrote, \\"... did I tell you that I saw a good deal of [Oscar's] brother Willie at Broadstairs? Quel monstre! Dark, oily, suspect yet awfully like Oscar: he has Oscar's coy, carnal smile & fatuous giggle, & not a little of Oscar's esprit. But he is awful ‚Äì a veritable tragedy of family-likeness\\".Max and Will: Max Beerbohm and William Rothenstein, Their Friendship and Letters, 1893‚Äì1945, ed. Mary M. Lago and Karl Beckson, 1975, p. 21. Beerbohm later wrote: > \\"My sister Constance came home one day and summoned my mother and me; she > was quivering to tell us what had happened. She knew in advance it was the > sort of thing my mother would adore. Well, Constance had been walking along > the street and met Willie Wilde ‚Äì Oscar's brother. In one hand, he was > carrying a huge leg of mutton by the narrow part; with his free hand he > swept off his hat and bent over double in a grand, ceremonial bow. There was > something so grotesquely funny in the way he did it, conveying both the > mutton and the bow. We decided it was a first class thing.\\"Max Beerbohm, > quoted in S.N. Behrman, Conversations with Max, Hamish Hamilton 1960, p. 38. In January 1894 Willie married Sophie Lily Lees (1859‚Äì1922), with whom he had been living. She has been described as \\"an emotional woman with a tendency to early panic ... she believed (incorrectly) that she was pregnant\\"Kevin O'Brien, \\"Lily Wilde and Oscar's Fur Coat,\\" Journal of the Eighteen Nineties Society, 1994. She tried to induce an abortion by taking a powder. The marriage caused further distress to Lady Wilde when the couple moved in with her. She wrote to Oscar on 4 February 1894, telling him of the marriage: \\"Miss Lees has but ¬£50 a year and this just dresses her. She can give nothing to the house and Willie is always in a state of utter poverty. So all is left upon me.\\" Willie and Lily had their only child, Dorothy 'Dolly' Ierne Wilde, in July 1895.Karl Beckson, \\"The Importance of Being Angry: The Mutual Antagonism of Oscar and Willie Wilde\\" in Blood Brothers: Siblings as Writers, ed. Norman Kiell, New York: International University Press, 1983. Lady Wilde wrote Oscar a lengthy letter seeking reconciliation between him and Willie, who, she said, was \\"sickly and extravagant\\". She added that she was \\"miserable at the present position of [her] two sons\\" and \\"at the general belief that you hate your brother\\". She then asked Oscar to hold out his hand to Willie, a request she repeated several times in the letter: \\"Come then & offer him yr. hand in good faith ‚Äì & begin a new course of action.\\" Later years Following Oscar's arrest and first trial in April 1895, Willie claimed that he gave his brother shelter when he was unable to find rooms in London. Willie said that Oscar \\"fell down on my threshold like a wounded stag\\". Standing by his brother, Willie wrote to Bram Stoker, \\"Bram, my friend, poor Oscar was not as bad as people thought him. He was led astray by his Vanity ‚Äì & conceit, & he was so 'got at' that he was weak enough to be guilty ‚Äì of indiscretions and follies ‚Äì that is all.... I believe this thing will help to purify him body & soul.\\"Barbara Belford, ;;Bram Stoker: A Biography of the Author of Dracula, 1996. Willie did not meet Oscar after he was released from prison in 1897. On 13 March 1899 Willie died, aged 46, at 9 Cheltenham Terrace in ChelseaThe Times, 15 March 1899. from complications related to his alcoholism.Barbaras Belford, Oscar Wilde: A Certain Genius, New York: Random House 2000. After Robert Ross wrote to Oscar in France informing him of Willie's death, Oscar replied: \\"I suppose it had been expected for some time. ... Between him and me there had been, as you know, wide chasms for many years. Requiescat in Pace.\\" Willie's widow remarried in 1900. Her second husband, who became Dolly's stepfather, was the Dutch-born translator Alexander Teixeira de Mattos.

Background  Historically, German law students did not receive any academic degree upon completion of their curriculum. Instead, after usually four or five years of study, students would sit their First State Examination (Erstes Staatsexamen) in Law, which was administered by the ministry of justice of the respective state, not the university. More recently, however, some universities have begun to award their students a Diplom-Jurist upon passing the First State Examination, in order to indicate the equivalence of the education to a master's degree in other disciplines.  Role for the legal profession  The \\"Diplom-Jurist\\" does not give the holder the right to work as, for instance, a fully qualified attorney (Rechtsanwalt) or a judge. The German legal education system requires examinees of the First State Examination to pass a two-year practical training period (Referendariat), at the end of which candidates sit the Second State Examination which, if passed, admits successful participants to the bar. As such, the \\"Diplom-Jurist\\" is a step towards qualifying as a lawyer, judge or prosecutor. Aside from that, the degree \\"Diplom-Jurist\\" is an academic degree in his own right. However, holders of the \\"Diplom-Jurist\\" degree may, of course, work as lawyers in unregulated legal professions where admittance to the bar is not required (e.g. in-house counsel). Other universities have begun to award Magister Juris degrees following the same principles.

Based on the fairy tale Cinderella, the film is about an orphan who is sent to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle after graduating from boarding school. Her life is made difficult by her snobby cousin who arranges that she stay home while the rest of the family attends a major social ball. With the help of her uncle, she makes it to the ball, where she meets and falls in love with her cousin's boyfriend. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Music. Plot Constance Harding is an unhappy orphan who will soon graduate from Miss Wiggins' school for girls. Her only real relatives are members from the James Clinton family, but they show little interest in the teenager. She is brought to New York by one of their butlers, where she moves in with a bunch of snobs. The upperclass people are not impressed with her, but Connie is able to befriend the servants. One afternoon, her cousin Barbara Clinton orders Connie to stop Ted Drake from going riding without her. Connie tries the best she can, which results in embarrassing herself. She has secretly fallen in love with him and is filled with joy when she learns the Drake family is organizing a ball. The servants raise money to buy her a fashionable dress. However, Barbara spreads a lie and Connie is eventually prohibited from attending the ball. Connie is heartbroken, until the servants arrange a limousine she can use until midnight. Meanwhile, the police detain the Clinton family car until almost midnight when they can be brought before a judge, since the chauffeur is missing the vehicle's proof of ownership. At the ball, everyone is impressed with her singing talents. Ted notices her and tries to charm her. They eventually kiss, when Connie realizes it is midnight. She runs off, but accidentally leaves one of her slippers behind. Ted finds the slipper and tries to locate the owner. Arriving at the ball just before midnight, Barbara spots Connie leaving the ball. Infuriated, she tries to break Connie's confidence and fires all the servants. The next day, Connie is missing as well, and her uncle James berates Grace, Barbara, and Walter for their hostile/indifferent attitude to Connie. Meanwhile, Connie returns to Miss Wiggins' school in the hope of becoming a music teacher. Ted follows her and they reunite in the end.

(2003) and Walter (2003) The Saxothuringian Zone, Saxo-Thuringian zoneKohl, Horst; Marcinek, Joachim and Nitz, Bernhard (1986). Geography of the German Democratic Republic, VEB Hermann Haack, Gotha, pp. 8 ff. . or Saxothuringicum is in geology a structural or tectonic zone in the Hercynian or Variscan orogen (380-270 million years old) of central and western Europe. Because rocks of Hercynian age are in most places covered by younger strata, the zone is not everywhere visible at the surface. Places where it crops out are the northern Bohemian Massif, the Spessart, the Odenwald, the northern parts of the Black Forest and Vosges and the southern part of the Taunus. West of the Vosges terranes on both sides of the English Channel are also seen as part of the zone, for example the Lizard complex in Cornwall or the L√©on Zone of the Armorican Massif (Brittany). Location In central Europe the Saxothuringian Zone is situated between the Rhenohercynian Zone to the northwest and the Moldanubian Zone to the southeast.The subdivision of the central European Hercynian orogen in zones was first made by Kossmat (1927) The Hercynian metamorphism of the former zone is generally lower grade; that of the latter zone higher grade than that of the Saxothuringian Zone. West of the Vosges the zone is displaced to the north by a major strike-slip fault, the Bray Fault. The Saxothuringian Zone is in some places transected by Permo-Triassic grabens and intramontane basins filled with Rotliegend sediments and older deposits. The Eger Graben in the northwest of the Czech Republic and the Saar-Nahe Basin in western Germany are examples of such structures. Geology The Saxothuringian Zone consists of early Paleozoic marine sediments that were deposited in the Saxothuringian Basin. They were slightly metamorphosed during the Hercynian orogeny. The sedimentary sequence is assumed to be continuous from the Ediacaran to the Visean (330 million years ago).Kroner et al. (2007); Franke (2000) These metasediments form a wide zone north of the city of Dresden in Saxony.For an overview see for example Linnemann (1995) Tectonostratigraphically, gneisses (high-grade metamorphic rocks) and granites are found under these metasediments. They crop out as the competent massifs of the Ore Mountains and Saxonian Granulite Massif. They were deformed and recrystallized during the Cadomian orogeny (in the Ediacaran, 650-550 million years ago) and intruded by felsic plutons during the Cambrian and Ordovician (540-420 million years ago). In some places klippes of allochthonous crystalline rocks are found on top of these two units. These klippes are the M√ºnchberg complex, Wildenfels complex and Frankenberg complex. They consisted originally of a sequence of deep-marine (flysch) sediments of Ordovician to Devonian age (480-360 million years old) and early Paleozoic mid-oceanic ridge basalts. The latter have been metamorphosed at a high grade (up to eclogite facies). These allochthonous nappes can probably be correlated with the Tepl√° terrane in the Moldanubian Zone further south.Matte et al. (1990) The Saxothuringian Zone is often also supposed to include the Mid-German Crystalline High, which then forms the northern part of the zone and lies directly next to the Rhenohercynian Northern Phyllite Zone. The Mid-German Crystalline High crops out in the Odenwald, the Spessart and the northern Vosges. It consists of Proterozoic orthogneisses and early Paleozoic volcanic (amphibolites with MORB-protoliths and tuffs) and sedimentary (pelites, calcareous schists and marbles) rocks that were metamorphosed at high grade during the Hercynian orogeny (up to amphibolite facies). These rocks were intruded by two generations of plutons: Silurian to Early Devonian (440-400 million years old) granitoids and middle Carboniferous (Hercynian, 340-325 million years old) granites.Oncken (1997); Franke (2000) See also *Geology of Germany Notes Bibliography *; 1992: Phanerozoic structures and events in central Europe, in: (eds.): A Continent Revealed - The European Geotraverse, 297 pp., Cambridge University Press, , pp. 164‚Äì179. *; 2000: The mid-European segment of the Variscides: tectonostratigraphic units, terrane boundaries and plate tectonic evolution, in: (eds.); Orogenic Processes, Quantification and Modelling in the Variscan Belt, Geological Society of London, Special Publications 179, pp. 35‚Äì61. *; 1927: Gliederung des varistischen Gebirgsbaues, Abhandlungen des S√§chsischen Geologischen Landesamtes 1, pp. 1‚Äì39. *; 2007: The Variscan orogeny in the Saxo-Thuringian zone - heterogeneous overprint of Cadomian/Paleozoic Peri-Gondwana crust, in: (eds.): The evolution of the Rheic Ocean: from Avalonian-Cadomian active margin to Alleghenian-Variscan collision, Geological Society of America Special Paper 423 pp. 153‚Äì172. *; 1995: The Neoproterozoic terranes of Saxony (Germany), Precambrian Research 73, pp. 235‚Äì250. *; 2001: The Variscan collage and orogeny (480¬±290 Ma) and the tectonic definition of the Armorica microplate: a review, Terra Nova 13, 122-128. *; 1990: Terrane boundaries in the Bohemian Massif: Result of large-scale Variscan shearing, Tectonophysics 177, pp. 151‚Äì170. *; 1997: Transformation of a magmatic arc and an orogenic root during oblique collision and it‚Äôs consequences for the evolution of the European Variscides (Mid-German Crystalline Rise), Geologische Rundschau 86, pp. 2‚Äì20. *; 2003: Gondwana-derived microcontinents ‚Äî the constituents of the Variscan and Alpine collisional orogens, Tectonophysics 365, pp. 7‚Äì22. *; 2010: Pre-Mesozoic Geology of Saxo-Thuringia 488 p. *; 2003: Erdgeschichte ‚Äì Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane, 325 pp., Walter de Gruyter, Berlin (5e druk), .

Blackpool Leaver made his debut for Blackpool on 7 February 1920, in a 1‚Äì0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday. He went on to make two further appearances (in the succeeding two matches) in the 1920‚Äì21 season. Leaver made four appearances in 1921‚Äì22.

Examples of those commands and data is loudspeaker messages, train destination signs, and control of doors (locked/un-locked, open/close) and others. Since 1996 this standard number has been reused for \\"Loudspeaker and telephone systems in RIC coaches Standard technical characteristics \\" UIC Online Shop, Leaflet No. 568 The current standard is given in UIC leaflet 558 \\"Remote control and data cable ‚Äì Standard technical features for the equipping of RIC coaches \\" http://www.shop-etf.com/en/leaflets-irs/5-rolling-stock/55-power-supply- lighting-and-heating/remote-control-and-data-cable-standard-technical- features-for-the-equipping-of-ric-coaches.html  History  The UIC 568-cable and connector was first introduced along with the specifications for carriages built according to the UIC type Y (24.5 meters long, 8 cabins) and the UIC type X (26.4 meters long, 10 cabins), but have later on been used for variety of other passenger carriages, allowing mixing of InterCity (medium to long distances) and regional (short to medium distances) carriages. Remote operation of locomotive Very early in the development of the standard, it was decided that two conductors and pins should be reserved for remote operation of the locomotive (when using control cars). Locomotives equipped according to this standard will usually have two sockets at each end of the locomotive, and carriages will usually also have one or two sockets. Loose cables are then used to establish connection between the locomotive and the carriages, as well as from carriage to carriage. Train communication network Attempts have been made to use this cable for a complete communications bus (Train Communication Network, TCN) but it was decided that backwards compatibility was important, so that un-converted carriages could still be used. This would require an 18-conductor cable, which led to the development of the UIC 558-cable and connectors. 13-wire plugs can be connected to an 18-pin socket, and the signals from the 13-wire cable carried through. The remaining five wires are used for the Train Communication Network (TCN)-bus and side-sensitive door control. Head end power Along with the UIC 568-cable and connectors, carriages used for international traffic are required to be equipped with electric heating. The power for this, as well as for lighting, air-conditioning, electric outlets for passengers, etc., is carried by a separate cable. This cable carries single-phase electric power at 1500 volts AC, 50 Hz (with the tracks as the ground connection), supplied from the locomotive, or in some cases a carriage with a generator. In order to use this power, each carriage is equipped with a transformer, which reduces the voltage and supplies a number of electric groups (typically one for heating/air-conditioning, one for lighting, one for outlets to passengers and so on).

Cinader (November 10, 1924 ‚Äì November 16, 1982) was an American television producer best known for his work on two NBC series packaged by actor/producer Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited, Adam-12 and Emergency! The latter show in particular was widely credited by observers as one of the most important efforts to promote the widespread adoption of paramedic services by fire departments and hospitals in the U.S. A native New Yorker and an Army veteran, Cinader first wrote for Holiday Magazine, and later became head of the United Nations' publications operation. Then he turned to the field of television syndication, working for the William Morris Agency and later for NBC's syndication division, where he created a 1957 adventure series, The Silent Service, a Dragnet-like semi-documentary anthology about Navy submarines. Afterward, he worked for both Hal Roach and Red Skelton in the early 1960s. While working a stint at Warner Brothers, Cinader was approached by Webb (a former head of the WB TV operation) to assist him in producing his 1967-70 revival of Dragnet, for Universal Studios. While on that job, he devised a show for Mark VII that told the story of the police beat from the perspective of two LAPD patrol officers. The result, Adam-12, ran on NBC from 1968‚Äì75; Cinader was also the producer of that program during the early part of its run. In 1971, while brainstorming for new program ideas, Cinader heard about a trial paramedic program that Los Angeles County was undertaking with funding by the California State Legislature. He became so enthralled with the idea that he persuaded Webb and Universal to make an entire show about the phenomenon. Emergency! was set in a fictional fire station, with trained firefighters attending to first aid and primary care of sick and injured victims on the scene, while electronically transmitting medical information to, and receiving instructions from, doctors and/or nurses at the fictional Rampart hospital. The show debuted as a mid-season replacement in early 1972, and despite facing the top-rated All in the Family for most of its run on Saturday nights, Emergency! managed to gain a large following among young viewers. NBC spun off the show into a Saturday-morning cartoon series entitled Emergency +4, which lasted for two years in the mid-1970s. The prime-time show itself ran for six seasons as a weekly show and two more as a series of two- hour made-for-TV movies. Cinader eventually became its executive producer; during the 1973-74 season, he also helmed Mark VII's Chase, a similar adventure-based show. The following year, he would supervise an Emergency! spin-off of sorts, Sierra, a show that lasted only 13 weeks. He produced two 1979 miniseries The Rebels and The Seekers, as well as Condominium (1980). Cinader became an expert in emergency medicine and in 1975 was appointed to the Emergency Medical Services Commission of Los Angeles County and he served on the commission until his death. Just prior to his death, Cinader produced the first six episodes of Knight Rider, a new series from Glen A. Larson. He is listed in the credits as Co-Executive Producer. Death Cinader died from cancer in Encino, California six days after his 58th birthday, just five weeks before Webb also died. Cinader was survived by his wife of 31 years, Jean. The Knight Rider episode \\"The Final Verdict\\" was dedicated to him, stating \\"he was an original.\\"https://www.nbc.com/classic-tv/knight-rider-original/video/the- final-verdict/n3677 Time was:48:17 Legacy Los Angeles County Fire Department, Fire Station 127 Cinader became so identified with the paramedic movement that he received an appointment to the local Emergency Medical Services Commission. Los Angeles County Fire Department station 127 in Carson, California, shown in Emergency! as the fictional Station 51, was named as the Robert A. Cinader Memorial Fire Station in his memory.

Biography Pole-Evans was born in Llanmaes near Cardiff, the son of an Anglican clergyman, Daniel Evans and Caroline Jane Pole. He was educated at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, receiving a BSc in 1903 and going on to Cambridge where he studied mycology and plant pathology under Harry Marshall Ward FRS, obtaining an MA in 1905. Pole-Evans was appointed as mycologist and plant pathologist, and joined Burtt Davy in the newly established Transvaal Department of Agriculture. Although having the most rudimentary laboratory facilities, Pole-Evans implemented a research program and started producing a steady flow of published work. He assumed charge of the Division of Mycology and Plant Pathology in 1912, which later became part of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology. After settling in Pretoria, Pole-Evans turned his attention to the rich flora of his adopted country and singled out the Aloes for special attention. He amassed a collection of great value and established the plants on the grounds of the Division. Some new Aloe species were described by him in the Trans. Roy. Soc. S. Afr. of 1915 and 1917. In 1916 an outbreak of citrus canker threatened to bring down the citrus industry in the Transvaal. Pole-Evans orchestrated a drastic program that called for the complete eradication of infected orchards and nurseries. This timely intervention saved the industry. During his travels throughout southern Africa, he collected photographs and data on the major vegetation types of the region. This resulted in a preliminary account entitled \\"The Plant Geography of South Africa\\", in which he recognised 19 botanical regions, each with distinctive ecological characteristics. His classification, with its accompanying 1:3,000,000 vegetation map, remained the standard reference work until replaced by Acocks' system in 1953. He initiated the Botanical Survey Advisory Committee which led to the serial publication of the Botanical Survey Memoirs, first appearing in 1919. He also introduced the Flowering Plants of South Africa in 1920 and Bothalia in 1921. One of his longstanding interests was pasture grasses, and he was instrumental in collecting and introducing many of these to South Africa from various places on the sub-continent. These grasses were grown and tested at the Prinshof and Rietondale Experiment Stations. In 1930 Pole-Evans accompanied John Hutchinson and Jan Smuts on a two-month expedition through Southern and Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland and Lake Tanganyika. A more ambitious expedition was undertaken by him in 1938 at the invitation of the Kenyan government. In the company of C. J. J. van Rensburg, an agrostologist, and J. Erens, a plant and seed collector, he set off on a four-month odyssey covering some . On this trip they travelled through Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika to Kenya, going as far north as the border with Sudan and Abyssinia, returning through Uganda, the Ruwenzoris and the Belgian Congo. His account of this expedition was published in Botanical Survey Memoir No. 22 of 1948. During his career, Pole-Evans collected extensively in southern Africa and covered the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. His collections can be found at A, B, BOL, BR, E, EA, GRA, K, L, MO, P, PRE, S, SRGH and US. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Pole-Evans when citing a botanical name.Aluka His dedication to botany in the service of the Department of Agriculture, set a high standard for a whole generation of South African botanists, inspiring an unparalleled expansion in the country's botanical science. The National Herbarium, which had started with the small collection of Burtt Davy, grew rapidly with the acquisition of the collections of Ernest Edward Galpin, Anna Dieterlen (1859-1945), Henry George Flanagan (1861‚Äì1919), Rudolf Marloth, Alice Pegler (1861‚Äì1929), William Tyson (1851‚Äì1920) and the bryophytes of Thomas Robertson Sim. Pole-Evans was instrumental in extending the ill-fated Dongola Reserve which had been created in the Northern Transvaal in the 1920s, and was scrapped by the new Government of 1948. In 1955 he retired to Umtali in Rhodesia, where he continued his botanical collecting. Pole-Evans died in Umtali, Rhodesia at the age of 89. Personal life He married Mary R.H. Thompson MSc (London) in 1922, three years after she joined his staff as a mycologist. Legacy Pole-Evans is commemorated by the grass genus Polevansia De Winter, and by numerous specific names such as Aloe pole- evansii, Dinteranthus pole-evansii, Gladiolus pole-evansii etc., as well as Volume 20 of Flowering Plants of South Africa. Scadoxus pole-evansii is named for his son, Reginald.

History The Duke Trophy was made in 1952 and donated to the Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council by Len Duke, the first Secretary/Treasurer of the AAIRC, with the help of an old school friend Dave Morgan. Both started skating at St Moritz Ice Palais in St Kilda in June 1946 and eventually represented Victoria in interstate competition. There had been interstate racing between NSW and Victoria for many years, initially managed by the Ice Hockey Association as an additional attraction to the interstate hockey matches at the time, however there was nothing tangible to record the winning teams in these competitions. By 1951 the AAIRC was formed and had separate associations for Speed Skating in Victoria and New South Wales and even for a short time in Tasmania, which was the venue for the 1952 Australian Championships. Duke felt there should be a dedicated trophy for Interstate Racing, especially after the Victorian team was very successful in Hobart in 1952. The resulting award was named and inscribed \\"The Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council Trophy for Interstate Racing\\". The trophy features a silver statuette of a skater on the top, mirroring the design of the Australian Championship award that Duke had won the year before. Around 1957 it was suggested that the interstate racing trophy be renamed the \\"Duke Trophy\\" to keep his name in the sport following his retirement. Duke's own 1951 Australian Championship trophy featured a silver speed skater mounted on a globe of the world. This trophy was donated back to the VSSU (which later became VIRA) after Len's death, and has since been made into the best and fairest award for the Duke Trophy competition. In early days of the competition, the tournament was run on the Queen's Birthday weekend in June. It was later moved to the last weekend of July. In 2014, however, competitors and officials recognized that this time was poorly suited to the international competition season, resulting in many elite skaters being unavailable to compete in the Duke Trophy. Plans are currently underway to move the date to September from 2016 onwards, placing the competition at the end of the speed skating season. Format of the competition The original format was a competition between 6 senior men and 2 junior men with races ranging from quarter mile, through half mile to 1 mile. Two skaters per State competed in each race, except for the 1 mile in which there were three skaters per state. The Juniors skated quarter and half mile only, then there was also a 2-mile Relay for the seniors. By 1955 a 2-mile race for Seniors was included. The whole program was held over a half hour period on the last night of the Australian Championships. Ladies came later in the early 1960s ‚Äì initially there were only three ‚Äì with a special trophy for the Ladies Relay donated by Teddi Jenkins of Victoria, a previous Victorian and National titleholder. Due to numerous factors, including a marked decline in the number of competitive skaters in some states, Australian Ice Racing officials worked during 2014 and 2015 to amend the rules and format of the competition. The new rules took effect in 2015, with the aim of promoting competition, accessibility and excitement whilst minimizing potential imbalance in team sizes. The current format, hosted across two days, sees skaters in five age categories compete over a range of distances (now measured in metric) from 222m to 3000m. The competition also includes 1500m, 3000m and 5000m relays. Points are awarded to state teams based on the finishing order of each race. The overall points winners are awarded the Duke Trophy, with additional awards given to the individual skaters deemed \\"best and fairest\\" or \\"most improved\\". Rules allow for \\"Vacant Position Skaters\\" to fill the field in the event that any state lack a competitor for a given race - this ruling allows for all races to be run with a full field, as well as providing the VP skaters with competition experience. VP Skaters cannot earn points for their state. Under the new rules, women do not skate in separate divisions; all races are mixed gender. In order to encourage women to participate, female skaters are awarded 125% of normal points for every placing. Awards The eponymous Duke Trophy is awarded to the state team with the highest overall score. In addition to the Duke Trophy itself, a number of other perpetual trophies are awarded in the competition: *The Len Duke Best & Fairest Award. This trophy was originally the 1951 Australian Championship Award won by Len Duke. It was rediscovered and donated back to the competition by the Duke family in the early 2000s to be repurposed as a perpetual award presented to the skater deemed to have achieved the best performance through honourable participation. *The Colin Coates Spirit of the Duke Award. This trophy, donated in 2002 by Australian Olympian Colin Coates, is presented to the skater deemed to have promoted the sport and captured the spirit of the competition. *The Denis Pennington Most Improved Award presented to the competitor displaying the greatest improvement in speed and/or technique. In exceptional circumstances, more than one skater can share this award: In 2015, the Pennington Blades was presented to the entire Victorian state team, having secured their first Duke Trophy win for 30 years. *The Teddi Jenkins Shield is presented to the winning ladies' relay team. From 2015, all races were open to racers of either gender, and the Teddi Jenkins Shield was not awarded. Due to their age and fragile condition, attempts have been made in recent years to limit the transportation of the physical awards. They are therefore kept and maintained in Queensland, and not taken to the winning state between competitions.

Top scores achieve Platinum followed by Gold,http://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/aboutus/latest-news/helping- to-set-the-standard-on-disability/ Silver, Bronze and Participants ranks.  History  The UK benchmark on Disability - later to become the Disability Standard - was first devised and piloted in 2004. Built by the Employers' Forum on Disability on the foundation of the 'Diversity Change Model',What is the Diversity Change Model? - designed by Dr. Gillian ShapiroWho is Dr. Gillian Shapiro? - as a method for measuring an organisations performance on diversity strands, the benchmark assessment enabled an organisation to assess their organisations performance on disability in relation to the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). The original research and development group who took part in this pilot project consisted of: Abbey, BT, BUPA, Barclays, Centrica, Cable & Wireless, HSBC, Royal Mail, PricewaterhouseCoopers and UnumProvident in the private sector and The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Metropolitan Police Service, Jobcentre Plus, Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions in the public sector. Following the success of the initial trail the Disability Standard was officially launched in 2005 with help from secretary of state at the time, Alan Johnson, under the title of Employers' Forum Disability Standard 2005 with 80 UK organisations taking part including the House of Commons. The benchmark survey ran again in 2007 with 116 participants and additions such as an interactive website enabling organisations to browse case studies and submit online. In 2009 - during the recession - 106 organisations participated taking the total number of organisations to have taken part in the Disability Standard since 2005 to over 200.  Results  The findings from the Disability Standard form the base of the Benchmark Report that is published by the Employers' Forum on Disability after each assessment.

Career Doctor and the Medics After Doctor and the Medics Searle left Doctor and the Medics in 1990. He appeared in two different line-ups of the Brit-pop band Boys Wonder, both before and after they were dropped by Sire Records in the late 1980s. A co- founder of the acid jazz band Corduroy in 1991, named by manager, Alex Bienkov, Searle's fast and fluid bass guitar playing style was foremost in the funky punky sound of the new mod outfit. Corduroy was a four-piece band based in south east London, formed with twins Ben and Scott Addison, formerly of Boys Wonder. It was built heavily around the style of a local instrumental jazz band, led by guitarist Simon Nelson-Smith, who completed the Corduroy line-up. The band released three albums on Eddie Piller's Acid Jazz Records: Dad Man Cat, High Havoc and Out of Here. They proved a popular live attraction (Modspeed(2011)} and gained a healthy following in Japan (Modspeed(2011)), making the first of several trips there in 1993. In 1994, they recorded a live album, Quattro ‚Äì Live in Japan. After leaving Acid Jazz Records they signed to Big Cat Records/V2, releasing two further albums, The New You! and the Rob Playford-produced Clik!. Clik! failed to chart and Corduroy was dropped by the label in 1999 after which the band split up. The group reformed in 2018 and released Return of the Fabric Four on Acid Jazz Records. Searle played as a session-man with various bands during the early 2000, including The Freestylers, Soul Hooligan, Chris Difford and Mother Earth. He produced others, including Smashing Time, and recorded with the Australian grunge band The Standing Eight Counts and Lord Large. Lord Large and Dean Parrish's northern soul record, \\"Left Right and Centre\\", written by Paul Weller, features Searle's distinctively flamboyant style. He subsequently appeared on stage at The 100 Club with the 1960s mod legends Sharon Tandy and The Fleur De Lys. Searle published written works in 2010. His first novel, The Absurdist is described as \\"A light-hearted, science-fictional tale about the illusionary nature of reality, lethal cocktails, hairy heroes, unrequited love and wasp hammers. Rude and irreverent, this funny philosophical caper about two young scam-artists caught up in unusual events, features the prettiest of girls, silliest of toys, quantum physics and giant space propellers in an adventure of absurd proportions,\\"{(Modspeed(2010)}. A collection of humorous drawings, Sketchistentialism, which followed in 2011, is described as being 'oddly philosophical and blatantly daft' {(Modspeed(2011)}. And, in 2014, a memoir came about his misadventures in Doctor and The Medics The Memoirs Of Damage & Vom which features a Foreword by The Medics drummer Vom a.k.a. Stephen Ritchie. Wet Dog In 2005, Searle co-formed the band Wet Dog. Wet Dog is an international group featuring Stephen 'Vom' Ritchie from the renowned German rockers Die Toten Hosen. Ritchie played with Searle in Doctor and the Medics. Wet Dog also includes Anna Donarski. \\"Fancy You\\", the first release by Wet Dog, appeared on an Acid Jazz Records compilation called Old School New Cool 2 in 2005. The band's first album Perfect Crime was released through Drumming Monkey Records / Rough Trade in August 2007 in Germany. It has 14 tracks, covering such styles as funk, punk, pop, rock and soul. A single, \\"Heart\\", was released from the album. Wet Dog are members of the mysterious Bohemian Underground Movement (B.U.M.), the umbrella name used by Searle for his various and mischievous pop art projects. The name came from writing BUM in the sand for puerile and mischievous effect. The first B.U.M. track,\\"I'm Afraid of the Man in the Pasty Shop\\", was recorded entirely over the phone from Cornwall and mixed in the B.U.M. studio weeks later. It appears on the Acid Jazz Record compilation, 'The New Testament of Folk. There have been several Bohemian Underground Movement releases, mostly through Acid Jazz Records.

Known primarily for his songwriting, Throckmorton has had more than 1,000 of his songs recorded by various country singers. He has also had minor success as a recording artist, having released two major- label albums: The Last Cheater's Waltz in 1978 on Mercury Records and Southern Train in 1986 on Warner Bros. Records. Throckmorton is a member of the Nashville Songwriters' Hall of Fame, and has been awarded Songwriter of the Year by both Broadcast Music Incorporated and the Nashville Songwriters Association International. Biography Throckmorton was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, although his family soon moved to Wichita Falls, Texas. He moved to San Francisco, California after graduating from college, and first played rock & roll before switching his focus to country music at record producer Pete Drake's suggestion. By 1964, he played bass guitar for Carl Butler and Pearl, and had been signed to a publishing contract; his first hit as a songwriter was \\"How Long Has It Been\\", which was a Top Ten country hit for Bobby Lewis. Throckmorton was later signed to a contract with Sony/Tree Publishing, but was fired after none of his songs became hits. Throckmorton returned to Texas in 1975. However, other songwriters had continued selling his songs, and he was soon re-hired by Tree Publishing. Over 150 of his songs were recorded in only nine months, including Johnny Duncan's first Number One hit, \\"Thinking of a Rendezvous\\". Other artists who had hits with his songs included John Conlee, Dave & Sugar, Merle Haggard, The Oak Ridge Boys, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Throckmorton was also signed to a recording contract with Mercury Records in 1976, although none of the singles from his debut album The Last Cheater's Waltz reached Top 40. He was also named Songwriter of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association International in 1978, 1979 and 1980, as well as Songwriter of the Year by Broadcast Music Incorporated in 1980. Between 1976 and 1980, at least one of his songs appeared on the country charts almost every week, and overall, more than a thousand of his songs were recorded by country artists. Throckmorton's streak of songwriting continued into the 1980s and 1990s, with Mel McDaniel, George Strait and Doug Stone recording his material as well. Throckmorton was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985. Three years later, he signed to a second recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, releasing the album Southern Train but no singles. Throckmorton retired to his ranch in Texas in 1988 to care for his dying father. In 2019 Willie Nelson recorded a version of Ride me back home by Sonny Throckmorton and also named his new album after it.

It separates the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is on the island of Borneo, and the Sulu Islands of the southern Philippines. The boundary is the result of the division of the Sulu Sultanate through the cession of its territories to colonial powers. The British gained control of the northeast shores of Borneo, which became known as North Borneo and subsequently Sabah, while the rest of the Sulu Islands fell under Spanish control and later United States rule. The Philippines still officially claim the eastern part of Sabah as part of its territory, arguing the validity of the cession by the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu. Malaysia and the Philippines are also parties to the multinational claims over the Spratly Islands and both countries have overlapping claims over some islands of the archipelago. The historical connections of the people living on both sides of the border has resulted in the border being extremely porous, with a lot of illegal immigration from Malaysia occurring. The porous border has also resulted in several incidents of cross-border raids and kidnapping by armed groups from Malaysia on Philippine towns and resorts on the east coast of Sabah. The border and disputes The Malaysian‚ÄìPhilippine border consists of two segments. The first segment is the portion that has already been delimited through treaty. The second maritime segment has yet to be delimited because it is in the Spratly Islands area in the South China Sea where the two countries have overlapping claims over the continental shelf and islands. Treaty defined border Three treaties defined the territorial extent of the Philippine archipelago, of which two are relevant in terms of determining the boundary between Malaysia and the Philippines. The third treaty concerns the cession of some islands in the Sulu Sea but does not include any boundary determination clauses. The Treaty of Paris of 1898 between Spain and the United States defined the territorial waters of the Philippines.Article III of the treaty. For full text of treaty, see Yale Law Schools Avalon Project site Only one portion of the boundary delimited by this treaty is relevant to the common border between the two countries. The relevant stretch lies between the Philippine island of Palawan and the northern tip of the Malaysian state of Sabah between turning points 7¬∞ 40' N 116¬∞ 0' E and 7¬∞ 40' N 117¬∞ 0' E. Although the British were not parties to this treaty, it has never challenged the extent of Philippine territorial waters after occupying North Borneo (Sabah today). Malaysia too has not challenged the boundary and had in fact recognised it via its 1979 map which follows this portion of the boundary as the extent of its territorial waters.See 1979 map of Malaysia's territorial waters and continental shelf produced by Malaysia's Land and Survey Department and reproduced by the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the country's response in the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea case concerning the reclamation of lands by Singapore in the Straits of Johor . The second treaty is the Convention regarding the Boundary between the Philippine Archipelago and the State of North Borneo between the United States and the United Kingdom which was signed at Washington, D.C. on 2 January 1930. The treaty subsequently came into force with the Exchange of Notes on 6 July 1932.Convention regarding the Boundary between the Philippine Archipelago and the State of North Borneo, U.N. Treaty Collection (archived from the original on 2011-07-28) The United States was the sovereign ruler of the Philippines at that time after acquiring it from Spain under the 1898 treaty between the US and Spain while the UK was the colonial ruler of North Borneo. The modern states of the Philippines and Malaysia became the successor states of the said treaties. Article I of this treaty establishes the turning points for the defined portion of the maritime border between Malaysia and the Philippines. The convention amended portions of the limits defined by the 1898 treaty to the current alignment of the Malaysia‚ÄìPhilippines border in the Sulu Sea, between point 7¬∞ 40' N 117¬∞ 0' E and 4¬∞ 45' N 120¬∞ 0' E. No common tri-point for Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in the Celebes Sea was established as this treaty did not involve the Netherlands, being the colonial ruler of what is today Indonesia, as a signatory. The three countries have also not negotiated for a common tri-point after their independence. In fact, Indonesia and Malaysia are currently involved in a dispute resulting from overlapping claims of the continental shelf in the Celebes Sea and negotiations to establish the tripoint seem unlikely for the near future. {  - !

Plagued by fog, earthquakes, and flooding, it was eventually abandoned and left to deteriorate in favor of a new light at Table Bluff. History Humboldt Bay is reached through a narrow gap between two long sand spits, and the founding of Eureka, California in 1850 on the shores of the bay led to the provision of a lighthouse for the bay in the first set of eight west coast lights. The design was essentially that of the original Point Loma Light: a central tower with a 1¬Ω story house erected around it. A fourth order Fresnel lens was provided and the light was first exhibited in December 1856. The protracted construction made this the last of the original eight lights to be completed, and in fact some lights in the next set were lit first. The light was situated in a sandy area towards the tip of the northern spit; the intent was for the light to serve both as a marker for the entrance and as a warning for the spit. It was immediately discovered that the low-lying site was vulnerable to the waves, and by 1867 the Lighthouse Board was already making plans to relocate the light to a new site on the south side of the entrance. In the meantime a log breakwater was placed around the light. Fog was a major problem, and a steam fog whistle was installed in 1874. The move was delayed for some decades, and in interim the light experienced numerous injuries from the elements. It was damaged by earthquakes in 1877 and 1882, subsequently leading to substantial bracing and reinforcement. High water in 1885 caused such severe damage that the house was deemed unfit for occupancy, and a temporary shelter was built to house the keeper until a replacement light could be built. The appropriation for the Table Bluff Light finally came through in 1891, and in October of the following year the lens of the Humboldt Harbor Light was moved to the new lighthouse. The lighthouse was officially closed on 31 October 1892 and the buildings were used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a field office during improvements to the harbor mouth, then was left to decay, with the central tower eventually collapsing around 1933. All that is left at the site today are foundation walls (which can be viewed in Samoa Dunes Recreation Area at the end of the north spit), though the cupola of the lantern was eventually recovered from the sand and is displayed at the Humboldt Bay Maritime Museum.

Though the human body can manufacture globular proteins from any protein source, it is much more efficient for the body to make globulins from locally digestible globular proteins. Edestin has the unique ability to stimulate the manufacturing process of antibodies against invasive agents and contains a low aggravatory phosphor content (kidney ailments, etc.). Globular proteins found in edestin (and in Alpha 1 globulins, Alpha 2 globulins, Beta globulins and Gamma globulins) are long peptide-chains, precursors for biological proteins essential for life. Edestin is similar to serum globulin (blood plasma), and the biologically active protein of edestin is metabolized in the human body and capable of biosynthesizing: *hormones (which regulate all the body processes), *haemoglobin (which transports oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide), *enzymes (which catalyze and control biochemical reactions), *antibodies (immunoglobulins which fend off invading bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, as well as toxins or antigens as they enter the body). Edestin can also be broken down to edestan. Hemp seed Commercial hemp seeds (for human consumption) contain an average 30-35% protein, of which 60-80% is edestin (the remainder being albumin).

Her younger sister Katharine Sergeant Angell White was an editor for The New Yorker and wife of E. B. White, author of Charlotte's Web and writer for The New Yorker. Sergeant was also an aunt of Roger Angell, another writer for The New Yorker. She was known to friends and family as Elsie. Sergeant was educated at Miss Winsor's School (now called The Winsor School) in Boston from 1894‚Äì1899 and Bryn Mawr College from 1899‚Äì1903.  Career  In 1910, she wrote her first article, \\"Toilers of the Tenements,\\" which she published in McClure's Magazine under the editorship of Willa Cather, thus beginning a lifelong friendship between the two women. In the same year (1910), she undertook extensive research on \\"Artificial Flower Making in Paris\\" for Mary van Kleeck who published a book on the \\"Artificial Flower Makers\\" for the Russell Sage Foundation. When the New Republic was founded in 1914, she became one of its original contributors. In 1916, she published her first book, French Perspectives, a result of her extensive travels to that country as the New Republic's war correspondent. On October 19, 1918, she was severely injured when her companion picked up a hand grenade that exploded. That experience resulted in her second book, Shadow-Shapes: Journal of a Wounded Woman, 1920. She moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1920, following her doctor's advice. She wrote about the Pueblo Indians and New Mexico itself until the mid-1930s, publishing mostly in the New Republic and the Nation. She spent extensive time in New York City and at the Macdowell Colony. In 1927, she published a collection of profiles about prominent Americans, Fire Under the Andes. Sergeant studied with Carl Jung and Toni Woolf in Zurich from 1929 to 1931. She published her only novel, Short as any Dream, in 1929. In the mid-1930s, John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, hired her to report on Pueblo social conditions and reactions to the Wheeler-Howard Act. Sergeant moved to Piermont in Rockland County, New York. In the 1930s and 1940s, she continued to publish magazine articles. During this period, Sergeant's sister Katharine financially supported her, though the two did not get along and were wary of each other. In 1953, she published the first of her two full-length biographies, Willa Cather: A Memoir. Despite her ill health and failing eyesight, in 1960 she published the well-reviewed Robert Frost: The Trial by Experience.  Death  Sergeant had planned to follow this with an autobiography, but she did not live to complete it. She was staying at the Cosmopolitan Club in New York when she died on January 26, 1965. She was found the next day with the advance for her next book in her pocket. Her wish was to be cremated and have her ashes buried in the Shepley-Sergeant plot in Winchester, Massachusetts. Katharine held a memorial service for her on April 12, 1965 at the Cosmopolitan Club, at which Bryn Mawr College President Katharine McBride introduced the speakers, including Robert Frost's daughter, Leslie Frost Ballantine, and the writer Glenway Wescott.

After making his Test cricket debut in late 2011, he has been in and out of the Australian test team a number of times due to various issues. In the 2019 Ashes series, he returned to the Test team after a 3 and a half year absence.  Personal life  Pattinson's elder brother is Darren Pattinson, who played for England in one Test match. Although born in England, Darren Pattinson grew up in Melbourne's outer suburbs and attended Haileybury (Melbourne). He made his first-class debut for the Victorian Bushrangers and consequently won a contract with Nottinghamshire.  Domestic career  Pattinson played for Dandenong Cricket Club in Victorian Premier Cricket and also played for Australia in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. On 23 December 2009, Pattinson set new best bowling in a List A innings record for Victoria, taking six wickets for the cost of 48 from his 10 overs. Pattinson was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2013 Indian Premier League. However he was ruled out of the tournament without playing in any of the matches due to non cricket related medical conditions. On 2 September 2020, he was included in the Mumbai Indians team for the 2020 Indian Premier League as a replacement for Lasith Malinga who pulled out of the tournament citing personal reasons. Pattinson also eventually made his IPL debut in the 2020 season and became a regular member. International career Pattinson was named in the Australian ODI squad for its tour of Bangladesh in April 2011. He made his ODI debut in the third and final match of the series and took the wicket of Imrul Kayes. Pattinson joined the Australian Test squad for the 2011 tour to Sri Lanka, but did not play a Test. Pattinson made his Test debut in the 2011/12 home series against New Zealand, in the first Test in Brisbane on 1 December 2011. He took 5 wickets for 27 runs in the second innings of his debut Test and helped Australia to a nine-wicket win, then took five wickets in the first innings of the second test, and was named Man of the Series, with fourteen wickets at an average of 14.00 across the two tests. He won another Man of the Match award in his next Test, the 2011 Boxing Day Test against India, with match figures of 6/108 and 55 runs. but he wasn't included in Australia's squad for the 2012 T20 World Cup. Before the 3rd Test against India in March 2013, Australia dropped Pattinson, along with Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson and Usman Khawaja following a breach of discipline. Michael Clarke, the captain, revealed that the extreme step had been taken as a result of repeated infractions which led to Watson flying back home and contemplating Test retirement. Former players reacted with astonishment at the harsh decision taken by the team management. Pattinson later returned to the Australian Test team during the West Indies tour of Australia in December 2015. In his first Test match back, Pattinson achieved his fourth five wicket haul, taking 5/27, which equaled his previous best bowling figures. He also reverted to his old bowling action, which gives him more control and pace that touches close to 150 km/h, but at a risk of re- injuring his back. On 20 April 2017, Pattinson was named in Australia's squad for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. In April 2019, Pattinson was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2019‚Äì20 season. In July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in England. He played in the first Test - his first Test since February 2016 - and also in the third Test.

History  The Pennsylvania Railroad's class A1 was a class of 0-4-0 switcher type steam locomotive. Built from 1886 to 1892, when the A1 was introduced into service, 0-4-0s were being used by other railroads. In time the 0-6-0 came and other railroads neglected the 0-4-0. But, on the Pennsylvania Railroad, this wasn't happening. This is because the PRR had a bunch of tight trackage and street trackage as well. The Pennsylvania Railroad elected to use a small locomotive to operate these tight and confined tracks. By the 1920s the Pennsylvania Railroad class A1 was greatly replaced by the even larger class A5s, the largest 0-4-0s on the Pennsylvania Railroad's roster of 0-4-0s in service at the time. By the 1950s as the diesel switchers became available for easier and more efficient switching duties, the Pennsylvania Railroad started to replace the 0-4-0s and 0-6-0s notably the Pennsylvania Railroad class B6sb switchers with diesel switchers. In 1957, as with all Pennsylvania Railroad steam locomotives still in service, they were completely replaced by the diesel locomotive.

During his studies, in 1893, Reinecke led an extensive study trip through Austria and Hungary. After graduating in 1897, he worked until 1908 at the Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz), and later at the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection (Die Kunstdenkm√§ler von Bayern). Until his death in 1958, he worked on almost all periods of European prehistory and early history, in particular on the chronology of the European Bronze Age and Iron Age. The names Michelsberg culture (1908) and the Altheim culture (1915) as well as the periodization of the Hallstatt culture go back to him. Particularly important are his contributions in Volume V of the \\"Antiquities of our pagan past\\" (Alterth√ºmer unserer heidnischen Vorzeit), where he developed a chronology system, based on an historical analysis of stylistic features and on typological characteristics, that has essentially retained its validity to this day.

He has lectured frequently on Holmes, Dracula, and the Victorian world and has taught a number of courses for UCLA Extension on Sherlock Holmes. He also taught a course on \\"Dracula and His World\\" for UCLA Extension in November 2009. Lawsuit against Conan Doyle Estate Ltd In February 2013, Klinger filed a copyright lawsuit against Conan Doyle Estate Ltd, a UK-based private company, which had demanded a license fee for the use of the Sherlock Holmes characters in a collection of stories In the Company of Sherlock Holmes. In the United States in 2013, only ten of Conan Doyle's sixty original Sherlock Holmes stories were in copyright, and the proposed stories relied only on aspects of the characters defined in public domain stories (such as Holmes's bohemian habits, deductive reasoning and many supporting characters). In December 2013, Judge Rub√©n Castillo ruled that stories published prior to 1923 were in the public domain but that ten stories published after then were still under copyright. The stories in the public domain consist of the four novels and 46 short stories. Judge Castillo rejected a claim by Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. that some aspects of Holmes in the pre-1923 stories were protected by copyright because they were \\"continually developed\\" through the protected ten stories, which will not enter the public domain until 2022. The characters and events in the pre-1923 stories, including Holmes and Watson themselves, are free for use by any author or creator, while elements introduced in the copyrighted stories, such as Watson's rugby background with Blackheath and details of Holmes' retirement, remain protected by copyright law. In June 2014, in an opinion by Judge Richard Posner, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court decision in favor of Klinger, and confirmed the public domain status of the pre-1923 material. In November 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a further appeal by Conan Doyle Estate Ltd, making the Court of Appeals' verdict final.Conan Doyle Estate v. Klinger, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-316 Subsequently, Klinger has consulted in connection with the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. litigation against Miramax regarding the film Mr. Holmes and against Legendary Pictures regarding the film Enola Holmes.

It is one of the region's only academic university-level teaching centers. The hospital is owned by the RWJBarnabas Health System and is the third largest hospital in the system. NBIMC is affiliated with the New Jersey Medical School of Rutgers University and features over 100 residents. It has an adult and pediatric emergency department, but serious trauma is usually handled by the nearby University Hospital. Attached to the medical center is the Children's Hospital of New Jersey, which treats infants and young people up to age 21.  History  The hospital was run under auspices of the Newark Jewish Community and its suburban successors from its inception in 1900-1901 until its purchase by Barnabas Health in 1996. In 2011, the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center was ranked among the top 50 hospitals in the United States for specialty care in cardiology and heart surgery. The following year, it remained highly ranked but was not in the top 50 hospitals nationwide. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is home to one of the nation's ten largest heart transplant centers, according to Becker's Hospital Review. In 2020, the hospital was given an \\"A\\" by the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade.  Services  * Cancer * Heart and vascular care * Men's health * Mental health and behavioral health * Neuroscience * Orthopedics * Pediatrics * Senior health * Transplant services * Weight loss and Bariatric burgery * Wellness * Women's health  Controversies  In 2019, federal regulators announced that Newark Beth Israel Medical Center put patients in \\"immediate jeopardy\\" before the hospital began to implement corrective measures, according to federal regulators. The investigation was begun after reporters from ProPublica found that the hospital's transplant team was failing to learn from surgical errors. According to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, regulators found a series of incidents in which the hospital recognized areas for improvement following botched surgeries, but didn't carry out its own recommendations, leading to mistakes on subsequent operations. Regulators also uncovered stories of hospital staff failing to obtain informed consent and to seek information from patients' and family members' \\"do not resuscitate\\" orders. Weeks later, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. issued a statement about the corrective actions taken by the hospital, saying, \\"Based on my communications with the hospital, I believe the situation is moving in the right direction at this time and I will continue to monitor it.\\" In 2020, the hospital suspended a staff member for distributing unauthorized protective gear after the staff member used GoFundMe to raise money to buy gowns and masks for hospital staff to use in dealing with Coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

The line runs between the West Mount Airy and Hunting Park neighborhoods primarily along Wayne Avenue. Route description SEPTA Route 53 starts at Carpenter's Woods in West Mount Airy. It follows Wayne Avenue east through a residential area, crossing over the Chestnut Hill West Line, shortly before passing Tulpehocken (SEPTA station). The route continues to run fairly closely to the rail line until Chelten Avenue, where the rail line dips to the south. The scenery becomes less residential as the route approaches Wayne Junction. After crossing under the railroad bridge by that station, the line turns south on Clarissa Street, crosses under the Roosevelt Expressway, and runs along the east side of SEPTA's Regional Rail Wayne Junction Yard before crossing West Hunting Park Avenue. At that point, the route continues on 18th Street, Pulaski Avenue, and 17th Street before turning left onto Erie Avenue, which carries SEPTA Route 56, another former street car converted into a bus route. (West-to-northbound buses use Pulaski Road all the way between Erie Avenue and 18th Street, as did the trolleys.) Both routes connect to Erie Station on the Broad Street Subway Line, as well as Germantown Avenue, which carries SEPTA Route 23. While SEPTA Route 56 continues northeast to the Torresdale-Cottman Loop in Tacony, Route 53 takes a left turn on 10th Street, and heads north towards the former Luzerne Depot, which became an all bus garage, and is now a cardboard recycling plant.Luzerne Depot; SIA Philadelphia Car Barn Tour (PhillyTrolley.org) SEPTA PCC car #2605 on route 53 on Wayne Ave. at Upsal, January 31, 1969 A 2016 route change has certain buses continuing to the Hunting Park station on the Broad Street Line, as before, while others continue east along Hunting Park Avenue to G Street. History SEPTA Route 53 was established as the Wayne Avenue Line sometime before 1890, and was expanded in 1904, 1929, and 1930. Route 53 was the first streetcar line in Philadelphia to receive PCC cars. On Sundays Routes 53 and 75 streetcar lines were operated as one route between Mt. Airy and Bridesburg. This consolidated service ended when the Route 75 was converted to trackless trolley operation in 1948. Route 53 was \\"temporarily\\" converted to buses in June 1981 because of a bridge reconstruction project. The conversion was made permanent May 16, 1985, when SEPTA track inspectors discovered misaligned rails on Wayne Avenue forcing buses to replace streetcars forever, and it was actually extended north of the former Luzerne Depot to Hunting Park (BSL station). Today, the northbound route passes Luzerne Street and makes a left turn at Lycoming Street, where it shortly encounters the southbound segment of the route on Old York Road onto which the northbound route makes a right turn, only to turn left at East Hunting Park Avenue, where it reaches Broad Street near the Hunting Park BSL station again. The line heads northeast along Roosevelt Boulevard, then turns on Bristol Street, only to head south on Old York Road again, until it reaches Luzerne Street, and makes another left on its way to the intersection with 10th Street. As of 2008, all buses along this route are ADA-compliant, and contain bicycle racks.

In an attempt to become more environmentally conscious, participants are asked to live \\"off the grid\\" as much as possible on a designated date by unplugging appliances, walking or cycling for transportation, turning out lights and decreasing energy usage in any other ways possible. As the sun sets on the evening of Blackoutsabbath, participants write down a list of ways they can contribute to the earth's well-being throughout the rest of the year. Annual benefit concerts take place to raise awareness of the cause. The organization's official site contains updates about the program and contains links to various tools, green products and services, studies, and groups that promote energy conservation and environmental protection. Steps Following is a list of \\"steps\\" to take to participate in Blackoutsabbath (dates are geared towards the first celebration in 2008): #Log onto the Blackout Sabbath site and check out the proposal and links. #(If possible) donate a fridge magnet which will be exhibited on the site and will then be given away at the awareness concert. These can be mailed to my management or given to me at one of my shows. In turn, they will be passed out to members of the audience at the awareness concert to promote the event. #Go to the unamplified candle lit concert on March 19 featuring me and my family and many others such as Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur, & special guest! at the Angel Orensanz Center. #Make plans for what you will do on the day of Blackout Sabbath (June 21), i.e. what you will cook ahead of time, who you will spend it with, etc. #On June 21 starting at 12 noon, turn off the lights, unplug your fridge, walk or bike everywhere, do as much as you can to \\"live off the grid\\" for the day. But still, even if you just turn off one light, that will be an effort and a contribution. #As darkness descends: light your candle, take out your pencil and pad and write down your list of things that you will do in the next year to contribute to the Earth's well-being. #Put the list on your fridge with a magnet and keep it there for a year. #At midnight, resume your life and try to keep your promises. #This exercise will be repeated the next year, at which point you can review your list and make a NEW one! Benefit concerts 2008 On February 15, Wainwright announced an intimate concert to benefit Blackoutsabbath would take place at Angel Orensanz Foundation in New York City on March 19, 2008. He asked fans to send refrigerator magnets for distribution as part of his initiative, citing \\"we've moved on from brooches to refrigerator magnets\\" (brooches were worn throughout his Release the Stars tour). Magnets could be handed to Wainwright directly after concerts or promotional events, or they could be shipped to his management company for collection and later distribution. Special guests performing at the concert included Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur and friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson. 2009 The second annual Blackoutsabbath concert with Wainwright and friends, took place on March 4, 2009, in City Winery in NYC. Scheduled to perform are Teddy Thompson, Jenni Muldaur, Lucy Wainwright Roche, Sloan Wainwright, and Sean Lennon. Celebrations 2008 On June 16, Wainwright posted a message on his site reminding fans to participate on the first annual Blackoutsabbath ritual, which would take place on June 21, 2008, from noon to midnight around the world. Citing that his \\"message was pretty dry in terms of the comedy section,\\" he attached messages written by his mother, Kate McGarrigle, and boyfriend, Jorn Weisbrodt so that readers could \\"chuckle a bit\\". In her message, McGarrigle encouraged readers to \\"tune out all BlackBerrys, computers, cell phones etc.. turn off all lights and electrical appliances, host a blackoutsabbath, and drop in...preferably outdoors...just like the old celebration of the solstice.\\" While McGarrigle would celebrate the event in Saint-Sauveur, Quebec with \\"like-minded folks\\", Weisbrodt revealed in his message that he and Wainwright would be hosting a celebration in Berlin where fans could attend if they RSVP'd appropriately and could find the designated location. A week following Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright posted messages recapping how he and his friends celebrated the event. He stated the night prior to June 21 involved mostly planning, including food arrangements, how to get his guitar to the apartment (\\"one of the old Communist towers on Karl Marx Allee\\"), and how he would be \\"going down and up five flights of stairs on the hour\\" to bring guests up to their room. On Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright and Weisbrodt unplugged their appliances at noon and spent the day browsing for magnets at museums, napping and preparing for the party. Once guests arrived, candles were lit and in between trips to greet guests Wainwright and Robert Wilson performed Shakespearean sonnets from a project they were collaborating on. Wainwright admitted he \\"felt a bit dorky strumming on the guitar and asking everyone to change their lightbulbs, especially since Germany compared to the US is miles ahead in terms of energy conservation.\\" By midnight, guests had completed their refrigerator lists. In his message, Wainwright encouraged fans to continue the Blackoutsabbath tradition by hosting small parties, sharing their stories on the website and inviting friends with knowledge of conservation (\\"your crazy hippie friend!\\") to moderate discussion and share their awareness with others. Charity events In November 2008, Blackout Sabbath and Global Inheritance partnered with Focus Features to host a charity auction to raise money for the two organizations. The auction winner won an early screening of Gus Van Sant's film, Milk, starring Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. The screening took place at a movie theater local to the winner, who was able to invite up to 50 friends to attend the event. The auction began on November 3 and closed on November 11. 100% of the funds raised was split between the organizations.

It contemplates its speaker's feelings on having left Africa and its culture. The snow flakes sail gently down from the misty eye of the sky and fall lightly lightly on the winter-weary elms. And the branches, winter-striped and nude, slowly with the weight of the weightless snow bow like grief-stricken mourners as white funeral cloth is slowly unrolled over deathless earth. And dead sleep stealthily from the heater rose and closed my eyes with the touch of silk cotton of water falling. Then I dreamed a dream in my dead sleep. But I dreamed not of earth dying and elms a vigil keeping. I dreamed of birds, black birds flying in my inside, nesting and hatching on oil palms bearing suns for fruits and with roots denting the uprooter's spades. And I dreamed the uprooters tired and limp, leaning on my roots ‚Äì their abandoned roots ‚Äì and the oil palms gave them each a sun. But on their palms they balanced the blinding orbs and frowned with schisms on their brows ‚Äì for the suns reached not the brightness of gold! Then I awoke. I awoke to the silently falling snow and bent-backed elms bowing and swaying to the winter wind like white-robed Moslems salaaming at evening prayer, and the earth lying inscrutable like the face of a god in a shrine.

History The order was established by the Sejm on 2 July 1949 for \\"awarding unique achievements in the task of building People's Poland\\". It was designed by Micha≈Ç Bylina and Wojciech Jastrzƒôbski. Unofficially, it replaced Poland's highest pre-war order, the Order of the White Eagle (the Order of the White Eagle was never officially disestablished, but it was not awarded in People's Poland). The order was awarded by the president of Poland until the office was abolished in 1952; from then it was awarded by the Polish Council of State. It had only one class. A person decorated with the order had the title of a Builder of People's Poland (Budowniczy Polski Ludowej). The order was awarded to many leaders of workship, notable party members (including military personnel) and others. The Order was last awarded in 1985. Up to that time, about 310 individuals were awarded the Order, and 10 institutions (ex. Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy) and territorial units (cities and administrative entities - voivodeships, for instance). During the times of the People's Republic, 7 recipients had their orders revoked. It was officially disestablished 2 years after the People's Republic was replaced by the Third Republic Eligibility criteria The order could be awarded to Polish individuals, enterprises, and institutions that performed exceptional deeds in the fields of: * national economy, in particular through inventions, improving work organizations, and work inspiration and efficiency (see udarnik) * education, science, culture and art * national defense * health and sport * public service Description The Order has a golden rosette, 53 mm in diameter.

It is commonly cited in policy debates in the European Union, including by representatives of both labour unions and employers, to connote broadly \\"the conviction that economic progress and social progress are inseparable\\" and that \\"Competitiveness and solidarity have both been taken into account in building a successful Europe for the future'\\". European states do not all use a single social model, but welfare states in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include an acceptance of political responsibility for levels and conditions of employment, social protections for all citizens, social inclusion, and democracy. Examples common among European countries include universal health care, free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The Treaty of the European Community set out several social objectives: \\"promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion.\\" Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.Sapir, Andr√©. 2005. Globalisation and the Reform of European Social Models. Bruegel. http://www.bruegel.org/1425.Barr, N. (2004), Economics of the welfare state. New York: Oxford University Press (USA). The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the post-war boom. Tony Judt lists a number of causes: the abandonment of protectionism, the baby boom, cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with living standards enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy. In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, globalisation, Europeanisation and an ageing population. Welfare state in Europe 400px Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.See article A unique \\"European social model\\" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US. Although each European country has its own singularities, four welfare or social models are identified in Europe:Sapir, A.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9515.2009.00654.x * The Nordic model, in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands * The Continental (Christian democratic) model, in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia * The Anglo- Saxon model, in Ireland and the United Kingdom * The Mediterranean model, in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain Nordic model As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of social insurance. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of \\"citizenship\\". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions. As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in active labour market policies whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the unemployed into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of public employment. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution. The Nordic model is also characterised by a high tax wedge. Continental model The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of \\"security\\" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25). As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in collective agreements. Another important aspect of the Continental model is the disability pensions. Anglo-Saxon model The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its social assistance of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously). Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments. Mediterranean model The Mediterranean model corresponds to southern European countries who developed their welfare state later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions. The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid employment protection legislation and a frequent resort to early retirement policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model. Evaluating the different social models Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in Gini index after transfers and taxes (in percentage change). Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following: # Reduction in poverty. # Protection against labour market risks. # Rewards for labour participation. Reduction in poverty The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the Gini index) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoked by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained. In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line. Protection against labour market risks As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between employment protection legislation and the share of workers receiving unemployment benefits. Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: # Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and severance payments for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing \\"employment\\" protection. # Unemployment benefits which are commonly financed with taxes or mandatory public insurances to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the \\"worker\\" as opposed to \\"employment\\". As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: * The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher \\"employment\\" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. * The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent \\"employment\\" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. * The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. * The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection. Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment. Rewards for labour participation Employment and unemployment rates for each social model Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the employment-to-population ratio as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The Lisbon Strategy initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010. In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target. Conclusion efficiency and equity. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low. Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: # Efficiency, that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest employment rate. # Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk. As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria. Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

Early Life and Career Siemens studied at Berlin and Munich universities, receiving his doctorate in 1918.Prakken, J.R. \\"The Development of Dermatology in the Netherlands.\\" Dermatology in the European Economic Community, British Journal of Derjnatology (1974), pg 232 Siemens was instituted as the first professor of the new dermatology department in 1929 at the University of Leiden. Siemens was the student of J. Jadssohn in Breslau and of von Zumbusch in Munich. At the point of his career, Siemens was well known for his twin studies and work on genetics in dermatology. While a professor at Leiden, Siemens continued researching genetics, but his department worked mainly as a clinic, where he and his team carried out clinical trials. Among those clinical trials were research on the topical \\"right-left-method\\", which involved the application of two different kinds of medicine to either half of the body. Siemens retired in 1964 and was succeeded by his formal pupil, M. K. Polano, who was head of the Dermatology Department at the Municipal Hospital in the Hague. The University of Liepzig chose Siemans for the position of Chairman of Dermatology on the basis of his scientific contributions; however, Siemans was not a member of the NSDAP and his research was not well-liked by the Nazi Party.Weyers, Wolfgang. \\"PART II. The New Leaders of German Dermatology\\", Dermatology and Dermatopathology Under the Swastika, 1995 Siemens' research into hereditary diseases at this time gained criticism within the Nazis for not exploring far enough into the racial aspects of genetics. As a result, the Commission on Higher Education forced the appointment of a different researcher who belonged to the NSDAP, Brodo Spiethoff, and the position was taken away from Siemens.

Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, 2012. While the twin method is generally attributed to Francis Galton's 1875 article \\"The History of Twins, as a Criterion of The Relative Powers of Nature and Nurture\\", Galton did not suggest the comparison between identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins; instead, Galton suggested using twins to test the power of the environment to change the similarity level between identical twins. Galton's article considered environmental factors such as social conditions and education; here, Galton faced objection that these environmental conditions were only a small part of the circumstances that could affect similarity of twins. Curtis Merriman, an assistant professor of Education at the University of Wisconsin, also published a report called \\"Psychological Monographs\\" on the twin method describing the difference between the identical and fraternal twins in 1924; however, Merrimen did not suggest that the difference between identical and fraternal twins could be used to explore hereditary traits and only interpreted his results as evidence for two types of twins. Siemens' work introduced the classical \\"Twin Method\\", which is recognized as highly influential by current Twin Studies experts in genetics. Hermann Werner Siemens was the first researcher to attempt to determine the roles of genetics and environment in the specific case of naevi, which are moles or birthmarks. While Siemens focused on dermatological phenotypes, he also explored psychological features using twin studies. An example of this research was on the academic performance of identical and fraternal twins: His research found that identical twins were more likely to have a similar performance in school than fraternal twins. Siemens wrote in \\"Zwillingspathologie\\" about his findings: > \\"If an illness is regularly dominant, then both of the identical twins > either suffer from it or are free from it.. the nonidentical twins correlate > as the siblings of a two-child family .... With the help of twin pathology, > we found a possible way to judge hereditary influence on the investigated > features .... The assessment is based on the comparison of the findings in > identical and nonidentical twins.\\" His research included reporting on similarities in skin traits in monozygotic twins, including naevi among other dermatological traits. Within Siemens' research, he reported monozygotic twins having a higher concordance in naevus counts compared with siblings. Siemen's research into twin studies was well before the structure of DNA was discovered, and as a result, his work was highly useful in compiling a detailed compilation of dermatological phenotypes for both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Siemens commented about his work in the 1920s, \\"twins of one egg origin will be of immense value for geneticists and psychologists.\\"  Reception in Europe  Not all researchers in the 1920s fully accepted Siemens' work initially. Siemens' research was criticized for proposing that identical twins had to have almost total concordance of a dermatological trait in order for the trait to be hereditary. Siemens argued that his work could be used to assess hereditary influence on features that were only partially determined by genetics rather than environment.  Racial hygiene and Nazi affiliation  Siemens was a major figure in the German racial hygiene movement by the early 1920s; Siemens later supported the Nazis and their racial policies. In 1916, Siemens published a book called Grundzuge Der Vererbungslehre, Rassenhygiene and Bevolkerungspolitik, or \\"Foundations of Genetics, Racial Hygiene and Population Policy\\". His work had a subsequent 12 editions, and the 8th edition included commentary on Hitler's political policies on racial hygiene. After World War II ended, his works were edited to remove his endorsement of Hitler, but not of his advocation of racial hygiene. As a result of Siemens' support for Hitler, some contemporary geneticists have omitted Siemens from the history of twin studies research as a form of revision by omission. Siemens wrote in 1937, > \\"Since the National Socialist seizure of power the political goals that we, > the racial hygienists, are in favor of, have now become a part‚Äîand not the > least important one‚Äîof the German government program. 'Racial hygiene as a > utopian dream' became 'Racial hygiene as political program'. . . .

Its compilation is usually dated to the ninth century. Form The Triads of Ireland cover a vast range of subjects. Triads 1-31 are about monasteries, 32-61 cover geography, and 149-86 law. The rest are a miscellany with no apparent overarching structure. Though they are all called triads, only 214 of the 256 of the triads form groups of threes. There are also three duads, seven tetrads, one nonad and 31 single items relating to monasteries at the start of the collection. The following example is Triad 91: {  style=\\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\\"  :Tr√≠ gena ata messu br√≥n: :gen snechta oc legad, :gen do mn√° frit √≠ar mbith fhir aili l√©, :gen chon fhoilmnich.  style=\\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\\"  :Three smiles that are worse than sorrow: :the smile of the snow as it melts, :the smile of your wife on you after another man has been with her, :the grin of a hound ready to leap at you. } The use of the triad form (arrangement into threes) to encapsulate certain ideas is neither distinctively Irish nor Celtic, but can be widely attested in many societies over the world, in part owing to its usefulness as a mnemonic device. It does appear to be particularly popular in the literatures of Celtic-speaking areas, one notable other example being the later Welsh collection Trioedd Ynys Prydein (\\"Triads of the Isle of Britain\\"). Beyond the particular form there is nothing to suggest a shared literary tradition. The Welsh triads also cover a much more restricted range, as they feature British history and legend almost exclusively, unlike the varied and heterogeneous Irish triads. Although triads can be pointed out in both Irish and (again later) Welsh law texts, they are the rule in neither as other numerical forms are usually preferred. Kuno Meyer proposed that the practice was inspired from the Old Testament, which however, offers very few examples. Fergus Kelly concludes that \\"[t]he case for a special Celtic cult of threeness is unproven, as is the attempt by Meyer and other scholars to establish a biblical origin.\\" Manuscript sources *H 2.16 or Yellow Book of Lecan (YBL), col. 236 ff, p. 414b-418a (TCD, Dublin).

Background and Biography The son and heir of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere and his wife Margaret de Clare, he was born at Hambleton, Rutland.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 7, No. 691 summarises testimonies by 12 individuals at a hearing held on 14 November 1335 as proof of age for Giles de Badlesmere. The evidence given on that occasion includes statements that Giles was born on 18 October 1314 in the manor of Hambleton, Rutland and was christened at the parish church of St Andrew there.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 8, No. 185. Giles' father was executed in April 1322 for having participated in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion against King Edward II of England. After Bartholomew had joined the rebels, his wife and their children were arrested and sent to the Tower of London because she refused to admit the Queen consort Isabella to Leeds Castle which had been granted to Bartholomew. His title and estates were attainted, therefore Giles did not immediately succeed to the barony on his father's death. In November 1328, Giles obtained a reversal of the attainder and succeeded by writ of summons as the 2nd Baron Badlesmere. However, when he died in June 1338, the barony of Badlesmere fell into abeyance as his marriage to Elizabeth Montagu had not produced children. Property Records of numerous inquisitions post mortem that were held in the summer of 1338 demonstrate that Giles' extensive possessions were to be found in London, Kent and 13 other counties as well as Ireland.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 8, No. 185.

His family moved to Morigny, Normandy, and then to the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Gard at an early age started to express his artistic gifts. In 1913, at the age of twelve he drew a self-portrait in charcoal. Two years later he wrote to Louis Metman, the curator of the Museum of Decorative Arts, who took him under his wing and enrolled him in the Acad√©mie Ranson. He found a job as a notarial clerk. At sixteen, he copied old paintings for a play, (the story of an antique dealer and a forger), adapted by Gabriel Signoret whose portrait he later painted. Gard was seventeen when he exhibited for the first time in the (Autumn Gallery) with his portrait of Metman. He received a special award and was proposed as a member. This early success was not repeated and Gard later said ironically: \\"Was my work so bad, or were these gentlemen of the jury carried away by the wine? Who will ever know? In any case, if they made an error on that day, they corrected it afterwards.\\" 1920s and 1930s In 1922, he entered the National School of Art in Paris (headed by Ernest Laurent), but he clashed with his professors and the school's atmosphere: As for his masters, he wanted to recognize only the Old Masters and, especially, those Leonardo da Vinci called \\"the mistress of the masters\\": nature. He caught the eye of Albert Besnard . He failed the Rome Grand Prix, but he received the Chenavard prize. When he left school \\"by the Bonaparte route\\" (that is, by failing), he signed a contract with an art dealer named Ch√©ron who counted among his prot√©ges Chaim Soutine, Tsuguharu Foujita and Kees van Dongen. Louis Metman gave him a small living allowance, which enabled him to go to paint in Toulon, sending back his paintings to Ch√©ron. The Great Depression of 1931 stopped these stays and obliged him to take a job in a workshop restoring paintings. He became the owner of the workshop a few years later. He continued to send his work to the Paris Salon and to exhibit in the Bernheim and Charpentier galleries. It was through his work restoring paintings that he met Sacha Guitry and they became friends. Gard painted portraits of the actress Jeanne Fusier-Gir, of Sacha Guitry and of Sacha's ex-wife, the actress Lana Marconi. 1940s and 1950s In 1946, Gard founded the art review Apollo (not to be confused with the English Apollo magazine), at first writing most of the articles and signing under his own name or a pseudonym. He started a crusade against abstract art and explained his own conception of art, whose only sensible criterion seemed to him to be to imitate nature. This work as writer and art restorer slowed down his painting work and his exhibitions at the Castet gallery, but it did not stop them completely. When Sacha Guitry died in 1957 he lost a friend, an admirer and a significant supporter. 1960s and 1970s In 1960, the French State bought one of his paintings () (\\"Red Roses\\"). From that moment on, as soon as he could escape from his restoration workshop, he ran to take refuge in in the forests of L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise, where he painted subjects as easy to conceive as they are hard to make: pond life, tricks of the light, the wind on leaves and sky, the changing seasons, etc. Three years before his death, he gave the proceeds from his workshop to his son, and wrote to him: \\"I had hoped that in the life of art that I had, I would meet some true art lover: I gave up this idea because I found only speculators or people who wanted vane family portraits. I concluded that your artistic sense is better than that of all these fake collectors.\\" In his workshop on Rue Bourdonnais, where customers became increasingly rare, he continued to write all that he still had to say on art and life. He painted only two more paintings, the last one (), \\"The Red G√©ranium\\" a month before he died, on 12 November 1979, alone and destitute in his studio in the Quai des Grands-Augustins, where his final illness set in.  Paintings  Early career Gard's relatively discreet originality passed almost unnoticed in the thrusting times for art that he lived in. He remained distant from 20th century movements laying claim as the heirs of the impressionists, be it Paul C√©zanne or Vincent van Gogh, and his art was deep and authentically attached to the French painters of the 19th century who had been able to get through the midst of official red tape and reconcile pictorial art with truth, freshness, and nature. In enlisting the great historical or mythological works, Gard goaded the Impressionists: \\"the folly to think something can be achieved without thought, just by representing light and colour\\". 1920s and 1930s Until 1926, when Fauvism, Cubism and Abstract styles came to the fore, Gard stayed away from theory and, it seems, followed Corot's lessons when he installed his easel on street corners in Morigny or √âtampes and practiced with a palette of soft and refined tones. From 1927, putting to use his stays in Toulon studying light and the harmonies of tone, he expressed himself in still life pictures of vigorous forms basked in a vibrant and colourful atmosphere, or in nudes with glowing flesh. He used knife-and- plaster for a vigorous and open touch, sometimes broad, sometimes tight, working with harmonies sometimes harsh, sometimes delicate. This painting style, which seen up close shows a rash and almost confused aspect, offers at a distance an extraordinary force and luminosity. Gard uses pure colour with a dexterity which belongs only to the great colourists, without ever going overboard. He ponders and solves one of the most complex problems of painting: shadows. He said: \\"For the part of a picture in shadow not to cause the death of a painting, by creating an inert zone, it must be luminous. A shadow must give the impression that it can move and not seem to be fixed to a spot: a shadow must express as much life as light.\\" Starting then, a very particular phenomenon of colour appears in his paintings: Aura. Strangely for a time when one saw so many extravagances, the colourful aura in which Gard bathed the subjects of his paintings received skepticism from the critics, who reproached him for what they thought was a pure fantasy; in particular the paintings with sharp contrasts (such as flowers). But it didn't matter: Gard, with his eye ready to seize the narrowest shafts of colour, really saw these auras -- and this is the role of the great painter, to pay attention to a phenomenon that a less sensitive eye does not always see. From 1932 Gard was definitively established in Paris, and although he had never seen Mediterranean light, he continued to explore this field in his still lives, his paintings of flowers and his portraits. 1940s to 1960s The 1940s, when Gard met Sacha Guitry, are marked by several portraits of the famous: Sacha Guitry, Lucien Daudet, Count Doria, Baroness Hottinguer, Georges Renand, and many others. In the 1950s Gard painted a series of still lives and flowers where he tried to fuse together two of his preoccupations in the same work, which, technically, are not easy to reconcile and from which he turns sometimes to one, sometimes to the other, the two tendencies fighting, one yielding to the other in turn: the love of a precise contour, the solidness of things, detail; and then the love of fireworks, of explosions of colour. In the 1960s, he returned to the daily grind, no doubt more out of necessity than by choice. His friend Sudreau, the Secretary of State, gave him a room in the castle of Bonhommes in l'Isle-Adam forest. The castle grounds, with its diverse trees, its ponds and its changing aspects tracking the changing of the seasons, offered to Gard a multitude of subjects. Since he could only make short trips there for a day or two, he chose to make drafts. He tried to seize the effects of light, wind, fog, snow, rain, playing in the trees, the meadows, the water or the sky. The light is expressed in prominent fluid brushstrokes, which do not seek to flatter the layman's eye. For the expert, these landscapes are a collection of erudite and delicious harmonies which sing nature. 1970s At the start of the 1970s, he returned to a series of still lives where he expresses the science of reflections in glass, as well as his science which consists in making one can feel how objects differ. He painted his last portraits. In the (\\"Young Man With Coat\\"), he pays homage to Titian, reaffirming, in the midst of the non- figurative art movement, his ties with the Enlightenement and Impressionist painters.  Writing  1930s and 1940s Gard took notes and wrote comments on art since he was seventeen years old. He gave conferences in Paris in the 1930s. He confessed this was not his gift, so he soon gave it up and started the practice of introducing his exhibition catalogue with a lecture on painting, often a satire against certain movements, the Salons or the art critics. In 1943 and 1944, he wrote five articles for the weekly magazine Panorama: \\"On Still-Life\\", \\"Forms and the plurality of exactness in painting\\", \\"Gauguin's Heritage\\", \\"Backbones won't swallow\\", \\"'G√©r√¥me', or 'the blunder of an era'\\". In 1946 he founded the bi-monthly Apollo, in which he published more than two hundred articles over ten years including \\"The 'Avanced' advance into the void\\", \\"We must discourage fine art\\", \\"The imitation of nature is the only desire in the plastic arts\\", \\"The 'golden number' is in nature\\", \\"Art has deserted France\\", \\"Rules on the harmony of colours and volumes\\", \\"The love of art is a bastion against the robot\\", \\"We must support art education\\", \\"Rules are necessary\\", \\"Against publicity\\", \\"Speculations on the fine arts\\", \\"Nature or nothing\\", \\"Refutation of Cubism\\", \\"The commercial genius\\", and so on. He set forth his position toward non-figurative art, explored its origins (which he considered fallacious), and highlighted the lack of understandable criteria by which to judge which works are valuable which are not. 1970s He continued to write on similar topics for L'Amateur d'Art (\\"The art lover\\") and in the 1970s for the journal Rivarol.  Quotations  *For more than a century the error of painting has been to be cerebral instead of pictoral. *Through history, we sometimes see outstanding geniuses. We give them no complications: genius is simple because it is all it needs to be. *Fashion is the opposite of what one has just finished. The dislike of certain errors leads one sometimes to the opposite errors. *In the arts, momentary practical success is never brought by the assurance of quality but by a tendency to it. One can only sail with the wind if one is in the wind. *Masterpieces do badly in a democracy. It is best that a masterpiece has a shiny face, since the hordes don't look at the back side. *Manet was not in fashion yesterday, and he wouldn't be today: too much daring for his time, not enough for ours. It is just a big picture. *The genius of art is the genius of infinitesimal yet precise values. *In art, it's the little nothings that make masterpieces. If Manet's white were less or more pink, it would not be Manet any more.

The family remained in Romania until his father died from injuries sustained during anti-Semitic riots in Gala≈£i when Bercovici was 11. After his father's death, most of the family emigrated to Paris. Konrad worked there during preparations for the 1900 World's Fair, and his education was influenced by witnessing public debates and recriminations surrounding the Dreyfus Affair. Bercovici went to the Universit√© Populaire where he studied to be an organist. In Paris, he met his wife, the sculptor Naomi Librescu.Paul Avrich, The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States, AK Press, 2005, p. 84 Together, they emigrated to North America. After some time in Montr√©al, Canada, the family settled on the Lower East Side, Manhattan, New York City. To make ends meet Bercovici worked in sweatshops, gave piano lessons, and played the organ for nickelodeons. He had begun his work as a writer as a journalist for a Yiddish paper in Montreal, but garnered attention when his first English-language book Crimes of Charity‚Äîwith an introduction by John Reed‚Äîexposed controversial practices in private charities in New York City. Bercovici continued to write articles as a journalist throughout his career, but became best known for his literary fiction that explored Gypsy themes. Stories like \\"Ghitza,\\" and \\"The Bear Tamer's Daughter\\" established Bercovici as a peer of his contemporaries in the 1920s when he was often included in World's Best Short Fiction collections. Once his career as an author took off, Bercovici frequented the Hotel Algonquin. At this time, he and his wife Naomi became close friends with Paul Robeson and his wife Essie. His success as a writer afforded Bercovici for travels from which he produced well-received examinations of Ethnic immigrants making their homes throughout the United States. In his work Around the world in New York he devotes a chapter, titled \\"Spain\\", to the Spanish corner of the city, called Little Spain. Most often, Bercovici traveled to Europe where he ran in circles with Lost Generation writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. He went on to write works of biography, travel and fiction.Paul Avrich, Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, AK Press, 2006, p. 107 He also wrote articles for Harper's. Bercovici's stories generated interest in Hollywood where he worked as a screenwriter for several years. There, he befriended Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks. Naturalist American writer Theodore Dreiser had copies of his work in his library.Roark Mulligan, 'Theodore Dreiser's Private Library' Bibliography *Crimes of Charity (1917) *Dust of New York (1919) *Ghitza and Other Romances of Gypsy Blood (1921) *Gypsy Blood (1922) London *Murdo (1923) *Love and the Gypsy (1923) London *Around The World In New York (1924) *Iliana: Stories of a Wandering Race (1924) *Costa's Daughter (1924) *Between Earth and Sky (1925) *Best Short Stories of the World (1925) *The Marriage Guest (1925) *On New Shores (1925) *Singing Winds: Stories of Gipsy Life (1926) *The Volga Boatman (1926) *Alexander: A Romantic Biography (1928) *The Story of the Gypsies (1928) *Nights Abroad (1928) *Peasants (1928) *There's Money in Poetry (1928) *Between Earth And Sky (1929) *The Crusades (1929) *The Power of Women (1929) *Steel Against Steel (1929) *Stormy Hearts (1929) *Wine, Women and Song (1929) *Blood and Lava (1930) *Land, an Old Man and His Wife (1930) *For Love of Zaska and Other Stories (1930) *When Faith in Love Returns (1930) *For a Song (1931) *Manhattan Side-Show (1931) *That Royal Lover (1931) *Against the Sky (1932) *The Incredible Balkans (1932) *Main Entrance (1932) *A Romany Chai (1933) London *It's the Gypsy in Me (1941) *The Exodus (1947) *Savage Prodigal (1948) *Gypsies, Their Life, Lore and Legends (1983) Bercovici v. Chaplin The Charlie Chaplin hit The Great Dictator (1940) was the subject of a plagiarism lawsuit (Bercovici v. Chaplin) in 1947 against Chaplin. The case was settled, with Chaplin paying Konrad Bercovici $95,000. In his autobiography, Chaplin insisted that he had been the sole writer of the movie's script. He came to a settlement, though, because of his \\"unpopularity in the States at that moment and being under such court pressure, [he] was terrified, not knowing what to expect next.\\"Chaplin, My Autobiography, 1964 Bercovici was represented in his plagiarism suit by attorney Louis Nizer. In his book My Life in Court Nizer goes into detail about Bercovici v. Chaplin: \\"The claim was that Chaplin had approached Bercovici to produce one of his gypsy stories as a motion picture and in the course of those friendly negotiations Bercovici gave him an outline of \\"The Great Dictator\\" story about a barber who looks like Hitler and is confused with him. Chaplin denied ever having negotiated for the gypsy story and also denied the rest of the claim...One day, upon my continuous inquiry, Bercovici suddenly had a flash of memory. He recalled that he had met Chaplin in a theater in Hollywood and that Chaplin had pointed out a Russian baritone in the audience whom he thought might play the leading role in the gypsy story. Bercovici believed that they spoke to the singer that evening and that he might possibly be a witness.\\" Nizer tracked down Kushnevitz, the Russian baritone at issue: \\"He [Kushnevitz] recalled the incident vividly, for this, as he put it, was one of the great moments in his life - the possibility that he would star in a Chaplin picture. Chaplin had called him down the aisle of the theater and had given him his private telephone number. He pulled out a little black book from his back pocket and he still had the number written in it. He was a perfect witness in view of Chaplin's denial of any interest in Bercovici's gypsy story.\\"Louis Nizer, My Life in Court (Rum and Coca Cola: 1944) pp. 9-10.

Climate and altitude Argentine wine regions are roughly the same distance from the equator as are the premier grape growing regions of France, Italy and California, yet due to its ideal dry climate, diseases that regularly affect vine varieties around the world are rarely found in Argentina.

The country‚Äôs close proximity to the Andes has vineyards being cultivated at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 ft. These perfect elevations ensure that while the air temperature stays cool, grapes receive more solar radiation than those at lower altitudes. The resulting harvest produces grapes with increased water stress, tannin maturity, and higher bud productivity producing larger yields. Varietals Although a number of grape varieties can be found growing in Argentina, the country‚Äôs most successful varietal is Malbec, a grape which has become largely synonymous with Argentine wine. Other grape varieties which perhaps hold the most promise for Argentina's future are Bonarda and Torront√©s. History Argentina's wine route is still relatively new. Although the country‚Äôs wine production dates back to the 16th century, the inclination of growth for consumption was essentially based on volume and not quality, so there was little significance placed on the art of planting vine varieties best suited to each location and its ecosystem. Argentina‚Äôs wine industry was transformed in the 1990s when international investors had the foresight to recognize the value and untapped resource of Argentina's wine producing potential. It has been estimated that over $1.5 billion in new vineyard investment occurred in the following decade, designed to strengthen and improve the industry's production quality.\\"Wine Industry in Argentina Finding Blend for Success\\".

Argentina wine regions have since undergone a radical transformation, and now rival the production quality of European wine-producing countries.

Renowned architects are translating brand identity into built structures, and now numerous iconic wineries dot the landscape of Argentina‚Äôs wine regions. Many of these wineries feature tourist accommodations, restaurants, wine tasting & food matching seminars, pruning & harvesting tours, and other wine-related experiences. Wine industry associations and various universities have been encouraging this process by launching well-funded studies to analyze the future of enotourism, by mapping out wine routes, and by offering specialized training courses for wine industry personnel.

Design and development The Phoebus was designed at a time when glider manufacturers were moving away from all-wood aircraft towards composite structures. B√∂lkow had been among the early leaders of this change with their Ph√∂nix T sailplane in the late 1950s, which used balsa/glassfibre sandwich construction. The Phoebus was built in the same way. It is a shoulder wing competition sailplane. The first aircraft, the Phoebus A, was designed to Standard Class rules, with a span of 15 m. Its straight tapered wings have an aspect ratio of 17.1; airbrakes are fitted at 70% chord. The fin and rudder are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with a high aspect ratio all moving T tail. The fuselage is a monocoque with the cockpit, ahead of the wings, enclosed with a one piece canopy. The Phoebus A has a monowheel plus tail bumper undercarriage, but in the later \\"B\\" variants the main wheel is retractable. The Phoebus C has a braking parachute. Operational history The Phoebus prototype was placed 3rd in the Standard Class at the German national gliding championships of 1964 and 8th at the World Gliding Championships held in the United Kingdom the following year.

Based on the Venetian Lagoon, it extended into most of Venetia, or the Terraferma territory of the Venetian Republic, suppressed 51 years earlier in the French Revolutionary Wars. After declaring independence from the Habsburg Austrian Empire, the republic later joined the Kingdom of Sardinia in an attempt, led by the latter, to unite northern Italy against foreign (mainly Austrian but also French) domination. But the First Italian War of Independence ended in the defeat of Sardinia, and Austrian forces reconquered the Republic of San Marco on 28 August 1849 following a long siege. History Background After existing as an independent maritime republic for 1,101 years and a leading naval power in the Mediterranean for most of that time, the Republic of Venice surrendered to Napoleon during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797 and was ceded to the Austrian Empire (as the kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia) by the Treaty of Campo Formio a few months later. This was confirmed by the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Austrian rule, after realising that mutually-agreeable home rule would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favouring Trieste as the imperial seaport.. Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken 45 million Austrian lire more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg r√©gime to grant credit to Venetian entrepreneurs. By the end of the 1840s, a collection of intellectuals, urban manufacturers, bankers, merchants and agrarian inhabitants of the terra ferma were clamouring for political change and greater economic opportunity, albeit only by non-violent means. Across Italy, discomfort with foreign domination and with absolute monarchy had led to all Italian states (apart from Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia) becoming parliamentary monarchies with much of the reform led by Pope Pius IX. Heavy-handed policing in response to an economic boycott of state monopolies in Austrian-held Milan led to the popular expulsion of the Austrian garrison in the city for five days in March 1848. Shortly after, the news of revolt in Vienna spreading to Venice lead the city to revolt against the Austrian rule, with the beginnings of Venetian independence. Insurrection and independence Daniele Manin proclaims the Republic of San Marco. Lithograph, dated ca. 1850 A few days after the independence of Milan and Venice and their affiliation to the Kingdom of Piedmont‚ÄìSardinia, the Piedmontese army crossed into Lombardy on 24 March 1848, with the Austrian commander, Field Marshal Radetzky pulling back to the Quadrilatero, a chain of defensive fortresses between Milan and Venice. Two days previously, Daniele Manin entered the Venetian Arsenal with \\"a number of public-spirited Venetians\\", in a direct challenge to Austrian rule. As the Arsenalotti detested the Austrian overseers and the Italians in Austrian military service were pro-Venetian, Manin and his supporters moved about at will, unharmed. Believing that the timing was favourable, Manin led his followers out of the compound with the cry Viva San Marco! ()‚Äîthe motto of the defunct Republic of Venice. Venetians, if not Austrian officials, accepted this to mean restoration of the old republic. With the exception of Verona, garrisoned as part of the Quadrilatero, the cities of Venetia ‚Äî in particular Belluno, Padua, Rovigo, Treviso, Udine and Vicenza‚Äîimmediately sided with the lagoon and rejected Austrian rule, proclaiming Manin president of the Republic of San Marco and investing him with dictatorial powers during the state of emergency. Manin's leadership was supported by the middle classes, revealing a permanent change in power from the mercantile patricians of the old republic, and his support of the lower classes, combined with promises of law and order to the bourgeoisie, meant his leadership was popular. Unfortunately, however, Manin did not have the leadership qualities that might have led to enduring independence. Maintaining independence King Charles Albert of Sardinia had occupied Milan and other Austrian territories with his army. But despite popular support in the Papal States, Tuscany, and the Two Sicilies for the Sardinian campaign, he chose to seek plebiscites in the occupied territories, rather than pursuing the retreating Austrians. Despite enthusiastic support for Sardinia by the revolutionaries (the Republic of San Marco and Giuseppe Mazzini's Milanese volunteers), the Austrians started to regain ground. But the Austrian government was distracted by the Vienna Uprising, the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and other Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. So Radetzky was instructed to seek a truce, an order he ignored. While Austria was pressed on every front, the Italians allowed her time to regroup and to reconquer Venice and the other troubled areas of the empire one by one. Militarily, misreadings of the fluctuating political status in northern Italy‚Äîcombined with Manin's indecision and ill-health, which confined him to bed at critical momentsCunsolo, Ronald/ Daniele Manin (1804‚Äì1857), Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848. Last accessed 23 November 2008‚Äîled to several damaging poor judgements by Venice. The Austrian fleet was stationed in the formerly-Venetian port of Pola, in Istria. Despite Venice having much sympathy there, they made no effort to seize the fleet. Similarly, had the Venetians encouraged the desertion of Lombard-Venetian soldiers from the Austrian army, such trained and disciplined troops might have bolstered the Venetian army. The Venetian revolutionaries also failed to incorporate the terra ferma (the Venetian mainland) into the lagoon-based republic effectively. While revolutionary reform generated some popular support for the new r√©gime, the revolutionaries recruited few troops there. Mainlanders were mistrustful of Venetian power, probably as a result of old assumptions about the earlier Mariner Republic. This combined with destructive foraging and other damage, which might have been avoided had the revolutionaries recruited across terra ferma. While most of the middle and upper classes still supported the fight for independence, the lower classes of terra ferma were largely indifferent. The Venetian and Lombard troops of Radetzky's army remained mostly loyal and actively fought for Austria.The Italians who stayed loyal to the Habsburgs, Gilberto Oneto, 8 December 2010 Mainland recruits could have combined with the 2,000 Papal guards and Neapolitan soldiers under General Pepe, who ignored orders to retreat in favor of supporting the infant republics. But when Austrians under Nugent marched on Verona, and General Durando led a Piedmontese force to defend, Venice could only supply a few volunteers, later joined by Colonel Ferrari's Papal regulars. This was of no avail, as Nugent's force met up with Radetzky's forces and took Verona easily. The church of San Geremia in Venice hit by the Austrian bombardment of 1849. Meanwhile, Manin retreated from his republican fervor, for fear of offending Charles Albert; this move was, however, both transparent and ineffectual. He also relied on reinforcement by Piedmontese and Papal troops, not understanding that Piedmont would not welcome a powerful republican neighbour when monarchies were under threat across Europe, or that Pope Pius IX could not continue to support war between two Catholic monarchs practically on his border. After the Italian rout at the Battle of Custoza on 29 July, Charles Albert abandoned Milan. When Radetzky offered its citizens free passage from the city, half the population left. Venetian lire from the revolutionary republic On 4 July 1848, the Venetian assembly voted 127‚Äì6 to approve Manin's proposal of subsumption into the Kingdom of Sardinia. This lasted only a month, as on 9 August Charles Albert signed an armistice that restored the Piedmontese border at the Ticino River. At the same time, the Piedmontese navy abandoned its support of Venice. In early October, followers of Giuseppe Mazzini tried to organize a great republican demonstration, hoping to gain aid from the French Second Republic, convert the city into a centre of Italian liberation, and inspire Garibaldi into an anti-Austrian crusade. But Manin, to avoid offending Charles Albert, suppressed them. A \\"federal congress\\" was to meet in Turin on 12 October 1848, and Prime Minister Vincenzo Gioberti of Piedmont invited Venice to send delegates, but the Venetians declined. The revolutionary authorities' reaction to Piedmont's declaration of war on Austria illustrated their failure to grasp realities ‚Äî the Venetian assembly recessed for two weeks. Return to Austrian control The 1887 bronze equestrian monument to Victor Emmanuel II in Venice, modelled by Ettore Ferrari (1848‚Äì1929), stands on the Riva degli Schiavoni. The details shows Venice in chains after the defeat in the 1848‚Äì49 Revolution. At her side, the Lion of Saint Mark in chains. The crushing defeat of Italian forces at the Battle of Novara (23 March 1849) sounded a death knell for Italian independence from the Austrians. To avoid an occupation of Piedmont, Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son Victor Emmanuel II, whose treaty with Austria required the complete removal of the Sardinian navy from Venetian waters. Manin addressed the Venetian assembly on 2 April 1849 and they voted to continue their struggle against the Austrians, despite an Austrian blockade of the city. On 4 May 1849, Radetzky started his attack on the Venetian fort of Marghera, held by 2500 troops under the Neapolitan command of Girolamo Ulloa. Bombardment of the lagoon and city started at the same time and, over the next three weeks alone, were dispatched towards Venice. The fort at Marghera held out until 26 May, when Ulloa ordered its evacuation; an offer of surrender from Radetzky was rejected at this time. By August, with famine and cholera sweeping the city, Manin proposed that the assembly vote for surrender, threatening to resign if the assembly votes to fight to the last. The assembly, however, agreed, and provided the president with authority to seek terms, which were agreed on 22 August. Radetzky's entrance to Venice on 27 August marked the complete surrender of Venice to the Austrian Empire, restoring the status quo ante bellum and causing Manin to flee Italy, with his family and 39 fellow-revolutionaries, into exile. Manin's wife died of cholera within hours of their departure for Paris.

The tool is used to bore a hole underground between two points without disturbing the surface ground. This open air chamber is referred to as the bore hole and is used to either run ducting for product or the raw product itself between the two points. Uses The tool is used in the installation of all public utilities electricity, gas, phone, and cable television; these are referred to as product. It is also used to install residential lawn irrigation systems and auxiliary home power lines. The tool is utilized in instances when it is difficult or cost prohibitive to plow or trench the product into the ground. Some of these instances are under driveways, roads, sidewalks, and landscaping. Pneumatic piercing tools are a lower-cost alternative to directional boring. How it works The tool uses air to pound its way through the ground underneath the obstruction. The tools is cylindrical in shape and ranges from one to eight inches in diameter and between three and six feet long. It is made from metal. Different manufacturers have different front styles and control mechanisms. Some have bullet shaped front and others have a stepped front similar to a unibit. Compressed air is used to power the tool, this air is run through a hydraulic hose with an oiler attachment to send oil through with the compressed air. The tool works in a way very similar to a jack hammer, inside the cylinder is a piston a valve opens and the air blows into the chamber forcing the piston forward which in turn propels the tool forward. The valve then shuts and the piston is pushed at a slower speed back in the tool, the valve reopens the piston pounds again and the tools moves forward. This process is continually repeated until the bore has run the intended distance. Both the lighter reverse hit of the piston and the friction of the ground surrounding the tool keep it moving forward instead of stopping. The speed of the tool can be controlled by a valve that connects the tools hose to the air supply this valve is outside the tool and remains accessible to the operator. As the tool pounds through the ground it compresses the soil. This compaction maintains the same diameter as the tool and leaves the bore hole through which the product is passed. Performing a bore The purpose of the bore is to get from point A to point B under the obstruction. First the operator surveys the area and the obstacle (road, sidewalk, driveway). Utility locates must be present for any underground work, the path most clear of utilities is chosen to send the tool through. The first hole is now dug on one side of the obstacle. This hole must be large enough to fit the tool and the operator in it so they can aim the tool. The hole also must be deep enough that as the tool compacts the ground the surface remains undisturbed. The depth of the starting bore pit depends on the type on soil that is being worked in and how well it compacts. The operator aims the tool to the desired exit point and allows it to perform its function creating a bore hole under the ground without disturbing the surface. The tool is tracked by the operator who feels the tool pounding and can approximate the tools location under the ground. The operator also monitors the surface to make sure that it is undisturbed. As the tool nears the exit point it is slowed down and an exit pit is dug to locate both the tool and the bore. As the tool enters the exit pit the operator chooses to either dig up the tool to retrieve it or reverses the tool back into the first bore pit to retrieve it. Now between the two pits is a completed bore under the obstacle which can be used to run the product. Drawbacks Pneumatic bore tools do have drawbacks which can cause difficulties completing the bore. First the distance of the bore the tool can create is limited by the length of the hose that supplies the tool with air. Also the tool is not steerable. Once it has exited the bore pit, the operator no longer has control over it. The tool can be deflected by rocks and soil density to a path the operator had not intended. If this deflection is in the direction of the surface, the tool can cause damage to the obstacle being bored under. If it is downward, the tool can dive to an unrecoverable depth. If it is deflected side to side the tool could also run into other utilities. These hazards make it important for the operator to maintain close observation of the tool. The type of ground the tool is working in can also lead to problems. If the soil is too loose, the tool cannot compact the soil, stalling it out or leaving no bore hole. If the soil is rocky the tool may be deflected or fail to pound forward due to its inability to break the rock. These drawbacks can be overcome by directional boring or straight line horizontal underground boring machines that use either wet (slick boring, slurry boring) or dry (auger boring, jack and bore) methods.

He served as Leader of the National Party and Leader of the Opposition between 2018 and 2020, and has been the Member of Parliament for Tauranga since the . A self-described \\"compassionate conservative\\", Bridges served in several Cabinet portfolios, including those of Minister of Transport (2014‚Äì2017) and Minister of Economic Development (2016‚Äì2017). He took the role of Leader of the House from May to October 2017. Bridges was elected as National Party leader on 27 February 2018, succeeding former Prime Minister Bill English, who resigned. He became the first person with MƒÅori ancestry to serve as leader of a major party in New Zealand. On 22 May 2020, following poor polling for the party, Bridges was challenged for the party leadership and replaced by Todd Muller, who would go onto relinquish leadership of the party less than two months later.https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/421189/national-party-leadership- collins-kaye-bridges-still-in-the-running Early life Simon Bridges was born in October 1976 in Auckland, the youngest of six children. His father of MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) descent was a Baptist minister and his mother of PƒÅkehƒÅ descent from Waihi was a primary school teacher. His father Heath's mother, Naku Joseph, was a member of NgƒÅti Kinohaku, a hap≈´ (subtribe) of the NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribe, and associated with Oparure Marae near Te Kuiti, through which Bridges has family connections to former Labour Cabinet Minister Koro Wƒìtere. This source misspelt NgƒÅti Kinohaku as Ngati Kanohaku. Bridges grew up in Te Atat≈´, West Auckland, and attended Rutherford College. There, he was taught by future Labour Education Minister Chris Carter, and became head boy of the college. He went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts in political science and history, and a Bachelor of Laws (Hons) at the University of Auckland. Legal career Bridges began his legal career as a litigation lawyer in a major Auckland law firm, Kensington Swan. He moved to Tauranga in 2001 to take up a position as a Crown prosecutor in the District and High Courts. During this time, he took leave to travel to the United Kingdom to study at the London School of Economics, and later to complete a postgraduate law degree at St Catherine's College, Oxford; he also worked as an intern in the British House of Commons. As a Crown prosecutor in Tauranga, Bridges mainly worked on jury trials.National Party biography: Simon Bridges . Retrieved 20 November 2008. Bridges ended his legal career in 2008, when he was nominated by the National Party to stand for election to the New Zealand Parliament. Early political career Bridges became a member of the Young Nationals in 1992 at the age of 16 and was elected Deputy New Zealand Chair in 1997. He was active in National's West Auckland organisation as a member of MP Brian Neeson's electorate team. Bridges supported Neeson against a challenge by John Key for the National Party candidacy to contest the new seat of Helensville at the 2002 general election. In the following years, Bridges held several senior positions within the party, including sitting on the party's rules committee and serving as chairperson of the Tauranga National Party branch. Member of Parliament Election to Parliament: 2008‚Äì2011 In 2008 the incumbent National MP for Tauranga Bob Clarkson announced his intention not to stand for re-election. Bridges then announced his candidacy for the party's selection to stand in the electorate, and he resigned from his roles within the party. In June 2008 Bridges was selected as the party's candidate for the Tauranga electorate. He was placed at No. 51 on National's party list. Several opinion polls during the campaign suggested Bridges was likely to win the seat by a large margin. Bridges won the seat with a majority of 11,742 votes, against a field of 11 candidates, including New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. As New Zealand First did not meet the 5% party vote threshold nationally, it was reliant on at least one candidate winning an electorate seat to be represented in Parliament, and Winston Peters' Tauranga candidacy had been its best chance that year. Bridges sponsored a Private Member's Bill to increase penalties for animal cruelty, which was drawn from the ballot in early 2010. After passing its first reading, the Animal Welfare Amendment Bill was adopted by the Minister of Agriculture David Carter as a Government Bill and was passed into law. Minister: 2012‚Äì2017 Bridges speaking to Bryce Edwards at a 2011 election event Bridges was re-elected in the . In April 2012, Prime Minister John Key appointed Bridges as a Minister outside Cabinet, as Minister for Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister of Transport, and Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues. In January 2013 Bridges moved into the Cabinet and became Minister of Labour and Minister of Energy and Resources. He continued to be Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues. He was no longer Minister of Consumer Affairs and Associate Minister of Transport. Bridges made regular appearances on TVNZ's Breakfast programme as part of the \\"Young Guns\\" feature, in which he appeared alongside Labour MP Jacinda Ardern. In April 2013 Bridges voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand. In October 2013, during a TV interview on Campbell Live, Bridges and presenter John Campbell became engaged in a heated discussion about the benefits and risks of offshore oil drilling. In April 2014, environmental activist group Greenpeace launched a campaign calling for Bridges to be removed as Energy and Resources Minister over an allegation he approved potential oil and gas exploration in Victoria Forest Park, West Coast, but later said he was unaware of having given the approval. Opponents perceived that Bridges had wrongly approved the exploration in a sensitive area, however this was denied by Bridges and Prime Minister John Key. Bridges, as Transport Minister, opens a cycle route in Palmerston North A by-election was held in the Northland electorate on 28 March 2015. On 9 March, the National party candidate Mark Osborne announced with Bridges (then Minister of Transport) that National pledged to upgrade 10 one lane bridges in the region at a cost of up to $69 million. Opponents criticised the government for using its advantage inappropriately in the Northland by-election campaign, especially since it was later revealed that Bridges had asked officials for information on the 10 one lane bridges days before the announcement. However, Prime Minister John Key defended the request on the grounds that Bridges had sought factual information rather than policy advice, which is permitted under the Cabinet Manual rules. Following the resignation of Prime Minister John Key on 5 December 2016, Bridges announced his candidacy for the Deputy Leadership of the National Party and consequent Deputy Prime Ministership. He withdrew from the election process when it became clear Paula Bennett had the numbers to win. New Prime Minister Bill English made changes to the Cabinet effective 20 December 2016, and Bridges became Minister for Economic Development, Minister for Communications, and Associate Minister of Finance. He retained his role as Minister of Transport and was no longer Minister of Energy and Resources, and Associate Minister of Justice, and Climate Change Issues. Opposition: 2017‚Äìpresent Simon Bridges was re-elected in the . Following the defeat of the National government, Bridges was no longer a minister, but was appointed Shadow Leader of the House, and National spokesperson for the portfolios for both Economic and Regional Development, and Immigration. In February 2018, Bill English resigned as the leader of the National Party, paving way for a leadership contest. In a press conference held the day after English's resignation, Bridges announced his candidacy for the leadership of the party. On 27 February 2018, he was elected as National Party leader, thus also becoming Leader of the Opposition. He is the first person with MƒÅori ancestry to serve as leader of the National Party. Bridges announced his Shadow Cabinet appointments on 11 March 2018. Paula Bennett serves as his deputy. =MP expenses saga= On 13 August 2018 Newshub reported that Bridges had spent $113,000 in taxpayer money on limousines and hotels between April and June 2018. (His expenses were higher than normal because he was travelling around New Zealand on a 'getting to know Simon' road-show.) Information on Bridges' spending emerged as a result of a leak of MPs' expenses. In response, the National Party demanded an independent inquiry into the source of the leak. Bridges publicly stated that he was \\"supremely confident\\" that his MPs were not behind the leak. On 15 August, Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard launched an independent inquiry into who had leaked information about Bridges' expenses. On 24 August 2018 RNZ reported that a person claiming to be the National Party leaker had sent separate anonymous text messages to Bridges and to Speaker of the House Mallard calling for the inquiry into the leaking of Bridges' expenses to be called off. The author of the text alleged that they had suffered from mental health problems and claimed that the publicity would endanger their health and life. In response, Mallard subsequently called off the inquiry, prompting criticism from both Bridges and Shadow leader of the House Gerry Brownlee, who demanded that the investigation into the identity of the leaker continue. Bridges claimed that the New Zealand Police were reportedly aware of the leaker's identity. At a press conference on 15 October 2018 Bridges implied that National MP Jami-Lee Ross had leaked his (Bridges') expenses. Bridges cited a PwC report which strongly suggested that Ross had been the leaker, based on text messages sent to a Radio New Zealand reporter, the Speaker of the House, and a police officer in the Botany electorate during the leak. Bridges also rejected claims made by Ross in a series of tweets alleging that Bridges had been trying to pin the blame on him for questioning his leadership decisions. Bridges also indicated that National would seek disciplinary action against Ross. On 16 October 2018, Ross alleged that Bridges had violated election law several times, including accepting an illegal NZ$100,000 donation in May 2018, which Ross claimed that Bridges had told him to cover up. The donation came from a businessman, Yikun Zhang, connected to the Communist Party of China. In addition, Ross alleged that Bridges and Deputy Leader Paula Bennett had tried to smear him with allegations that he had sexually harassed several women. Bridges publicly denied Ross' allegations as baseless and said it was a matter for the police. That same day, the National Party caucus voted to expel Ross for disloyalty. Ross announced his intention to stay in parliament as an independent MP. On 29 January 2020, the Serious Fraud Office filed criminal charges against four people in relation to an alleged NZ$100,000 donation paid into a National Party electorate bank account. Bridges stated neither he nor anyone from National Party are among those who have been charged in relation to the donation allegations. The Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation in 12 March 2019, after police referred on a complaint made by Ross. =2020 COVID-19 pandemic= On 24 March, it was reported that Simon Bridges would lead a cross-party select committee that would scrutinise the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. The cross-party Epidemic Response Committee would run in the absence of the New Zealand Parliament, which would adjourn for five weeks on 25 March. Two thirds of members will be from the opposition National and ACT parties while the rest will come from the governing Labour-New Zealand First-Greens coalition government. On 6 April, Bridges drew media attention when he admitted that despite the advice against long road trips during the pandemic lockdown, he was commuting back and forward between Tauranga and Wellington to chair the committee, even though its proceedings were being conducted by video-conference. He said that he had not considered basing his family in Wellington, as Jacinda Ardern had done, and that his actions were \\"absolutely an appropriate way of doing things.\\" Later that day he also said that his internet was unreliable, and that he needed to be close to the Press Gallery and other media. The next day, he downplayed the issue of his internet connection after it was reported that his home has fibre and ultra-fast broadband. He also said that the \\"resources and focus\\" available from his physical presence in Wellington were of use, and that it was not practicable for him to relocate there completely. Bridges' actions were defended by both the left-wing blogger Martyn \\"Bomber\\" Bradbury and right-wing blogger David Farrar, who compared him favourably to Health Minister David Clark's lapses during the lockdown. On 16 April, Simon Bridges called upon the New Zealand Government to lift the level 4 lockdown the following week to help struggling businesses that were affected by the lockdown. Bridges' disagreement with the decision to extend the lockdown was poorly received, prompting Deputy Leader Paula Bennett to issue a statement claiming that Bridges had the support of National's caucus. On 23 April, a man was charged in court for threatening to kill Bridges and his family in a Facebook post. =2020 New Zealand National Party leadership challenge= On 18 May, a Newshub Reid Research public opinion poll was released, which recorded Bridges' preferred Prime Minister rating at 4.5% and voting intention for National at 30.6%, in contrast to Prime Minister Ardern and Labour's high approval rating. In response to Bridges' low approval rating, National MPs Todd Muller and Nikki Kaye mounted a challenge for the leadership and deputy leadership of the National Party. An emergency caucus meeting was held on 22 May to determine the party's leadership, resulting in him losing his position as leader of the National Party and Leader of the Opposition. =Todd Muller Shadow Cabinet= On 2 July 2020, Bridges was allocated the foreign affairs portfolio in Todd Muller's shadow cabinet and was moved up to the number 17 spot on the National Party list. Personal life Bridges met his future wife Natalie, a British-born public relations consultant, while she was studying at the University of Oxford. The couple have two sons, born in 2012 and 2014, and a daughter, born in 2017. The family live in Matua, Tauranga. As of 2008 he attended Holy Trinity Tauranga, an Anglican church. Bridges has a personal superannuation scheme, like 241 other New Zealanders (mainly MPs). Bridges' sister, Rachel Trimble, married National MP Simon O'Connor in December 2016.

On the formation of the Reichsbahn the engines were given the running numbers 99 081 to 99 093. The first seven locomotives from 1889 were given the railway numbers XI to XVII. Further deliveries followed in 1891 (XVIII - XX) and 1899 (XXI and XII). In 1907 and 1910 there was a follow-on order for two, largely identical engines. These were given numbers XXVIII and XXIX. The latte was designated as Class Pts 3/3 N in accordance with the Bavarian numbering scheme following the 1909 take over of the Palatine railways by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. All engines delivered up to 1907 were also given a name. Locomotive no. XX Laumersheim went missing during the First World War. All the others were taken over by the Reichsbahn. The first locomotives were retired in 1930/31; the remainder between 1948 and 1957. In 1939, number 99 081 went to the Wangerooge Island Railway and was retired there on 12 August 1952. The last locomotive still in service was 99 093 which was finally withdrawn on 10 August 1957.  Design  Because the lines ran on or alongside roads it was decided to design the locomotives as tramway or 'box' locomotives (Kastenlokomotive). They had a fully glazed, box body and the drive was covered to reduce the risk to passers-by or horses. In order to enable the engine driver to see the line there was a sliding side window. The driver himself stood to one side next to the boiler. The water tank was integrated into the rivetted plate frame. The filling points were on the front wall the left and right of the smokebox. Coal was stored behind the outer firebox on the footplate. As a result, the engines could only be laboriously coaled using baskets. The saturated steam drive was on the outside and had slide valves. The cylinders were set horizontally and drove the third coupled axle. The running gear was supported at three points. Th first and second coupled axle were supported on common carrying springs and the third on a transverse leaf spring. The boiler barrel was rivetted and comprised two sections. The steam dome sat on top of the second section. Initially a Hardy vacuum brake was installed; this was later replaced by a Westinghouse compressed-air brake. The sander was hand-operated and sanded the second and third axles. The engines also had a Latowski steam-operated bell and, later, a steam turbo generator was fitted over the smokebox door outside the locomotive body to provide electric lighting.

The show was a production of Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited for Universal Television. Premise Unlike most of Mark VII's other productions, Mobile One was not based on the real-life exploits of a police force or any other governmental agency. The show was set instead in a local television station's electronic news gathering operation, which at the time was a very new technology. Jackie Cooper starred as on- screen reporter Peter Campbell; Julie Gregg played Maggie Spencer, Campbell's producer; and Mark Wheeler played camera operator Doug McKnight. Much of the show was spent covering Campbell and McKnight's travels to the scenes of crimes, accidents, and other newsworthy events in a mobile unit car, thereby resembling Mark VII's Emergency!

Team FREDNET is an international Open Source and Open Participation competitor in the Google Lunar X PRIZE competition. Uniquely, the team also allows organizations and individuals to participate freely in its mission through the team's website. Their strategy is to utilize the same approach for developing open source software in order to build a lunar lander and a lunar rovers capable of winning the Google Lunar X Prize. Team FREDNET plans to establish an Open Space Foundation that provides incentives, education, and funding to future individuals and organizations seeking to develop their own space projects. In addition, they hope to foster greater public interest and education in Space Exploration and Research. Organization Overview  Key People  Team FREDNET is led by Fred J. Bourgeois, III. Dr. Sean Casey of the Universities Space Research Association manages business development for Team FREDNET. Mike Barrucco is the principal guidance, navigation, and control engineer for the team. Richard Core is Team FREDNET's project manager.

Essentially, the goal is to build a catalog of Space Components in order to make Space Commercialization more open, cost-effective, productive, and accessible. =Open Source Development Team= Organizing this far-flung group posed perhaps the biggest and earliest challenge. Open source software teams can normally download a program and add their own contributions, but Team FREDNET had to translate its many individual ideas into rocket engines and rover gears. To address this challenge, Team FREDNET took major steps in August and September 2009 to make it easier for globally distributed collaboration to occur by providing guidelines for people who wanted to make contributions. =Open Source Development Software Tools= Team FREDNET relies heavily on Open Source Software Tools to accomplish their mission. * The team uses MediaWiki software from the Wikimedia Foundation for organizing its development efforts. * Launchpad is used for certain bug tracking and configuration management utilities. * Blender is the animation software the team uses for showing a simulation of the mission. Missions and Objectives Team FREDNET tf(x) Lunar Rover Rendering. Mission Architecture Team FREDNET plans to use a simple architecture in their bid to win the Google Lunar X PRIZE, consisting of a small lander that will deploy a small lunar rover which in turn will use the lander as a communication relay back to Earth. There are three main components to the Team FREDNET mission which include (a) the transfer mission (i.e. getting the rover from the Earth to the Moon), (b) the Moon mission (i.e. directing the rover to accomplish the tasks needed to win the Google Lunar X-Prize), and (c) the Earth mission (i.e. receiving the data that the rover must transmit to Earth to win the Google Lunar X PRIZE). =The Transfer Mission= * The Launcher cost is proportional to mass. An applicable approximation is 31,000 $/kg. The launcher will put this mass to LEO orbit (8600 m/s of Delta_V for about 200 km LEO) with a solid propellant stage having a 260-second specific impulse. * The Lunar Bus will do a number of maneuvers (elliptic transfer orbits) in order to gain 4400 m/s of Delta_V for the transfer orbit to the Moon. The Lunar Bus will use bi-propellant with a specific impulse of 320 s. Note that in some contexts we regard the Launcher and Bus as one component, the vehicle system transporting the Lander and Rover. =The Moon Mission= * The Lunar Lander is being designed to do a descent maneuver in order to gain 2200 m/s of Delta_V to transfer orbit to the Moon. The Lunar Bus will use a bi-propellant with a specific impulse of 320 s. * The Lunar Rover plan is to travel 500 meters from the Lunar Lander then send prize-specified Mooncast, videos, pictures, emails, etc. =The Earth Mission= * A Ground Support System is planned to be able to receive the weak signal from the Moon in order to receive the rover Mooncast. Education Programs The team wants to offer educational institutions an opportunity to add science projects fitting inside the parameters of the mission to promote awareness of commercial space travel and space exploration. As part of this education effort, the team has contributed towards a team that created a LEGO Mindstorms based rover that is controlled by Bluetooth technology. A future elementary school level competition will be used to name the Rover that the team will eventually send to the moon.

High school White began his football career at Point Loma High School in San Diego, CA, where he was the starting quarterback for a powerhouse team that included gifted wide-receiver Brett Callan, as well as future NFL stars J. J. Stokes and La'Roi Glover. The team was coached throughout White's four years by local legend Bennie Edens. College career After high school, White attended Penn State, hoping to play for hall-of-fame coach Joe Paterno, but he never saw significant playing time. After one season, he transferred to the University of Arizona, where he spent a redshirt year before winning the starting quarterback role in 1993. That season, with White at the helm, the Wildcats rolled to a 10-2 record and broke a 15-year drought to tie for their first (and, to date, only) share of the Pac-10 championship. The Wildcats wrapped up the season in the Fiesta Bowl, where White threw for 2 touchdowns en route to a 29-0 drubbing of 10th-ranked Miami, still the only shutout in Fiesta Bowl history. White would continue as starting quarterback until 1995, finishing with 40 touchdown passes for his career and, perhaps more importantly, an unbeaten 3-0 record against the Wildcats' arch-rival ASU Sun Devils, throwing 7 touchdowns and only one interception in those three games. A 2008 editorial in the Arizona Daily Star ranked him as one of the Wildcats' 10 best quarterbacks of all time. Pro career After college, White was not taken in the NFL draft, but signed with the Houston Oilers as a free agent immediately following the draft. He was subsequently traded to the Atlanta Falcons before finishing his pro career in the Arena Football League, where he played for the Tampa Bay Storm during the 1997 season. Quotes White's inconsistent play inspired this memorable quote by ABC announcer Mark Jones: \\"Against USC, he looked like Dan Marino.

Plot A group of Sioux come to shelter in Canada from the Indian wars in the United States following Custer's last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. They are given permission to remain by the Canadian government represented by three Mounties. Caucasian Indian-fighters from Montana searching for 40 stolen horses discover the Sioux settlement and mistakenly assume their horses are theirs. In the white men's surprise attack they murder many Indians, steal many horses, and kidnap an integrated white young woman recognized as having been kidnapped in a raid years earlier. The Mounties promise justice, track, capture, and begin the week-long ride to a trial at court. During the week tables turn back and forth, backstories shared, some discussion about American gun culture and violence, and the woman is killed. Eventually the Caucasian Americans are lured to what may be their lost horses but a stampede erupts and the Sioux manage drive the white men over the cliff like buffalos to their death. Without a shot fired and the deal maintained the Sioux remain in Canada while the Mounties return to their fort where the senior will finally retire.

The \\"S\\" letter (for Sun) with the motto Nec pluribus impar. Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, 1694. Nec pluribus impar (literally: \\"Not unequal to many\\") is a Latin motto adopted by Louis XIV of France from 1658. It was often inscribed together with the symbol of the \\"Sun King\\": a head within rays of sunlight. Meaning While the motto relates to the allegory of the \\"Sun King\\", its precise meaning is obscure. Philip F. Riley calls it \\"almost untranslatable\\". Historian Henri Martin called it \\"very pompous and, above all, obscure and perplexing\\". Louvois, Louis' War Secretary, interpreted it as seul contre tous ‚Äî \\"alone against all\\"; lexicographer Pierre Larousse suggested au-dessus de tous (comme le soleil) ‚Äî \\"above all (like the sun)\\". John Martin says \\"[Louis'] matchless splendour was expressed by the motto Nec Pluribus Impar - not unequal to many suns.\\". Yves-Marie Berc√© gives Suffisant (seul) a tant de choses (\\"Sufficient (alone) for so many things\\") or Tout lui est possible (\\"Everything is possible for him\\"), i.e., \\"not unequal to many [tasks]\\". Louis himself wrote: ; quoted in Berger. Origin and use The first use of the motto and symbol is usually given as the great Carrousel of 1662, in what is now the Place du Carrousel, to celebrate the birth of his son Louis, the Dauphin. However, the motto appeared as early as 1658 on a medal. Voltaire attributes the motto and emblem to Louis Douvrier, who derived them from a device of Philip II of Spain, of whom it was said the sun never set on his dominions. Polemicists in the Spanish Netherlands pointed out the unoriginal nature of the symbol. Louis XIV himself was not enamoured of them, but they proved popular with the public and so he tolerated them. The motto and sun-king device appeared on many buildings, as well as on cannons. The classical de Valli√®re guns in particular bear the motto and the symbol, even for those founded long after Louis XIV's death. Many of Louis' subordinates adopted emblems and mottos playing off those of the sovereign. C√©sar de Beaufort, Admiral of France, adopted a moon with motto Elle ob√©it au soleil et commande aux flots (\\"It obeys the sun and commands the waves\\"); Duc de Sully adopted a burning-mirror with motto Je br√ªle sous son regard (\\"I burn [under its gaze / at his command])\\". It is the motto of Rib√©t Academy, a private preparatory school in Los Angeles, the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment of the 6th light armored brigade of the French Army and Muir College a public, English medium school for boys located in Uitenhage, South Africa.

It was in operation from 1856 to 1957. History It was launched on January 1, 1856, by Ephraim B. McCrum and William M. Allison, with equipment purchased from the defunct Altoona Register. Two years later, H. C. Dern acquired Allison's share of the company, and in 1875, Hugh Pitcairn replaced McCrum. Dern and Pitcairn started publishing daily issues in 1873. These were discontinued after two years, but resumed in 1878. The Tribune occupied its own three-story building at 1110 12th Street, with the press room in the basement, circulation and advertising on the first floor, the editorial department on the second floor and the composing room on the third floor. Adam J. Greer was one of the first editors, and was followed by William H. Schwartz. Schwartz had been associated with local newspaper work for more than thirty years, and achieved widespread recognition for his editorials. Mr. Dern died in 1905, but his family retained his interest in the paper. Hugh Pitcairn became the president, and the Tribune remained in control of Pitcairn and the Dern family until 1912, when Col. Henry W. Shoemaker assumed ownership and merged it with two other papers, the Altoona Gazette and the Altoona Times. Front page of the Altoona Tribune, April 5, 1860 Under the Pitcairn-Dern ownership, the Tribune maintained a wide circulation (42,000 in 1899), and appeared each morning. Its political stance was 'independent Republican', and it described itself as 'progressive'. The new owner, Shoemaker, wrote a weekly column in which he covered regional folklore and history and called for conservation and neighborhood beautification efforts. Shoemaker died in 1957, and the paper was closed shortly after, with its last edition published on December 31, 1957. The Tribune was inducted into the Blair County Chamber of Commerce Business Hall of Fame on October 15, 2012.

Life and career Gluck was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Lillian Mary Veronica Friar (Campbell-Phillips) and Harry Fitzer Gluck, a musician. He spent his childhood in New York's East Side and also lived in his mother's hometown of Newcastle, England for a short while. At 17, he joined the US Navy Air Arm. After the war, he attended different universities before graduating in Archaeology and Middle East Studies from UC Berkeley in 1949. He attended the Asia Institute School for Asian Studies, where he completed a two-year MA degree. He described his religion as a \\"Jew by temper; Buddhist [by] inclination\\". Gluck was the first to stage performances, art exhibits related to Japan and Asia and stage conferences for Asian problems such as the nationalization of Iranian oil and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Gluck was responsible for the republishing of the 19 volumes of The Survey of Persian Art after the original printing plates were destroyed in London in the Second World War. In 1963, edited and published \\"Ukiyo: Stories of the \\"Floating World\\" of Postwar Japan\\", translation of then contemporary Japanese short stories, including one otherwise unpublished piece by Yukio Mishima; and 1992 saw the re-publication of the mammoth one volume 1,340-page\\" Japan Inside Out\\" guide to Japan, originally published in 1964 in five volumes. Invited to Iran in 1966 by his former professor and mentor Arthur Upham Pope, Jay moved his family to Shiraz from Japan to take up the post of Acting Director of the Asia Institute of the Pahlavi University. \\"n independent research center of publication and study.\\" Gluck oversaw the restoration of the Narenjestan, the beautiful compound of the Ghavam ol-Molk Shirazi, where the Asia Institute was to be housed. In 1970, Gluck returned with his family to Japan, but maintained a residence in Tehran until his departure forced upon him by changes in the Iranian political climate of 1979 and pending threats of revolution. 1996 saw the publication of \\"Surveyors of Persian Art: A Documentary Biography of Arthur Upham Pope & Phyllis Ackerman\\" edited by Jay Gluck, No√´l Siver and Sumi Hiramoto Gluck, the culmination of 30+ years of work in memory of his lifelong mentor and friend. In 1980, the first Kitano International Festival was held under the stewardship of Jay and his wife Sumi Hiramoto Gluck. The Festival held at the Kitano Jinja (Shrine) became renowned in the local community for bringing together people of all nationalities living in Kobe and for its generous contribution of proceeds to various international charities of the day. Jay was the first non-Japanese to receive Kobe City's \\"International\\" and \\"Hyogo Prefecture's 'Order of the Crane'\\" - their highest civilian awards. Jay Gluck described himself to Contemporary Authors as a \\"dilettante of the type one laughingly refers to today as an Asian expert.\\" He commuted quarterly between Iran and Japan from 1963‚Äì78, and said that he regrets not recording his impressions of the Iranian milieu just prior to the revolution in 1978: \\"It is a writer's rent for the space and air he takes up to see life more critically and record this, regardless of the immediate cost it threatens to-- but usually does not--demand. Failure to do so costs more later and these payments never cease. The Zen adage that he who knows is silent and he who speaks out knows not is now seen to be but a sad commentary, and not the instructions for evidencing wisdom the young accolyte smugly took them for.\\" Gluck died on December 19, 2000 in California as a result of Parkinson's disease. His wife Sumi lived in their house in Claremont, California until her death on November 19, 2005. Their grandson is actor Griffin Gluck.

Background Fisherman was bred and raced by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, a member of the prominent horse-racing Whitney family. He was out of the mare Crawfish and sired by Whitney's Phalanx, the winner of the 1947 Belmont Stakes voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Fisherman was trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Sylvester Veitch. Racing career Sent to the racetrack at age two, Fisherman won a number of races for his age group including the important Champagne Stakes. Despite Fisherman's performances in 1953, in the balloting for American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt he finished behind Hasty Road in one major poll and Porterhouse in the other two. In 1954, under regular jockey Hedley Woodhouse, three-year-old Fisherman won the Gotham Stakes. In the U.S. Triple Crown series he finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby and did not run in the Preakness Stakes. But, in the ensuing Belmont Stakes he ran second to High Gun. From there, Fisherman went on to win two very important races. First, he won the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course then, following the withdrawal of an injured High Gun, C. V. Whitney was invited to run Fisherman in the November Washington, D.C. International Stakes. In the mile and a half weight-for-age race on the grass at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, he was up against older horses and some of the best from Europe including Queen Elizabeth's colt Landau and the betting favorite, the French filly, Banassa. Ridden by Eddie Arcaro, Fisherman remained within striking distance of the pacesetter before taking the lead and holding off a charge in the homestretch by Banassa to win the race. In 1955, Fishermen continued to win New York races, capturing the Excelsior Handicap and earning a second in the John B. Campbell Handicap. Encouraged by the performance on grass by Fisherman and another of his top runners, the three-year-old Career Boy, C. V. Whitney decided to send the two horses to compete in the 1956 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France. Fisherman finished off the board with Career Boy taking fourth behind winner, Ribot, one of the best horses in European racing history. Stud record Fisherman was retired to stud but met with limited success as a breeding stallion. References * TIME magazine article on Fisherman winning the 1954 Washington, D.C.

The album was released on 3 December 2008 by Minos EMI and is his first new album since 2006. The album features 10 songs primarily composed by Dimitris Kontopoulos. The title track of the album, Irthes, was written as a dedication to Rouvas' newborn baby girl. The main sponsors of the album are Trident, and once again Vodafone Greece. In April, the album was repackaged to include Rouvas' 2009 Eurovision Song Contest entry \\"This Is Our Night\\", along with the two other songs he sang at the Greek national final, which are included in English and in Greek. The album was subsequently renamed This Is Our Night. The album was ranked as the fourth best Greek album of 2009 by Ethnos. Conception Background and recording Irthes marks Rouvas' 12th studio album in his career and first new album in two years. Rouvas began working on the album in the summer 2008, collaborating mainly with Dimitris Kontopoulos. The title track of the album was written for Rouvas' daughter. It is expected that the album will be repackaged in Spring 2009 with Rouvas' Eurovision songs. The album is mainly composed by Dimitris Kontopoulos, with Sanny X making a contribution to one song. Lyricists on the album include Giannis Rentoumis, Giannis Doxas, Nikos Gritsis, Thanos Papanikolaou, Vicky Gerothodorou, and Pigi Konstantinou. Track listing Original release This Is Our Night (2009) Singles \\"+ Se Thelo\\" :The lead single of the album titled \\"+ Se Thelo\\" (Kai Se Thelo; And I want you) was released in July 2008 as a digital download. It is a dance song composed by Dimitris Kontopoulos and was first presented live by Rouvas on 17 June 2008 at the MAD Video Music Awards 2008. The performance featured complex choreography and lighting, as well as an overall Japanese inspired theme on the background video screen and with the dancers' costumes. Footage from the performance was later used for the official video clip of the song. After its digital release, the song became a dance hit and has reached number one on the Greek airplay charts as well as the Greek iTunes chart for many weeks. \\"Irthes\\" :The second single, and title track of the album, is the ballad \\"Irthes\\", not to be confused with the same named electropop track of the previous album Iparhi Agapi Edo. \\"Irthes\\" was released to radio stations on 20 November 2008, and has music by Dimitris Kontopoulos with lyrics by Yiannis Doxas. The song became a moderate hit, peaking at number 18 on the Greek Airplay Chart, however, it is one of Rouvas' lower charting songs. The first music video, directed by Kostas Kapetanidis, premiered two days later and features Rouvas singing in front of a microphone in the studio. A second, more sophisticated music video was released shortly after, directed by La Boo, portraying Rouvas on a dark rural road running away from a woman who is slowly approaching him in a car. The driver shifts into high gear to run him over, although Rouvas super-physically performs a backward flip while propelling himself off the car in midair, thus landing securely behind the car feet-first and fully intact. The driver then turns around and once again chases Rouvas. \\"This Is Our Night\\" :The third single from the album and the first released after the re-release is Rouvas' Eurovision Song Contest 2009 entry \\"This Is Our Night\\". The song peaked at number one on the Greek Airplay Chart and Greek/International Airplay Chart and for three and two consecutive weeks, respectively; it remained in the top 10 of the former for 10 weeks. \\"Ksehna To Prin Kai To Meta\\" :The final single from the album is \\"Ksehna To Prin Kai To Meta\\".

Sakis Rouvas was the host of the Greek \\"The X Factor\\". On 28 November 2008 episode, Rouvas performed the title track \\"Irthes\\" live on the show. He also performed \\"Vimata\\" and \\"Hamogela\\" in subsequent episodes. On 4 December 2008, Sakis Rouvas premiered his winter season shows with the Maggira Sisters at STARZ where he performed songs off of the album. The show was a commercial success and extended to late February. A special presentation of the show was held on Love Radio called \\"Sakis Live in Love\\". Rouvas was also Greece's Eurovision participant for 2009. Reception Critical response As with Rouvas' last studio album Iparhi Agapi Edo, Irthes received generally favorable reviews, although the general consensus was that it was not one of Rouvas' biggest efforts. The album earned Rouvas a number of awards and nominations, including wins at the MAD Video Music Awards for \\"Male Artist of the Year\\" and \\"Artist of the Year\\" in 2009, and the \\"Singer of the Year\\" at the Status Men of the Year Awards in 2010. Commercial performance Irthes debuted on week 50 of IFPI's Greek Albums Chart at number five, only coming behind Michalis Hatzigiannis' 7, Alkistis Protopsalti's Ki Eimaste Akoma Zondani, Antonis Remos' Alithies & Psemata, and Eleftheria Arvanitaki's Kai Ta Matia Kai I Kardia, where it also remained for a second week. The album moved up to number two in its third week on the chart, behind Anna Vissi's album Apagorevmeno. In its fourth week, the album dropped to number 15, where it remained for its fifth week as well, however, it moved back up to number 6 in its sixth week. It was certified gold after its fourteenth week, denoting shipments of 15 thousand copies, and as of the week 11/2009 charts, it has charted for 15 weeks. From March 2009 to October 2010, IFPI Greece closed operations, making it impossible to track the album's sales through its database after that point. In 2009, IFPI lowered its thresholds to 12 thousand for platinum status, meaning Irthes would have automatically been converted to platinum status as its previous certified shipments had surpassed that amount, although any further sales are unknown. The album placed at number twenty-four on IFPI's Year-end chart for Top 50 Greek albums of 2008, and number twenty-nine on the Top 50 Greek and Foreign Albums of 2008.

He was the temporal, if not the spiritual, head of Terryglass, succeeding Finn mac maic Ch√©lechair Ui Cheinn√©idig, who died in 1152. It seems that √Åed himself had no successor and was the last coarb, as Terryglass was burned down in 1164 and was then dissolved by reforms later in the century. √Åed was a friend of Finn mac Guss√°in Ua Gorm√°in, bishop of Kildare and abbot of Newry, who sometimes collaborated with him.O'Sullivan, William, 'Notes on the scripts and make-up of the Book of Leinster', in Celtica 7 (1966) pp. 1-31Kelleher, Margaret, and Philip O'Leary (eds.)

Ogma: essays in Celtic studies in honour of Pr√≥ins√©as N√≠ Chath√°in (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002) pp. 105-111 According to a note in the Book of Leinster \\"√Åed Ua Crimthainn wrote the book and collected it from many books\\". It is a literary compendium of stories, poetry, and history, and it appears from annals included in it that it was written between 1151 and 1201, although largely completed by the 1160s. The last entry in the manuscript in √Åed's hand which can be dated appears to belong to the year 1166. Gerald of Wales saw the book when he accompanied his cousin Strongbow on his invasion of Ireland and said of its illuminations that they were \\"the work of Angels\\".The Irish Sagas at macdonnellofleinster.org √Åed was probably the court historian of Diarmait Mac Murchada. In the Book of Leinster he was apparently the first scholar to create the concept of the , the \\"king of Ireland with opposition\\", later more widely adopted. This described Diarmait's ambitions and the achievements of his great-grandfather Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥. √Åed's description of the period between the death of M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill and the rise of Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥ was misread by Conall Macgeoghegan when he compiled the so-called Annals of Clonmacnoise in the 17th century, leading to the inclusion of poet Cu√°n Ua Lothch√°in and abbot Corcr√°n Cl√©rech in some old lists of High Kings of Ireland. at pp. 869-870.

Life and career Woolard, like Christopher Wallace, is from Brooklyn, specifically L.G., Lafayette Gardens. In real life he raps under the name \\"Gravy\\". He is featured in the song \\"Untouchable\\" by Tupac Shakur on the Pac's Life album. He had to add over 50 pounds to his already chubby frame to play The Notorious B.I.G. in the film Notorious. Woolard was previously known for being shot near radio station Hot 97 in 2006 and giving an interview on the Funkmaster Flex show directly afterwards. His music was later banned from play at the station as a result of a policy that bans \\"music by any artist who is involved in an altercation at the station.\\" Recently, Woolard has been considering getting back into the film industry after taking time off to spend with his daughter. Sources say he has been linked with the newly formed Diamantaire Management Inc., who also has unreleased Alex \\"Chae\\" Muniz, Marc Anthony's son, as a signed client. On June 7, 2016, Woolard was arrested in Snellville, Georgia on charges of battery. In 2016, he starred in the movie Barbershop: The Next Cut as Marquese. Woolard reprised his role as The Notorious B.I.G. in All Eyez on Me, a biopic about Tupac Shakur, which was released in June 2017.

The park was opened by the London County Council in 1893, on land given by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. It is listed Grade II on the register of parks and gardens of special historic interest maintained by English Heritage. The park runs north of the River Thames from All Saints church along a broad tree-lined avenue and an embankment path along the river, and ends at Bishop's Park Road. It contains tennis courts and bowling greens, with another small park area fronting Fulham Palace Road. It is adjacent to Fulham Palace and Fulham Football club. A memorial to members of the International Brigade who volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War has been located within the park since 1997. The park has a poolside beach and facilities for basketball, tennis, table tennis, lawn bowling and skating, and hosts a farmers' market. History The park was formally opened by Sir John Hutton, chairman of the LCC, in 1893. It included land known as Bishop's Walk, Bishop's Meadow and West Meadow, formerly owned by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as Lords of the Manor of Fulham which had been given to the Fulham District Board of Works on condition that it be laid out and maintained for public recreation. The meadows had already been protected from flooding by the creation of an embankment; the river wall was built between 1889-93 by Joseph Mears, the father of Chelsea F.C. founders Joseph and Gus Mears. In 1894 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners sold Fulham Vestry the house of Pryors Bank (then called Vine Cottage) and its gardens. The house was demolished in 1897 and replaced by a Pseudo-Tudo refreshment pavilion, but the gardens were preserved and opened as an extension of Bishops Park in 1900 after extension of the river walk. They contain four 1940s sculptures titled Adoration, Protection, Grief and Leda, presented in 1953 by sculptor James Wedgwood as a commemoration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. A further sculpture, Affection, a mother and child by Joseph Hermon Cawthra, was added in 1963; both sculptors had studios in the area. The park was expanded again in 1903. Scenes from the 1976 horror film The Omen were shot on location in the park. After a successful lottery funding bid in February 2011, the park underwent a major restoration project with almost the entire site being altered and modernised.

A man calling himself Marlow kidnaps Jonathan Chester, the young son of wealthy industrialist Anthony Chester, and locks him in a rented house. He then goes to see the boy's father and announces that he will only reveal his whereabouts once he has been paid ¬£50,000 (a large sum at the time) and is safely in Brazil. The boy's nanny alerts the police and Inspector Parnell arrives to discourage Chester from paying up lest it send out a signal to give in to blackmailers. Marlow then reveals that a bomb is in the house where Jonathan is kept and will go off at 10 a.m. the next day. This is too much for Chester who attacks Marlow, causing the crook serious injuries from which he later dies, leaving the police with little time or indication as to where to find Jonathan.

It began on 29 November 2008 at the Rukatunturi ski jumping hill in Kuusamo, Finland, and finished on 22 March 2009 at Planica, Slovenia. The overall winner of the 2008/09 World Cup was Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria, who won 13 of the 27 individual competitions, breaking Janne Ahonen's single-season record of 12 wins in a season. Schlierenzauer's 20 podiums in a single season is also a new record. Early leader Simon Ammann of Switzerland finished second in the overall standings, while Four Hills champion Wolfgang Loitzl of Austria finished third. Harri Olli of Finland finished fourth in the overall standings after a late-season run that gave him the first three World Cup wins of his career. Russia's Dimitry Vassiliev rounded out the top five, while defending champion Thomas Morgenstern of Austria finished in a, by his standards, disappointing 7th place overall, failing to win a single individual competition this season. The Nations Cup, which is determined by adding all points gained by the participants of a country, in both individual and team competitions, was won overwhelmingly by Austria with 7331 points, more than three thousand points ahead of second-placed Finland (4270 points). Lower competitive circuits this season included the Continental Cup and Grand Prix.

It also forbade the exchange between people of biological weapons and established the prison sentence for committing the crimes mentioned in the Act; a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Act extends to anyone within the United Kingdom, or British citizens abroad, however the citizen must be within the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man or any of the British colonies to be arrested for the offense. It also gives Customs and Excise officers the power to seize biological weapons coming in or out of the United Kingdom, or British citizens in other countries transporting biological weaponry for deportation to the UK. A fourth section says that anyone may be charged (as with other crimes) with aiding and abetting or conspiring to transport biological weapons. The Act extends to the entire United Kingdom.

Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969), is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the doctrine of licensee estoppel and holding that public interest considerations require that licensees be free to challenge the validity of possibly spurious patents under which they are licensed.. This entailed the overruling of Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc. (holding that licensee estoppel is the general rule). and prior cases that it had reaffirmed.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court recognized that a conflict existed between the demands of contract law, which ‚Äúforbids a purchaser to repudiate his promises simply because he later becomes dissatisfied with the bargain,\\" and federal policy, which ‚Äúrequires that all ideas in general circulation be dedicated to the common good unless they are protected by a valid patent.‚Äù Past efforts at compromise to reconcile these competing interests led to ‚Äúa chaos of conflicting case law.‚Äù The Court found guidance in a 19th-century decision stating that ‚Äú[i]t is as important to the public that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents as that the patentee of a really valuable invention should be protected in his monopoly.‚Äù. It concluded that the equities of the licensor under contract law were outbalanced by ‚Äúthe important public interest in permitting full and free competition in the use of ideas which are in reality a part of the public domain.‚Äù It explained: > Licensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive > to challenge the patentability of an inventor's discovery. If they are > muzzled, the public may continually be required to pay tribute to would-be > monopolists without need or justification. Based on ‚Äúthe strong federal policy favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain,‚Äù the Court therefore held that the licensee Lear must be permitted not to pay patent royalties to Adkins if it could prove that the patent for a gyroscope was invalid.

Accident competed at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 17 September 2009. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Region 1 by Shout! Factory in 2012.  Plot  In the opening scene, a man is killed in what appears to be an accident. However, it is revealed that the man was actually murdered, with the supposed accident actually orchestrated by a group of killers led by the Brain (Louis Koo). The group specialises in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle (Stanley Fung), one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards. The team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary. During one run, Uncle smokes a cigarette and begins to show signs of Alzheimer's disease, forgetting that he made a vow to stop smoking. However, the rain falls on time, and the team decides to go forth with their plan. Uncle forgets to play his part in the murder, but the murder is successfully executed nonetheless. Unexpectedly, after the murder, a bus loses control and almost runs over the Brain. The Brain manages to get out of the bus's path, but the bus then runs over Fatty (Lam Suet), another member of the team, killing him on the scene. The Brain takes Fatty's belongings, with Fatty asking the Brain whether it really was an accident before he dies. The Brain then returns home to find police officers investigating his flat, which was broken into. The Brain becomes paranoid and is convinced that everything was a setup. He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent (Richie Jen) over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent. One day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman (Michelle Ye) picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pick-up. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money. After he leaves, as he is walking on the sidewalk, the client (the son) falls from the roof of the same building and is dead. The Brain develops further suspicion of the insurance agent, who he can see talking on the phone and later hear him talking about the client on the phone in his flat. In a later date, the Brain receives a call from Uncle for help. However, the Brain is too late and finds Uncle severely injured, apparently dropping two stories from a building near the crime scene in the opening scene. The Brain decides to take revenge against the insurance agent and devises a scheme to kill the agent by reflecting the sun's rays to blind a car to run over the agent in what would appear to be an accident. However, in the middle of the plan's execution, there is a solar eclipse, blocking the sunlight. At this time, the Brain receives a call from Uncle in the hospital, who tells the Brain that Fatty's death really was an accident. Uncle had accidentally dropped a bag of toy balls that night, which led to the loss of control of the bus. Realizing he has made a mistake and that the agent is innocent, the Brain runs and tries to cover the windshield from reflecting light. The agent sees and recognises the Brain as he is running, but the Brain is too late, and a blinded driver runs over the agent's wife, killing her. On a later date, as the Brain is leaving the rented flat, he is confronted and stabbed by the insurance agent in the staircase, who asks the Brain why he had to harm them. The Brain looks at the sky and thinks about his own wife before he dies.

The company was known for its play-for-porn approach to gaming, with such games as AV Pachi-Slot (Hot Slots) and Soap Panic (Magic Bubble) featuring female nudity as a reward for skilful playing. These games were usually distributed through mail order and sold approximately 30,000 to 50,000 copies each. Many of their games were developed by Taiwanese companies and were released in non-pornographic form elsewhere in the world; however three were released in the United States for the Nintendo Entertainment System with pornography intact (albeit sometimes modified to \\"Westernise\\" the girls' features) by another Taiwanese company, Panesian. An issue of Hacker magazineThe Hacker name was first used by Satoru Hagiwara, an entrepreneur and former music producer, for a monthly PC magazine. Hacker International was founded by Hagiwara as an outlet for its writers' ideas; its first product was the Hacker Junior, an upgrade for Famicom systems that provided composite video output and turbo controllers, for which they were sued by Nintendo and eventually settled out of court. The company was also known for the Disk Hacker software which allowed users to copy Famicom Disk System disks using only an ordinary Disk System (as opposed to the official method of using Nintendo's authorised Disk Writer units, which were placed only in game stores and charged 500 yen to copy a selected game to a customer's disk). Several versions were released to combat successive anti- piracy measures introduced by Nintendo. None of Hacker's games, with the exception of their 15 PlayStation titles, were licensed by the respective console manufacturers; Hiroshi Yamauchi personally opposed pornographic content in Famicom games, believing they would tarnish Nintendo's reputation. When Tokuma Shoten's Family Computer magazine published advertisements for Hacker's games, it felt its relationship with Nintendo‚Äîwhich it relied on for preview materials‚Äîwas so threatened that five of Tokuma's top executives travelled to Nintendo to apologise to Yamauchi in person. However, NEC was more tolerant of Hacker's PC Engine releases (under the Games Express brand) and actually thanked Hacker for helping console sales. Hacker became a licensee for the PlayStation under the name Map Japan, releasing 15 games, but eventually closed in 2001 due to competition from other publishers and Hagiwara's own loss of interest in gaming. Hacker's relationship to other Japanese adult console game producers of the era, such as Super Pig and MIMI Pro, is debated. For example, in the case of Super Pig, some claim this is merely a pseudonym under which Hacker published Disk System games while others maintain it is an entirely separate company that only occasionally worked with Hacker.

The concept of audio signal flow is closely related to the concept of audio gain staging; each component in the signal flow can be thought of as a gain stage. In typical home stereo systems, the signal flow is usually short and simple, with only a few components. However, in recording studios and performance venues, the signal flow can often be quite complicated, with a large number of components, each of which may cause the signal to fail to reach its desired output. Knowing each component in the signal flow becomes increasingly difficult and important as system size and complexity increases.  Feedback  Feedback, also called \\"Howl-Round,\\" occurs when the output of a device is accidentally connected to its input. If the device is amplifying the signal, then the amplified output will be fed back into the input, where it will be amplified again and sent to the output, where it will return to the input, be amplified again, and sent to the output, ad infinitum. An understanding of signal flow is important in preventing feedback.  CD playback example  The following example will trace the signal flow of a typical home stereo system while playing back an audio CD. The first component in the signal flow is the CD player, which produces the signal. The output of the CD player is connected to an input on a receiver. In a typical home stereo system, this connection will be analog and unbalanced at consumer line-level of -10dBV using RCA connectors. By selecting the proper input on the receiver, the signal is routed internally to an amplifier which boosts the signal voltage from line- level to the voltage required by the speakers. The output of the amplifier is then connected to speakers, which convert the electrical signal into acoustical sound.  Single vocalist recording signal flow example  The exact series of elements in a signal flow will vary from system to system. The following example depicts a typical signal flow for recording a vocalist in a recording studio. Singer Signal Flow Example The first element in the signal flow is the vocalist, which produces the signal. This signal propagates acoustically to the microphone according to the Inverse-square law, where it is converted by a transducer into an electrical signal. Other objects may also produce sound in the acoustical environment, such as HVAC systems, computer fans, traffic noise, elevators, plumbing, etc. These noise sources can also be picked up by the microphone. It is therefore important to optimize the acoustical signal/noise ratio at the microphone. This can be accomplished by reducing the amplitude of unwanted noise (for example, turning off the HVAC system while recording), or by taking advantage of the inverse-square law; by moving the microphone closer to the signal source and farther away from any noise sources, the signal/noise ratio is increased. After the microphone, the signal passes down a cable to the microphone preamplifier, which amplifies the microphone signal to line level. This is important because a line-level signal is necessary to drive the input circuitry of any further processing equipment down the chain, which will generally not be able to accept the extremely low- voltage signal produced by a typical microphone. For the purposes of this example, the output of the microphone preamplifier is then sent to an EQ, where the timbre of the sound may be manipulated for artistic or technical purposes. Examples of artistic purposes include making the singer sound \\"brighter,\\" \\"darker,\\" \\"more forward,\\" \\"less nasal,\\" etc. Examples of technical purposes include reducing unwanted low-frequency rumble from HVAC systems, compensating for high-frequency loss caused by distant microphone placement, etc. The output of the EQ will then be sent to a compressor, which is a device that manipulates the dynamic range of a signal for either artistic or technical reasons. The output of the compressor is then sent to an analog-to- digital converter, which converts the signal to a digital format, allowing the signal to be sent to a digital recording device, such as a computer.  Vocalist live sound signal flow example  The following example traces the signal flow of a vocalist performing in a church. The signal flow begins as in the previous example; singer, microphone, microphone preamplifier, EQ, and compressor. For this example, this signal then flows into a mixing board, which allows the signal to be routed to various outputs. The mixing board includes facilities for a main mix bus, which we will send to the house sound system, a monitor mix bus, which we will use to create a monitor mix for the singer, and an auxiliary mix bus, which we will use to create a second mix to be sent to the lobby and nursery.  Band signal flow example  A diagram of a typical signal flow for a band  Broadcast performance signal flow example  In this example, we will explore the signal flow of a hypothetical rock concert. For our example, this concert not only has a live audience, it is also being broadcast on live TV, and it is being recorded, with copies of the recording being sold to the public immediately after the concert is over. The signal from each microphone is therefore being sent to five places; the house sound system, the in-ear monitor system for the performers, the broadcast system, the recording system, and to the lobby, restrooms, and backstage areas so that people can hear the performance while outside the performance area. Overview diagram of Signal Flow for this example. The house sound system will be controlled from the \\"Front of House\\" position, also called the \\"Mix position.\\" This position is usually located behind the audience. The view from the Front of House Position. The in-ear monitor system will be controlled by a monitor mix engineer located in the wing on one side of the stage. It is necessary that the monitor mix engineer be able to communicate with the performers, so being in close proximity to them is essential. The monitor mix position is often called \\"monitor world.\\" An example of a monitor mix position The broadcast mix will be controlled from a broadcast truck, located in the parking lot behind the performance venue. An example of a broadcast truck. The recording system will be located in another truck, located next to the broadcast truck. For this example, the lobby, restroom, and backstage mix will be controlled by an assistant stage manager from backstage. Stage managers panel To facilitate this 5-way split, a device called a microphone splitter will be used. The microphone splitter serves several purposes; it will split the signal 5-ways, provide phantom power for condenser microphones and active DI boxes, and it will provide isolation between the 5 outputs, preventing ground loops. Preventing ground loops is an extremely important function, as the severity of ground loops typically increases with distance. In a large network of interconnected sound systems, such as the one in this example, ground loops could become dangerously severe. Isolation to prevent ground loops is therefore vitally important. An example of a microphone splitter Let's begin by tracing the signal path from the splitter to the audience. The signal leaves the splitter, typically via an Audio multicore cable, and travels to the Front of House position. Here, the still-mic-level signal enters into a microphone preamplifier, which boosts the signal voltage to line level. For this example, the microphone preamplifier is built into a mixing board. It is typical for a mixing board to include a line trim after the preamplifier. This allows the amplitude of the now line-level signal to be adjusted. This may be done for artistic or technical reasons. A typical application for the line trim is attenuating signals that were intentionally amplified too much by the microphone preamplifier. Over amplifying the signal can cause the preamplifier to distort, which can under certain circumstances produce a desirable sound. After the line trim, the signal is processed by the mixing board's EQ, filter, compressor, limiter, de-esser, delay, reverb, and any other signal processing features the mixing board has available and that the mix engineer chooses to use. The processed signal is then sent to the mix bus, where it is combined with all the other signals coming from the stage. The balance of signals is controlled by faders. The mix is then routed to one of the mixing boards outputs, and flows into a loudspeaker controller. This device processes the signal to optimize it for the sound system installed in the performance venue. It then flows into a rack of amplifiers, and then to the speakers.

Ancestry Golovkin was born in Lausanne to Count Alexander Alexandrovich Golovkin and his wife, Baroness Wilhelmina-Justina von Mosheim. He was brought up in Paris as a Protestant. His father was a grandson of Peter the Great's chancellor, Gavriil Golovkin. On his death Wilhelmina-Justina remarried Jean-Louis-Paul-Fran√ßois, 5th duc de Noailles. After the fall of the Ancien R√©gime in France, Yury went to Russia and entered the service of Catherine the Great. China mission The Russian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, had been preparing a mission to China for several years, partly in response to the growing Napoleonic hold over Europe, which left Russia with few possibilities for expansion.W. H. Zawadzki, A man of honour: Adam Czartoryski as a statesman of Russia and Poland, 1795-1831 (Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1993); Jerzy Skowronek, Antynapoleo≈Ñskie koncepcje Czartoryskiego (Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnistwo Naukowe, 1969), pp. 170-71. The resulting embassy was in some respects Russia‚Äôs answer to the embassy sent by Britain in 1793 under Earl Macartney, for the economic importance of Russian trade with China through the Russian-American Company was very significant.M. I. Sladkovskii, Istoriya torgovo-ekonomicheskich otnoshenii narodov Rossii c Kitaem (do 1977 g.) (Moscow: Nauka, 1974), pp. 188-90; Joseph Fletcher, \\"Sino-Russian relations, 1800-1862\\", in Cambridge History of China, vol. 10 ‚ÄòLate Ch‚Äôing, 1800-1911‚Äô, part 1 (Cambridge University Press, 1978), pp. 319-22. The Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) had permitted trade at the town of Kyakhta on the Russian-Chinese border (now the Russian-Mongolian border), roughly halfway between Irkutsk and Urga (present-day Ulan Bator).Mark Mancall, Russia and China: their diplomatic relations to 1728 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971), pp. 250-55. However, the growth of European trade with China on the Chinese coast in and around Canton was giving rise to the future of Russian trade with China and in February 1803 Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, the Minister of Commerce, proposed a full-scale assault on what he saw as the commercial isolation of East Asia.Clifford M. Foust, Muscovite and Mandarin: Russia's trade with China and its setting, 1727-1805 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1969), p. 323. In the end there were three components to this strategy; the first was Golovkin's mission, which travelled overland across Siberia in the winter, the second was Nikolai Rezanov‚Äôs mission to Japan, and the third was Adam Johann von Krusenstern‚Äôs circumnavigation of the globe, the first achieved by a Russian ship. The pretext of the Golovkin mission was to inform the Chinese government of the accession of Tsar Alexander I, but the real objective was to secure permission for Russian ships to enter Canton, to negotiate for the opening of a Russian consulate in Beijing and to secure Chinese agreement to the despatch of a Russian mission to Tibet.G. E. Grum- Grzhimailo, Opisanie Amurskoi oblasti (St Petersburg: [Ministerstvo Finansov], 1894), p. 25. Early in January 1806 Golovkin and his cort√®ge reached Urga (Ulan Bator) on their way to Beijing. In Urga, in bitterly cold weather, the entire company were invited to attend an open-air reception at which they were expected to perform the kowtow before a table on which stood a wooden tablet and three candles. Golovkin refused, declaring that he would be happy to prostrate himself before the emperor but could not do so before a piece of wood.This account of the fiasco in Urga is based on the Swedish ambassador's dispatch to the King of Sweden, for which he relied on the reports of Baikov, the first secretary to the embassy. Other accounts differ in detail: Kurt B. L. C. von Stedingk, M√©moires posthumes du Feld-Mar√©chal comte de Stedingk, ed. M. F. F. de Bj√∂rnstjerna, 2 vols. (Paris: Arthus-Bertrand, 1894‚Äì5), 2: 151‚Äì2. With that, the prospects for the mission melted away, and Golovkin and his large train had to retrace their steps to Irkutsk and then St Petersburg. Ramifications There is nothing like failure to ensure obscurity and oblivion, and nothing significant has been written on the Golovkin expedition, even in Russian, since 1875.Alain Peyrefitte, in chapter 83 of The collision of two civilizations: the British expedition to China in 1792-4, translated by Jon Rothschild (London: Harvill, 1993; a translation of L'empire immobile ou le choc des mondes, 1989), presents the embassy as nothing more than a failure. For the post-war period that may largely be due to the enforced sensitivities of Soviet scholars to the delicacy of Sino-Soviet relations, for, as one of them put it in 1959, it was all a question of the penetration and exploitation of the Chinese market, and that was hardly a friendly act.P.

The Golovkin embassy was a political failure, but it provided a unique intellectual opportunity which was not missed by contemporaries in St Petersburg. Filipp Vigel‚Äô, whose reminiscences are a valuable source for the workings of Russian upper-class society in the nineteenth-century, recorded that the prospect of travelling to China excited much interest; his own motives for participating were, however, somewhat mercenary, for he was short of money and it was only through his influential connections that he was able to land himself with a well-paid position on the embassy in a clerical capacity.F. F. Vigel‚Äô, ‚ÄòVospominaniya‚Äô, serialised over many issues in The Russian Messenger; his account of his participation in the Golovkin expedition and his character sketches of participants are contained in vol. 50 (1864), pp. 557‚Äì74. More significantly, the embassy included a party of scientists and other ‚Äòsavants‚Äô under the direction of the Academy of Sciences and under the leadership of Count Jan Potocki (1761‚Äì1815). Potocki‚Äôs leadership of the scientific team was not simply a matter of his personal connections with the fellow Pole, Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, for his intellectual and political credentials for fulfilling that role were impeccable, and without him it is unlikely that the brilliant German orientalist, Julius Klaproth, would have had any part to play in the mission. Others in the party of scientists carried out a detailed exploration of Siberia, studies of the flora and fauna, and so on.V. N. Basnin, ed., 'Vostochnaya Sibir'.

The book promoted the idea that taking large amounts of vitamin C could reduce the duration and severity of the common cold. A Nobel Prize-winning chemist and activist, Pauling promoted a view of vitamin C that is strongly at odds with most of the scientific community, which found little evidence for the alleged health benefits of greatly increased vitamin C intake. The book went through multiple editions, and a revised version that discussed the flu and other diseases, retitled Vitamin C, the Common Cold & the Flu, came out in 1976.Goertzel and Goertzel, pp. 199-201 The book characterizes the inability of humans and some other animals to produce vitamin C in terms of evolution and Pauling's concept of \\"molecular disease\\" (first articulated in his 1949 study, \\"Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease\\"). Pauling argues that the loss of vitamin C synthesis first arose as a molecular disease, because of a genetic mutation that resulted in the loss of the biochemical capacity to make the vitamin, but because diets of the primate ancestors of humans consisted of high levels of vitamin C from plant sources, the loss of that biochemical mechanism was not harmful and may have even been beneficial. He argues, however, that the subsequent shift to a high-meat, lower-plant diet resulted in widespread vitamin C deficiency.Pauling (1981), pp. 57-68, Goertzel and Goertzel, pp. 205-206 Research, writing and revisions Pauling began studying vitamin C mega-dosage, and orthomolecular medicine more broadly, after he was contacted in 1966 by biochemist Irwin Stone, who suggested that taking enough vitamin C would let him live another fifty years. Pauling reinterpreted the large body of research on vitamin C based on comparative studies of the biochemical genetics of vitamin C synthesis in different species, as well his own theories about \\"molecular disease\\" and recent developments in molecular evolution. He criticized the design of studies that did not find positive results for vitamin C mega-dose treatment, and promoted those that did. He and other vitamin C advocates thought the vitamin boosts the body's ability to fight all kinds of infection. By 1970, after following Stone's regimen for 4 years and studying and debating the issue extensively, Pauling was sure enough that organized medicine had it wrong that he wrote Vitamin C and the Common Cold to popularize his vitamin C message.Goertzel and Goertzel, pp. 197-201 In 1970, he found an in-depth 1942 study from public health researcher at the University of Minnesota, \\"Vitamins for the Prevention of Colds\\", which became a focal point for his subsequent criticism of what he saw as flawed vitamin C research.Goertzel and Goertzel, pp. 202-203 One chapter was added to the second edition in 1971. By 1976, following confrontations with researchers holding to the mainstream view of vitamin C, Pauling expanded the book to include evidence related to a wide variety of other illnesses, and the flu in particular. That edition and a further revision in 1981 were issued under the title Vitamin C, the Common Cold & the Flu.Pauling (1981), p. iv Reception The book was well received by the public and garnered considerable popular attention, resulting in a rush of vitamin C sales. Paperback editions were issued in 1971 and 1973, and Pauling subsequently authored several related books: Vitamin C and Cancer (1979) and How to Live Longer and Feel Better (1986). The book and Pauling himself faced considerable criticism from scientists and physicians.Goertzel and Goertzel, pp. 201-205 The book's claim of taking a daily vitamin C intake of 2,300mg or more for \\"optimum\\" health is not supported by scientific evidence.Marshall, Charles W. (1986). Vitamins and Minerals: Help or Harm?. George F. Stickley Company. pp. 122-124. Charles W. Marshall author of Vitamins and Minerals: Help or Harm?, has commented that the \\"vast majority of reputable medical and nutritional scientists strongly disagree\\" with Pauling's recommendations. Marshall also noted that \\"there have been at least 30 experiments done to test the effects of vitamin C against colds in humans. Most biomedical scientists who have analyzed the results of these trials have found Pauling's claims mainly unsupported in 15 of those trials which were the best designed.\\" Notes References *Ted Goertzel and Ben Goertzel, Linus Pauling: A Life in Science and Politics, BasicBooks, 1995. *Linus Pauling, Vitamin C, the Common Cold & the Flu, Berkley Books, 1981.

Jackson, Michael Sheen and Carrie-Anne Moss. It was released direct-to-video on June 14, 2010. The film is noteworthy for the controversy it generated around its subject matter, the torture of a man who threatens to detonate three nuclear bombs in separate U.S. cities.Gregor Jordan's Unthinkable 2011-01-18, Cinematofilos.com.ar [Not in citation given]  Plot  An American man and former Delta Force operator, Yusuf (Sheen), makes a videotape. When FBI Special Agent Helen Brody (Moss) and her team see news bulletins looking for Yusuf, they launch an investigation, which is curtailed when they are summoned to a high school, which has been converted into a black site under military command. They are shown Yusuf's complete tape, where he threatens to detonate three nuclear bombs in separate U.S. cities if his demands are not met. A special interrogator, \\"H\\" (Samuel L. Jackson), is brought in to force Yusuf to reveal the locations of the nuclear bombs. H quickly shows his capability and cruelty by chopping off one of Yusuf's fingers with a small hatchet. Horrified, Special Agent Brody attempts to put a stop to the measures. Her superiors make it clear that the potentially disastrous consequences necessitate these extreme measures. As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the \\"good cop\\"). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for puppet governments and dictatorships in Muslim countries and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries. The group immediately dismisses the possibility of his demands being met, citing the United States' declared policy of not negotiating with terrorists. When Brody accuses Yusuf of faking the bomb threat in order to make a point about the moral character of the United States government, he breaks down and agrees that it was all a ruse. He gives her an address to prove it. They find a room that matches the scene in the video tape and find evidence on the roof. A soldier removes a picture from an electrical switch, which triggers a tremendous C-4 explosion at a nearby shopping mall visible from the roof. The explosion kills 53 people. Angry at the senseless deaths, Brody returns to Yusuf and cuts his chest with a scalpel. Yusuf is unafraid and demands she cut him. He justifies the deaths in the shopping mall, stating that the Americans kill that many people every day. Yusuf says he allowed himself to be caught so he could face his oppressors. H questions whether Yusuf will reveal the bombs' location unless Yusuf's wife is found. When she is detained, H brings her in front of her husband and threatens to mutilate her in front of him. Brody and the others begin to take her away from the room in disgust. Out of desperation, H slashes her throat, and she bleeds to death in front of Yusuf. Still without cooperation, H tells the soldiers to bring in Yusuf's two children, a young boy and girl. Outside of Yusuf's hearing, he assures everyone that he will not harm the children. Yusuf's children are brought in, and H makes it clear that he will torture them if the locations of the bombs are not divulged. Yusuf breaks and gives three addresses (in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas), but H does not stop, forcing the others to intervene. Citing the amount of missing nuclear material Yusuf potentially had at his disposal (some 15‚Äì18 lbs. were reported missing, with about 4¬Ω lbs. needed per device), H insists that Yusuf has not admitted anything about a heretofore- unreferenced fourth bomb. H points out that everything Yusuf has done so far has been planned meticulously. He knew the torture would most likely break him, and he would have been certain to plant a fourth bomb, just in case. The purpose of the preceding torture was not to break Yusuf, but rather to make it clear what would happen to his children if he did not cooperate. The official in charge of the operation demands that H bring Yusuf's children back in for further interrogation. H demands that Brody bring the children back in because her decency will give him the moral approval that he needs to do the \\"unthinkable\\". When Brody refuses to retrieve the children for H, he unstraps Yusuf, sarcastically setting him free. The official draws his pistol and aims it at H to coerce him into further interrogation. Yusuf grabs the official's gun. He asks Brody to take care of his children and kills himself. Brody walks out of the building with Yusuf's children.  Extended version  An FBI bomb disposal unit arrives at one of the disclosed locations and resets the timer, preventing the bomb from going off. As the FBI is celebrating, however, behind a nearby crate, the originally unconfirmed fourth bomb's timer counts down to zero. Cast *Samuel L.

Design and development ISTUS (international commission for the study of motorless flight) launched a campaign for gliding's inclusion in the Olympic games, organising an international competition, planned for 4‚Äì17 July 1937 for aspiring national teams. The BGA were in a quandary as the only suitable aircraft was the Buxton Hjordis. To replace it Mungo Buxton had started the design of the Hjordis 2 but due to his commitments as a serving RAF officer Buxton handed over the design to Slingsby, Sproule and Shaw to complete the aircraft. Buxton had studied the latest soaring techniques and came to the conclusion that competitive aircraft would need to fly efficiently at higher speeds and not sacrifice glide performance for climb performance. The result of their efforts, the Slingsby Type 9 King Kite, emerged as a cantilevered gull wing sailplane with wooden structure covered by plywood throughout, except for fabric covered ailerons, tailpane, elevators and rudder. A large comfortable cockpit housed the pilot under a canopy built up from single curved pieces of plexiglas. To ensure full aileron control at high speed it was necessary to build a stiff wing with ribs at half the normal spacing with a deep laminated timber main spar. The trailing edges of the wings were taken up by landing flaps inboard of the gull joint and ailerons outboard. Flight tests Flight tests of the King Kite with Philip Wills at the controls revealed a tendency to enter spins easily, and more importantly, a reluctance to recover from spins. To alleviate the problem while a permanent solution was found the rudder was increased in size twice, initially in span and later in chord. Wasserkuppe 1937 International Competition The three King Kites, Hjordis and the Falcon III were all shipped to Wasserkuppe in time for the 1937 international competition. The first launch for the British team ended in disaster when Willy Watt, in a King Kite, on his first ever bungee launch attempted to turn immediately after the bungee slipped off the hook, the King Kite spun into the ground disintegrating around the dazed Watt. John Nielan also had an episode with spinning, recovering at very low altitude and then continuing on a cross-country competition task. The reason for the King Kites handling problems was attributed to the inner wing being jigged improperly in the factory, so rectification on the three already built King Kites was impossible. After Wasserkuppe After their return from Wasserkuppe the two remaining King Kites flew very little before the out break of the Second World War. Both aircraft were impressed by the RAF for use by ATC officers, one breaking up in flight during 1946 and the other transferred to the RAFGSA (Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association) at Detling where it was scrapped in 1950, after glued joints were found to have failed. Re-birth of the King Kite In 1978 the blueprints were recovered from storage and a replica King Kite was built by David Jones using modern low drag wing profiles, with advice from Professor Wortmann at Akaflieg Stuttgart.

It grows to 5.7 inches (14.6 cm) in the wild. It has a brown color with light blue to yellow horizontal stripes over its body which change into spots towards the face. It also has a vividly yellow area surrounding the eye. In the aquarium trade it can be seen under a variety of common names, including yellow-eyed kole tang, striped bristletooth, and bristletooth tang. This species is an herbivore, grazing algae on the shallow reef. It has also been commonly observed to clean algal growths from the shells of sea turtles. In the Ahihi-Kinau nature preserve area on Maui, Hawaii, aggregations of this fish have established \\"cleaning stations\\" where green sea turtles come to be groomed. This is a symbiotic relationship. The fish benefit by having access to an easy meal, while the turtles get groomed of the algae growths on their shells, which can increase drag in the water when growth becomes too dense. The species is commonly offered for sale in the marine aquarium trade, where it is valued for its algae-grazing habit. It can be aggressive toward other surgeonfish and needs high amounts of water movement when kept in captivity, where a minimum of a 70-gallon aquarium is required.

Slingsby Sailplanes. Shrewsbury: Airlife, 1996. . Design and development The Type 20 was probably the least well known Slingsby product, yet it arguably had the most exciting flying life. The design started life in parallel with the larger Type 21, as a private venture inexpensive robust two-seat training glider intended for the Air Training Corps. The aircraft borrowed design elements from several predecessors, including an enlarged wing from the T.8 Kirby Tutor, and a fuselage, reminiscent of the early Falcons, with cabane struts in front of the rear cockpit, which sat in front of the narrow cabane structure under the centre-section, as well as an additional cockpit in the nose. Flight trials Flying with the T.20 began in 1944 with no reported problems, the prototype languished at Sutton Bank Gliding Club, emerging only to fly the occasional illegal soaring flight, the pilots that flew the T.20 all praising its handling. No production order was forthcoming however. Preparation for carrier trials During the intensive carrier operations of the war it had been noticed that there were many accidents as aircraft neared the 'Round- down' (the aft edge of the flight deck) on their approach to 'Land-on'. To investigate this phenomenon the Admiralty authorised a research program to establish airflow patterns over the 'Round-down' on large aircraft carriers using a suitable glider towed behind a carrier using a small winch to allow the glider to climb, descend and move forwards and backwards in relation to the 'Round-down'. John Sproule, former designer at Slingsby, was ordered to find a suitable aircraft and carry out the test flying. In 1945 Sproule visited the Slingsby works and took the prototype T.20 away for use in the carrier trials. Carrier trials on HMS Pretoria Castle The T.20 was fitted with special instrumentation and large Zap flaps, fixed at 30¬∞, at Wombleton aerodrome where initial trials were carried out at low altitude towed behind a car. The glider, scientists, John Sproule and winch were loaded onto HMS Pretoria Castle at the Clyde docks and on 29 May 1945 the T.20 took off, tethered to a winch on the flight deck. The glider was manoeuvred around the aft end of the carrier, as she steamed along at 35 knots, until there was a sudden shift in the wind which left Sproule struggling to maintain height calling for the winch to haul him in so he could gain height. The winch engine had stalled and was reluctant to start, but just as Sproule was preparing to abandon the T.20 in the wake of the carrier, the winch burst into life and the T.20 climbed away allowing the shaken Sproule to land the T.20 back on the deck. Results gathered by the instruments were of poor quality so the trials on Pretoria Castle were abandoned. Carrier trials on HMS Illustrious After the scientists had modified their instruments, a new set of trials were authorised to take place on . Sproule and an experienced glider pilot as deputy, scientists, glider and equipment were embarked on Illustrious in the English Channel. Initial flights with Sproule at the controls went well, but his deputy's first outing ended in disaster as the pilot failed to pull back on the stick to climb away, staying close to the deck weaving from side to side till eventually the tow cable snagged a telecoms antenna and unceremoniously dumped the T.20 into the sea alongside the carrier. The deputy pilot was rescued but the unfortunate T.20 was rammed by an accompanying destroyer to ensure the wreckage sank.

Design and development Following the technical success of the T.37 Skylark, the concept was expanded with the introduction of the T.41 Skylark 2. The use of laminar-flow sections was continued but the section at the tips was changed to NACA4415 to reduce the tendency to tip-stall. The Skylark 2 was very similar in shape to its predecessor but had a smooth-skinned rounded fuselage and a wing of greater span and area. Composite materials were introduced in the Skylark 2, with the nose cone, wingtips and various small fairings made from polyester resin glassfibre. The thickness of the aerofoils was increased to ensure that drag was reduced over a wider speed range allowing the Skylark 2 to climb faster in thermals at low speed and race between thermals at high speed. History The prototype was flown in November 1953 and tested by the British Gliding Association's Test Group No.1 based at Lasham Airfield.

The term \\"Day of Compassion\\" first appeared in a call issued in 1942 by the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America to all Christians in the United States. It urged all Christians to pray and show compassion for the persecuted Jews in Europe. More than a half- century later, the idea of a Day of Compassion was used for several other purposes, including a television program HIV/AIDS-awareness, a university psychology course, a day of observance in India, and an international day of celebration.  Day of Compassion Television Program  Between 1993 and 1999, a television special called \\"Day of Compassion\\" took place every year on June 21 to honor people who were fighting AIDS or were HIV-positive. Neil Tadken, the television show's creator, was so moved by the HIV/AIDS-awareness storyline involving the character Billy Douglas (Ryan Phillippe) on One Life to Live, that Tadken contacted the producers of all ten daytime dramas, suggesting that on June 21, their shows mention AIDS and HIV in some way. All My Children, One Life To Live, General Hospital and Days of Our Lives participated in the first year. Hollywood Support's became the supporting organization, headed by Barry Diller and other major studio heads in the Hollywood. Tadken then met with producer Lawrence Leritz, who agreed to become the East Coast producer and spokesperson. Leritz continued for three seasons, and Day of Compassion became the largest one-day event in television history with over 200 shows participating, including soaps, talk shows, cable programs and news. Time Magazine named Leritz as its Local Hero in June 1996 for his contribution.  Day of Compassion Student Assignment  thumb Qian Zhang (now Habi Zhang), winner of the 2014 Day of Compassion Award, with Professor Scott Plous and Dr. Jane Goodall In 1997, Scott Plous, a psychology professor at Wesleyan University and Executive Director of Social Psychology Network, developed an action teaching assignment in which students are challenged to behave as compassionately as possible for 24 hours and then analyze the experience. According to the instructions, students are asked to \\"live each minute of that day in as compassionate a way as possible. In other words, for a full 24-hour period you should do your best to reduce suffering, help other people in need, be considerate and respectful, and avoid causing harm to any living being.\\" Afterward, students submit a paper answering questions such as: * If your behavior was different than normal, which person did you like more: the \\"Day of Compassion you\\" or the \\"normal you\\"? * If you preferred the \\"Day of Compassion you,\\" what are the psychological factors that prevent this \\"you\\" from coming out? * If you wanted to encourage others to behave as you did during the Day of Compassion, what techniques would you use? The purpose of the assignment is to help students understand compassion‚Äîand barriers to compassion‚Äîin their daily life. As a result of the assignment, students have reportedly resolved conflicts with estranged family members, helped refugees and homeless strangers, rescued animals, volunteered at soup kitchens, donated to food drives, and carried out many other acts of kindness. Students also frequently report positive social reactions to their acts of compassion and a desire to continue carrying out such acts in the future. Plous later created a version of the assignment for use in a Social Psychology massive open online course taken through Coursera by more than 750,000 students from 200 countries. In the online course, students voted on the best Day of Compassion assignments submitted, and the grand prize winner was given an expense-paid trip to meet a public figure known for making the world a more compassionate place. In 2013 the winner was Balesh Jindal, a physician from India who addressed sexual violence towards girls in her community and later met the 14th Dalai Lama. In 2014 the winner was Qian Zhang, a Chinese mother who intervened when she heard a boy being beaten in a neighboring apartment and later met anthropologist Jane Goodall. These meetings received press coverage and led the BBC to dub the assignment \\"the world's most compassionate 24 hours.\\"  World Compassion Day  In 2012 the first World Compassion Day, founded by Pritish Nandy, was held in Mumbai, India, in the presence of internationally known figures such as the 14th Dalai Lama. The Inaugural World Compassion Day focused on promoting animal welfare and vegetarianism, and was co-organized by Humane Society International. Each year, World Compassion Day takes place on November 28. According to Nandy: \\"The objective is to rediscover the relevance of ahimsa. We want to revive the idea of compassion not just as do-good gestures but also as an initiative to create an alternate lifestyle.\\"  Compassion Day  In 2012 the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition began celebrating July 6 as an international \\"Compassion Day\\" in honor of the 14th Dalai Lama's birthday and as an opportunity for people to come together and dedicate themselves to making a positive difference in the world. A key goal of Compassion Day is to cultivate compassion not just in one's heart, as is done in meditation, but in meaningful ways that benefit others. By practicing \\"compassion in action,\\" the day is also intended to inspire others to behave compassionately.

The sequence takes its name from the fact that it represents the sequence of left and right folds along a strip of paper that is folded repeatedly in half in the same direction. If each fold is then opened out to create a right-angled corner, the resulting shape approaches the dragon curve fractal. For instance the following curve is given by folding a strip four times to the right and then unfolding to give right angles, this gives the first 15 terms of the sequence when 1 represents a right turn and 0 represents a left turn. 800px Starting at n = 1, the first few terms of the regular paperfolding sequence are: :1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ... Properties The value of any given term tn in the regular paperfolding sequence can be found recursively as follows. If n = m*2k where m is odd then :t_n = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } m = 1 \\\\mod 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } m = 3 \\\\mod 4 \\\\end{cases} Thus t12 = t3 = 0 but t13 = 1. The paperfolding word 1101100111001001..., which is created by concatenating the terms of the regular paperfolding sequence, is a fixed point of the morphism or string substitution rules :11 ‚Üí 1101 :01 ‚Üí 1001 :10 ‚Üí 1100 :00 ‚Üí 1000 as follows: :11 ‚Üí 1101 ‚Üí 11011001 ‚Üí 1101100111001001 ‚Üí 11011001110010011101100011001001 ... It can be seen from the morphism rules that the paperfolding word contains at most three consecutive 0s and at most three consecutive 1s. The paperfolding sequence also satisfies the symmetry relation: :t_n = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } n = 2^k \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-t_{2^k-n} & \\\\text{if } 2^{k-1} which shows that the paperfolding word can be constructed as the limit of another iterated process as follows: :1 :1 1 0 :110 1 100 :1101100 1 1100100 :110110011100100 1 110110001100100 In each iteration of this process, a 1 is placed at the end of the previous iteration's string, then this string is repeated in reverse order, replacing 0 by 1 and vice versa. Generating function The generating function of the paperfolding sequence is given by :G(t_n;x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}t_nx^n \\\\, . From the construction of the paperfolding sequence it can be seen that G satisfies the functional relation :G(t_n;x) = G(t_n;x^2) + \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}x^{4n+1} = G(t_n;x^2) + \\\\frac{x}{1-x^4} \\\\, . Paperfolding constant Substituting into the generating function gives a real number between and whose binary expansion is the paperfolding word :G(t_n;\\\\frac{1}{2})=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{t_n}{2^n} This number is known as the paperfolding constant and has the value :\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac {8^{2^k}}{2^{2^{k+2}}-1} = 0.85073618820186... General paperfolding sequence The regular paperfolding sequence corresponds to folding a strip of paper consistently in the same direction. If we allow the direction of the fold to vary at each step we obtain a more general class of sequences. Given a binary sequence (fi), we can define a general paperfolding sequence with folding instructions (fi). For a binary word w, let w‚Ä° denote the reverse of the complement of w. Define an operator Fa as :F_a : w \\\\mapsto w a w^\\\\ddagger \\\\ and then define a sequence of words depending on the (fi) by w0 = Œµ, :w_n = F_{f_1} ( F_{f_2} ( \\\\cdots F_{f_n}(\\\\varepsilon) \\\\cdots ) ) \\\\ . The limit w of the sequence wn is a paperfolding sequence. The regular paperfolding sequence corresponds to the folding sequence fi = 1 for all i. If n = m*2k where m is odd then :t_n = \\\\begin{cases} f_j & \\\\text{if } m = 1 \\\\mod 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-f_j & \\\\text{if } m = 3 \\\\mod 4 \\\\end{cases} which may be used as a definition of a paperfolding sequence.

As of 2013 it had a population of 185,503. It is composed of 66 sub-districts, each represented by a district delegate. Grand Yoff is part of the Parcelles Assainies district. The neighborhood of Grand Yoff is the most populated neighborhood in Dakar, and the 7th most populated in Senegal. Population The population of Grand Yoff is growing rapidly. In 2002, it was estimated that there were about 128,740 inhabitants. Since then, the neighborhood increased to about 144,859 inhabitants in 2007 and to approximately 185,503 in 2013. There is some debate surrounding the total number of people living in Grand Yoff, as some believe the figures represent less than the actual number of people who live in this neighborhood. Each of the ethnic groups in Senegal are represented in this neighborhood. Despite its growing population, Grand Yoff occupies an area of only 6.3 km2. The limited space has led to an overcrowding of the area. On average, there are about 29,000 inhabitants per km2 in Grand Yoff, about 50% more than the Paris Commune and about 7% more than in Manhattan, New York. The high population density has led to many difficulties such as street congestion, land disputes, and conflicts of occupation. Infrastructure Grand Yoff has a road network with only one third being paved (46 km). The remaining 110 km of road is unpaved and mostly made of sand. Like most of Dakar, the interior of Grand Yoff is made up of small streets of sand while the main roads are paved. Sometimes, the smaller streets are difficult to reach by car due to informal trade encroaching on the roads. Despite portions of paved roads that are partially degraded by potholes, the paved roads are in relatively good shape. Issues and challenges There are many challenges facing the neighborhood of Grand Yoff. The high population density has led to a number of difficulties such as street congestion, land disputes, and conflicts of occupation. When confronted with massive influxes of inhabitants, these problems tend to worsen. Recurring flooding during the rainy seasons also pose a serious problems to the inhabitants in this neighborhood as it complicates the lives of those who live in the affected areas. There are also problems of insecurity, lack of health and education infrastructure, and unemployment, especially among the younger generation.

History Carolina was founded in 1927 by Dr. Thomas E. Powell Jr., a young geology and biology professor at Elon College (now Elon University). During the 1920s, science teachers had to collect most of the materials they used in their classes and laboratories, which took considerable time away from their primary responsibilities. Like other teachers, Dr. Powell was spending much of his own time in the field gathering specimens for his classes. Because he usually got more than he needed, he sold the surplus to his colleagues. This grew into the Carolina Biological Supply Company as Powell foresaw that the coming years would bring a growing need for his collecting abilities.

The condition was introduced in axiomatic quantum field theory by Nikolay Bogolyubov in 1955. Formulation In axiomatic quantum theory, S-matrix is considered as a functional of a function g: M\\\\to [0,1] defined on the Minkowski space M. This function characterizes the intensity of the interaction in different space-time regions: the value g(x)=0 at a point x corresponds to the absence of interaction in x, g(x)=1 corresponds to the most intense interaction, and values between 0 and 1 correspond to incomplete interaction at x. For two points x,y\\\\in M, the notation x\\\\le y means that x causally precedes y. Let S(g) be scattering matrix as a functional of g. The Bogoliubov causality condition in terms of variational derivatives has the form: :::\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta g(x)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta S(g)}{\\\\delta g(y)} S^\\\\dagger(g)\\\\right)=0 \\\\mbox{ for } x\\\\le y.

McConnell after his experiments with memory transfer in planarian worms generated a torrent of mail enquiries. The W.R.D. published both satirical articles, such as \\"A Stress Analysis of a Strapless Evening Gown\\", and scientific papers, the most famous of which, \\"Memory transfer through cannibalism in planaria\\", was a result of McConnell's RNA memory transfer experiments with planarian worms and was later published in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry. The title for the W.R.D., McConnell explained, was an extension of the psychological jargon that terms psychologists who work with rats \\"rat runners\\" and those who work with insects \\"bug runners.\\" After complaints that the satirical articles and the scientific publications were not distinguishable, the satirical articles were printed upside down in the back half of the W.R.D. along with a topsy turvy back cover. In 1966, the title was changed to the Journal of Biological Psychology in an effort to make the publication more accessible to the scientific community. In 1979 the magazine ceased publication.

In March 2016, video was released of Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen) using the RPG-32 against Houthi forces during the Yemeni Civil War. It is unknown how the terrorist group could have acquired such a modern and advanced weapon system, but it is likely they were initially supplied to Yemeni loyalist forces by the user nations of Jordan or the UAE, part of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, then captured by militants.

It is a core helium fusing star that is classified as a member of the red clump evolutionary branch, although the metallicity of this star‚Äîmeaning the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium‚Äîis anomalously low for a member of this group. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is 5,050 K, giving it the yellow-hued glow typical of G-type stars. In the galactic coordinate system, this star has space velocity components of [U, V, W] = [+13.75, +3.47, . The peculiar velocity of this star, relative to its neighbors, is . It has been listed as likely member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar location and a common trajectory through space. Backwards extrapolation of the motion of Œ≥ Microscopii has shown that approximately 3.8 million years ago, it was only around 6 light-years from the Sun. It would then have had an apparent magnitude of ‚àí3 and have been brighter than Sirius is now. Shortly before that, around 3.9 million years ago, it likely passed within 1.14 to 3.45 light-years of the Sun, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Gamma Microscopii has a visual companion, CCDM J21013-3215B at an angular separation of 26 arcseconds along a position angle of 94¬∞, with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 13.7. Most likely this star is not gravitationally bound to Œ≥ Microscopii, but is merely a line of sight companion. The Bayer designation Œ≥ Microscopii was not assigned by Bayer himself.

Rachel's father was Laban. Her older sister was Leah, Jacob's first wife; their mother was Adinah. Seder Hadoros Her aunt Rebekah was Jacob's mother.\\"Rachel\\", Jewish Virtual Library Marriage to Jacob Rachel and Jacob at the Well by James Tissot (c. 1896‚Äì1902) Rachel is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in when Jacob happens upon her as she is about to water her father's flock. She was the second daughter of Laban, Rebekah's brother, making Jacob her first cousin. Jacob had traveled a great distance to find Laban. Rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother, Esau. During Jacob's stay, he fell in love with Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. On the night of the wedding, the bride was veiled and Jacob did not notice that Leah, Rachel's older sister, had been substituted for Rachel. Whereas \\"Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful\\", \\"Leah had tender eyes\\".\\"Leah had tender eyes\\" () (Genesis 29:17). It is debated as to whether the adjective \\"tender\\" (◊®◊õ◊ï◊™) should be taken to mean \\"delicate and soft\\" or \\"weary\\". Some translations say that it may have meant blue or light colored eyes. Some say that Leah spent most of her time weeping and praying to God to change her destined mate. Thus the Torah describes her eyes as \\"soft\\" from weeping. Later Jacob confronted Laban, who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first. He assured Jacob that after his wedding week was finished, he could take Rachel as a wife as well, and work another seven years as payment for her. When God \\"saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb\\" (Gen 29:31), and she gave birth to four sons. Rachel, like Sarah and Rebecca, remained unable to conceive. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, \\"The infertility of the matriarchs has two effects: it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son, marking Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph as special; and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of God.\\"Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. \\"Rachel: Bible.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. (Viewed on August 6, 2014) Rachel became jealous of Leah and gave Jacob her maidservant, Bilhah, to be a surrogate mother for her. Bilhah gave birth to two sons that Rachel named and raised (Dan and Naphtali). Leah responded by offering her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob, and named and raised the two sons (Gad and Asher) that Zilpah bore. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah were half-sisters of Leah and Rachel.Ginzberg, Louis (1909) The Legends of the Jews, Volume I, Chapter VI: Jacob, at sacred-texts.com After Leah conceived again, Rachel was finally blessed with a son, Joseph, who would become Jacob's favorite child. Children Rachel's son Joseph was destined to be the leader of Israel's tribes between exile and nationhood. This role is exemplified in the Biblical story of Joseph, who prepared the way in Egypt for his family's exile there.\\"Joseph\\" at jewishencyclopedia.com Fresco by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo of Rachel sitting on the idols (1726‚Äì1728) After Joseph's birth, Jacob decided to return to the land of Canaan with his family. Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve children without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his idols. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance (). Not knowing that the idols were in his wife's possession, Jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them: \\"With whoever you will find your gods, he will not live\\" (). Laban proceeded to search the tents of Jacob and his wives, but when he came to Rachel's tent, she told her father, \\"Let not my lord be angered that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me\\" (). Laban left her alone, but the curse Jacob had pronounced came true shortly thereafter. Death and burial Rachel's Tomb, near Bethlehem, 1891 Near Ephrath, Rachel went into a difficult labor with her second son, Benjamin. The midwife told her in the middle of the birth that her child was a boy.Reisenberger, Azila, \\"Medical history: Biblical texts reveal compelling mysteries\\", University of Cape Town News, January 10, 2003 Before she died, Rachel named her son Ben Oni (\\"son of my mourning\\"), but Jacob called him Ben Yamin (Benjamin). Rashi explains that Ben Yamin either means \\"son of the right\\" (i.e., \\"south\\"), since Benjamin was the only one of Jacob's sons born in Canaan, which is to the south of Paddan Aram; or it could mean \\"son of my days\\", as Benjamin was born in Jacob's old age. Rachel was buried on the road to Efrat, just outside Bethlehem,\\"Rachel\\" at http://jewishencyclopedia.com and not in the ancestral tomb at Machpelah. Today a site claimed to be Rachel's Tomb, located between Bethlehem and the Israeli settlement of Gilo, is visited by tens of thousands of visitors each year.\\"Kever Rachel Trip Breaks Barriers\\" by Israel National News Staff at israelnationalnews.com, Published: 11/14/05 Rachel's tomb is said to be in the ancient city of Zelzah in the land of the Tribe of Benjamin (First Book of Samuel, chapter 10, v. 2). Additional references in the Bible Rachel weeping for her children, 14th-century fresco from Marko's Monastery. * Mordecai, the hero of the Book of Esther, and Queen Esther herself, were descendants of Rachel through her son Benjamin. The Book of Esther details Mordecai's lineage as \\"Mordecai the son of Yair, the son of Shimi, the son of Kish, a man of the right (ish yemini)\\" (Esther 2:5). The designation of ish yemini refers to his membership in the Tribe of Benjamin (ben yamin, son of the right). The rabbis comment that Esther's ability to remain silent in the palace of Ahasuerus, resisting the king's pressure to reveal her ancestry, was inherited from her ancestor Rachel, who remained silent even when Laban brought out Leah to marry Jacob. * After the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin were exiled by the Assyrians, Rachel was remembered as the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children. Jeremiah 31:15, speaks of 'Rachel weeping for her children' (KJV). This is interpreted in Judaism as Rachel crying for an end to her descendants' sufferings and exiles following the destruction by the Babylonians of the First Temple in ancient Jerusalem. According to the Midrash, Rachel spoke before God: \\"If I, a mere mortal, was prepared not to humiliate my sister and was willing to take a rival into my home, how could You, the eternal, compassionate God, be jealous of idols, which have no true existence, that were brought into Your home (the Temple in Jerusalem)? Will You cause my children to be exiled on this account?\\" God accepted her plea and promised that, eventually, the exile would end and the Jews would return to their land.Weisberg, Chana, \\"Rachel - Biblical Women\\" at chabad.org * In the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew (part of the New Testament), this reference from Jeremiah is interpreted as a prediction of the Massacre of the Innocents by Herod the Great in his attempt to kill the young Jesus. The Jeremaic prophecy is the inspiration behind the medieval dramatic cycle Ordo Rachelis, concerned with the infancy of Jesus. In Islam Despite not being named in the Quran, Rachel (, RƒÅ·∏•ƒ´l) is honored in Islam as the wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph, who are frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an as Ya‚Äòq≈´b () and Y≈´suf (), respectively.

One of the most popular in his oeuvre, it is a frequent feature of anthologies, such as A New Book of African Verse edited by John Reed and Clive Wake (Heinemann African Writers Series, 1985). \\"The piece belongs with the best of Senghor's nostalgic verse,\\" wrote Michael J. C. Echeruo in a tribute to Okara on the occasion of his 70th birthday, \\"with the militancy of many of David Diop's lyrics, and certainly with J. P. Clark's 'Ivbie', another of my favorite African poems. Okara's poem is more relaxed than these, however, more ironic, less tortured. In some ways, of course, it is less urgent, less strident, less involved. If Clark's 'Ivbie' was complex and for good reason, You laughed, and laughed, and laughed seemed also appropriately straightforward: proud without arrogance, hurting without showing it, and blunt without rudeness.\\"Echeruo, Michael J. C., \\"Gabriel Okara: a Poet and His Seasons\\", World Literature Today, 1992, p. 454. The first of Okara's poems that it was Echeruo's pleasure to read, it was also in his opinion the most enduring. The poem is sometimes wrongly attributed to South African writer Dennis Brutus.  Synopsis  Gabriel Okara's poem consists of 10 stanzas and describes the interplay of different interpretations of the same sounds, sights, and dances. The interaction that takes place within the poem is commonly thought to be between a white colonialist and an African native. The poem follows a trope in African literature of \\"The White Man Laughed\\", which embodies the notion of dismay and cynical derision of the beliefs, practices, and norms of an African.. Paper 3. However, Okara's poem can be seen to transcend the acceptance of the derision of the White Man and present a wiser African intellectual. The poem concludes with the African man teaching the White Man of his ignorance and helping him realize that the native beliefs of the African are not primitive nor removed from intellectual thought. As summarized by Pushpa Naidu Parekh, \\"In 'You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed,' the colonizer's mockery and contemptuous disparagement of indigenous African culture and worldview are confronted and ultimately silenced by the warmth of the native's 'fire' laughter.\\"Parekh, Pushpa Naidu, \\"Gabriel Okara\\", in Pushpa Naidu Parekh and Siga Fatima Jagne (eds), Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio- bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1998, pp. 353‚Äì354.

According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"The law was designed to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by controlling runoff at its source with small, cost-effective natural systems instead of treatment facilities. Reducing runoff improves water quality and recharges groundwater...Under the ordinance, builders would be required to use rainwater storage tanks, permeable pavement, infiltration swales or curb bump- outs to manage the water where it falls. Builders unable to manage 100% of a project's runoff on site would be required to pay a penalty of $13 a gallon of runoff not handled there -- a requirement the Building Industry Assn. has been fighting.\\"Los Angeles might require rainwater capture Proposed law would apply to new home-building, larger developments and some redevelopment projects to prevent runoff from reaching the ocean.

They speak one of the language family of the same name. The Jivaro people are famous for their head-hunting raids and shrinking of heads. These raids usually occur once a year in one particular Jivaro neighborhood. The raiding parties usually only attack one homestead per raid, killing the men, spearing the older women to death, and taking younger women as brides. Percentage of male deaths due to warfare amongst the Jivaro, as compared to other indigenous ethnic groups in New Guinea and South America and to some industrialized nations. They also used these as the battle weapons. Jivaro also engage in hunting activities. These activities usually involve a husband and wife hunting with a blow gun and poisoned dart, dabbed with the poisonous plant curare, which stops the heartbeat of the animal. Jivaro usually hunt for monkeys and birds, but they do not rely on hunting as their primary food source. Groups An Achuar man with a blowgun The principal groups are: *Shuar *AchuarShuar in Logro√±o, Ecuador *Humabisa *Aguaruna Some have also named the following: *AntipasStirling, Matthew. 1938 Historical and Ethnographic Materials of the Jivaro Indians Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 117, 2 *MaynaHarner, Michael. 1972 Jivaro: People of the Sacred Waterfalls. . Moreover, the Shiwiar are a group of Achuar speakers living along the Corrientes River, next to Quechua speakers; many Shiwiar also speak this other, unrelated, language.  Religion   Beliefs/Worldview  The Jivaroan worldview is built upon the idea that both animate and inanimate objects hold souls that cannot be seen by our common eyes. These souls contain power, or kar√°ram, that the Jivaroan people believe can be contained and harnessed within one‚Äôs self. Harner talks about these souls, called arutam: > ‚ÄúA person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and > in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is > considered to be so important to an adult male‚Äôs survival that a boy‚Äôs > parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. By repeatedly > killing, one can continually accumulate power through the replacement of old > arutam souls with new ones. This ‚Äútrade-in‚Äù mechanism is an important > feature because, when a person has had the same arutam soul for four or five > years, it tends to leave its sleeping possessor to wander nightly through > the forest. Sooner or later, while it is thus drifting through the trees, > another Jivaro will ‚Äústeal‚Äù it. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to > obtain a new soul before the old one begins nocturnal wanderings. This felt > need encourages the individual to participate in a killing expedition every > few years.‚Äù Killing becomes a vital part of the Jivaro culture. Men are only marriageable after becoming hunters within their communities. The more one kills, the more power one has, granting one immunity of death. Violence is a huge part of Jivaroan culture in respect to this type of soul belief. Harner talks about the main systems of belief within the Jivaroan communities: > ‚ÄúJivaro souls beliefs constitute one of four major autonomous systems of > verbalized thought so far noted in their culture. The other three are the > systems of crop fairy (nungui) beliefs, and kinship system. Since belief in > one system is not explicitly based upon belief in another, an adequate > understanding of Jivaro soul beliefs can be achieved without recourse to the > beliefs regarding nunui, witchcraft, or kinship.‚Äù  Gods and deities  The Jivaroan people have a polytheistic religion. The Jivaro god, Tsungi, is the god of shamanism, and the Jivaro goddess, Nung√ºi, refers to mother earth. Nung√ºi is described as being a short and heavy-set woman, dressed in a black dress. According to Jivaro belief; if Nung√ºi dances in a woman's garden, it will be productive during the harvest season. Living deep underground, she emerges at night to dance in the gardens. Women sing to Nungui to ask her to protect the gardens, and they carefully weed the gardens daily to appease her. Jivaro believe in a protective spirit that comes to them through spirit visions. This spirit, known as Arutam is thought to protect them from injury, disease, and death. The Jivaroan gods and goddesses are deeply tied to nature. There are different creators and gods that explain the origins of man and animal, the occurrence of natural events and relationships that exist in daily life. Their creation myths support their violent culture as ‚Äúit is dominated by a series of battles among the gods and an essential duality of where people are the victims.‚Äù Among the deities are spirits that are known to provide wisdom and protection to the person they are tied to. Some commonly seen animals are the anaconda, pangi, and the giant butterfly wampang. These animals can assist shamans in healing or bewitching people. Through the Jivaroan worldview, it is believed that sickness and death are caused by attacks on one‚Äôs spirit by malevolent shamans. The healing shamans will hold ayahuasca ceremonies and perform different rituals to counteract the work done by witchcraft.  Rituals  Shrunken head from the upper Amazon region Headhunting See: Shrunken Head Jivaro Gardening Unlike many other cultures, the Jivaro cultures place more emphasis on gardening (horticulture) than they do on hunting. This is due to the unpredictable nature of hunting in the Amazonian region, where the Jivaro call home. As a result, a ritualistic approach to gardening sprouted from the Jivaro cultures. Despite the reliable, elaborate system of horticultural development the Jivaro have developed, they still believe the act to be ‚Äú‚Ä¶as fraught with uncertainty as hunting‚Äù as Michael Brown stated in a paper titled, ‚ÄúAguaruna Jivaro Gardening Magic in Alto Rio Mayo, Peru.‚Äù He then went on to say that in order, ‚ÄúTo encourage the growth of their cultivated plants they sing magical gardening songs, perform a set of ritual acts when planting a new garden, and observe certain taboos connected with garden work.‚Äù Much like similar beliefs and rituals associated with hunting, the Jivaro believe that spirits reside in the plants and they need to be encouraged to grow by various songs, chants, and dances. Owing to the belief of spirits residing in the plants, the garden is regarded as a place of great spiritual significance. Like the inside of a temple, the garden is a place where one receives sanctuary. \\"It is one of the few places where a woman can go alone without attracting curiosity and suspicion. It offers privacy from prying eyes and ears and is therefore the site of a certain amount of intra- and extra-marital sexual activity\\" (Brown, 171) = Ayahuasca ceremonies = Ayahuasca ceremonies play a large role in the Jivaro culture. These ceremonies are used for healing practices usually directed toward enchanting spirits. Here, Bradley C. Bennett makes note of these healing practices, > \\"During Healing Ceremony, only shaman and patient drink Natem and will > participate in the singing and chanting while the shaman will perform > different actions to the patients body thought to heal the spirit.\\" The shaman goes about relieving the patient of any harmful spirits that may be attacking his or her body. The Jivaro also believe in an act of what may be considered telling the future or telling time. Bennett makes another note of the Jivaro and their ayahuasca ceremonies, where a Jivaro will hire a shaman to tell of far away friends and family. > \\"The Jivaro shamans, Under the influence of ayahuasca, often believe that > they are seeing distant relatives or sweethearts. These distant persons > apparently have to be individuals with whom the shaman is already > acquainted, so that he can \\"know whom to look for.\\" Also it is normally > necessary for the shaman to be already acquainted with the distant locale > and the route to get there, and preferably he should know the appearance and > location of the house of the person being sought.\\" The Jivaro have been practicing these ceremonies for hundreds of years, keeping them held close to their roots. The ceremonies of the ayahuasca brew continue to be practiced this day.  Beliefs  The Shuar believe that the first being, Tensak, casts a spiritual dart that to curse or heal a person. Bennett recorded that the Tensak \\"exists in a higher plane of existence that can be seen when in the shaman state.\\" Bennett also observed that, as a shaman works to heal spirits and counter bewitching shamans he will consume Banisteriopsis caapi, tobacco and alcohol to help enhance and fuel his trip from the Natem. Confounding factors Jivaro family, c. 1901 Anthropologists have recognized these languages[which?] as distinct peoples, but have called attention to two confounding factors. The first has to do with nomenclature: Jivaroan language speakers typically identify themselves either by their language's word for person (shuar) or by the name of the river on which they live. Consequently, historical sources record either one name for all, or a plethora names of many small Jivaroan tribes, each the name of a different river.Karsten, Rafael. 1935 The Headhunters of Western Amazonas. The Life and Culture of the Jibaro Indians of Eastern Ecuador and Peru, Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, Commentationes Humanarum Littararum VII(l). 2-3 The second reason has to do with social organization. Prior to Ecuadorian or Peruvian colonization and Christian missionization in the 20th century, the principal unit of Jivaroan social organization was the polygynous matrilocal household or cluster of matrilocally-organized households. Notably, although Jivaroans shared the same language and culture, each household or cluster of matrilocally organized households were politically and economically autonomous. Thus, in 1938 Matthew Stirling commented that: He also said that: Prior to colonization and the presence of Christian missionaries, Jivaroan speakers were not organized into any stable and clearly bounded polities or ethnic groups. In response to European colonization and missionization, Jivaroan speakers have formed nucleated settlements that are organized into political federations: the Federaci√≥n Interprovincial de Centros Shuar and the Nacionalidad Achuar de Ecuador in Ecuador, and the Organizaci√≥n Central de Comunidades Aguarunas del Alto Mara√±on and the Consejo Aguaruna y Huambisa in Peru.  Resistance against invaders  At the time of Spanish arrival to South America, the Jivaro were an independent culture and hostile to outsiders. The neighboring Incas tried to subjugate the Jivaroan peoples, but the Inca Empire's expansion attempts failed after a series of bloody confrontations where the Inca army lost against the fierce Jivaroan warriors. The Jivaro put up a similar resistance to Spaniards, who came into their territory searching for placer gold. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the Jivaroan tribes had only limited and intermittent contact with the Spanish. Etymology The word \\"Jivaro\\" is likely a corruption of xivar, a word that means ‚Äúpeople‚Äù in the Shuar Chicham language.Gnerre, Maurizio 1973 ‚ÄúSources of Spanish J√≠varo,‚Äù in Romance Philology 27(2): 203-204. Berkeley: University of California Press. During the Spanish colonial period, \\"Jivaros\\" were viewed as the antithesis of civilized. The word J√≠baro thus entered the Spanish language; in Ecuador it is highly pejorative and signifies \\"savage\\"; outside of Ecuador, especially in Mexico and Puerto Rico, it has come to mean \\"rustic.\\" References External links * Category:Ethnic groups in Peru Category:Indigenous peoples in Peru Category:Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Category:Indigenous peoples in Ecuador Category:Headhunting ja:„Éí„Éê„É≠Êóè ","title":"Jivaroan peoples"},{"id":"20314803","text":"The Patrician Secondary School () in Newbridge, County Kildare was founded on 26 August 1958 by the Patrician Brothers in Charlotte House, Station Road.

The Br√•nemark Osseointegration Center (BOC), named after its founder, was founded in 1989 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Biography After studying at Lund University in Sweden, Br√•nemark became professor of Anatomy at Gothenburg University in 1969. Br√•nemark has been awarded many prizes for his work, including the coveted Swedish Society of Medicine's Soederberg Prize in 1992‚Äîoften referred to as the 'mini-Nobel'‚Äîand the Swedish Engineering Academy's equally prestigious medal for technical innovation. Br√•nemark has also been honored with the Harvard School of Dental Medicine Medal for his work on dental implants in the United States and holds more than 30 honorary positions throughout Europe and North America, including the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK. In 2003, he received an honorary doctorate from the European University of Madrid. He was the winner of the European Inventor Award 2011 in the category Lifetime achievement. In 2014, he died at the age of 85. Dental implantology In 1978, the first Dental Implant Consensus Conference was held, sponsored jointly by the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University. It was a landmark event, at which retrospective data on dental implants were collected and analyzed and criteria and standards for implant dentistry were established. In 1982 in Toronto, Br√•nemark presented work that had begun 15 years earlier in Gothenburg. Br√•nemark's investigations into the phenomenon of osseointegration, or the biological fusion of bone to a foreign material, reinvigorated the field of implantology. The Toronto conference brought widespread recognition to the Br√•nemark implant methods and materials and is one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry since the late 1970s. The Br√•nemark System of dental implants was bought out and is currently available from Nobel Biocare. Work on osseointegration Radiograph of Br√•nemark's initial rabbit specimen, showing the titanium optic chamber fixed to the rabbit's tibia and fibula. The distal extent of the rabbit's femur can be seen at the left of the radiograph, completely unrelated to the screw, despite some sources (such as Block & Kent's textbook) claiming that Br√•nemark's study involved the femur. Br√•nemark's work in the field of osseointegration reinvigorated the realm of implant dentistry and brought it from being a shunned field into one that became recognized and incorporated into dental school curricula and training programs.Shulman, LB; Driskell, TD: Dental Implants: A Historical Perspective. In Block, M; Kent, J; Guerra, L, editors: Implants in Dentistry. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders, 1997. page 6. Early modern dental implant technology consisted of blade and transosteal implants. Blade implants, introduced in 1967, consisted of a metal blade that was placed within a bony incision that subsequently healed over the horizontally situated piece of metal but allowed a vertical segment to perforate the healed surface. Transosteal implants, the application of which was strictly limited to the mandible, consisted of a number of screws which were inserted into the inferior aspect of the mandible, some of which extended through and through into the oral cavity.Shulman, LB; Driskell, TD: Dental Implants: A Historical Perspective. In Block, M; Kent, J; Guerra, L, editors: Implants in Dentistry. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders, 1997. page 6 It was previously thought that both of these implant types relied on mechanical retention, as it was heretofor unknown that metal could be fused into the bone. With the advent of our current understanding of osseointegration however, rootform endosteal implants became the new standard in implant technology. The phenomenon of osseointegration was first described by Bothe et al. in 1940 and later by Leventhal et al. in 1951. Br√•nemark's studies, and his subsequent coining of the phrase osseointegration, occurred a year after Leventhal during vital microscopy studies in rabbits using titanium optic chambers. He and his team found that titanium oculars placed into the lower leg bones of rabbits could not be removed from the bones after a period of healing (see photo at right).Br√•nemark, PI: Introduction to osseointegration. In Br√•nemark, PI; Zarb, G; Albrektsson, T, editors: Tissue-Integrated Prostheses - Osseointegration in Clinical Dentistry. Quintessence Publishing, Co., Inc. Chicago, page 26. He then developed and tested a type of dental implant utilizing pure titanium screws, which he termed fixtures. Although the field of implantology was eschewed by dental academia until that time, the \\"extensive and weighty documentation of implant efficacy and safety\\" and \\"early replication by reliable, independent researchers\\" resulted in the widespread embrace of implantology by the dental community.

He was a pioneer in the study of entrepreneurship and corporate governance.  Early life  Mace was born in Montevideo, Minnesota, son of Jack Mace. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1934 and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) in 1936. He was admitted to the Minnesota Bar, but decided to further his education at the Harvard Business School, where he received his M.B.A. in 1938. He took a job at HBS after graduation as a research associate before leaving for military service four years later. He left the U.S. Air Force in 1946 as a Lieutenant Colonel, having been awarded the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster.  Career at HBS  Mace returned to HBS and created the first-ever course in entrepreneurship at Harvard. Titled The Management of New Enterprises, the course has remained, in various incarnations, a fixture of the HBS curriculum for decades and is regarded as the foundation of the School's extensive entrepreneurial management program. Mace's longstanding interest in corporate governance began with the research he undertook for his Harvard doctoral dissertation, which was published as a book in 1948 under the title The Boards of Directors of Small Corporations. Following the publication of two additional books, Growth and Development of Executives and Management Problems of Corporate Acquisitions, Mace took a leave of absence from his teaching duties to undertake a project involving in-depth interviews with more than 100 chief executive officers and board members. The result was the 1971 publication of the influential book Directors: Myth and Reality. Mace's research on boards of directors aroused significant interest and controversy in the business community by uncovering the fact that many boards were too symbolic mere rubber stamps for top management. Putting his research into practice, Mace served on the boards of Litton Industries; Interchemical Corp.; Jostens, Inc.; Hanes Corp.; Squibb BeechNut; Camp, Dresser & McKee; United Technologies; and Harte-Hanks Newspapers. In 1955, Mace accepted an offer to join Charles B. (Tex) Thornton, who had just bought the Litton Co., a small electronics firm in California. Working with Thornton from 1955 to 1958 as vice president and general manager of the Electronics Equipment Division, Mace guided Litton's annual sales growth from $3 million to more than $80 million, as the company went on to become one of the most famous conglomerates in the history of American business. Mace returned to HBS, where he remained until his retirement in 1972. During those years, he involved himself in a number of School activities, from teaching in a program for faculty members from foreign business schools to serving as the School's first associate dean for external affairs.  Family  Mace married Adelaide Rowley, daughter of Professor Frank B. Rowley, and had at least three children, sons Myles Jr., Nicky and Terry (Terrence).  Retirement  In retirement, Mace remained active despite becoming blind because of glaucoma. He acted as contributing editor of the Harvard Business Review from 1975 to 1978. He also continued to serve on several boards, wrote articles, and was consulted frequently by former students and colleagues. In 1984, Mace received HBS‚Äôs highest honor, the Distinguished Service Award. He died in Massachusetts in 2000. Archives and records *Myles L.

Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U.S. 57 (1969), is a 1969 decision of the United States Supreme Court on the legal standard governing the obviousness of claimed inventions. It stands for the proposition that, when old elements are combined in a way such that they do not interact in a novel, unobvious way, then the resulting combination is obvious and therefore unpatentable. Background Drawing of the machine patented in this case The patent. sought to solve a problem in paving asphalt roads‚Äîthe joint between the new section and old, cold sections tends to bond poorly. Previously, one machine spread and shaped the new deposit of asphalt and a second machine contained a radiant-heat burner, which softened cold asphalt. The claimed invention combined on one machine chassis the spreading and shaping equipment along with a radiant-heat burner. The defendant highway constructor's alleged infringement resulted from its placing of a radiant-heat burner on the front of a standard paving machine. This allowed \\"its machine to perform the same functions with the same basic elements as those described in [the] patent.\\". Proceedings in lower courts District court ruling The patent owner, Pavement Salvage Company, sued the highway constructor, Anderson's-Black Rock, in the United States District Court at Charleston, West Virginia. The district court held the claimed invention obvious and the patent invalid, because (according to the court of appeals) it believed that it was known that the answer to the problem of cold joints lay in heat treatment and that a generator of the type described by the inventor \\"would do the job.\\" The district judge concluded: > The question of radiant heat was old in the art. The pivotal question would > more logically appear to be, assuming that the radiant heat would work > effectively, was it obvious that a more successful machine would evolve if > all of the elements were constructed on one chassis? It is my opinion that > such a combination was reasonably obvious to one possessing ordinary skill > in the art.Pavement Salvage Co., 308 F. Supp. at 945. Court of appeals ruling The patent owner appealed and the Fourth Circuit reversed (2-1). It held: > The defense is simply obviousness. The prior art, however, is predominantly > a long history of failure to solve the problem by heat treatment. At a time > when the industry was concentrating on a quite different, though expensive, > partial corrective, there was nothing in the junk pile of prior art heat > treatment patents to make it obvious to anyone that they supplied the > ultimate solution. That this is so is forcefully demonstrated by the > duration of the fruitless search, by the skepticism and incredulity with > which experts in the field received Neville's disclosure, by its commercial > success after demonstrations dissipated the disbelief of the experts, by the > conduct of competitors in accepting licenses and purchasing equipment and > the bold tribute of the alleged infringer in hailing it as the very > antithesis of the obvious. One judge dissented. He said, \\"Nor is it demonstrated to my satisfaction that the combination on one chassis of the paving machine and heat generator is necessary to produce the desired result. Yet, the combination is held patentable, though for all we know the same desired result may be achieved by two machines juxtaposed and separately propelled.\\" Supreme Court ruling The Supreme Court, without dissent, reversed the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and reinstated the judgment of the district court. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court agreed with the reasoning of the district court and the court of appeals dissent that combining the claimed elements of the patent was obvious: \\"A separate heater can also be used in conjunction with a standard paving machine to eliminate the cold joint, and in fact is so used for heating the transverse joints of the pavement.\\"Anderson's-Black Rock, 396 U.S. at 59. The Court continued, \\"The combination of putting the burner together with the other elements in one machine, though perhaps a matter of great convenience, did not produce a 'new or different function.Anderson's-Black Rock, 396 U.S. at 60 (quoting Lincoln Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 303 U.S. 545, 549 (1938)). The Court also dismissed the Fourth Circuit's reliance on commercial success, because \\"those matters without invention will not make patentability.\\"Anderson's-Black Rock, 396 U.S. at 61. Pointing to the Supreme Court's 1966 ruling in Graham v. John Deere Co.,383 U.S. 1, 6 (1966). the Court said, as that case held, that \\"[t]he patent standard is basically constitutional, Article I, ¬ß 8, of the Constitution,\\" and thus under that grant of power authorizing Congress \\"to promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts\\" Congress may not \\"enlarge the patent monopoly without regard to the innovation, advancement or social benefit gained thereby. . . . This is the standard expressed in the Constitution and it may not be ignored.\\" Therefore, based on the methodology commanded in the Graham case, the Court held the claimed combination obvious: > We conclude that while the combination of old elements performed a useful > function, it added nothing to the nature and quality of the radiant-heat > burner already patented. We conclude further that to those skilled in the > art the use of the old elements in combination was not an invention by the > obvious-nonobvious standard. Use of the radiant-heat burner in this > important field marked a successful venture. But as noted, more than that is > needed for invention.Anderson's-Black Rock, 396 U.S. at 62-63.  Subsequent developments  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for many years ignored and refused to cite or follow the Black Rock decision. But the 2007 Supreme Court decision in KSR v. Teflex,. which cited and followed Black Rock for the proposition that \\"a court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions,\\" gave the Federal Circuit \\"forceful instruction\\"Lawrence Ebert, More on the impact of KSR, (May 1, 2007). to change its approach. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the KSR case, the Federal Circuit began to defer to the Black Rock decision.See See also Sundance, Inc. v. Demonte Fabricating Ltd., 550 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Before Dystar the Federal Circuit appears to have cited Black Rock only twice, in 1984 and 1985.

It was opened in 1986 by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). This special unit of 16 isolation cells was sealed off in a basement from the other prisoners. Reports from different human rights organization including Amnesty International brought the attention to the existence of the unit and the inhumane treatment of prisoners. Conditions The HSU prisoners lived in constant artificial lights 24 hours a day. Personal property was forbidden. Camera and visual surveillance recorded every activity. There were periods when the guards experimented with sleep deprivation: waking the prisoners every hour during the night. When prisoners filed complaints, the guards started waking them every half hour. Contact with the outside world was sharply restricted: Visitations were limited.

The collections of Archival Library, as well as those of the later folklore and cultural history archives, were placed there. Today it is the main building of the Estonian Literary Museum, to which three extensions have been added. During the Second World War, the institute was split into two state museums covering ethnography and literature. In 1946 the museums were re-combined. Starting in 1957 the Literary Museum has held a two-day conference on literature and folklore each December, the so-called \\"Kreutzwald days to remember\\" (Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald is an important Estonian writer). Some years after the restoration of independence in 1995, the museum received its former name back and extended the publication of its annual almanac to articles, primary source texts and research. Databases There are about 50 databases in the Estonian Literary Museum. Most of them are specialized databases, for example, the graffiti database, the Estonian Runic Songs database and a database in English - the Estonian Droodles.Databases of the Estonian Literary Museum (Accessed 03.10.2017)Folklore.ee Databases(Accessed 03.10.2017) Some of the databases have an option to be used in English. By 2016, the Estonian Literary Museum had 65 TB of data in its digital databases which is planned to increase up to 130 TB in the course of the project \\"Development of the Estonian Literary Museum to an International Center for Digital Humanities\\" by 2020.Estonian Literary Museum's project (Accessed 03.10.2017) The databases are very different in size and technical solutions, also, they are created at very different times: from the 90's to the present. For example, in 2002, the database Analytic bibliography of Estonian Journalism was launched.Biblioserver. (Accessed 04.09.2017) The databases range from simple web publications to more complex structured databases such as the Kreutzwald's century. Content can be given in both digitized and text form, as well as pictures, sound and videos, accompanied with comprehensive metadata, such as time, place, maker etc. A project has also been launched to publish the materials of databases and other collections on the Meta-Share page,Meta-Share (Accessed 03.10.2017) which already includes texts \\"1001 children's games from the year 1935\\".Uka-uka database (Accessed 03.10.2017) Kivike The most central database in the Estonian Literary Museum is the file repository Kivike. It gathers up data from numerous other specialized databases in the Estonian Literary Museum, enabling the user to acquire information with less effort. The user can access the materials of the Estonian Literary Museum and make inquiries, as well as order the materials from the archives for further use. The materials in Kivike are free for research and teaching purposes.Kivike (Accessed 03.10.2017) To date, there are 335668 items (34 TB) in Kivike, a more detailed overview is given with the table on Kivike's website.Kivikese arvandmed (Accessed 03.10.2017) Pictures of the ELM ELM Panorama (2017).

It was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 53 years, during which four storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983 and ended November 30, 1983. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form. The first named storm, Hurricane Alicia, formed on August 15. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Dean, dissipated on September 30. This season produced seven tropical depressions, of which four became named storms; three attained hurricane status, of which one became a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The most notable storm in 1983 was Hurricane Alicia, which killed 21 people and caused $2.6 billion (1983 USD; $5.6 billion 2008 USD) in damages, making it the costliest storm, at the time, in Texas history. As a result of its intensity, the name Alicia was subsequently retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization. Another notable storm, Hurricane Barry, made landfall on Florida as a tropical storm, then, after crossing into the Gulf of Mexico crossing, strengthened into a weak Category 1 hurricane that traveled almost due west across the Gulf before making landfall in extreme northern Mexico. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included. By convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.

Description Ventral view ;Adult The wingspan is 29‚Äì48 mm. The forewing has two yellow-rimmed black eyespots on both sides, dorsal and ventral. The hindwing has two spots on the dorsal side but have smaller spots on the ventral. The other all color is light brown. The wood satyr is comparably larger than sosybia. ;Caterpillar The body is light greenish brown with a dark dorsal line and alternating brown and yellowish lateral stripes. The surface of the caterpillar has bumps, these bumps bear short reddish-brown hairs. The head is dirty white while the tail hairs are light gray. The wood satyr is part of the typically Neotropical subtribe Euptychiina. It can be observed in forests, usually along the edges and in brush-filled openings along cleared forest roads. It has also been observed in grassy areas usually between forested patches. It flies near the ground, twisting between and through grasses, small trees and bushes. Collectors have found it often difficult to capture, though it appears to be a slow flyer at first glance. This butterfly prefers habitat that is open, contains deciduous trees along with marshy areas and possessing brushy cover. Range and habitat They are seen in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, from Nova Scotia south into Florida, west to Texas, Saskatchewan and Wyoming. As the name implies the little wood satyr is most commonly seen in woods and shrubby areas. Life cycle Adults in the northern portions of their range fly between June and July while their southern populations fly between March and September. Adults have a slow \\"bouncing\\" flight but they will rise as far as the top of tall trees. Females lay eggs singly on grass, the fourth-instar caterpillars hibernate.

It formerly was a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Background St. Peter's f has its roots in Germany when an entire village chose to immigrate to America rather than give up their religious heritage. The congregation started a Christian Day School in 1843, that continues to provide education for children from the surrounding communities. St. Peter's originally was a member of the Buffalo Synod, which through a series of mergers became part of the American Lutheran Church, and finally, the ELCA. The need to make Christ known has most recently taken the shape of exchanging the structures of denominational Lutheranism for the freedom of function offered by LCMC. School history The first educational building in Walmore was built of clay and timber at the north end of a lot donated by Friedrich Haseley. The back of the building was partitioned off and served as living quarters for the teacher. In 1873, the school burned. The fire was discovered in the back part of the building during school hours. Teacher F. Wilhelm Wendt got the children to safety and saved as much of the furnishings and equipment as possible, while one of the boys, following Mr. Wendt's orders, ran over to the church and rang the church bell. The furious clanging of the bell, coming unexpectedly in the middle of the afternoon, notified the Walmore families that some disaster had occurred. Men gathered at the school as quickly as possible to save what they could and put out the blaze. It was not possible to repair the building, however. The second school, a brick structure, was erected in 1875. The school building which served for 77 years had one room where seven grades were taught by one teacher. The concept of this kind of arrangement seems impossible today. The basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic were taught. Proper writing technique was very important at the school. A poor or incorrect technique would result in a lower grade or rewriting the assignment. Other subjects included geography, history, and spelling. Spelling bees were a fun way of sharpening skills. Teaching religion was of first importance. For the first and second grades this meant memorizing Luther's Small Catechism; third, fourth and fifth graders would continue by memorizing the so-called \\"large catechism\\", which was a question and answer explanation of the five parts of the catechism as well as accompanying Bible verses. By the time a child was confirmed he was expected to have memorized the entire catechism. The sixth and seventh grades prepared for confirmation by attending daily hour-long confirmation classes with the pastor. Music has always been a very important part of the curriculum - hymns memorized and sung in school and for Christmas Eve services and school picnic programs; by 1960 training was expanded to include theory as well as singing in four part harmony. Classes were taught mostly in the German language until World War I. Anti-German sentiment was so strong that the schools were told to introduce teaching classes in English. German and English reading and writing (German script) continued to be taught well into the 1930s and German language religion, and confirmation remained in effect until the early 1940s. A peculiar custom was that the day after confirmation (usually in April) the newly-confirmed students would continue their schooling in the public school, rather than going to the next grade at the beginning of the school year. This seemingly overwhelming schedule of classes, and variety of subjects to be taught by a single teacher, required much cooperation from the parents as well as very strict discipline of the students. It usually fell to the mothers to help the children with daily memorization work; homework in most subjects was also on a daily basis. Strict discipline meant \\"no talking aloud without permission, ask permission to get up from your seat, no whispering, no turning around, no gum chewing, just sit and study\\". Minor infractions meant writing \\"lines 10-25\\" a certain number of times. Major offenses could mean writing 100-200 \\"lines\\", staying in at recess or lunch hour, or for the incorrigible ones, punishment could mean being sent out to cut a willow branch and it would then be used to spank the child. Christmas Eve was a time of great expectation, even as it is today. Hours had been spent in preparation for the church program; songs had to be rehearsed, recitations memorized. At the end of the service, the trustees distributed a candy bag to each child. The contents were usually a small paper bag of hard candy, chocolate drops, and sugar cream candy, while the large bag held an assortment of unshelled nuts. Before electricity was installed, the Christmas tree was trimmed with candles. Trustees were assigned to sit near the tree with buckets of sand, in case the tree caught fire. The school built in 1875 remained in use until 1954. The brick building was one large school room. There was a pot bellied stove in the northwest comer to provide heat and as many desks as required to accommodate the fluctuating number of students. The unheated entrance was used as a cloak room. There was no indoor plumbing; two \\"little houses\\" complete with Sears catalogs served as \\"Johnny on the Spot\\". Students were also responsible for chores around the school. The girls took turns sweeping the room; the boys provided wood for the stove, removed ashes, and also carried water from the well to the water container. By the late 1940s, it became increasingly apparent that the old school was inadequate to serve the increasing number of students and the changing requirements in the educational system. The present school was dedicated in 1954 under the leadership of Reverend Martin Pempeit. Mrs. Pempeit and Miss Williams were the first teachers in the new school. Subsequently, over the years the scope and size of St. Peter's Christian Day School has changed and increased to include foreign languages, home economics, and computer science. Present enrollment is 108 students, five full-time teachers, three part-time teachers, two part-time teachers aides, one part- time secretary and one part-time principal. The grades range from pre-school through grade 8. Parents and parishioners alike continue their commitment to provide an excellent educational opportunity for the children.  Church history  Significant changes in the community took place after World War II. Many of the returning veterans found employment other than the farming they had left behind. New people moved into the community. Walmore was affected by the same changes as the rest of the nation. English language services were not introduced at St. Peter's until the early 1930s. Almost exclusively German services were conducted until the early 1940s. The school dedication booklet dated 1953 lists the services for each Sunday as German service at 9:30 a.m. and English service at 10:45 a.m. While High German is seldom used today, a number of parishioners are still very fluent in speaking Low German and often speak it in their homes.

Alexander John Forsyth, The Gazetteer for Scotland (2008) Gunsmiths like Joseph Manton invented more reliable forms of ignition, like the tube lock in 1814. The artist Joshua Shaw designed what is recognized today as the percussion cap, which he patented in the United States in 1822, since Forsyth had threatened his rivals in Britain with legal action. These new forms of ignition proved popular among hunters during the Regency period, who had their old reliable flintlocks converted.Ricketts, H., Firearms (London, 1962) Life He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and succeeded his father as minister of Belhelvie in 1791.Myatt, F, 19th Century Firearms (London, 1989) p.18 While hunting wild duck, he was dissatisfied with his flintlock fowling-piece due to its long lock time (the delay between the time the trigger is pulled and the time the main charge of gunpowder begins burning); by the time the pellets actually left the barrel, the target animal could hear the noise from the trigger being pulled and have time to either fly, dive, or run before the shot reached it. He began his research into the use of fulminates of mercury or silver in 1805. He patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with fulminate of mercuryAlexander Forsyth in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica During the Napoleonic Wars Forsyth worked on his design at the Tower Armouries. But when a new Master General of Ordnance was appointed he was dismissed; other experiments had had destructive results and the new master general did not wish to see Britain's main arsenal destroyed. Napoleon Bonaparte offered Forsyth a reward of ¬£20,000 if he took his invention to France, but Forsyth declined. The French gunsmith Jean Lepage developed a similar form of ignition in 1807 based on Forsyth's design, but this was not pursued.

Initially formed in 1962 as a new Tasmanian branch of the Country Party of Australia after decades of inactivity in the state, it at first enjoyed no electoral success. In the run up to the 1969 election the party was joined by Kevin Lyons, a former Liberal turned independent member of the Assembly for Braddon, who renamed it the Centre Party and retained his seat at the election, securing the balance of power and serving as Deputy Premier in a coalition government until 1972. Upon the coalition's collapse the Centre Party faded away before being dissolved in 1975. The party first contested the 1964 state election, winning 9,280 votes (5.26%) but no seats. Kevin Lyons, the son of the late Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, was originally a member of the Liberal Party. In 1966, a dispute arose over preselection and Lyons resigned from the Liberals on 7 September.LYONS, Kevin Orchard, Tasmanian Parliamentary profile. Lyons remained in the House of Assembly as an independent, until the 1969 election when he joined the party and renamed it as the Centre Party.Petrow, Stefan: Country Party, The Companion to Tasmanian History (University of Tasmania). Although the party's vote slipped to 8,160 (4.31%), Lyons was re-elected to the House of Assembly as the party's only MHA, after substantial numbers of preferences were transferred to him from Liberal voters in the electorate of Darwin. Labor and the Liberals both won 17 seats in the House, resulting in a hung parliament, with the Centre Party's one seat giving Lyons the balance of power. In negotiations with Liberal leader Angus Bethune, Lyons agreed to form a coalition with the Liberals, and became Bethune's Deputy Premier. The Liberal- Centre coalition lasted until 1972, with Lyons resigning as Deputy Premier after a dispute with Bethune, effectively dissolving the party and the coalition. The resulting instability triggered the 1972 election, which was the Centre Party did not contest. The party's last contests came in the federal elections of 1974 and 1975 (by now as the National Country Party) but had no success. The party disappeared that year.

Large woody debris (LWD) are the logs, sticks, branches, and other wood that falls into streams and rivers. This debris can influence the flow and the shape of the stream channel. Large woody debris, grains, and the shape of the bed of the stream are the three main providers of flow resistance, and are thus, a major influence on the shape of the stream channel.Curran, Janet H. \\"Flow Resistance of Large Woody Debris in Headwater Streams of the Washington Cascades\\" Abstracts with Programs - Geological Society of America, vol.29, no.6, pp.315, 1997 Some stream channels have less LWD than they would naturally because of removal by watershed managers for flood control and aesthetic reasons. The study of woody debris is important for its forestry management implications. Plantation thinning can reduce the potential for recruitment of LWD into proximal streams. The presence of large woody debris is important in the formation of pools which serve as salmon habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Entrainment of the large woody debris in a stream can also cause erosion and scouring around and under the LWD. The amount of scouring and erosion is determined by the ratio of the diameter of the piece, to the depth of the stream, and the embedding and orientation of the piece. Large woody debris helps to form pools in streams which are important habitats for fish and other species. Influence on stream flow around bends Large woody debris slow the flow through a bend in the stream, while accelerating flow in the constricted area downstream of the obstruction.Daniels, Melinda D; Rhoads, Bruce L \\"Influence of experimental removal of large woody debris on spatial patterns of three-dimensional flow in a meander bend\\" Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, vol.32, no.3, pp.460-474, Mar 2007 See also *Beaver dam *Coarse woody debris *Driftwood *Log jam *Stream restoration References Category:Dead wood Category:Hydrology Category:Forest ecology Category:Habitat ","title":"Large woody debris"},{"id":"20315566","text":"Willis Nelson Dysart (March 15, 1923 in Omega, Georgia - November 8, 2011)The Mental Calculator's Handbook, Fountain and van Koningsveld, 2013, pages 476-483. was an American mental calculator. His talent for arithmetic emerged at the age of three after his mother taught him to count. He quit school in the third grade (age 9) and pursued a career as a lightning calculator.Mickey: Short Stories and Anecdotes - Neurosis Can Be a Good Thing After All, R.E. McCoy 2004, pp 39-40Raleigh Register, September 13, 1949The New York Times, May 2, 1938Los Angeles Herald, December 27, 1964 In 1938 Robert Ripley featured Dysart in his 'Believe It Or Not' newspaper column and introduced what would become Dysart's stage name - 'Willie the Wizard'. In 1940 Dysart was recruited by a local radio station to tally votes in the US presidential election. Dysart would very quickly (much more quickly than rival radio stations aided by calculating machines) give \\"the exact standing of any candidate on the board, including his current total, the percentage of votes counted at that point and the probable outcome of the contest on the basis of existing information\\". Not content with that, Dysart would provide a little entertainment by, for instance, asking for the birth dates of the candidates and immediately giving the years, months, hours, minutes and seconds they had lived to that momentStrange people, Frank Edwards, Lyle Stuart (New York) 1961, pp 69-70 Dysart has given many live demonstrations of his skill at a range of venues. He has also appeared on numerous television shows, including I've Got a Secret, You Asked For It, The Art Linkletter Show and The Joe Pyne Show, which made him famous in the United States. He has also been the subject of psychological studies.East Los Angeles Gazette, April 12, 1964Long Beach Press Telegram, December 20, 1942 Although excelling at all kinds of arithmetic, Dysart's most startling demonstrations have been in addition and multiplication. Multiplying a pair of three-digit numbers is for Dysart a trivial task, which is why he breaks larger numbers into groups of three digits before multiplying them (many of the multiplications reported to have been made by Dysart involve six or nine-digit numbers). In this respect Dysart is unique among the documented calculators, some of whom ‚Äì most notably Dutchman Wim Klein ‚Äì multiplied large numbers by breaking them up into groups of two-digit numbers but never three-digit numbers. It took Dysart less than 10 seconds to multiply a pair of nine-digit numbers.Long Beach Independent, February 9, 1949South Gate Press, March 19, 1975Readings in Psychology Today: Some Memory Freaks I Have Known, James B.

He played college football and college baseball at the University of Minnesota, and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round of the 2010 NFL Draft. After four seasons with the Broncos, he played for the New York Jets for three years and then the Tennessee Titans for one year. Early years Decker attended Rocori High School in Cold Spring, Minnesota.

Additionally, he was named football team MVP two years in a row. During his prep football career he had 2,156 receiving yards and 28 touchdowns. College career Decker attended the University of Minnesota. He made his collegiate debut against Kent State and had a single reception for a 39-yard touchdown from quarterback Bryan Cupito. On September 23, in a game at Purdue, he completed a 22-yard pass. As a freshman, Decker finished with 378 receiving yards and three touchdowns.

In early spring 2009, Decker met with Thomas Goudy, a wide-out coach in St. Louis, Missouri. Goudy helped Decker with his ball-holding technique. Decker spent three weeks in his training camp before starting the summer conditioning camp. Decker began the season with the consistent play that had been a hallmark of his Gophers' career. Through three games, Decker was sixth in the nation in receiving yards, with 183 yards against Syracuse, 113 yards against Air Force, and 119 yards and two touchdowns against California.

As a result, he was unable to participate in both the NFL combine and Minnesota‚Äôs pro day workout. He scored a 43 on the Wonderlic test at the combine, the top score for the group of prospects who took the test in Indianapolis. Denver Broncos =2010 season: Rookie year= Decker in 2010 Decker was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round (87th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year contract through 2013 worth $2,522,000. Due to foot surgery, Decker sat out during Broncos rookie mini-camp and OTA's. Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said he hoped he'd be ready by the season's opener, ‚ÄúAt this point we're going to err on the side of being real careful and not put them in a situation where (it‚Äôs) the last day of minicamp on June 13th and all of a sudden we have a foot injury,\\" said McDaniels. \\"Hopefully, everybody will be ready by August.‚Äù On July 27, 2010, the Broncos signed Decker to a 4-year contract. In the preseason, Decker led all NFL rookies in receptions, but due to the Broncos' depth at receiver, Decker didn't see much action in the offense until late in the regular season. He did contribute on special teams, however, recording seven special teams tackles while returning 17 kickoffs for 429 yards giving him 25.2 yards per return average. Toward the end of the season, the Broncos did start to mix Decker into the offense more, after fellow rookie Demaryius Thomas (a first round draft pick) went down with an injury. Decker finished his rookie season with six receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. =2011 season= Decker's role in Denver's offense expanded in 2011.

On November 13, in a Week 10 divisional road game at Arrowhead Stadium against the division-rival Kansas City Chiefs, starting quarterback Tim Tebow attempted a pair of deep passes for Decker, the first almost being hauled in off a deflection and the other being knocked down by the defender, but in the fourth quarter, with Denver hanging on to a slim 10-7 lead, Tebow hit Decker on a go route deep for a 56-yard touchdown catch, Decker's only catch of the game and only Tebow's second completion, as the Broncos won 17-10 to move into a second-place tie in the AFC West with the San Diego Chargers and Chiefs. In the first round of the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Decker was taken out of the game due to injury. Decker finished the 2011 season with 44 receptions for 612 yards and eight touchdowns. =2012 season= Heading into the 2012 regular season, Decker seemed primed to have a productive year with veteran quarterback Peyton Manning running Denver's offense.

It resembles an American Foxhound but is smaller. It was named after Halden, a town in southeastern Norway. Description Appearance The Halden is similar to the American Foxhound in appearance although it is smaller. Haldens stand between 17 and 21.5 inches at the shoulder, and weigh approximately 40-55 lbs. They have smooth, very dense coats, hanging ears, and are white with black patches as well as brown shading on the head and legs. They are strong dogs with rectangular bodies and straight, solid backs. The tail is fairly thick, carried low, and hangs down toward the hocks. The skull is slightly domed with a pronounced stop and a straight nosebridge. The cheeks are flat. The ears are pendulous and curled, and the eyes are dark brown and kind. The nose is black. Breeders of Haldens aim for a particular foot shape, with high, tight, long toes and dense fur, for greater stability and warmth as the terrain they hunt through is often snowy and difficult to navigate.De Prisco, Andrew, and Johnson, James B. The Mini-Atlas of Dog Breeds. Neptune City, NJ:TFH Publications,1990. .Wilcox, Bonnie, and Walkowicz, Chris. The Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World . Neptune City, NJ: TFH Publications, 1995. Temperament The Halden is a loving and an affectionate pet as well as a good hunting breed. They are said to be good family dogs and to behave well with children. Haldens are hardy and energetic, able to bear cold weather and maintain a quick pace for extended periods. They do best in homes with large areas to play or owners who provide extensive exercise. Prolonged periods of inactivity can cause them to become restless and unhappy. The Halden does not hunt in packs, as many hounds do. They are bred to hunt alone with their owner.Fogle, Bruce. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2000. Health The Halden is a healthy breed, with no known health problems. They have an average lifespan of 12 years. History The Halden is one of three Norwegian hare hound breeds, and is the smallest in size. Bred for scent hunting, the breed is believed to have been developed through crossing local Norwegian scenthounds with scenthounds from Sweden, Germany, and England. It was first developed in the early 1900s, and the breed standard was established in the 1950s. The Halden is relatively rare, seldom seen outside Norway.Grandjean, Dominique, DVM.

There are two known subspecies:. *N. m. mitchellii, the nominate subspecies, commonly called Mitchell's satyr or Mitchell's marsh satyr, is found in Michigan and Indiana. The species is presumably extirpated from former ranges in Ohio (last seen in the 1950s), New Jersey (last seen in 1988), and Wisconsin. *N. m. francisci, commonly called Saint Francis' satyr, is found in a single metapopulation in a 10 √ó 10 km area of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Recent discoveries since 1998 of populations in Alabama, Mississippi, and Virginia are being studied for taxonomic classification, and may be grouped with N. m. mitchellii or be described as new subspecies. All subspecies, including those newly discovered, are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act. Its larvae can feed upon the highly-invasive Japanese stilt grass Microstegium vimineum, so populations of this butterfly are potentially at risk from efforts to remove stilt grass. A butterfly of similar appearance, the Carolina satyr (Hermeuptychia sosybius), is also able to feed upon stilt grass. Description Both subspecies are small brown butterflies with a wingspan rage of 34‚Äì44 mm. The upper surfaces of their wings are unmarked, while the undersides of the wings have rows of round, yellow-ringed eyespots. N. m. francisci is slightly darker, with more irregularly shaped eyespots. Their eggs are greenish white to cream, becoming tan as they age. The larvae's dark head can be seen a day or two before hatching. First instar larvae, 3‚Äì4 mm long, have dark brown bilobed heads, while four subsequent instars, 6‚Äì12 mm long, have green bilobed heads, and green bodies with raised white ridges along the sides. The chrysalis are 10.5‚Äì15.5 mm long, suspended with the head down. It is a light lime green, with pale green or white speckling, and turns a medium brown about two days before eclosion.

Life and career William Paris Chambers was born in Newport, Pennsylvania but spent most of his early years in Newville, Pennsylvania. It was in Newville that he studied music, quickly becoming a proficient performer on the cornet, which he began to study around age thirteen. By the age of eighteen he was conducting the Keystone Cornet Band. At the age of twenty-five, he conducted the Capital City Band of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was also given credit for bringing the Chambersburg and Martinsburg bands into statewide fame. Between 1887 and 1893 he conducted the Great-Southern Band of Baltimore, Maryland. While on a tour with the Great-Southern in 1892 Chambers demonstrated his stamina and skill with the cornet with a solo performed from the 14,500 foot summit of Pike‚Äôs Peak. At the turn of the century, Chambers managed the C.G. Conn store in the city of New York, performing impromptu on the cornet for the customers, including fellow cornet virtuosi. His forte was a phenomenally high register ascending to the third high C. He liked to tell his store audience: ‚ÄúIt is all really very simple; all you have to do is to develop the muscle in and around the lips, by long hours of the right kind of practice, and anyone can do the same things I do on the cornet.‚Äù He was regularly featured in cornet solos with Francesco Fanciulli‚Äôs Seventy-First Regiment Band on the mall at Central Park. In 1905‚Äì1906 he performed cornet solos in Europe and Africa, accompanied by his own band of musicians. One of his favorite concert tricks was to hold the cornet inverted during difficult solos, pushing the valves up instead of down and with the backs of his fingers and maintaining correct tempo. He would sometimes perform on the cornet with the bell touching his right ear. In 1906, he performed for Jules Massenet in Paris. The famous French composer was averse to the cornet, but he relented and accompanied Chambers in his own √âl√©gie Op. 5, No. 10 and afterward complimented Chambers on his performance, saying: ‚ÄúI have just composed a little song, Je t‚Äôaime!, which ought to make a fine effect on the cornet when performed by an artist like yourself.‚Äù Massenet played the piece on the piano and then Chambers performed the work on the cornet. Chambers filed for bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 28, 1908. On February 20, 1910, he performed on the cornet (his wife accompanying him on piano) at the Maine Memorial Service for the United Spanish War Veterans at Carnegie Hall in New York. In 1912 Chambers formed the municipal band in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He returned to Newville, Pennsylvania and while trying to rebuild his health he also rebuilt the band there. W. Paris Chambers died in Newville in 1913 and is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery. Compositions and recordings Chambers wrote several cornet solos and nearly ninety marches. His most widely known works include The Boys of the Old Brigade (unrelated to the Irish republican song of the same name) and Chicago Tribune, both marches. His compositions have been called ‚Äúsome of the finest and most difficult works in the American march repertoire.‚Äù Chambers‚Äôs compositions were published by John Church, Harry Coleman, Carl Fischer Music, J. W. Pepper and Son, Roland F. Seitz, Southern Music, E. F. Kalmus, and Wingert-Jones Music. Chambers was the earliest artist to record the cornet on disc, for Berliner. He performed on Edison and Berliner records (in the 1890s) and on Zonophone (in 1901). Several of his works were performed on Victor records.

Early life  Joshua Shaw was born in Billingborough, Lincolnshire, England in 1776 and was orphaned at the age of 7. To survive he worked for a local farmer as a bird scarer. During the three years he spent doing this work he discovered his artistic talent and began drawing the animals he encountered. After his mother remarried Shaw worked for his stepfather's plumbing and glazing business, and later as a mail carrier.  Artistic career  Witch Duck Creek, oil on canvas, c. 1835. Reynolda House Museum of American Art At the age of 16 Shaw painted his first work: 10 commandments in St Michael's Church. His master, jealous of Shaw's skills, sent him to Manchester to work as a foreman. Shaw was able to find purchasers for his work and emerged from obscurity, traveling to London where his paintings attracted many wealthy clients. Shaw emigrated to the United States in 1817 and by 1819 settled in Philadelphia, where he established himself as an artist. In 1820 he collaborated with John Hill, an aquatint engraver, on a collection of large folio prints titled \\"Picturesque Views of American Scenery.\\" Shaw provided the paintings, which Hill reproduced as prints.Scharf, John Thomas, and Thompson Westcott, History of Philadelphia, 1609‚Äì1884, vol. II (Philadelphia: L.H. Everts & Co., 1884), p. 1059. Shaw's landscape paintings were picturesque in style, a logical result of his English training. His landscapes typically included \\"a dark foreground, generalized trees or hills framing the composition in the foreground and middleground, a stream or lake, and distant hills. All of these elements are a direct influence of Claude Lorraine's 17th-century idealized landscapes of the Roman countryside.\\"Naeve, Milo M., \\"Joshua Shaw,\\" 150 Years of Philadelphia Painters and Paintings: Selections from the Sewell C. Biggs Museum (Philadelphia: The Library Company of Philadelphia and The Sewell C. Biggs Museum of American Art, 1999), p. 11. Claude Lorraine, in turn, was an influence on 18th and early 19th century British landscape painters. Although fellow artist William Dunlap called Shaw \\"an ignorant, conceited English blockhead,\\"Diary of William Dunlap, vol. 2 (New York: The New-York Historical Society, 1943), p. 501. he participated actively in the cultural life of his adopted city. He helped promote the Artists' Fund Society of Philadelphia, established in 1834, and was instrumental in founding the Artists' and Amateurs' Association of Philadelphia in 1839.Scharf, John Thomas, and Thompson Westcott, History of Philadelphia, 1609‚Äì1884, vol.

By 1843 Shaw retired to Bordentown, New Jersey, northeast of Philadelphia. In his retirement he sold few paintings and died in poverty in 1860. The Deluge towards Its Close, oil on canvas, c. 1813. Metropolitan Museum of Art  Inventions  Joshua Shaw (a.k.a. Joseph Shaw) claimed to have invented the copper percussion cap in 1814, but experts no longer consider this a valid claim. He was an early developer of percussion primers and a gun dated to be no earlier than 1817, was made by William Smith of Lisle Street in London to test his prototype steel cap. Shaw, writing in the Journal of the Franklin Institute in 1829 clearly states that he adopted the use fulminate of mercury, which was improvement over the corrosive chlorate of potash fulminate patented by Alexander John Forsyth. In 1816 Forsyth filed for an injunction against Joseph Manton's patent for the tube lock or scent-bottle lockRicketts, Howard. FIREARMS, Pleasures & Treasures. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1962. p.54 and the suit was found in favor of Forsyth in 1818. He also successfully filed suits against Joseph Vicars, William Beckwith, and Jackson Mortimer in 1811; Isaac Riviere in 1819, and Collinson Hall in 1819. Forsyth's patent expired on April 11, 1821. However, there was no evidence these lawsuits influenced Shaw. Shaw went to Philadelphia in 1817 and filed for a patent on June 19, 1822 and surrendered it to the Patent Office in 1829 to obtain a revised patent reissued on May 7, 1829. His patent was overturned by Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York in October 1829 and upheld in by the U.S. Supreme Court in January 1833.Shaw v. Cooper, Page 32, U.S. Petition 292 At some point prior to 1823 the U.S. Ordnance Department converted one of John Hall's breech-loading rifles to test Shaw's percussion caps and based on this, despite the Supreme Court ruling, successfully petitioned Congress House of Representatives, Bills and Resolutions, 29th Congress, 1st session, H.R. 206, February 10, 1846 for compensation for use of his patent. In 1846 the U.S. Congress authorized a payment to Shaw in the amount of $25,000. He received $18,000 on May 4, 1847 and the remainder by 1858. During the Regency era the percussion cap, along with Forsyth and Manton's inventions, became popular among hunters on both sides of the Atlantic. By 1827 copper percussion caps were manufactured by the millions in both England and France and imported to the U.S. A number of people in the U.S., including Joseph Cooper as early as 1824 Shaw's testimony, Shaw v. Cooper, Page 32, U.S. Petition 292 were manufacturing them in smaller quantities by 1827. In the 1840s the British, French and Russian armies began adopting his form of ignition. The Austrians, by contrast, preferred the tube-lock derived from Joseph Manton's design.Myatt, F. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 19th Century Firearms: An Illustrated History of the Development of the World's Military Firearms During the 19th Century. London: Tiger Books International, 1989. The Model 1841 Springfield rifled musket was the first percussion-lock firearm produced for the U.S. Ordnance Department. Shaw returned to England in 1833 with his new design for cannon locks. His invention was adopted by both the British and the Russians. By the time Shaw died in 1860 he was well-known and respected in America as a member of the Franklin Institute; in addition to being an artist and scientist he was a prolific writer.

It sat along the former A45 road until a bypass opened on 15 November 2018, and is close by road to the M1 London to Yorkshire motorway junction 16, north of London and southeast of Birmingham. The village of Nether Heyford, with which it shares a primary school, church and other facilities, is about to the south. Notable buildings Heyford Mill lies a little to the west, along the River Nene in a valley which separates the village and Nether Heyford. The mill was derelict but underwent extensive restoration and refurbishment in 2008. The Mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book. In November 2008, South Northants Council decided to serve a \\"planning enforcement notice\\" on the developer alleging failure to comply with planning permission. The Council had previously served a court injunction against the developer to stop occupation of the property. The enforcement notice will require the demolition of the new buildings and other works on the historic site. The mill fell into disuse in the 1960s. With the intention of saving its historic character, the Council granted planning permission in 2005 to restore and change the use of several derelict buildings at Heyford Mill after they had suffered arson and vandalism attacks. The site is in open countryside, part of the floodplain of the River Nene.

It spent six weeks as a New York Times Bestseller and was the winner of 2007 Barry Award for Best Thriller. Plot summary When the laptop of a terrorist mastermind falls into the possession of the Office, Gabriel Allon suspects an imminent attack upon the Pope. He warns his friend Luigi Donati, the Pope‚Äôs personal secretary, in time to tighten security and personally investigate likely terrorist suspects among the Vatican‚Äôs staff. However, the Pope ignores Gabriel‚Äôs suggestion that a large outdoor ceremony be moved into an enclosed‚Äîand more secure‚Äîstructure. That disregard proves fatal when three suicide bombers cause more than 700 deaths among worshipers. Gabriel rescues the Pope just as more terrorists arrive to shoot missiles at the Basilica. As the Vatican later researches the disaster, it discovers that its council for improving relations with the Muslim world was little more than a front for inside terrorism. When the Office places the blame on a powerful terrorist network, terrorists respond by bombing the vehicle of Ari Shamron, the head of the Office and Gabriel‚Äôs close friend. As Shamron fights for his life, Gabriel joins a member of the CIA in a secret scheme to infiltrate the vast network of ‚ÄúZizi,‚Äù a terrorism financier linked to both the bombing and the attack on Shamron‚Äôs life. They select Sarah Bancroft, an American art curator with a wealthy European upbringing, to penetrate Zizi‚Äôs organization. When she and art dealer Julian Isherwood sell Zizi, an art aficionado, an undiscovered Van Gogh, Zizi takes the bait and hires Sarah as his personal art director. He introduces her to his ‚Äúfamily‚Äù by inviting her on an idyllic cruise in the Caribbean. Gabriel and his team tail Sarah with the hope that she‚Äôll be able to identify Ahmed bin Shafiq, the man who orchestrates the many terrorist activities that Zizi funds. However, Gabriel‚Äôs team shows too much interest in Sarah, and they quickly arouse the suspicion of Zizi‚Äôs professional security team. On the night that Gabriel plans to assassinate bin Shafiq, Zizi‚Äôs party preempts his move and takes Sarah hostage. Sarah is secreted away to Switzerland, where she is heavily drugged with truth serum and forced to reveal the identities of Gabriel‚Äôs colleagues. In a desperate race against time, Gabriel‚Äôs team locates Sarah, kills her captors, and frees her. She in turn reveals that bin Shafiq, believing her death to be imminent, taunted her by stating that he was on his way to yet another terror operation at the Vatican. This shred of information sends Gabriel rushing back to Rome on the very day that the President of the United States is scheduled for a historic visit with the Pope. The target of the attack‚Äîthe President‚Äîseems obvious, but Gabriel struggles to identify the operative. In an almost imperceptible move, a member of the elite Swiss Guard shoots two bullets at the President. Donati throws himself in front of the President and sustains critical injuries. Donati‚Äôs sudden movement alerts Gabriel, who kills the renegade guardsman before more shots are fired. Luigi Donati later recovers from the shooting, Ari Shamron survives the bombing and returns to the Office, Julian Isherwood retires, Sarah Bancroft receives a new life and identity from the CIA, Uzi Navot takes over the directorship of the Office‚Äôs special operations, and Gabriel Allon rekindles his romance with Chiara Zolli. Although the elaborate art plot failed, the book ends with two briefly recounted successes: Allon and his team locate and kill both Ahmed bin Shafiq and Zizi.

The book is the third in an Indiana Jones‚ÄìstyleGoodbook.com reviews action series. The preceding book was The Six Sacred Stones, which ended in a cliffhanger with archaeologist and ex-soldier Jack West Jr. and his team searching for the last four \\"Vertices of the Machine\\". The Four Legendary Kingdoms is its sequel. The series is published by Pan Macmillan and this book was first released on 20 October 2009 in Australia. Situation at the end of The Six Sacred Stones The Six Sacred Stones began the story of Jack West Jr's quest to rebuild the mythical 'Machine' before there is an uninterrupted line between Earth and a zero-point field (The 'Dark Star'), which will wipe out all life on Earth. In order to complete the Machine, West had to locate six oblong diamonds known as 'the pillars', and place them in six underground Vertices at their allotted times. Two pillars had to be placed in December 2007, the remaining four in March 2008, immediately before the arrival of the 'Dark Sun'. However, due to the knowledge of the Machine having been lost over the millennia, West first had to locate the Six Sacred Stones, which give him the information about the Machine he needs. By the end of the book, two pillars had been placed, and the various sacred stones had passed between many groups. Jack West Jr Jack West Jr is the main protagonist of the book. He is Australian and codenamed Huntsman. He is the son of Jonathan West Sr, codenamed Wolf and half brother of Rapier. He was last seen falling into the abyss with the Japanese-American Marine A.J.Isaki (Switchblade). Max Epper The second sub-group was in an airfield in Botswana, as they were unable to reach the Second Vertex in time. The group is composed of Prof. Max Epper (aka Wizard); Zoe Kissane (aka Princess); Sky Monster (no-one knows his real name); Lily West (Jack West's adopted daughter aka Eowyn); Ono (a Neetha tribesman from the Congo) and Dr Diane Cassidy (an anthropologist studying the Neetha). The items they have with them are the Seeing Stone of Delphi, and a Neetha inclinometer. They were last seen escaping from a group of South African F-15's Zahir al Abbas Zahir al Abbas (aka Pooh Bear) is travelling to Israel to rescue his friend, Ben Cohen (aka Stretch) from the Mossad who have placed a 16 million reward on his head for betraying them. Wolf The main antagonist, Johnathan West Sr, aka 'Wolf', holds all the cards at the end. He has the Philosopher's Stone, the Firestone, the Killing Stone of the Maya, and the pillars from the first two Vertices. He has also captured Lily West's friend, Alby Calvin, and leaves him at the Second Vertex. The Japanese Blood Brotherhood The secondary antagonists, who desire to destroy the world to erase Japan's humiliation after World War II, they are led by Epper's colleague, Professor 'Tank' Tanaka, and have the third pillar in their possession. They try to kill the twins and professor Max Epper The Five Warriors Every identity of the Five Warriors were revealed to be Moses, Jesus, Genghis Khan and Napoleon Bonaparte and the fifth is Jack West Jr himself. Each of the Soldiers/Leaders had, in someway, been involved in the mystery of the capstone/Dark Sun/6 sacred stones; for example, Jesus was described by Reilly as someone who had possession of several pillars within the plot (throughout the book, there were subtle hints of antagonism against the Catholic Church, describing it as a 'sun cult'. Reilly also interpreted a metaphor from the Bible to claim that Jesus had 'carried a sword' and was purely a man who never resurrected from the grave). Genghis Khan held the locations to the entrances to the temples where the pillars must be placed. Jack's role, however, is revealed at the very end of the book to be fighting against his father to save the world from the Dark Sun. The Six Pillars and their rewards The novel revolves around the placement of six Pillars at specific dates and times which coincide with astronomical events. The placement of these Pillars activates the Great Machine, which protects the earth from the deadly rays of the Dark Star/Sun. When these pillars are placed, whoever removes it from the pyramid receives the individual 'reward' of that Pillar. The First Pillar: \\"Knowledge\\" The First Pillar was in possession of the House of Saud, given to Jack's team by Vulture. The First Vertex is in Egypt, under Lake Nasser near Abu Simbel and the First Pillar must be placed there on 10 December 2007 at 6:12am, during a Titanic Rising. The Reward for the placement of this pillar is Knowledge, which is revealed to be technical knowledge. Alby translates the four sides of the pillar, with Lily's help, and discovers that one side is a variety of the carbon matrix, a super strong and extremely lightweight form of carbon fibre. Another side is revealed to be a map of Sirius and its two companion stars, one of which is a zero-point field like the Dark Sun. The Third side of the pillar contains the solution to the Universe Expansion Problem, while the final side is not explained. The Second Pillar: \\"Heat\\" The Second Pillar was in possession of the Neetha tribe, in the deep jungles of the Congo. The Vertex of the Second Pillar is in South Africa, beneath the Cape of Good Hope. The Second Pillar must be placed one week after the First on 17 December 2007 sometime around 2:55am, again during a Titanic Rising. The Reward for the placement of this pillar is Heat, which is believed to be the secret to Perpetual motion and an endless energy source. The Third Pillar: \\"Sight\\" The Third Pillar was located in a trap system within the Third Vertex. The Third Vertex is located on the north-west coast of the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Its Pillar must be placed on 11 March 2008 at 12:05am, during a Titanic Rising. The Reward for the laying of this pillar is Sight, the ability to see the death of the person whose blood is on the Pillar. The Fourth Pillar: \\"Life\\" The Fourth Pillar was in the possession of the British Royal family and was handed to Pooh Bear, Stretch and the Twins in an attempt to lay it. The Fourth Vertex is at Lundy Island, Bristol Channel. The Fourth and Fifth Pillars must be placed at the same time: 2:10am on 18 March 2008. The Fourth Pillar's Reward is Life, its function is not determined in the book, but is possibly the ability to bring people back from the dead. The Fifth Pillar: \\"Death\\" The Fifth Pillar was in joint possession of the Russian Romanovs and the Danish Royal Family until it came to be with Carnivore. He handed the Pillar to Jack West and Lily in an attempt to lay it successfully. The Fifth Vertex lies under the U.S Naval base at Diego Garcia, Indian Ocean. The Fourth and Fifth Pillars must be placed at the same time: 2:10am on 18 March 2008. The Reward for the Fifth pillar is Death, some thought its reward was a weapon; the gift of dealing death to the holder's enemies. The Sixth Pillar: \\"Power\\" The Sixth Pillar was found in the fictional tomb of Jesus Christ in some salt mines in southern Israel. The Sixth and last Vertex is beneath the Ahu Vai Mata on the most north- westerly point of Easter Island, Pacific Ocean The Final Pillar must be placed on 20 March 2008, at 6:00pm, during the Dual Equinox: when both our Sun and its twin, the Dark Sun, will be shining on the Vertex at Easter Island. The Reward for the placement of the Sixth Pillar is Power, which grants whoever is holding the charged Pillar whatever they wish, be it world domination, the death of an enemy or the destruction of cities, on the whim of the holder. Synopsis The story starts with Jack's fall from the Vertex under Table Mountain with the suicidal Marine Switchblade, and his escape with the aid of Switchblade's Maghook, a staple of many of Reilly's works. He quickly reunites with the rest of his team at Little McDonald Island. The dates for the placement of the six pillars sees a three-month window between the second and third placements. Jack and Zoe use the interim period to help Pooh Bear in the rescue of Stretch from the Israeli Mossad. In a Roman ruin located under Israel's most secret facility, they find Stretch subjected to a hellish treatment: kept alive in a tank of formaldehyde by General Muniz, a Mossad spymaster. Stretch was to be the latest addition in Muniz's private collection of \\"living trophies\\", a practice pioneered by a former KGB operative. Stretch is subsequently liberated and the party makes their escape. Jack learns of The Five Greatest Warriors from Diane Cassidy, five key members of history who would influence the sacred stones and their whereabouts. They set about locating the third pillar and its matching Vertex. Following a connection to Genghis Khan, the party sets out for Mongolia. They locate the Khan's tomb under a false mound that covered a meteor crater. In the bowels of the fortress, they find a petrified dinosaur egg painted with images of the six temples that house the Verticies. The Japanese Blood Brotherhood attempt to stop Jack and Wolf from finding the next temple by destroying the egg, and Wizard is killed by Wolf in their escape. Realising that Genghis's shield also carries the images carved on the egg, Jack and his team race to the northern tip of Hokkaido. Japan attempts to stop them from entering the temple‚Äîwhich can only be done so in the middle of a tsunami‚Äîbut Jack and his father form an uneasy truce and agree to place the third pillar together. Negotiating a maze set above a lake of lava, they successfully place the pillar. Several Japanese snipers very nearly kill them, and in the firefight, Jack and his father receive a vision of Jack's death from the pillar: what appears to be a fiery accident involving a falling aircraft. Wolf decides to let Jack go free after Jack saves his life. Unfortunately, all involved are captured by a group of Russians. At the same time, Jack's friends are picked up from their various assignments around the world. Everyone is taken to a dam in far eastern Siberia, where they meet Carnivore, General Muniz's friend and the creator of the \\"living tombs\\". Carnivore is the last of the House of Romanov, and the leader of the coalition of royal houses in Europe. Diane Cassidy is also revealed to be one of his agents. After forcing Jack to fight his half-brother to the death, the Carnivore subjects Jack's friends to his hellish prison cells to encourage him to place the fourth and fifth pillars. Without a choice, Jack agrees. The Carnivore makes a similar arrangement with Mao Gongli, Scimitar and Vulture, holding their loved ones hostage and sending them out to find the sixth and final pillar. The fourth and fifth pillars must be placed simultaneously. Jack, Lily and Iolanthe make for Diego Garcia while Pooh Bear, Stretch and the Adamson twins go to Lundy Island. Shortly after they place their pillars, Carnivore and Cassidy abandon their Siberian base and their victims, leaving them to die. Wolf escapes and gives pursuit, heading for Easter Island. Meanwhile, Jack, Lily and Iolanthe return to Israel, where they locate the (occupied) Tomb of Jesus Christ, the bearer of the sixth and final pillar, in a salt mine near Ein Aradhim. After Pooh Bear is forced to kill Scimitar and Vulture, Jack himself makes for Easter Island aboard a heavily damaged Halicarnassus. Meanwhile, the Dark Sun enters the edge of the solar system and planet earth is subjected to extreme weather conditions. Unable to land his plane, Jack crash-lands in the entrance to the Easter Island shrine. Unable to catch either Wolf or the Carnivore in the ten minutes remaining until the final pillar must be placed, Jack uses the remains of the Halicarnassus to cover the ground between himself and Carnivore. Jack kills the former KGB operative with the plane's sole remaining gun, which literally blasts him to nothingness. Lily, the only person Jack trusts - not least of all because she is the only one who can read the Word of Thoth - carries out the final placement. The reward for the sixth pillar is power, the ability to make one's thoughts a reality. Imbued with the power of the pillar, Lily goes on a murderous rampage, killing Cassidy and Mao Gongli in a grotesque fashion before Jack is able to stop her. As the Great Machine activates and the world is saved from the Dark Sun, Jack kicks the pillar into the void beneath the Vertex. Wolf gives chase, but the Halicarnassus causes the balcony overlooking the void to collapse, and he falls to his death as he chases the pillar. We learn that because it was Wolf's blood and not Jack's on the third pillar in Hokkaido, it was a vision of Wolf's death that Jack saw. Jack and Lily leave Easter Island, returning to Siberia in time to free their friends and the Carnivore's victims from the formaldehyde tanks. The epilogue sees Jack and Zoe married and living in Australia with Lily. The five surviving pillars remain hidden, with Jack reporting that they had been lost or destroyed over the course of their mission. Zoe discerns that the fifth Greatest Warrior - whose identity had gone unknown because of his role to play in the potential apocalypse - was actually Jack, and the story ends. Possible future books In the interview at the end of the book, the question \\"You've already written Seven Ancient Wonders, Six Sacred Stones and the Five Greatest Warriors. will the Jack West Jr series of books count down all the way to the One...?\\" was asked. After a short explanation, Reilly states that he will probably write \\"The Four Something Somethings\\" and could very well work down to \\"The One Something Something\\", so it is very likely that there are still novels in the series yet to come. A possible hint of a sequel and its theme can be found in The Six Sacred Stones. On page 182, the bottom paragraph reads \\"There were other carvings, including one of four throned kings sitting shoulder-to-shoulder and flanked by five standing warriors, but Jack ignored them.\\" In 2016, seven years after the novel was published, Reilly announced that a sequel was indeed going to be published later that year, its title announced as The Four Legendary Kingdoms.https://www.facebook.com/OfficialMatthewReilly/videos/vb.12532471338/10153675823186339/?type=2&theater; References External links *Official Matthew Reilly website *5 October 2008 blog post *17 March 2009 blog post *3 October 2009 blog post Category:2009 Australian novels Category:Novels by Matthew Reilly Category:Thriller novels Category:Macmillan Publishers books ","title":"The Five Greatest Warriors"},{"id":"20316275","text":"Thomas Alexander Nagle was an Irish Labour Party politician.

Produced by Scholastic Productions, it originally aired on PBS Kids from September 4, 2000 to February 25, 2003. The UK version (where it was dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original American soundtrack) originally aired on BBC Two on April 1, 2002. John Ritter voiced Clifford in all episodes, though this was originally done by a Canadian actor Brent Titcomb in the 1988 direct-to-video series. By the time the last of the 65 half-hour episodes and the subsequent film Clifford's Really Big Movie were completed, Ritter was back on ABC's prime time schedule, starring in 8 Simple Rules. Ritter's death on September 11, 2003 came less than two weeks after PBS debuted Clifford's Puppy Days. While no new Clifford episodes have been released since Ritter's death, voice actors for the main characters have reprised some of their roles for the Ready to Learn PBS Kids PSAs. Clifford's Really Big Movie serves as the series finale due to Ritter's death, as no new episodes were made to continue from where it left off (until the reboot in 2019). However, Clifford's Puppy Days still continued to air until its cancellation in 2006. On May 16, 2018, Scholastic announced a reboot of the series of the same name, which was released on December 6, 2019 on Amazon Prime Video and December 7, 2019 on PBS Kids, starring Adam Sanders as the new voice of Clifford. However, PBS Kids continues to air reruns of this animated series. Overview Two 15-minute stories made up each half-hour episode. Usually one story featured Clifford and his canine friends, Cleo, T-Bone and Mac among them; the other story would focus on Clifford's owner, Emily Elizabeth and her friends, Jetta, Vaz and Charley. During scenes focusing on the dogs' perspective, human speech would replace barking to show the storyline from the dogs' point of view. Episodes Characters Dogs *Clifford (voiced by John Ritter; Tom Eastwood in the British version): A big red Labrador Retriever. The depiction of Clifford's size is inconsistent; he is often shown as being about 30 feet tall (9.1 m) from paws to head, but can appear far larger. The character is based on the imaginary friend of creator Norman Bridwell's wife. His owner is Emily Elizabeth Howard. *Cleo (voiced by Cree Summer; Regine Candler in the British version): A purple female poodle. Her owner is Mrs. Diller. *T-Bone (voiced by Kel Mitchell; Benjamin Small in the British version): A yellow and orange, male bulldog.

Production The series was produced by Mike Young Productions and Scholastic Studios with animation production by Hong Ying Universe Co. in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, Morning Sun Animation Group and Hosem Animation Studio, both Shanghai-based outlets who did the uncredited work and Hong Guang Animation, also a Suzhou- based outlet, but also did the uncredited work. Setting The TV series takes place in the fictional island of Birdwell Island, where Clifford lives. The name is inspired by Norman Bridwell, the author of the books, but the letters I and R are switched. Birdwell Island was inspired by Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where Bridwell lived. Emily Elizabeth used to live in an apartment in New York City, but she moved away with her parents and Clifford to Birdwell Island because her mother told her that a small apartment is no place for a big dog like Clifford. Format The series has at least 4 segments in the show. # First story: The opening theme is followed by the first central story, which is usually about the dogs, and a problem they face. # Storytime with Speckle: Between the first and second story, Emily Elizabeth reads Clifford a short story about a dog named Speckle, and his animal friends. # Second story: Another central story, usually about Emily Elizabeth and her friends. # Clifford's Big Ideas: Another 30-second short, which demonstrates a moral lesson such as \\"Play Fair\\" or \\"Help Others\\", with narration by Emily Elizabeth. This segment was cut-out on PBS Kids Channel airings. #Live action segments starring real kids and their dogs. On UK airings, only one story is shown, with either the Storytime with Speckle or the Clifford's Big Ideas segments at the end, shortening the show to about 15 minutes.  Reception  Clifford the Big Red Dog has received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children. Lynne Heffley of Los Angeles Times wrote,\\" Clifford: The Big Red Dog focuses on positive messages with a fantasy approach. Based on the classic children‚Äôs books by Norman Birdwell, this animated series is about a red dog who is the size of a jumbo jet to match the outsized love that his owner, a little girl named Emily, has for him.\\" International broadcast Clifford the Big Red Dog was shown on CBeebies and Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom. It also aired in Canada on CBC and in Latin America on Discovery Kids. It aired in the Republic of Ireland on TG4 from 6 February 2001.RT√â Guide, 3‚Äì9 February 2001 edition and subsequent dates It aired in Australia on Nine. 2019 reboot On May 16, 2018, Scholastic announced a reboot of the series, which premiered on December 6, 2019 for both Amazon Prime Video and PBS Kids. Scholastic, 100 Chickens, 9 Story Media Group and Brown Bag Films produce the series. Excepting Clifford, Emily Elizabeth and Birdwell Island, the new series is a complete departure from the predecessor show's character base. In other media Direct-to- video In 1988, before the television series, six direct-to-video episodes based on the Clifford series were released on videocassette by Family Home Entertainment, Scholastic Media and Nelvana Limited. The animation for the direct-to-video series came from the Peanuts cartoon team of Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez. Brent Titcomb voiced Clifford in the videos, and Alyson Court voiced Emily Elizabeth. Film In 2004, Warner Bros. Pictures distributed a feature-length animated film based on the show, Clifford's Really Big Movie. In the movie, Clifford, Cleo and T-Bone join an animal show to win a lifetime supply of dog food to provide for Clifford. This was one of John Ritter's last films as he died on September 11, 2003, after completing voice work for the film. Clifford's Really Big Movie was dedicated to his memory. The movie also stars Wayne Brady as Shackleford the Ferret, Judge Reinhold as Amazing Larry, John Goodman as George Wolfsbottom, and Jenna Elfman as Dorothy the Cow. The film also serves as the series finale, as no new episodes were produced after its release, until the reboot.

Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973),. is a 1973 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that (1) when a patent is directly involved in an antitrust violation, the Government may challenge the validity of the patent;This overruled or further limited United States v. Bell Tel. Co., 167 U.S. 224 (1897), which held that the United States lacked standing to challenge the validity of its issued patents ‚Äúon the mere ground of error of judgment‚Äù in issuing them. The United States had standing to seek to invalidate patents, however, on grounds of fraudulent procurement and also as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. and (2) ordinarily, in patent-antitrust cases, ‚Äú[m]andatory selling on specified terms and compulsory patent licensing at reasonable charges are recognized antitrust remedies.‚Äù  Background  Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin.ICI had patents on the dosage form of the drug. Glaxo had patents on manufacturing patents. They ‚Äúpooled‚Äù the patents (that is, cross-licensed one another), subject to express licensing restrictions that the chemical from which the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù form of the drug (tablets and capsules) was made must not be resold in bulk form. ICI and Glaxo licensed three ‚Äúbrand name‚Äù drug companies to make and sell the drug in finished form only. The purpose of this restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as price-cutters, and the effect was to maintain stable, uniform prices. The Department of Justice Antitrust Division sued, alleging violations of ¬ß 1 of the Sherman Act and also alleging that the patents were invalid. The district court granted summary judgment against the defendants on the antitrust charges, but dismissed the invalidity claims on the ground that the Government lacked standing to challenge patent validity. The district court also denied the Government‚Äôs request for mandatory selling of the bulk chemical and compulsory licensing, on reasonable terms. The Government then appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Byron White wrote the majority opinion for the Court Justice Byron White wrote the 6-3 majority opinion for the Court. Justice William Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justices Potter Stewart and Harry Blackmun joined.  Standing  The Court observed that the defendants had been adjudged to be antitrust violators. The Court said that while ‚Äúwe do not recognize unlimited authority in the Government to attack a patent by basing an antitrust claim on the simple assertion that the patent is invalid,‚Äù whether the patents are valid or invalid could significantly affect what remedies were appropriate. Therefore, when the Government presents substantial claims for relief, a court should entertain the Government‚Äôs validity challenge.  Relief  The Court noted that mandatory sales and reasonable royalty compulsory licensing were ‚Äúwell established forms of relief when necessary to an effective remedy, particularly where patents have provided the leverage for or have contributed to the antitrust violation adjudicated.‚Äù Here, the evidence showed that the patents ‚Äúgave the appellees the economic leverage with which to insist upon and enforce the bulk-sales.‚Äù Reasonable royalty licensing was necessary to assure competitive access to the input factor for production of the drug. In addition, both mandatory sales of ‚Äúbulk-form griseofulvin on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms‚Äô and grants of ‚Äúpatent licenses at reasonable-royalty rates to all bona fide applicants‚Äô were necessary in order to \\"‚Äôpry open to competition‚Äô the griseofulvin market that ‚Äòhas been closed by defendants' illegal restraints.‚Äô\\"  Subsequent developments  The Glaxo case was brought, initially, as a test case on government standing to challenge patent validity‚Äîa vehicle for overturning or at least limiting the 1897 decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Bell Tel. Co.167 U.S. 224 (1897). That decision had held that the United States lacked standing to challenge its own grant, because of the doctrine of legal estoppel. Substantively, Glaxo was one of a series of antitrust challenges against patent license restrictions on the sale of bulk drugs. Such restrictions were used to keep the bulk chemical form of drugs out of the hands of generic drug houses and other potential price- cutters, so that \\"finished\\" drug prices could be maintained at high levels. (The Supreme Court's statement of the facts in its Glaxo opinion explains this point.See Glaxo, 410 U.S. at 63.) The defendants asserted no health and safety or other factual defenses. The district court then granted three summary judgment motions in the government's favor on the issue of antitrust violation, granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the patent validity challenges, and denied any significant relief.See Glaxo, 410 U.S. at 56. The case then went to the Supreme Court on a record consisting of legal briefs and supporting affidavits, without live testimony: there had not been a single day of trial in the usual sense‚Äînothing but legal argumentation.Glaxo, 410 U.S. at 56 n.5. After the Supreme Court's decision, the government found itself possessed of a new power to challenge antitrust defendants' patents. However, the government did not rush to exploit this power. It appears that only one reported decision has involved a patent validity challenge based on the doctrine of the Glaxo case. See also United States v. FMC Corp., 717 F.2d 775 (3d Cir. 1983) (government has no standing to invalidate patent for failure to file copy of interference settlement).

Specialized in urban fantasy and horror, supernatural and vampire fiction, he rose to fame in 1999 with the novel Os Sete. As of 2016, his books have sold over a million copies,Autores ‚Äì editoraaleph  Andr√© Vianco and in 2018 he was named, alongside Max Mallmann, Raphael Draccon and Eduardo Spohr, one of the leading Brazilian fantasy writers of the 21st century. Biography Andr√© Ferreira da Silva was born in S√£o Paulo on January 10, 1975, but raised in the neighboring town of Osasco. His pen name, \\"Vianco\\", was adopted by him as an homage to the street in which he grew up during his childhood, the Dona Primitiva Vianco Street. Vianco was always into horror films and literature, and cites Stephen King, Eiji Yoshikawa's Musashi, Edgar Allan Poe, Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles, Henry James, Victor Hugo and old Tales from the Crypt comics as some of his favorite readings and major influences.Autor Rocco  Andr√© Vianco He began his career working as redactor for radio station Jovem Pan's journalism department,Entrevista com Andr√© Vianco (April 16, 2008) where he stayed for two years, and also had a part- time job at a credit card company. He self-published his debut novel, O Senhor da Chuva, in 1998. After being fired from his job at the credit card company, Vianco used his FGTS money to publish his magnum opus, Os Sete, in 1999. Set in the fictional coastal town of Amarra√ß√£o, Rio Grande do Sul, the book tells the story of a group of seven vampires from 16th-century Portugal, awakened from their deep slumber in late 20th-century Brazil after their bodies are found by two divers in a sunken carrack. A critical and commercial success, it has sold over 50,000 copies as of 2008.
