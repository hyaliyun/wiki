An early written reference to a Jewish presence in Munich is dated 1229, when Abraham de Munichen acted as a witness to the sale of a house in Ratisbon. In 1210, Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria, permitted the Jews to build a synagogue and to acquire a cemetery in 1225. The Jews’ street soon developed into a ghetto, beyond which the Jews were not permitted to live until 1440; the ghetto contained, besides the synagogue, a communal house, a ritual bath, a slaughter-house, and a hospital. By the second half of the thirteenth century the community had increased to 200. Bavarian Jews had loaned money to Otto I, Duke of Bavaria, around 1180 to build Landshuth, and received in return special privileges, which were confirmed by Ludwig I, who in 1230 granted them the right to elect the so-called “Jews’ judge.” A pogrom after \\"a Christian child was found dead and many Jews were killed as revenge \\" in 1286 is commemorated by two memorial dirges (Kinnot) printed in \\"Gezerot Ashkenaz Vetzarfat,\\" Haberman, 1956 and described in\\"Das Martyrologium des Nurnberger Memorbuches\\" Salfield, 1898 However, in 1442 Jews were excluded from Upper Bavaria, including Munich. Jews only settled back in Munich at the end of the 18th century (53 in 1781, 127 in 1790). The Jewish population is estimated at around 3,500-4,000 in 1875 and around 11,000 in 1910 after the immigration of Eastern Jews following the outbreak of pogroms in Russia. By 1910, 20% of Bavaria's Jews (approximately 11,000 people) lived in the Bavarian capital. By the time the Nazis rose to national power in 1933, there were about 9,000-10,000 Jews in Munich. By May 1938, about 3,500 Jews had emigrated, ca. 3,100 of them moving abroad. By May 1939, the number of Jews in the city had further declined to 5,000. In 1944, only 7 Jews remained in Munich. During the war, about 3,000 Jews were deported, with only about 300 returning after the war. A new community was founded in 1945, which had grown to about 3,500 by 1970. Following the emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union after 1990, the Jewish population in Munich numbered 5,000 in 1995 and is estimated today to around 9,000, making it the second largest Jewish community in Germany after Berlin.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource ==References== * Shoah Resource Center * Jewish Life in Munich (in German) * Chronology of Jews in Munich * Encyclopedia Judaica * Jews in Munich * WWII persecution of Jews in Munich * Jewish Munich * German Jewry ==External links== * Jewish Population by Cities * The Jewish Community of Munich, The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot * Walther Weiss Collection at the Leo Baeck Institute, New York, contains materials on the Jewish community of Munich from 1894-1941 ==Further reading== * Stefan Schwarz: Die Juden in Bayern im Wandel der Zeiten, Olzog, München 1980, Munich Jewish Munich Munich Jewish Munich de:Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland fr:Histoire des Juifs en Allemagne he:יהדות גרמניה nl:Geschiedenis van de Joden in Duitsland ","title":"History of the Jews in Munich"},{"id":"20534366","text":"Sir John Edward George Bayley, 2nd Baronet (23 December 1793 – 23 December 1871) was an English baronet and amateur cricketer.

The estate contains seven buildings, the most notable being Elstowe Manor and Chelten House, mansions designed by Horace Trumbauer. Elstowe Manor was built in 1898 at the location where \\"Needles\\", the former family summer home of William L. Elkins, had stood. Elkins, a Philadelphia businessman, was integral in the formation of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, the forerunner of SEPTA. == Elstowe Manor == Elstowe Manor The 45-room manor was built in the style of Italian High Renaissance. The unique interior features, such as the ornately carved wood and gilded molding, marble columns and accents, frescoed ceilings, gargoyles and the like, were crafted in Europe and shipped to the United States, where they were assembled on site. The interior was designed by renowned French interior decor experts Allard et Fils, which accounts for the distinctly French feel in some of the rooms. The home is anchored on either side by a large library and drawing-room. Between these are two wings, one containing a breakfast room and dining room and the other a billiard room and den, with a separate wing leading to a large gallery. These wings all lead to a grand staircase in the center of the house. The second floor has nine bedrooms, three dressing rooms, and seven baths. The third floor and raised basement are servant quarters. With the mansion, Trumbauer also designed the wrought-iron gates at the entrance to the estate along with a small gatehouse, a powerhouse, and an eight-car garage. == Chelten House == Chelten House In 1896, Elkins commissioned Trumbauer to build a home on the estate for his son, George W. Elkins. This mansion, Chelten House, was built in the Elizabethan style. The house was situated on a large, balustraded terrace which allows for outdoor living space. The first floor of the house is built of local Wissahickon schist, while the second and third floors are half-timbered with panels of pebbledash. The interior space is fashioned with a stuccoed Gothic tracery ceiling with Tudor-style paneling. Stables are located directly behind the house. == Ownership after Elkins == Chelten house during winter In 1932, William H. Elkins, grandson of William L. Elkins, sold the Elstowe manor property to the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine de' Ricci. Chelten House was owned by Philadelphia cigarette manufacturer Stephen X. Stephano. After the death of his wife, Penelope, he sold Chelten House to the Dominican Sisters in 1948. The Dominican Sisters operated both buildings (known as the Dominican Retreat House) as a women's religious retreat and preserved the grounds and historical integrity of the buildings. Thousands of women and men attended retreats, days of prayer, and other spiritual programs for 75 years. Women would come to pray, meditate and find a place of refuge and reflection. At its peak, as many as 14,000 women and men came to the Dominican Retreat House in one year. The dedication of the sisters to preservation of the historic mansions on the estate was extraordinary and today, in 2013, the original features and architectural details remain intact. It was described as the most significant example of Gilded Age architecture in the region by John Gallery of the Philadelphia Preservation Alliance. Over time, the needs of people coming on retreat changed, and the economic challenges of operating the buildings became unsustainable for the Dominican Sisters. The Dominican Retreat House was at the time of its closing in 2006 the oldest retreat house for women in the United States. In February 2009, the Dominican Sisters sold the 42-acre property to the Land Conservancy of Elkins Park, PA, who intended to use the facility for group spiritual, health and wellness education retreats, and also as a venue for elegant special events. The property was reopened in September 2009 as Elkins Estate and has hosted a number of wedding receptions and events. But the conservancy could not keep up payments to the sisters who held the mortgage. In November 2010, because of numerous missed payments, including a $250,000 payment on the principal, the Dominican congregation foreclosed on the property, and the conservancy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The property was in bankruptcy reorganization until October 2012, when the case was dismissed. The congregation filed a motion to evict the conservancy in March 2012 after it defaulted on a revised settlement agreement. The agreement held that if the conservancy defaulted on its first payment of $300,000 it would vacate the premises, but the conservancy refused to leave and continued to hold events there until November 2012. The legal battle continued. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran an extensive story describing the legal dispute on October 31, 2012. On January 24, 2013, the Dominican Sisters and the conservancy reached an agreement in which the conservancy would vacate the premises and relinquish control to the sisters by January 30, 2013. The sisters regained possession of the property and sold the property to Landmark Developers in August 2019. ==See also== *List of Gilded Age mansions == References== * Kathrens, Michael (2002).

Hitzges pioneered radio sports talk in the morning at KLIF radio at a time when sports talk was mainly on in the evening. Hitzges moved to (former rival) KTCK in early 2000 after 15 years at sister station KLIF when the latter removed sports talk programming from its lineup. Hitzges also serves as the television play-by-play voice of the Dallas Sidekicks. He has also provided major league baseball commentary for ESPN. Hitzges is known for his enthusiasm and knowledge of sports trivia and has been compared to Dick Vitale for his energy and love of sports. Hitzges has been honored by the Dallas All Sports Association and the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. Hitzges also hosts \\"Norm-A-Thon\\", a yearly 18-hour marathon broadcast to raise money for the Austin Street Center, a Dallas area homeless shelter. Hitzges has also been a long-time supporter of Texans! Can Academy, an organization that provides at-risk youths with education and training. Weekly segments on his show include “The Birdhouse,” “Shuttle Run,” “The Meatheads of the Week,” and “The Weekend-around.” Since 2010, Hitzges and his wife have lived in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm, Texas. On August 7, 2020, Hitzges celebrated his 45th anniversary of sports talk radio. During a call-in, Mark Cuban related that Norm's KLIF show was the first radio program streamed on the internet on his original radio simulcast platform, AudioNet (later Broadcast.com). This required recording the show on an 8-hour VCR tape and then encoding the tapes onto a Packard-Bell PC to upload to the internet. On August 27, 2020, Hitzges announced on the air that he is being treated for bladder cancer. Notable DFW media members were quick to show their support, including Fox 4's Mike Doocy. ==Partial bibliography== * Horizons in the Mirror (1971, Naylor Co., ) * Norm Hitzges Historical Sports Almanac (May 1991, Taylor Publishing, ) * Essential Baseball: A Revolutionary New Method for Evaluating Major League Teams, Players, and Managers (with Dave Lawson, December 1994, Dutton, ) * Greatest Team Ever: The Dallas Cowboys Dynasty of The 1990s (August 2007, Thomas Nelson, ) ==References *Norm's Clubhouse *Norm Hitzges' entry on The Ticket website Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:American sports announcers Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Radio personalities from Dallas Category:Sportswriters from New York (state) Category:Sportswriters from Texas Category:Texas Rangers (baseball) broadcasters Category:Dallas Cowboys broadcasters Category:People from Little Elm, Texas Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992) commentators ","title":"Norm Hitzges"},{"id":"20534393","text":"Ayacucho Fútbol Club is a Peruvian football club located in Ayacucho, Peru.

His injuries spared him from the Bataan Death March. After Bilibid, he was transported via boxcar to a camp near Cabanatuan. In September, he was sent to Lipa City, Batangas and placed in charge of a 500-man work detail to construct a runway. During the construction, his crew deliberately sabotaged the runway so that it buckled under the weight of landing bombers. His injuries forced him to be sent back to Bilibid in January 1943, where he was operated on April 1943 by an American surgeon who was also in captivity. In June, he was sent back to Cabanatuan to join a farming detail. In January 1944 his detail was being worked to the point where men were collapsing in the manure. When he demanded that the Japanese commander take it easy on his men, he received a severe beating, damaging his kidneys and sending him back to a hospital.\\"Gallant Captain Tells How He Felt When He Was Captured,\\" Arthur Wermuth, The Lowell Sun, September 28, 1945.

Because the prison ship was unmarked, it was bombed December 15, 1944 at Olongapo in Subic Bay by aircraft from USS Hornet who mistook it for a troop transport, killing several hundred POWs. Wermuth survived the bombing and was transported by boxcar to San Fernando. 160 men were placed in his car and as there was no room to move or sit, were forced to stand for the duration of the 26-hour trip. According to Wermuth, the man beside him died on his feet and was held in place by the crowd for the rest of the trip since there was no room to remove the corpse.

He served as the president of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;) from 1899 to 1925. ==Early life== Truesdale was born on December 1, 1851 in Youngstown, Ohio. He was the oldest of Calvin and Charlotte (Haynes) Truesdale's four children. He was educated in Rock Island, Illinois. ==Career== Truesdale began his career as a clerk with the Rockford, Rock Island and St. Louis Railway in 1869. In 1876, he was hired as passenger and freight agent for the Logansport division of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis Railroad, with offices in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1881, Truesdale accepted a job as traffic manager of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and soon became vice president. In 1887, he was hired as the president of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. Following a brief tenure in this role, Truesdale served as the first vice president and general manager of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, a position he kept through the last decade of the 19th century. Truesdale became president of the DL&W; in March 1899, replacing an ailing Samuel Sloan. He immediately cemented his reputation as a relentless visionary by launching one of the most ambitious railroad modernization programs in American history. Until the dawn of the twentieth century, the DL&W; — like most railroads dealing with adverse geography — generally followed the contours of the land when laying track. Steep climbs and long hours aboard a train remained commonplace. Truesdale's efforts to rebuild his 900-mile system set the standard for U.S. rail construction. Heavier bridges and track were installed to permit heavier locomotives and cars to travel over them faster. Dozens of new stations were built. Many curves were straightened. Where conditions demanded, entire stretches of track were replaced by new alignments. One example was the Lackawanna Cut-off, a stretch of fast track with no grade crossings. Built to replace the DL&W;'s \\"Old Road\\", this enormous construction project involved huge amounts of cut and fill through the Pequest Valley of northwest New Jersey. It shortened the route by only 11 miles, but enabled trains to travel at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour. (The Cut-off was eventually decommissioned by Conrail and abandoned in 1983. The state of New Jersey later purchased the abandoned corridor and began reconstruction in 2011 to host New Jersey Transit commuter trains.) Under Truesdale's leadership, the railroad also constructed the Nicholson Cutoff north of Scranton, including the Tunkhannock Viaduct, the largest concrete bridge and one of the largest concrete structures in the world. The Tunkhannock Viaduct is still in use. DL&W; launched its Phoebe Snow marketing campaign, one of the best-known in American advertising, in 1902, shortly after Truesdale became president. The campaign built its name-branded character upon the reputation for clean operations cultivated by Truesdale. Truesdale retired as DL&W; president in 1925, but remained chairman of the board until 1931. ==Personal life and death== Truesdale married Annie Topping on October 2, 1878. She was the daughter of Lt. Col. Melville Douglas Topping, who was killed August 20, 1862, at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, while commanding the 71st Indiana Regiment. They had two sons, Calvin and Melville, and a daughter, who married Richard M. Bissell. Truesdale resided in Greenwich, Connecticut, and he was predeceased by his wife.

While flash file systems are closely related to file systems in general, they are optimized for the nature and characteristics of flash memory (such as to avoid write amplification), and for use in particular operating systems. == Overview == While a block device layer can emulate a disk drive so that a general-purpose file system can be used on a flash-based storage device, this is suboptimal for several reasons: * Erasing blocks: flash memory blocks have to be explicitly erased before they can be written to. The time taken to erase blocks can be significant, thus it is beneficial to erase unused blocks while the device is idle. * Random access: general-purpose file systems are optimized to avoid disk seeks whenever possible, due to the high cost of seeking. Flash memory devices impose no seek latency. * Wear leveling: flash memory devices tend to wear out when a single block is repeatedly overwritten; flash file systems are designed to spread out writes evenly. Log-structured file systems have all the desirable properties for a flash file system. Such file systems include JFFS2 and YAFFS. Because of the particular characteristics of flash memory, it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems, which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of NAND flash blocks. The basic concept behind flash file systems is: when the flash store is to be updated, the file system will write a new copy of the changed data over to a fresh block, remap the file pointers, then erase the old block later when it has time. In practice, flash file systems are used only for Memory Technology Devices (MTDs), which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller. Removable flash memory cards and USB flash drives have built-in controllers to manage MTD with dedicated algorithms,OpenNFM: An open source NAND FTL for SSD and embedded storage module like wear leveling, bad block recovery, power loss recovery, garbage collection and error correction, so use of a flash file system has limited benefit. Flash-based memory devices are becoming more prevalent as the number of mobile devices is increasing, the cost per memory size decreases, and the capacity of flash memory chips increases. == Origins == The earliest flash file system, managing an array of flash as a freely writable disk, was TrueFFS by M-Systems of Israel, presented as a software product in PC-Card Expo at Santa Clara, California, in July 1992 and patented in 1993. One of the earliest flash file systems was Microsoft's FFS2, for use with MS-DOS, released in autumn 1992.Microsoft FFS2 patent FFS2 was preceded by an earlier product, called \\"FFS\\", which however fell short of being a flash file system, managing a flash array as write once read many (WORM) space rather than as a freely writable disk. Around 1994, the PCMCIA, an industry group, approved the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) specification, based on the design of M-Systems' TrueFFS. The specification was authored and jointly proposed by M-Systems and SCM Microsystems, who also provided the first working implementations of FTL. Endorsed by Intel, FTL became a popular flash file system design in non-PCMCIA media as well. == Linux flash filesystems == ; JFFS, JFFS2 and YAFFS : JFFS was the first flash-specific file system for Linux, but it was quickly superseded by JFFS2, originally developed for NOR flash. Then YAFFS was released in 2002, dealing specifically with NAND flash, and JFFS2 was updated to support NAND flash too. ; UBIFS : UBIFS has been merged since Linux 2.6.22 in 2008. UBIFS has been actively developed from its initial merge. UBIFS has documentation hosted at infradead.org along with JFFS2 and MTD drivers. Some initial comparison show UBIFS with compression faster than F2FS. ; LogFS : LogFS, another Linux flash-specific file system, is being developed to address the scalability issues of JFFS2. ; F2FS : F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System) was added to the Linux kernel 3.8. Instead of being targeted at speaking directly to raw flash devices, F2FS is designed to be used on flash-based storage devices that already include a flash translation layer, such as SD cards. == Union filesystems == Overlayfs, Unionfs, and aufs are union filesystems, that allow multiple filesystems to be combined and presented to the user as a single tree. This allows the system designer to place parts of the operating system that are nominally read-only on different media to the normal read-write areas. OpenWrt is usually installed on raw flash chips without FTL. It uses overlayfs to combine a compressed read-only SquashFS with JFFS2. == Translation layers  See also == * List of flash file systems * Wear leveling * Write amplification == References  External links == * Presentation on various Flash File Systems – 2007-09-24 * Article regarding various Flash File Systems – 2005 USENIX Annual Conference * Survey of various Flash File Systems – 2005-08-10 * Anatomy of Linux Flash File Systems – 2008-05-20 Category:Computer memory Category:Computer file systems ","title":"Flash file system"},{"id":"20534513","text":"The title is frequently translated as \\"Sugawara no Michizane and the Secrets of Calligraphy\\" or variations thereof. It might more literally be translated as \\"A Mirror of Sugawara's Instruction by Hand.\\" is a Japanese play that has been performed in bunraku and kabuki, and was jointly written by Takeda Izumo I, Takeda Izumo II, Namiki Sōsuke and Miyoshi Shōraku.Shōriya, Aragorō. \\"Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami.\\" Kabuki21.com. Accessed 4 December 2008. Along with Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura and Kanadehon Chūshingura, it is one of the three most famous and popular plays in the kabuki repertoire. Sugawara was first performed as a puppet play in August 1746 at the Takemoto-za in Osaka, debuting on the kabuki stage the following month in Kyoto. The Edo debut was held at the Ichimura-za the following March. The play is set in the 9th century, and is based on the life of Heian period court noble and government official Sugawara no Michizane (referred to as Kan ShōjōThe \\"Kan\\" in Kan Shōjō (菅丞相) is an alternate pronunciation of the \\"Suga\\" in Sugawara; \\"Shōjō\\" means, roughly, \\"Prime Minister.\\" Thus, the term as a whole simply means \\"High Minister Sugawara.\\" in the play), who was exiled to Kyushu when he lost favor at court and was falsely accused of conspiring to seize the throne. A fictional set of triplets named Umeōmaru, Sakuramaru, and Matsuōmaru, characters invented for the play, also play a major role, each individually proving their loyalty and service to Kan Shōjō in different scenes.Miyake, Shutarō. Kabuki Drama. Tokyo: Japan Travel Bureau, Inc., 1971. p98. The antagonist is , whose name is written with the same kanji as the historical Fujiwara no Tokihira. Like most full-length five-act kabuki plays, Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami is very rarely performed in full. Instead, a selection of scenes will be chosen, or a single scene will be combined with scenes from other plays, dance dramas, or other pieces to form a day's program. The most popular, and most frequently performed, scene from this play is Terakoya (\\"temple school\\"), the third scene of Act IV. The Kurumabiki (Act III, first scene) scene is considered to be a paragon of the aragoto form, and of the essence of kabuki.\\"Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami.\\" Kabuki Encyclopedia (歌舞伎事典, kabuki jiten). Japan Arts Council, 2001-2003. Accessed 4 December 2008. The play was brought to Europe by the early 20th century and translated into French and German; it was the basis for Felix Weingartner's opera Die Dorfschule, as well as an early work by Carl Orff. == Structure == The fullest version of Sugawara consists of twelve scenes in five acts. Though this was originally intended to be performed across the better part of a day, modes of performance have changed, and the full version would today take twice that long, due to the style and speed of current forms of acting. For this reason and others, kabuki plays are almost never performed in their entirety today, and Sugawara is no exception. The fullest standard version of any play is called tōshi kyōgen, which in the case of Sugawara consists of six of the full twelve scenes. However, again as is the case with most plays, individual scenes or elements of Sugawara may be performed alone as part of a day's program of other such bits and pieces. Two of the scenes, Yasui no Hama (Act II, second scene) and Kitasaga (Act IV, second scene), have only been performed in bunraku, never yet in kabuki. The last time Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami was performed in its entirety (the ten kabuki scenes) was in 1966 at the National Theatre, Tokyo. The full length performance was divided in to programs, the first one in November (from Act I to scene I of Act II) and the second one in December (scene I of Act II to Act V).Shōriya, Aragorō. \\"Theatre National.\\" Kabuki21.com. Accessed 2 January 2018. From those ten scenes, the six that are still performed regularly (Kamo Zutsumi, Hippô Denju, Dômyôji, Kurumabiki, Ga no Iwai and Terakoya). This is the 'tōshi kyōgen of Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami. The only performance after World War II of the other four scenes (Ôuchi, Michiyuki Kotoba no Amaikai, Tenpaizan and Ôuchi Tenpen) was that of 1966, with the exception of Ôuchi, which was performed again at the National Theatre in 1981.Shōriya, Aragorō. \\"Ouchi.\\" Kabuki21.com.

The fundamental structure of the play is very much in keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god.Jones, Stanleigh H. Jr. (trans.) \\"Mount Tempai and Tumult in the Palace.\\" in Brazell, Karen (ed.). Traditional Japanese Theater: An Anthology of Plays. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998. pp95-111. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness. == Plot summary == The following plot summary is based on the full twelve-scene version. The characters of Sakuramaru, Umeōmaru, and Matsuōmaru are triplets who have been the beneficiaries of Kan Shōjō's favor in the past, having been placed as retainers to court officials. === Act I ===  The Imperial Palace (Ôuchi)  The play opens as an envoy from China arrives to paint a portrait of the emperor. The emperor is sick, however, and so a stand-in needs to be chosen; Shihei volunteers himself, an indication or reflection of his own lofty goals, but at the suggestion of Kan Shōjō and the decision of the emperor, Prince Tokiyo was a younger brother of Emperor Daigo is chosen. As Tokiyo's love, Kariya, is the adopted daughter of Kan Shōjō, Shihei sees this as favoritism, and is disturbed. The emperor also orders Kan Shōjō to pass on his secrets of calligraphy to a disciple of his choice.  The Banks of the Kamo River (Kamo Zutsumi)  The second scene features a meeting between Prince Tokiyo and Kariya, arranged by Sakuramaru. Kariya being a commoner, only adopted into the world of the imperial court, their love is taboo. When the meeting is discovered by one of Shihei's agents, the couple are forced to flee and hide, and Sakuramaru is disgraced.Cavaye, Ronald et al. A Guide to the Japanese Stage. Tokyo: Kodansha, 2004. pp155-157.  The Transmission of the Secrets of Calligraphy (Hippô Denju)  Kan Shōjō passes on his secrets to Genzō, a former disciple of his who had been banished from the court after falling in love with a lady-in-waiting named Tonami. Kan Shōjō is later called before the emperor, but loses his hat, an ill omen. He is accused by Shihei of plotting, through the marriage of Kariya to Tokiyo, to seize power, and is subsequently exiled to Dazaifu. Genzō and Tonami, with the help of Umeōmaru, take Kan Shōjō's son, Kan Shūsai, with them to their small school in the provinces, in order to keep him safe from Shihei and his schemes. === Act II ===  The Travel Dance of the Sweet Talking Candy Peddler of Love (Michiyuki Kotoba no Amaikai)   The shore at Yasui (Yasui no Hama)   At the Dômyôji Temple (Dômyôji)  The second act takes place at the Buddhist temple Dōmyō- ji, where Kan Shōjō waits for his escort to Dazaifu, and where Kariya stays with her older sister Tatsuta. Kariya is scolded and beaten by her mother, Kakuju, who blames her affair with Prince Tokiyo for the accusations against Kan Shōjō, her father, and for his exile. Meanwhile, Sukune Tarō and his father Haji no Hyōe, who are in service to Shihei, prepare to assassinate Kan Shōjō. The minister's escort is meant to arrive at daybreak, and so his arrival will be signaled by a rooster's crow. Tarō and Hyōe kill Tatsuta, Tarō's wife, and throw her body into a nearby pond; they hold a rooster over the corpse, and its crows, as Japanese superstition holds it would. The false escort prepared by Tarō and Hyōe to take Kan Shōjō away thus leaves with his passenger. Kakuju, discovering her daughter's body, and realizing what has happened, attacks and stabs Tarō. The real escort then arrives for Kan Shōjō, learns that the minister already left in a different palanquin, and prepares to set off to find him. Just then, the false escort returns, having realized he had been tricked with a wooden statue of the minister; several times in this scene, Kan Shōjō demonstrates the mysterious ability to transform into, or otherwise replace himself with, a wooden statue. He emerges from the palanquin, and the false escort is arrested and Hyōe executed, before the minister leaves with the real escort, to a tearful farewell, bound for his exile in Dazaifu. === Act III === As is standard in five-act bunraku and kabuki plays, the middle act departs from the main characters, the nobility and politics, focusing on a different set of characters, usually commoners. The third act of Sugawara features triplets, Umeōmaru, Sakuramaru, and Matsuōmaru, each a loyal retainer to one of the play's chief characters (Kan Shōjō, Prince Tokiyo, and Shihei, respectively). The triplets each wear a symbol on their sleeve to identify them: Ume, Sakura, and Matsu are the Japanese words for plum blossom, cherry blossom, and pine respectively. They are also distinguished by their makeup and acting style. Sakuramaru is a romantic and gentle type, in the wagoto fashion, Umeōmaru is a hero in aragoto style, with bright red face makeup, and Matsuōmaru is a villain, his face painted with blue lines.  The Struggle for the Carriage (Kurumabiki)  This famous scene, \\"a classic example of Kabuki's stylized beauty\\",Kawatake, Toshio. Kabuki: Baroque Fusion of the Arts. The International House of Japan, 2003. takes place in front of the Yoshida Shrine in Kyoto. The scene opens as Umeōmaru and Sakuramaru try to stop Shihei's carriage, and are confronted by Matsuōmaru, a member of the entourage. As the pair begin to unlash the oxen and tear apart the carriage, Shihei emerges, his blue face makeup marking him as a villain. He glares at them malevolently, halting their attack. File:Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Matsuomaru.jpgIchikawa Danjuro VII as Matsuomaru, by Utagawa Kuniyasu  The Celebration (Ga no Iwai)  In the second scene, the triplets travel to the home of their father, Kan Shōjō's aged retainer Shiradayū, in Sata Village, for the festive celebration of his 70th birthday. The three soon begin fighting but, with no swords at hand, attack one another with bales of hay. Though only fighting with hay and other common objects, the fight scene is executed in the same style and manner as the greatest of aragoto fight scenes. In the course of the fight, a branch from Kan Shōjō's favorite cherry tree (sakura) is snapped off. Shiradayū notices this, and points it out as an omen, representing Sakuramaru's responsibility for Kan Shōjō's downfall, as he was the one who helped bring Tokiyo and Kariya together. Kan Shōjō arrives and, together with Shiradayū, chastise Matsuōmaru and banish him from their service; Sakuramaru then emerges and announces his decision to commit ritual suicide, in order to atone for his wrongdoing. Shiradayū strikes a bell as his son dies. === Act IV ===  Mount Tenpai (Tenpaizan)  The first scene of Act IV takes place at Kan Shōjō's mansion in Dazaifu, where he has been exiled. He reminisces about his favorite plum tree (ume), which suddenly appears there before him, having uprooted itself and flown to Dazaifu from the capital.This is a common element in the legend of Sugawara no Michizane. Ume motifs feature heavily at Tenjin shrines devoted to him, and plum trees said to be this very one, his favorite from Kyoto, can still be found today at Dazaifu Tenman-gū. Kan Shōjō and Shiradayū are admiring the blossoms when Umeōmaru arrives with a captive: Washizuka Heima, a minion of Shihei's. Heima, tied up with rope, reveals Shihei's plot to seize power, describing each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with it, as if it were a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at least not in body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.  The Hermitage of Kitasaga (Kitasaga)   The Village School (Terakoya)  This scene is among the most popular, and most frequently performed, scenes in the play. It takes place at the provincial school run by Genzō and Tonami, where they are watching over the young Kan Shūsai. Shihei suspects that this is where the minister's son is being hidden, and sends Matsuōmaru there to kill the boy and return with his head; among all of Shihei's retainers, only Matsuōmaru is trusted to identify the boy's head. In this scene, Matsuōmaru is dressed in a dark kimono with snow and pine motifs, his hair wild and busy, a sign of the tragedy which is to come, and of the illness which he claims in order to quit Shihei's service. Seeking to atone for his past wrongdoings, Matsuōmaru plots to save Kan Shūsai's life, at the cost of that of his own son, Kotarō. He sends Kotarō to the school, where Genzō and Tonami decide he is the only one at the school whose head could pass for Kan Shūsai's. This scene is a classic example of the conflict between giri (honor, fealty) and ninjō (human compassion), as Genzō and Tonami sacrifice an innocent boy to save their master's son. When the sound of Genzō's sword striking off Kotarō's head is heard from offstage, Matsuōmaru strikes a distinctive Matsuō mie pose, expressing his suppressed anguish. He then departs with the head in a box, to identify it for Shihei as Kan Shūsai's head, pretending to have done the deed and thus saving Kan Shūsai's life.See Kumagai Jinya for another kabuki play in which a similar scene unfolds. The Minamoto clan samurai Kumagai Naozane, instead of killing the young, noble, and spirited Taira clan samurai Taira no Atsumori, sacrifices his own son, and identifies his own son's head as Atsumori's for his lord. Matsuōmaru's wife, Chiyo, arrives at the school to pick up her son, and Genzō and Tonami fear for a moment that they may have to kill her too, rather than reveal their deception. But Matsuōmaru himself arrives, and explains to all involved that the boy killed was his own son, and that he did this intentionally, in order to make up for his past transgressions against Kan Shōjō and the Court, and his involvement in Shihei's schemes. === Act V ===  Disaster at the Imperial Palace (Ôuchi Tenpen)  The single scene of Act V is only rarely performed in bunraku, and never in kabuki. It takes place in the Imperial Palace in Kyoto where a storm rages. In the aftermath of Kan Shōjō's death, discussions are held regarding the succession of Kan Shūsai, his son, to the head of the Sugawara clan. Though the clan is currently in disgrace, Prince Tokiyo argues that the storm must be caused by Kan Shōjō's angry spirit, and that acknowledging his innocence and restoring the honor of his family by making Shūsai its head would appease him. Shihei grabs Kan Shūsai, threatening to kill him, and declaring that nothing, not even a thunder god, will stand in the way of him overthrowing the emperor and seizing power for himself. Bolts of lightning slay his minions, as Shihei stands firm. The young Kan Shūsai slips away as the ghosts of Sakuramaru and his wife appear, and attack Shihei. The Buddhist priest Hosshō rubs his rosaries and chants prayers to drive the ghosts off, but stops when he learns of Shihei's evil schemes. The ghosts attack Shihei once again, with sakura branches, and kill him. The storm dispels and the ghosts depart. The play ends with the priest Hosshō declaring Kan Shūsai the successor to the Sugawara house, and the posthumous conferral upon Kan Shōjō of the Senior First Court Rank. He declares that a shrine should be constructed at Kitano to honor the minister, who shall now be worshipped as a god (kami) of scholarship. == Gallery == Image:KabukiActor.jpgUnnamed actor in the role of Toneri Umemaru in Sugawara no Michizane, circa 1860–1866, Toyohara Kunichika Image:Kikugorō Onoe VI as Kan Shōjō.jpgKikugorō Onoe VI (1885–1949) as Kan Shōjō Image:Kikugorō Onoe VI as Umeō-maru.jpgKikugorō Onoe VI as Umeō-maru Image:Kichiemon Nakamura I as Takebe Genzō.jpgKichiemon Nakamura I (1886–1954) as Takebe Genzō Image:Kichiemon Nakamura I as Matsuō-maru.jpgKichiemon Nakamura I as Matsuō- maru Image:Kōshirō Matsumoto VII as Fujiwara no Shihei.jpgKōshirō Matsumoto VII (1870–1949) as Fujiwara no Shihei ==References *菅原伝授手習鑑 - 菅原伝授手習鑑 Japan Arts Council Retrieved 4 December 2008 *菅原伝授手習鑑 床本 (Text of gidayū accompaniment to bunraku play) Retrieved 5 December 2008 Category:1746 plays Category:Bunraku plays Category:Kabuki plays Category:Edo- period works Category:Sugawara no Michizane Category:Buddhist plays Category:Fiction set in the 9th century ","title":"Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami"},{"id":"20534515","text":"Charles James Barnett (31 October 1796CricketArchive profile–31 December 1882) was an English amateur cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1820 to 1837 and a Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1831 to 1835.

Successful tracks range from jazz-funk-rock 'Secret Weapon Part I', where guitarist Dave Miller blisters the fretboard Marc Ribot-style, to the glitchy, laptoppy electronics permeating 'Sources', from the off-kilter, odd-timed Miller guitar runs and Quin Kircher's percussion clatter on 'Displacement', to the comparatively meditative, gamelan-like feel of 'Glass'.\\" Allmusic wrote in their review: \\"[The album] contains rather provocative investigations of vanguard jazz as it interacts with electronics, mutant funk, and even post-rock. Greene's compositions are rooted in space and edgy drama, and have wide-open spaces for various kinds of improvisations; rarely does one player occupy the solo space without another (or even two) engaging him directly.\\" The album also received positive reviews from All About Jazz and The Phoenix's John Garelick, who gave the album a 3/4 rating and said, \\"Aside from the general aggressive, post-rock, post-jazz underground feel, there’s pretty tunes here, lots of slow, quiet parts, bebop flow, and even some walking bass.

Her family had a strong connection to the theater. Her mother, Hazel Wade, worked in vaudeville as a performer, while her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Johnson, worked for the Lincoln Theater in Baltimore, Maryland. Ernestine grew up in Los Angeles and started her acting career at age four. In 1935, Ernestine was a member of the Four Hot Chocolates singing group. She appeared in bit parts in films and did the voice performance of a butterfly in the 1946 Walt Disney production Song of the South. Wade was a member of the choir organized by actress-singer Anne Brown for the filming of the George Gershwin biographical film Rhapsody in Blue (1945) and appeared in the film as one of the \\"Catfish Row\\" residents in the Porgy and Bess segment. She enjoyed the highest level of prominence on Amos 'n Andy by playing the shrewish, demanding and manipulative wife of George “Kingfish” Stevens.Bogle, Donald. “Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television,” Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001. Wade, Johnny Lee, and Lillian Randolph, Amanda Randolph, Jester Hairston, Roy Glenn (and several others) were among the Amos 'n' Andy radio cast members to also appear in the TV series. Ernestine began playing Sapphire Stevens in 1939, but originally came to the Amos 'n' Andy radio show in the role of Valada Green, a lady who believed she had married Andy. In her interview that is part of the documentary Amos 'n' Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy, Wade related how she got the job with the radio show. Initially there for a singing role, she was asked if she could \\"do lines\\". When the answer was yes, she was first asked to say \\"I do\\" and then to scream; the scream got her the role of Valada Green. Ernestine also played the radio roles of The Widow Armbruster, Sara Fletcher, and Mrs. Van Porter. In a 1979 interview, Ernestine related that she would often be stopped by strangers who recognized her from the television show, saying \\"I know who you are and I want to ask you, is that your real husband?\\" At her home, she had framed signed photos from the members of the Amos 'n' Andy television show cast. Tim Moore, her TV husband, wrote the following on his photo: \\"My Best Wishes to My Darling Battle Ax from the Kingfish Tim Moore\\". Wade defended her character against criticism of being a negative stereotype of African American women. In a 1973 interview, she stated “I know there were those who were offended by it, but I still have people stop me on the street to tell me how much they enjoyed it. And many of those people are black members of the NAACP.” The documentary Amos 'n' Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy covered the history of the radio and television shows as well as interviews with surviving cast members. Ernestine was among them, and she continued her defense of the show and those with roles in it. She believed that the roles she and her colleagues played made it possible for African- American actors who came later to be cast in a wider variety of roles. She also considered the early typecast roles, where women most often were cast as maids, not to be damaging, seeing them in the sense of someone being either given the role of the hero or the part of the villain. In later years, she continued as an actress, doing more voice work for radio and cartoons. After Amos 'n' Andy, Wade did voice work in television and radio commercials. Ernestine also did office work and played the organ. She also appeared in a 1967 episode of TV's Family Affair as a maid working for a stage actress played by Joan Blondell. ==Death== Ernestine Wade is buried in Angelus- Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

A total of 5,721 machines were produced between 1955 and 1970. In 1961 a factory-prepared faired Velocette Venom and a team of riders set the 24-hour world record at a speed of at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry, a banked oval racetrack in France. It was the first motorcycle to average over 100 mph continuously for 24 hours and no 500cc or single-cylinder motorcycle has broken this record. In 1965, the Velocette Venom was further developed with a full racing kit to create the range-topping Velocette Thruxton, with a special cylinder head developed by American flat-track racers, and adapted by Velocette to create a new production racer. It was a very popular and successful clubman racer, winning the 1967 Isle of Man Production TT. The Thruxton became the most popular Velocette model, but could not save the Velocette company from bankruptcy in 1971. Poor trading conditions over a number of preceding years forced the company into voluntarily liquidation in 1971,The Classic Motor Cycle, Goodman on Velocette, interview with Peter Goodman, by Dennis Frost, pp.47-51. Accessed 15 June 2016 with all the remaining stock and tools sold off to pay creditors. An interesting use of the Venom power train was the Indian Velo 500, an updated, limited-production run of 250 machines devised by American entrepreneur Floyd Clymer, using a Velocette engine with Italian cycle parts. ==Development== Still going in 2010 Introduced in November 1955 and launched at the same time as the 349 cc Velocette Viper, the single- cylinder Venom was developed from the Velocette MSS and needed to compete against a new range of British twin-cylinder motorcycles. Conceived by Velocette’s Eugene Goodman and designed by Charles Udall, the Venom's 499 cc engine had a bi-metal cylinder with a cast-iron liner, high compression piston and a light alloy cylinder head. The design of the engine's high cam with short push-rods was simpler to produce than an overhead camshaft engine. Sport model with engine fairings The Venom had high quality chrome plating and was finished in black paintwork with gold pinstriping. The Sport models of the Venom and the Viper were among the first production motorcycles to have glass fibre enclosure panels from 1960. These quickly-detachable enclosures were produced for Velocette by AvonThe Classic MotorCycle, July 1996, p.27 Shaping the Future by Roy Poynting. \\"Engine/gearbox fairing for the so-called Sports Velocettes was not a sales success story\\". Accessed and added 2014-09-25 and extended from the front of the engine, level with the top of the crankcases, to the rear pillion footrests. Although a practical addition in preventing oil-stained clothing,Motorcycle Mechanics, April 1966. pp.60–61 Road test. \\"Another unique point about the Velo are the glass-fibre enclosure panels around both sides of the engine and gearbox. They cover all the lower parts of the engine and gearbox, and make the Velo one of the few bikes one can ride in decent street clothing without danger of oily smuts and splashes. The only tool needed to remove them is a bronze penny, and they come off within seconds\\" Accessed and added 2014-09-25 the panels were unpopular with the traditional buyers of Velocette singles. An unusual feature of the Venom design is that the clutch was between the gearbox and gearbox sprocket rather than the conventional configuration in the primary chain case on the far left, with the gearbox sprocket between the clutch and the gearbox. This made the clutch less accessible but allowed for easy gearing changes and a range of sprockets with different numbers of teeth could be fitted by removing the sprocket cover.Motorcycle Mechanics, April 1966. pp.60–61 Road test Accessed and added 2014-09-24 The gearbox was also a novel Velocette design with a constant mesh close ratio unit that could be maintained relatively easily while still in place. Simply designed with single top and down tubes, the Venom's heavy brazed-lug frame (which had clear origins in bicycle manufacture) was well proven for its handling capability.Motorcycle Mechanics, April 1966. pp.60–61 Road test. \\"Built rather on the heavy side, the frame is a solid example of traditional British craftmanship, and coupled with the chunky Velo forks and the finely adjustable rear suspension, is responsible for the absolutely unshakeable steering. With the current rage for special building, one is tempted to wonder why the Velo frame and cycle parts are not more popular with the powerhouse Bonneville boys—...\\" Accessed and added 2014-09-25 At the rear was an unusual swinging arm design with two separate arms clamped to a cross-tube instead of the traditional welded-section rear fork. Although this was effective, it was difficult to set up the horizontal alignment. The rear shock absorbers were originally made by Woodhead Monroe, then replaced by Armstrong units and eventually Girling shocks. These could easily be adjusted to suit the rider's preference by moving them in special curved slots. The front telescopic forks, designed by Velocette and manufactured in-house, had hydraulic damping and an offset wheel spindle. The Venom used Miller electrics up to 1962, with a belt-driven dynamo. After 1962 this was changed to a Lucas system. The speedometer, ammeter and light switch on the original Venoms were fitted into a steel headlamp nacelle; the optional rev counter had to go on a bracket. Later models with Thruxton forks had conventional headlamp brackets and separate instruments. Eventually becoming the best selling 'flagship' of the Velocette motorcycle range, the Venom has become highly sought after as a definitive example of a British sports four- stroke single. ==Venom Scrambler== In December 1958, the Velocette development team built Venom off-road motorcycles, which were sent to the United States for evaluation in enduro events. Built to the Viper Clubman standard and advertised with the slogan \\"A winner in every respect\\", the Scrambler had a specially lightened frame, light alloy mudguards and high-level enduro-style exhaust pipes. A special off-road Venom was named the Endurance. Fitted with the Venom engine, it had a 21-inch front wheel, high handlebars and a small fuel tank, as well as full lighting so that it could be legally used on the roads. ==Venom Clubman== Clubman Mk2 'Veeline' version with factory-specified Avon fairing, TLS front brake, dropped handlebars and rear-set footrests From 1960, Velocette produced the Venom (and the Viper) in a Clubman racing version, fitted with TT Amal carburettors, a manually controlled BTH racing magneto (in place of the Lucas unit) and a close-ratio gearbox, with the compression ratio raised to 9.3 to 1. The Venom Clubman dispensed with the glass fibre enclosure and instead made a feature of highly polished crankcase and gearbox castings. Supplied with \\"rearset\\" controls, lowered handlebars and a steering damper, the Clubman also had a range of optional accessories including a \\"megaphone\\" exhaust silencer, a rev counter and light alloy wheel rims. Although they could be difficult to start – an entire section in the owners handbook was dedicated to starting technique – experienced Clubman riders found them easy to maintain and fast, as the Venom Clubman could achieve over 100 mph. In 1966 the Venom was upgraded to the Mk II, which had the Thruxton front forks fitted with rubber gaiters, a twin leading shoe front brake and narrowed mudguards, combined with a new exhaust design giving it a more modern sports motorcycle look. ==Velocette Venom Thruxton== In 1965, the well-proven Venom was improved by Velocette designer Bertie Goodman with a special race kit complete with radically revised cylinder head, an Amal Grand Prix carburetor and reworked cam followers. A prototype for this new cylinder head was sent to the factory by Los Angeles Velocette dealer and race sponsor Lou Branch. The new cylinder head had a 1 3/8\\" inlet tract, a 2\\" inlet valve, an 8\\" finned carburetor manifold, and used a 1 3/8\\" Amal GP2 racing carburetor, to produce 41hp. The following year this went into production as the Velocette Thruxton. Also known as the Venom Thruxton, this aimed to fill the gap left by the demise of the BSA Gold Star and was named after the Thruxton Circuit race track on a former wartime airfield in Hampshire where race-prepared Venoms had performed particularly well in production racing events. The Velocette Thruxton was a true racer, with a full race specification cylinder head that was gas flowed by hand to accommodate extra- large valves and a downdraught inlet port. The Amal carburetor was so large it required a distinctive cutaway in the bottom of the fuel tank, and race cams boosted performance to up to . As well as the traditional black-with-gold- lining finish, the Velocette Thruxton was also produced with an unusual blue frame, forks and seat and silver petrol tank with gold lining. In 1968 the Lucas magneto was phased out, and Velocette replaced it with coil ignition. A total of 1108 Thruxtons were built, but although it had more power than the Venom the Thruxton could not save Velocette. The company went into liquidation in February 1971. The Thruxton has gone on to become one of the most sought- after of all classic British motorcycles, with many private owners having converted standard Venom models to the more valuable Thruxton specification. Velocette Owners Club Thruxton Registrar Ray Thurston has comprehensive records of all Thruxton machines and any prospective purchaser should check with him that any intended purchase is in fact genuine. ==24-hour world record== On 18 March 1961 a factory-prepared Velocette Venom Clubman with fairing set the 24-hour world record at an average speed of . It was the first motorcycle of any size to top the 100 mph in 24 hours and, as at 2008, no motorcycle of the same capacity has been able to equal or improve on this record. The record attempt took place at the Montlhéry oval track, a concrete track just outside Paris with a very uneven road surface and poor track lighting. A team of six French riders were accompanied by Motor Cycling journalist Bruce Main-Smith, who achieved the best lap time of 107 mph despite the poor lighting conditions. After securing the 12-hour record at more than , the team went on to complete the 24-hour endurance record attempt. Stopping only to change riders and refuel (from a bucket using a funnel), the Venom secured the world record. The publicity was very important for Velocette, as the success revived sales of the Venom, which went on to become one of Velocette's best-selling motorcycles. The Venom which set the 24-hour world record is on display at the British National Motorcycle Museum. ==Racing success== 1965 Velocette Venom Thruxton At the 1964 Thruxton 500 endurance race, Velocette Venoms took the first three places in the 500 cc category, with winners Alan Harris and Howard German on a Stevens-entered machine finishing third overall in with the larger-capacity machines.Motor Cycle, 3 August 1964, p9.

In 1967 two Venom Thruxton motorcycles, ridden by Neil Kelly and Keith Heckles gained first and second places in the Production TT, a category for road-based machines with limited controlled- modifications first staged at the Isle of Man in that year; Kelly also recorded the fastest lap at 91 mph.

At times referred to as the Greensburg Athletic Club, the team began as an amateur football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several professional players were added for the 1895 season. In 1894 it was discovered that the team had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) player, Lawson Fiscus, to play football and retained his services on salary. The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, the Latrobe Athletic Association. Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: Charlie Atherton, George Barclay, Ross Fiscus, Jack Gass, Arthur McFarland, Charles Rinehart, Isaac Seneca and Adam Martin Wyant. Several of these players revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton is credited with inventing the place kick, and George Barclay invented the first-ever football helmet. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca became the first Native-American to earn All-American honors and Adam Martin Wyant was the first professional football player to become a United States Congressman. The team's home games were played at Athletic Park (which was later renamed Offutt Field). The field is still in use as football field by Greensburg Salem High School and, up until 1993, Greensburg Central Catholic High School. ==History== 1893 Greensburg Athletic Association team. The G.A.C on the uniform refers to the Greensburg Athletic Club ===Amateur era=== The first four years of Greensburg Athletic Association football that began with the 1890 season, through 1893, were not particularly successful. The drawbacks included a lack of local opponents, rivalries which did not develop until later as well as a lack of local experienced players. It is not even known if the club recorded a win prior to 1894. The Greensburg Athletic Association kicked off its inaugural season in 1890. Their first game resulted in 6–6 tie against Indiana Normal (IUP), while losing their first-ever home game to the Kiskiminetas Springs School (Kiski Prep), 34–4. A group of college students, which of whom returned home to Greensburg for Thanksgiving vacation, played for the team for a game against an unknown Pittsburgh club to close out the season. However, the team, filled with supplement players, lost to the Pittsburgh club by a narrow margin. During the 1891 season, the club suffered from at least two known losses against two of the two top football athletic clubs in Pittsburgh: the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and the Allegheny Athletic Association. Meanwhile, the result of an earlier game against Indiana Normal remains unknown. Meanwhile, the surviving records of the club's 1892 campaign show only two games being played, resulting in two losses against Western University of Pennsylvania (today the University of Pittsburgh), 6-2, and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, 28-0. In 1893, Greensburg placed a higher emphasis on its football program. The results of three of the four games from that season remain unknown. The team's fourth game, against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, resulted in 10–0 loss. ===Glory years=== 1894 In 1894 Greensburg hired its first professional player, Lawson Fiscus, for $20 a game plus expenses. While Fiscus did play for Greensburg as an amateur in 1893, he was actively recruited by several other teams as professionalism in football began to take hold. Fiscus played informal football at Indiana Normal, even before it even fielded a school team. He has also played at halfback for the Allegheny Athletic Association as well as for Princeton University. Greensburg Athletic Association: 1894 During the 1894 season, Greensburg jumped out to a 5-0 record, before losing 10-0 against the Altoona Athletic Club. A week later, a game against the Jeannette Athletic Club, ended at halftime due to disagreement between the two teams. The disagreement regarded the tough play of Greensburg's Lawson Fiscus, who was accused of kicking or stepping on the face of one of the Jeannette players, during the game. A rematch between Greensburg and Altoona was held on Thanksgiving Day. This time though, Greensburg defeated Altoona, 6-4 in front of about 2,500 fans. During this era, please note that a touchdown accounted for four points and the “goal after” for two. Greensburg finished a highly successful season with a record of 6-1-1 and led to an increased interest in football throughout Western Pennsylvania. Fans now turned out in large numbers for games, and even accompanied the team by train to road games. And while Fiscus was the only paid player on the 1894 team, several other pros joined him in 1895. 1895 Greensburg's 1895 season opened and closed with games against the Latrobe Athletic Association, from nearby Latrobe, which served as Greensburg's chief rival. The Latrobe team had an impressive squad led by John Brallier who became the first football player to admit to being a paid professional. Greensburg won the opening game 25–0 to start the season 2–0. However problems arose when Lawson, and two former Penn State University players, Charlie Atherton (who was also the team's coach), and Ed Robison, turned down Greensburg's offer of $125 a month each to play for the upstart Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, located in Pittsburgh. However, the community raised some extra money to give the players a better offer than Duquesne. As a result, all three players stayed with Greensburg. After a 6–0 start the team tied the Pittsburgh Athletic Club 0–0 at Exposition Park. The following week, Greensburg was defeated by the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club in Pittsburgh, 14-0, in what was seen as a controversial game. A local resident with ties to Duquesne was substituted for the scheduled official. This resulted in what the Greensburg Daily Tribune called bad officiating and “thievery”. A touchdown was said to have been scored by Duquesne after time was called, along with rough play. However Greensburg soon recovered and finished their season with a 9-1-1 record. However, the score and the outcome of Greensburg's final game against Latrobe is disputed by historians. While Greensburg and Latrobe records both indicate a 4-0 Greensburg win, one Pittsburgh newspaper reported the game ended in 4-0 Latrobe victory. 1896 For 1896, Alfred Sigman of Lafayette College became the team's fullback and coach, and two more Fiscus brothers, Ross and Newill, were added to the team. Greensburg began their season 5–0, which included wins over the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Latrobe. The team was acclaimed by Pittsburgh papers at mid-season as being the best in Pennsylvania. During a game against a squad from Beaver Falls, Greensburg's Tom Donohoe ran 44 yards with an intercepted pass. [Note: Pass was probably a lateral, since the forward pass was not legal until 1906]. On October 17, Greensburg defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club for the very first time, posting a 14-0 win at home. All three of the game's touchdowns were scored by Lawson Fiscus. On October 31, Greensburg defeated Latrobe, 10-4. In the stands there was considerable betting over whether Latrobe would score or not. Late in game Latrobe's Doggie Trenchard scored a touchdown, led to a Latrobe newspaper stating that “Greensburg got the game and Latrobe got the cash.” However Greensburg's hopes of winning a state championship were dashed when the club was finally defeated by the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club in Pittsburgh, 18-4, on November 14. The game was followed by a scoreless tie with Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Greensburg did recover from their road trip to post a 10-0 win over Latrobe on Thanksgiving Day to end the season 6-1-1. 1897 The 1897 season marked the pinnacle of the professional football era in Greensburg. That year's squad had 27 players, which included a number of new ones. Among those players was George Barclay, of Millville, who played a halfback at Bucknell University and Lafayette University. Barclay brought several of Lafayette top players with him to Greensburg to enhance the team. Greensburg went on to post a 10-1 record. The team's only defeat came at a 12–6 loss in the ninth game to Latrobe. However, the outcome of that game was reversed by a 6–0 score in a season-ending rematch at Latrobe. Greensburg, along with Washington and Jefferson College, had the best football records in Pennsylvania for the 1897 season. Barclay, however, was the only Greensburg player among the eleven named by The Pittsburg Times to their “All-Western Pennsylvania” team. ===Decline=== Lawson Fiscus The start of the 1898 season saw optimism in Greensburg with the return of ex-coach Charlie Atherton. However, some of the players from the 1897 season had bigger offers to play elsewhere and left the team. Replacing these players proved hard since the amount of money, to lure new talent to Greensburg, was hard to come by in a small city. However, as early as 1898, the team featured Christy Mathewson, a future baseball hall of famer and former fullback from Bucknell University, in their line-up. Greensburg's first game that season was against, their rivals, Latrobe. The game was played on a field, so muddy that the game had to be delayed at one point so that mud could be removed from the eyes, nose, mouth and ears of Latrobe's Ed Abbaticchio, who was buried in the mud on one of his carries. Latrobe went on to win the game 6-0 (4-0 by other accounts). The 1898 season would go on to be marred with another loss to Latrobe, and ties against Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. However, the team later turned things around to finish the season strong. In the final game of the season, Greensburg beat rival Latrobe 6-0 at Latrobe. According to the Greensburg Daily Tribune, the end of the game was marred by stoning and spitting on Greensburg players and fans, “boorish conduct by ruffians,” resulting in one player being injured when he was hit on the head by a rock. At the end of the season, against their club's wishes, Greensburg's Charles Rinehart and George Barclay played in the very first pro football all-star game for the 1898 Western Pennsylvania All-Star football team, against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, on December 3, 1898. The all-star team was put together by Latrobe manager, Dave Berry and resulted in 16-0 Duquesne win. For reasons that are still unclear, Greensburg leaders opposed the game and did their best to discourage their players from taking part. After an apparent decline in financial resources and interest, professional football in Greensburg and Latrobe underwent a one-year hiatus in 1899. Some efforts were made to reorganize a team around a core of local members of the 1898 squad, which would have to be shored up by obtaining some Latrobe players. However this effort never materialized. When the 1899 season began, most of the top Greensburg players of the year before were playing for either Greensburg's rivals in Pittsburgh or for other teams as far away as Newark, New Jersey. As result of not having a Greensburg or Latrobe team in 1899, the football clubs from Pittsburgh completed their schedules by playing teams mainly from eastern Pennsylvania. Final season In 1900, plans were complete for the return of professional football to Greensburg. Under the direction of industrialist Morris L. Painter, Greensburg once again fielded a team. Many of the players were from eastern and midwestern colleges and universities. The top sought player for the 1900 season, Ralph Hutchinson of Princeton, signed with Greensburg as a player-coach. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca, a former All-American from the Carlisle Indian School, was also signed to the team. Also that year, Latrobe's team was reorganized by the team's long-time manager, Dave Berry. Soon a three-game series had been arranged between Latrobe and Greensburg which provided for a home-and-home series, with a third game at the site which drew the largest crowd. Greensburg began the season 2-1-1, before losing 6-5 to the Homestead Library & Athletic Club, a Pittsburgh-area team financed heavily by the Carnegie Steel Company. Newspapers in Greensburg called it “the greatest contest ever witnessed on the Greensburg gridiron”. The game also featured a match-up between two of the era's star players: Homestead's Art Poe and Greensburg's Isaac Seneca. Greensburg newspaper accounts of the day state that Seneca outplayed Poe. However, the Greensburg club did sustain several key injuries during the game. By this time Greensburg was unable to regain its footing. A loss at home, this time to Latrobe, was sustained a week later on October 27. This marked Greensburg's third straight loss. During the game a fight between Seneca and the Latrobe quarterback, named Kennedy, led to a riot between the opposing fans and players. This riot prompted the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Office to devise a heighten security plan for the return game in Latrobe. On October 31, the Greensburg team, still injury-plagued, suffered a fourth consecutive loss, 24-0, to Duquesne Country and Athletic Club at Exposition Park. Greensburg's final win came on November 5 with a 22-0 over Altoona. However, the team was defeated again by Homestead five days later, 22-0 over Altoona. The final professional football game for Greensburg took place on November 17, in Latrobe. Latrobe would go on to win the game, 11-0, and the claim of “Westmoreland County championship”. By this time, the team was experiencing major financial problems. To make matters even worse, the club's scheduled next-to-last game was cancelled due to inclement weather. However, the worst occurred when Latrobe, who always drew large crowds when they played Greensburg, withdrew from a scheduled Thanksgiving Day game. Latrobe paid a $400 forfeit and withdrew from the Thanksgiving Day game at Greensburg to play against Duquesne instead. However that game also had to be cancelled because of extreme weather conditions. Greensburg's final season record was 3-7. ==Legacy== Although there were probably others, several members of the 1895 squad who were known to have been paid to play football were Fiscus, guard-quarterback Adam Wyant of Bucknell and the University of Chicago, and fullback Charles Atherton and halfback Fred Robison, both of Penn State. Wyant was cited by his coach at Chicago, Amos Alonzo Stagg, as “one of the best men that ever donned the canvas jacket” (then part of the uniform). Wyant also served at one time as principal of the Greensburg schools and became a U.S. Congressman from the Greensburg area. He would go on to be the first U.S. Congressman to have played professional football. Atherton, who had a street and campus building named after him, later became president of Penn State University. ==References== Category:1890 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1900 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:History of Pennsylvania Category:Defunct American football teams in Pennsylvania Category:Greensburg, Pennsylvania Category:American football teams established in 1890 Category:American football teams disestablished in 1900 ","title":"Greensburg Athletic Association"},{"id":"20534703","text":"Xabier Etxeita Gorritxategi (; ; born 31 October 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Getafe CF mainly as a centre back. ==Club career== Born in Amorebieta-Etxano, Biscay, Etxeita finished his development within Athletic Bilbao's prolific youth academy at Lezama, after playing with hometown club SD Amorebieta.

It aims to equip developing country youth with skills and resources to contribute positively to their communities as well as engage Canadian youth in international development and social justice issues. Over 200 Canadian youth volunteer overseas annually with YCI.Youth Challenge International Annual Report 2006-2007 ==Overview== The organization's mission is to \\"build the skills, experience and confidence of young people to effect positive change in their communities\\"(3). YCI's operations and programming is rooted in 4 core principles: * Youth Involvement: Youth take active decision making and leadership roles in YCI's projects * Volunteerism: The spirit of volunteerism as central to, and a key force motivating YCI's work * Partnership: Working with local, youth-led or youth focused organizations * Youth Capacity Building: YCI seeks to help both youth and youth development organizations build the capacity to work autonomously as effective change agents in their respective communities YCI operates on the belief that truly effective aid must have an explicitly youth focus – economic and social development outcomes cannot be improved without youth-specific programming. Youth represent a large share of the Global South's population structure with 1.3 billion young people aged 12 to 24 now living in developing countries. As the largest cohort of developing country youth in history, this group now makes up well over half the population of most developing countries. A critical challenge facing this population is youth unemployment, compounded by the HIV/AIDS crisis, gender inequality and disenfranchisement. Taking into account these factors, YCI's program rationale focuses on targeting these issues to promote positive youth- focused change in the developing world. Typically, YCI operates programs in countries characterized as politically stable, less developed countries that have an existing development relationship with the northern partners of YCI such as Canada and Australia. Organizations that YCI has collaborated with include: Youth Challenge Guyana in Guyana, Reto Juvenil International in Costa Rica, Youth Challenge Australia in Vanuatu, ZANGOC and Faraja Trust in Tanzania, YMCA-Ghana in Ghana, Association for Adolescent Development and the Program for Adolescent Mothers in Grenada, and Emmanuel Development Association in Ethiopia. All of YCI's partners are fully autonomous non-profit organizations with an indigenous board of directors and local staff. An international complement of field staff joins this base to help deliver field projects in each country. YCI's long term development goal is to assure that each partner has the stability and capacity to develop a greater regional role in designing, managing and evaluating important development, health and conservation projects, along with increasing the participation of local youth and community stakeholdersYouth Challenge International - \\"About Us\\" In addition, YCI has built relationships with other Canadian organizations including most recently, YMCA Canada and YMCA GTA as well as Club 2/3 and Oxfam Quebec, developing collaborative programming in both Ghana and Benin. ==History== Youth Challenge International was born as a charitable organization in 1989. Inspired by the UK-based Operation Raleigh (1984–1988), Canadian alumni from this project, along with new volunteers and sponsors in Canada, organized to send a group of Canadian youth to Guyana to work with Guyanese youth on community identified projects.\\\\- Youth Challenge Australia. General Information Guide In 1990, YCI sent 40 young Canadians, who, side by side with 40 Guyanese youth, worked on major community projects in conservation, infrastructure and health. Also, during its inaugural year, YCI partnered with the Adventure Club of the Soviet Union, sending a team of Canadian and Russian youth to the Arctic to participate in community service activities and conduct scientific research.Wearing, S. Chapter 3: Volunteer Tourism Experiences (44-46). Volunteer Tourism: Experiences That Make a Difference. Sydney, Australia: CABI Publishing (2001). In 1991, a similar program to the one in Guyana was also launched in Costa Rica. The following year, the mutual successes of these programs eventually led to the establishment of autonomous organizations in both these countries.Youth Challenge International - History Around the same time, Australian alumni from the original Operation Raleigh, initiated Youth Challenge Australia to provide similar opportunities to Australian Youth. In 1997, the Youth Challenge Organizations; Youth Challenge Guyana, Reto Juvenil Internacional (in Costa Rica), Youth Challenge Australia, and Youth Challenge International (based in Canada), decided to form the Youth Alliance Council. These organizations now function autonomously, financially independent from one another, but meet on a yearly basis to participate in co-operative decision making and joint planning for the member organizations. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, YCI has continued to increase the number of countries it operates in and has sent over 2,500 volunteers abroad, partnering with over 15 countries.Youth Challenge International - Snapshot of our History It currently operates in Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Benin, Guyana, Costa Rica, Grenada and Vanuatu. In addition, as of 2006, YCI has been working to engage Canadian youth in global development issues domestically, promoting awareness and advocacy through the functioning of its Volunteer Action Teams. In 2009, YCI launched its American partner Youth Challenge America. Two female volunteers from New Brunswick were abducted in Ghana on June 4, 2019 and were freed in a raid by police eight days later. ==Procedure== The ideal YCI volunteer candidate is aged 18–35, interested in international youth development, motivated to make positive change, seeking an international team- based experience and available for 5 to 12 weeks.Youth Challenge International - Volunteer Programs Since there are programs throughout the year, volunteers have different options in terms of dates. YCI programs are structured to be team-based; youth volunteers will live and work with fellow Canadian youth or youth from their host countries. A main component of YCI is selecting individuals to volunteer overseas on various projects. Although the process is not competitive, volunteers are selected on their own merits. Past travel, work, education, volunteer experience as well as skills and interests are taken into consideration when deciding where to place an individual. Candidates must undergo a phone interview, during which an YCI Volunteer Program staff member will help the candidate to determine which country he or she is best suited for. There is both a pre-departure learning curriculum and in-country orientation to help prepare and equip volunteers with the necessary tools and skills to complete successful placements. ==External links== * Youth Challenge International * Youth Challenge Australia * Reto Juvenil Homepage * YMCA – Ghana ==References== Category:Development charities based in Canada Category:Youth organizations established in 1989 ","title":"Youth Challenge International (Canada)"},{"id":"20534804","text":"Ridgeley High School, built in 1934, was a middle and a high school in Mineral County, West Virginia. The high school closed in 1976 because of consolidation in Mineral County schools. At one time the school contained kindergarten though 12th grade. ==History== Ridgeley students received their high school education at Allegany High School in Cumberland, Maryland until 1934, when a high school program was established in the town. The first graduating class in 1935 had 13 students. The school closed as a result of consolidation in 1976 and was succeeded by Frankfort High School. ==Campus== Ridgeley High School sits on a plot of land in the center of the town by the levee which separates the property from the Potomac River. The building is a two-story school with L-shaped hallways on both levels. On the lower level (essentially the basement) classrooms lined the front of the school and the side facing the football field. The cafeteria was at the center of the L in the basement. Aside from lunches, the space was used for weekly sock hops on Friday nights providing entertainment to students. On the upper floor, classrooms lined the outer walls facing the street. On the football field side, classrooms lined both sides of the hallway. The other side of the hall was mostly occupied by the gym where basketball games were played. Outside, the football field took up a large portion of the property. The football stadium had no lights, so games were played on Friday afternoons with students released early to attend. The property behind the school was also used by gym classes for calisthenics. The football field was also used for years by other local sports teams including the Ridgeley Rams football team. The building was demolished over two weeks beginning on October 22, 2018. ==Extracurricular activities== The Ridgeley Blackhawks football team won the West Virginia Class A championship in 1975. ==Notable alumni== *William E.

It had a croquet lawn, a tennis court, an orchard, a paddock and a swimming pool. It cost £420,000 and after the purchase was complete on 28 February 1991, he spent £125,000 improving it. He also had a flat in London, a house in Brighton and one overseas. He hired Mr Skinner to survey the house, particularly to determine levels of aircraft noise. Skinner reported that the noise was of acceptable level, whereas in reality, at 6 am the noise was intolerable. Holding patterns formed right above the house. This distressed Mr Farley as he often spent early mornings in his garden. The trial judge held that Mr Farley had paid no more than someone who knew of the noise, so there was no financial loss, but awarded £10,000 for distress and discomfort. ==Judgment== The House of Lords restored the trial judge’s award, because not being put at such inconvenience was an important term. Lord Scott held that if Mr Farley had known about the aircraft noise he would not have bought the property. He could either claim for being deprived of the contractual benefit (Ruxley Electronics Ltd v Forsyth), or he could claim as having consequential loss on breach of contract (Watts v Morrow). He added that if there had been an appreciable reduction in the house’s market value, he could not recover both, which would have been double recovery. Although £10,000 was ‘on the high side’, the value was within the right range. > ‘If the cause is no more than disappointment that the contractual obligation > has been broken, damages are not recoverable even if the disappointment has > led to a complete mental breakdown. But, if the cause of the inconvenience > or discomfort is a sensory (sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste) experience, > damages can, subject to the remoteness rules, be recovered.’ Lord Clyde said it was ‘the specific provision relating to peacefulness of the property in respect of the aircraft noise which makes the present case out of the ordinary’. The predominant object test was dispensed with, so it was enough that the term broken was known by both parties to have been important (it did not matter whether the purpose of the contract was to provide peace of mind). So it seems surveyors will not ordinarily be liable when a house is defective and causes distress. ==See also== *English contract law *Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488 *Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd [1973] QB 233, [1973] 1 All ER 71, where purpose of contract to obtain some mental satisfaction *Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, [1975] 3 All ER 92 *Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1, 49, (a case actually concerning \\"reflective loss\\" in UK company law) it was said contract breaking is an ‘incident of commercial life which players in the game are expected to meet with mental fortitude’ ==NotesReferences== *E McKendrick and Graham, 'The Sky's the Limit: Contractual Damages for Non-Pecuniary Loss' [2002] Lloyd's Maritime and Commercial Law Quarterly 161 Category:English contract case law Category:English remedy case law Category:House of Lords cases Category:2001 in case law Category:2001 in British law ","title":"Farley v Skinner"},{"id":"20534846","text":"Charles Evenden, soldier, cartoonist, and author, is probably best remembered as the founder and guiding inspiration of the ex-servicemen organisation known as the Memorable Order of Tin Hats. ==Early life== Charles Alfred Evenden, the eldest of the thirteen children was born in London to John Charles Evenden of Kent and his wife, Elizabeth Gregory on 1 October 1894. He was educated at Haggerston Road School in the London Borough of Hackney. At the age of twelve, he was top of the school and remained there for two years, winning two scholarships to Charterhouse School. However, his parents did not have the means to send him to Charterhouse and found him a job in a factory instead of half-a-crown a week. To supplement his income he took to selling newspapers. While doing this he began studying newspaper cartoons. This inspired him in the drawing classes he attended and on one occasion he sent a cartoon to the Daily Express. The psychological effect of this act was to influence his whole life. ==World War I== He joined the Australian Army in World War I and was sent to Egypt. As a member of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, he took part in the Gallipoli campaign until he was badly shell-shocked and evacuated to Malta. He was hospitalised in England and at the cessation of hostilities returned to a farming life in Australia. ==Post-war years== His farming efforts proved to be financially unsuccessful, and he took up newspaper work in Melbourne. After a brief period, he decided to try newspaper life in South Africa. In 1923 he arrived in Durban where he joined the staff of The Natal Mercury as its cartoonist under the nom-de-plume of \\"EVO\\". He remained with the paper from 1924 until 1953. With the startling simplicity of his ideas, he soon made a name for himself. To emphasise his attitude towards politicians and bureaucrats he created two characters, \\"Dr Mug\\" and \\"Mr Wump\\". His brand of Cockney humour had a special appeal for the newspaper's readers. ==Memorable Order of Tin Hats== 1917 Brodie pattern helmet According to the Dictionary of South African Biography, one night in 1927 after he and the editor of The Natal Mercury, RJ Kingston Russell, had seen a war film, Evenden was persuaded to draw a cartoon on 'remembrance'. According to the Dictionary, \\"The cartoon showed a tin helmet surmounted by a burning candle. Around the flames of the candle were six words – True Comradeship – Mutual Help – Sound Memory\\". However, the official MOTH website carries a cartoon captioned Forgetfulness and this led to the founding of the Order. This is confirmed by the Eastern Province Herald which describes the cartoon as follows: \\"a bullet- and shrapnel-riddled Allied helmet awash in the ocean. In the background a steamship passes over the horizon, leaving the forgotten, ghostly form of a veteran forlornly wading through the water.\\"The Herald online The concepts of True Comradeship, Mutual Help and Sound Memory were to become the inspiration of a remarkable organisation of ex-front line soldiers, of all ranks, known as the Memorable Order of Tin Hats (MOTH). Evenden, as the founder of the movement and its guiding inspiration was given the title of 'Moth O' – a position he held until his death.\\" Lapel badge worn by members of the MOTH The membership of the MOTH movement, under Evenden's vigorous direction and leadership, grew into thousands. Men and women of two world wars, of the Second Anglo Boer War (1899–1902) and even those of former enemy forces streamed into its ranks. All who were prepared to keep alive the memories of comradeship and self-sacrifice – the finer virtues that war brings forth – were welcomed and made at home in shell holes with colourful and meaningful names of war-time memories and occasions. The shellholes spread to the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Membership was extended to those who had participated in the South African Border War. The MOTH national headquarters is situated in Warriors Gate, Durban, which is modelled on a Norman design from a photograph given to Evenden by Admiral Evans-of-the-Broke. In 1948 Evenden opened Mount Memory ,- a monument to the missing and dead of the Second World War, in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains. ==Family life== He married Reenie Carlos and had a son, Barrie, and a daughter. Barrie was posted as missing in action when his ship was torpedoed by a U-boat in the Mediterranean Sea. After he died in Durban on 1 April 1961 Evenden was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over the Durban bay. ==Writings== Evenden wrote the story of how the MOTH organisation was created in his book Old soldiers never die (Durban, 1952). He was also the author of Like a little candle (Durban, 1959). ==Recognition== In 1955 he was received by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, at Clarence House. On 11 November 1955, the freedom of the city of Durban was conferred on him, at a parade of 14 000 Moths, by the then Mayor, Councillor Vernon Essery. ==References * Official website of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats Category:1894 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Hackney Central Category:Writers from Durban Category:People from KwaZulu-Natal Category:English emigrants to South Africa Category:British editorial cartoonists Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:Artists from Durban ","title":"Charles Evenden"},{"id":"20534860","text":"Jefe de Jefes (\\"Boss of Bosses\\") is the title of a studio album released by Regional Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte.

For example, a television set remote controller can also control a set-top box and a DVD player. It is a one-wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices. ==Trade names for CEC technology== Trade names for CEC are: * 1-Touch Play (Roku) * Anynet+ (Samsung) * Aquos Link (Sharp) * BRAVIA Link, BRAVIA Sync, Control for HDMI (Sony) * CE-Link, Regza Link (Toshiba) * E-link (AOC) * EasyLink (Philips) * Fun-Link (Funai, Sylvania, Emerson, Magnavox, Philips) * HDMI-CEC (Hitachi) * INlink (Insignia) * Kuro Link (Pioneer) * NetCommand for HDMI, Realink for HDMI (Mitsubishi) * RIHD (Remote Interactive over HDMI) (Onkyo) * RuncoLink (Runco International) * SimpLink (LG) * T-Link (ITT, Thomson) * VIERA Link, HDAVI Control, EZ-Sync (Panasonic) * CEC (Vizio) ==CEC commands== The following is a list of the most commonly used HDMI-CEC commands: * One Touch Play allows devices to switch the TV to use it as the active source when playback starts * System Standby enables users to switch multiple devices to standby mode with the press of one button * Preset Transfer transfers the tuner channel setup to another TV set * One Touch Record allows users to record whatever is currently being shown on the HDTV screen on a selected recording device * Timer Programming allows users to use the electronic program guides (EPGs) that are built into many HDTVs and set- top-boxes to program the timer in recording devices like PVRs and DVRs * System Information checks all components for bus addresses and configuration * Deck Control allows a component to interrogate and control the operation (play, pause, rewind etc.), of a playback component (Blu-ray or HD DVD player or a Camcorder, etc.) * Tuner Control allows a component to control the tuner of another component * OSD Display uses the on-screen display (OSD) of the TV set to display text * Device Menu Control allows a component to control the menu system of another component by passing through the user interface (UI) commands * Routing Control controls the switching of signal sources * Remote Control Pass Through allows remote control commands to be passed through to other devices within the system * Device OSD Name Transfer transfers the preferred device names to the TV set * System Audio Control allows the volume of an AV receiver, integrated amplifier or preamplifier to be controlled using any remote control from a suitably equipped device(s) in the system ==Protocol== CEC is a separate electrical signal from the other HDMI signals. This allows a device to disable its high-speed HDMI circuitry in sleep mode, but be woken up by CEC. It is a single shared bus, which is directly connected between all HDMI ports on a device, so it can flow through a device which is completely powered off (not just asleep). The bus is electrically identical to the AV.link protocol, but CEC adds a detailed higher-level message protocol. The bus is an open-collector line, somewhat like I²C, passively pulled up to +3.3 V, and driven low to transmit a bit. Similarities to I²C include: * Low- speed serial bus * Open-collector with passive pull-up * Speed limited by distributed capacitance * Receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0 * Multiple masters allowed via arbitration: sending a 1 bit and observing a 0 indicates loss * Byte-oriented protocol * Each byte has an acknowledge bit appended * Special start signal Differences from I²C: * Single wire rather than two wires * Bits sent with fixed timing rather than separate clock * 1000× lower speed (417 bit/s instead of 400 kbit/s) * Four address bits rather than seven * Defined protocol for dynamic address allocation * Header includes both initiator and recipient address * No special stop signal; instead, each byte has an end of message flag appended * No \\"read\\" operations; all data bytes in a frame are sent from transmitter * Instead, \\"get\\" requests solicit response frames * Every device must be able to transmit * Detailed specification of meaning of bytes after the address Each bit begins with the line pulled low (falling edge), a delay indicating the bit value, a rising edge, and further delay until the start of the following bit. Normal data bits are long. A logic 1 is held low for , while a logic 0 is held low for . The receiver samples the line at after the falling edge, then begins watching for the following bit after the falling edge. A receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0 bit by pulling the line low within 0.35 ms of the falling edge, and holding it until the 0 bit time. The transmitter observes the bus during its own transmissions to detect this condition. This is used to acknowledge a transmission. Each frame begins with a special start bit, held low for and then allowed to rise, for a total duration of . Any device may send a start bit after observing the bus idle for a suitable number of bit times. (Normally, 5 bit times, but 7 bit times immediately after a successful transmission to facilitate fair sharing of the bus, and 3 bit times between a failed transmission and its retransmission.) This is followed by up to 16 bytes. Each byte consists of ten bits: eight data bits (transmitted msbit- first, in big-endian order), an \\"end of message\\" bit (set to 1 after the last byte of a frame), and an \\"acknowledge\\" bit. For single-recipient messages, the acknowledge bit operates similarly to I²C: it is transmitted as a 1 bit, and the receiver pulls it down to a 0 bit to acknowledge the byte. For broadcast messages, the acknowledge bit is inverted: it is still transmitted as a 1 bit, but is pulled down to a 0 bit by any receiver which rejects the byte. The first byte of each CEC frame is a header containing the 4-bit source and destination addresses. If the addressed destination exists, it acknowledges the byte. A frame consisting of nothing but the header is a ping which simply checks for the presence of another device. The address 15 (1111) is used for the broadcast address (as a destination) and unregistered devices (as a source) which have not yet chosen a different address. Some devices do not need to receive non-broadcast messages and so may use address 15 permanently, notably remote control receivers and HDMI switches. Devices which need to receive addressed messages need their own address. A device obtains an address by attempting to ping it. If the ping is unacknowledged, the device claims it. If the ping is acknowledged, the device tries another address. The second byte is an opcode which specifies the operation to be performed, and the number and meaning of following parameter bytes. For example, a user press on a remote control will generate a 3-byte frame: a header byte, a \`\` opcode (0x44), and an operand byte identifying the button. Including the initial idle time and extra-long start bit, this takes 88.5 ms (37 bit times). A later \`\` opcode (0x45) has no operands. ==See also== * Consumer IR * Media controls ==References * HDMI.org FAQ entry for CEC * USB CEC adapter communication library Category:Television technology Category:Video signal Category:Electronics standards Category:Film and video technology Category:Remote control ","title":"Consumer Electronics Control"},{"id":"20534933","text":"Bundling of Microsoft Windows is the installation of Microsoft Windows in computers before their purchase. Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of personal computers to include Windows licenses with their products, and agreements between Microsoft and OEMs have undergone antitrust scrutiny. Users opposed to the bundling of Microsoft Windows have sought refunds for Windows licenses, arguing that the Windows end-user license agreement entitles them to return unused Windows licenses for a cash refund. Although some customers have successfully obtained payments (in some cases after litigation or lengthy negotiations), others have been less successful. ==The \\"Windows tax\\"== Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed, saying that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system. Analyst Vishal Tripathi said that many consumers purchase PCs with pre-installed operating systems because they do not want to deal with the \\"learning curve\\" and inconvenience of installing an operating system. Virtually all large computer vendors bundle Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. In 1999, Maximum PC wrote that non-Windows users \\"have long griped that machines from large companies can't be purchased without Windows\\". In 1999, analyst Rob Enderle attributed the lack of computers without Windows available for individual purchase to economic impracticality, citing certification and warranty requirements. In 1999, Dell stated that it only offered non-Microsoft operating systems on servers and as part of customized large orders, but if Linux became popular enough to make Linux pre-installation cost-effective, \\"we'd be foolish not to offer it\\". The Guardians computer editor Jack Schofield said that there were significant overhead costs associated with pre- installation of Linux, in part due to Linux's small market share. Serdar Yegulalp of Computerworld said that in the late 1990s, because Linux was not fully developed, Linux computers were \\"a tough sell for non-technical users\\". Microsoft historically engaged in licensing practices that discouraged the installation of non-Microsoft operating systems. Microsoft once assessed license fees based on the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included. Beginning in 1983, Microsoft sold MS- DOS licenses to OEMs on an individually-negotiated basis. The contracts required OEMs to purchase a number of MS-DOS licenses equal to or greater than the number of computers sold, with the result of zero marginal cost for OEMs to include MS-DOS. Installing an operating system other than MS-DOS would effectively require double payment of operating system royalties. Also, Microsoft penalized OEMs that installed alternative operating systems by making their license terms less favorable. Microsoft entered into a consent decree in 1994 that barred Microsoft from conditioning the availability of Windows licenses or varying their prices based on whether OEMs distributed other operating systems. Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said that the decree was effective in allowing Dell and HP to offer Linux computers, and Jeremy Reimer of Ars Technica stated that the decree made it \\"fiscally realistic to sell computers with alternative operating systems\\". In 1999, a Microsoft representative stated that their contracts with OEMs did not \\"stop[] any OEM from shipping any operating system on their PCs\\". In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system. In a 2001 article in Byte, it was reported that license agreements between OEMs and Microsoft forbade OEMs from including Windows alongside another operating system on the same computer. According to a 1999 New York Times article, \\"critics assert that the company continues to use its market clout to ensure that nearly all new personal computers come with Windows pre-installed.\\" In 2009, Microsoft stated that it has always charged OEMs about $50 for a Windows license on a $1,000 computer. In 2007, Dell stated that its computers with Ubuntu installed would be priced about $50 lower than comparable systems with Windows installed. In a 2010 ZDNet article, Chris Clay wrote that Dell computers with Ubuntu preinstalled were priced higher than identical systems with Windows preinstalled, even though Ubuntu is free and open source. The claimed increase in the price of a computer resulting from the inclusion of a Windows license has been called the \\"Windows tax\\" or \\"Microsoft tax\\" by opposing computer users. Some computer purchasers request refunds for Windows licenses included with their purchased computers because they do not want to use Windows, preferring an operating system such as Linux instead. Jeff Walsh of InfoWorld said that businesses with site licenses can save money by requesting refunds of Windows licenses included with purchased computers. Users can avoid the \\"Windows tax\\" altogether by assembling a computer from individually purchased parts or purchasing a computer from an OEM that does not bundle Windows. Some smaller OEMs and larger retail chains such as System76 have taken to specializing in Linux- based systems to their advantage from major suppliers' paucity of non-Windows offerings. Beginning in 2007, Dell offered computers with Ubuntu pre- installed. In 2014, Hewlett-Packard stated that it sells \\"units bundled with a built-in OS and those without\\". Some Linux distributors also run 'partnership' programs to endorse suppliers of machines with their system pre-installed. Some vendors purchase computers from major OEMs, install Linux on them and resell them. Chris Clay of ZDNet wrote that employee discount programs create a financial incentive to purchase computers from a large manufacturer, even if the manufacturer does not offer computers without Windows. ==Boot locking concerns== Microsoft requires that OEMs support UEFI secure boot on their products to qualify for the Windows 8 Logo Program. Concerns have been raised that OEMs might ship systems that do not allow users to disable secure boot or install signing keys for alternative operating systems. Such computers would be unable to boot any non-Windows operating system (unless that operating system was signed and its keys included with the computer), further complicating the issue of Windows refunds. While Microsoft claims the OEMs would be free to decide which keys to include and how to manage them, competing OS vendors' relative lack of influence on the desktop OS market compared to Microsoft might mean that, even if signed versions of their operating systems were available, they might face difficulties getting hardware vendors to include their keys, especially if end users won't be able to manage those keys themselves. Boot locking is now required for ARM devices. ==License refund policy== Microsoft does not provide refunds for Windows licenses sold through an OEM, including licenses that come with the purchase of a computer or are pre-installed on a computer. A Microsoft Denmark representative stated that Microsoft's Windows license terms allow OEMs to offer a refund for just the Windows license. Microsoft's End User License Agreement for Windows 10 states that: In 1999, the relevant text read In 1999, according to InfoWorld, \\"Some users are taking this EULA literally and plan to demand a cash refund.\\" In 1999, a Microsoft representative described requesting a Windows refund on the basis of rejecting the license as \\"a technicality where someone is twisting the language a little bit to come up with the idea that they can run back to the OEM with this\\". Laurie J. Flynn of The New York Times characterized the license refund argument as using a loophole in the license agreement. OEM policies for refunding unused Windows licenses vary. Some OEMs have programs that specifically allow a user to receive a refund for an unused Windows license. Acer US has a Windows refund program where a user can ship a computer with an unused copy of Windows to the Acer service center and have the computer returned without Windows for a refund. Acer's policy requires the customer to return items at their own expense, and the balance received by the customer can be as low as €30. The same applies for EU, the reported refund as of 2014 is €40 for Windows 8. Other vendors, like Dell, have ad hoc procedures for users to request a refund of a Windows license; one user who received a £55.23 refund from Dell said of the process, \\"I was pretty gob-smacked that it was so easy\\". In some cases, vendors have asked that customers requesting refunds sign non-disclosure agreements. In 1999, a Toshiba representative stated that a case where a user obtained a $110 refund was \\"not the typical policy and not what other people will run into if they try it\\". Other vendors do not issue refunds for Windows licenses. In February 1999 InfoWorld reported that \\"No PC manufacturers are currently offering refunds for users who do not use Windows\\". According to a 1999 Maximum PC article, Dell did not provide refunds for Windows licenses, interpreting the license agreement to \\"treat the hardware and software as a single package that must be returned\\". In 2009, Sony refused to offer a partial refund for a customer who declined the Windows Vista EULA, instead offering a refund for the entire computer, which the consumer declined. Litigation by users denied a partial refund for the unused Windows license has resulted in rulings in France and Italy that bundling Microsoft Windows and then refusing to offer partial refunds for just the Windows license violates applicable law. In September 2014, the Supreme Court of Italy in ruling 19161/2014 decided that a laptop buyer was entitled to receive a refund of €140 for the price of a Microsoft Windows license and a Microsoft Works license on a computer, saying that bundling was \\"a commercial policy of forced distribution\\" and slammed this practice as \\"monopolistic in tendency\\".Windows Tax Shot Down In Italy, slashdot.org, 14 September 2014Italy: High Court shoots down Windows tax, Free Software Foundation Europe, 12 September 2014, accessed 14 September 2014Hp perde causa: il software preinstallato indesiderato è rimborsabile, La Republica, 11 September 2014, accessed 14 September 2014 In India bundling is challenged by users as a violation of Competition Act 2002 and one of them has sent a legal notice to HP. However, in another license refund case, a French appellate court ruled in favor of the OEM, \\"holding that the sale at issue did not constitute the unfair commercial practice of coercive selling, which is not permitted under any circumstances, an unfair commercial tying practice, or a misleading or aggressive commercial practice.\\" The case is pending before the Court of Cassation. In September 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that \\"the sale of a computer equipped with pre-installed software does not in itself constitute an unfair commercial practice within the meaning of Directive 2005/29 when such an offer is not contrary to the requirements of professional diligence and does not distort the economic behaviour of consumers.\\" The Court also ruled that Directive 2005/29 does not require OEMs to include a separate price for an operating system license. ==Public response== Websites have been created for the specific purpose of spreading information about the issue and educating others on their options for getting a refund. A 1999 rally opposing the bundling of Windows attracted about 100 protesters and gained media attention worldwide. The overall goal of such events has been to get OEMs to expand their selection of computers without a copy of Windows pre-installed, with the additional goal of getting them to revise and improve their refund policies while the first goal has not been met. An analyst stated that refund actions by individual users were \\"a publicity stunt [that] has no impact\\". ==References== Category:Microsoft criticisms and controversies Category:Windows XP Windows XP ","title":"Bundling of Microsoft Windows"},{"id":"20534940","text":"Realtime Interrupt is a 1995 science fiction novel by James P.

It is located on Madison Ave in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, adjacent to AutoZone Park, a minor league baseball stadium. Architect G. M. Shaw designed the structure for S. C. Toof & Co., the oldest printing company in Memphis, it was built in 1913 to serve as a production and administrative facility for the company. On six stories, the building offers of production and office space. In 2008, the building is vacant. In the Summer of 2014, construction began on the building for the creation of The Press Box Lofts. The first residents moved in November, 2014. ==History== Mural on the eastern side of the building (2009) The S. C. Toof & Co. printing business was founded in 1864. To accommodate for the expanding business after the turn of the 20th century, the Toof Building was planned by architect G. M. Shaw to serve as the new production and administrative site for the company in downtown Memphis. The building was designed in the architectural style of the Chicago School. The Chicago School utilized new technologies of steel-frame construction with masonry cladding and plate-glass window areas. Focusing on the function of the building rather than its appearance, the style also limited the amounts of ornament on the exterior. Construction of the building was completed in 1913. S. C. Toof & Co. is the oldest printing company in the Memphis area and is still in existence in 2008 under the name Toof Commercial Printing Co., with a business address on S Cooper St in Memphis. In 1982, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Toof Building is located west of and adjacent to AutoZone Park, a minor league baseball stadium and home of the Memphis Redbirds. In the mid-1990s, plans emerged to establish a minor league baseball museum in the vacant building. Lack of financial support for the museum let the supporters abandon the plans. The privately owned structure is still vacant in 2008, windows and doors are boarded. Since August 2008, the eastern side of the building, facing the AutoZone Park baseball stadium, was prepared for a large-scale mural. The mural was completed in April 2009. ==See also== * Chicago School (architecture) * National Register of Historic Places listings in Shelby County, Tennessee ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Memphis, Tennessee Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Memphis, Tennessee Category:Chicago school architecture in the United States ","title":"Toof Building"},{"id":"20534962","text":"Sean-nós ( ; Irish for \\"old style\\") is a highly ornamented style of unaccompanied traditional Irish singing, and in the singing of Ireland's Gaeltacht. == Sean-nós singing style == Sean-nós singing is a highly ornamented style of solo, unaccompanied singing defined by Tomás Ó Canainn as: > ...a rather complex way of singing in Irish, confined mainly to some areas > in the west and south of the country. It is unaccompanied and has a highly > ornamented melodic line....Not all areas have the same type of > ornamentation—one finds a very florid line in Connacht, contrasting with a > somewhat less decorated one in the south, and, by comparison, a stark > simplicity in the northern songs...Tomas Ó'Canainn, Traditional Music in > Ireland (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978), pp. 49, 71 Ó Canainn also asserts that \\"...no aspect of Irish music can be fully understood without a deep appreciation of sean-nós singing. It is the key which opens every lock\\". Alternatively, it is simply \\"the old, traditional style of singing\\" and therefore is not always ornamented. It varies very much from one part of the country to another, as according to Hiúdaí Ó Duibheannaigh, who served on the Irish Folklore Commission from 1936 to 1939, \\"...people now, that word being used these last forty years, think it's a particular style of singing: it's not!\\" Sean-nós songs can be relatively simple, though many are long, extremely stylised and melodically complex. A good performance classically involves substantial ornament and rhythmic variations from verse to verse. Ó Canainn identifies most ornamentation as melismatic ornamentation. This is when a note is replaced or emphasised by a group of adjoining notes, unlike intervallic ornamentation, in which additional notes are used to fill up an interval between two notes. Decorative elements common in sean-nós singing fulfill aesthetic purposes to connect the text to the singer's interpretation of the melody and to enhance a sense of continuity by filling the gaps between phrases. These decorative elements, or ornamentations, include: * Highly ornamented singing where the voice is placed near the top of the range * Nasalisation * A second form of nasalisation, used in the south, produces an \\"m\\", \\"n\\" or \\"ng\\" sound at the end of a phrase * Melisma (singing one syllable in a word to several notes) * Brief pauses initiated by glottal stops, \\"slides\\" or glissandi (predominantly when sung by women) * Very long extended phrases * A tendency to draw breath after a conjunction or linking words rather than at the end of a phrase * Ending some songs by speaking the finishing line instead of singing it * Varying the melody in each verse An example of the sean-nós singing style, sung by Bridget Fitzgerald, may be heard here A number of songs are modal, as opposed to major, in melody. == Distinguishing social features == \\"Songs were made to accompany the work inside and outside the home, to express the many emotions - love and sadness of daily existence, to record local and other historical events and to often mark the loss of family and friends whether by death or by emigration\\".Amhranaíocht ar an Sean-nós, Tomás Ó Maoldomhnaigh, Treoir, Volume 36 Number 1, Spring 2004 https://comhaltas.ie/music/treoir/detail/amhranaiocht_ar_an_sean_nos/ The very interaction between the performer and audience is a crucial aspect of the sean-nós tradition. * The singer may require cajoling—this may be considered as part of the recital. * The singer may occasionally adopt a position facing the corner of the room and away from the audience, with eyes closed, a position that has acoustic benefits, aids concentration for performing long intricate songs from memory, and perhaps has some additional ancient significance. * The listeners are not expected to be silent throughout and may participate in the performance through words of encouragement and commentary. Sometimes a listener will hold the performer's hand, and together they will move or \\"wind\\" their linked hands in the rhythm of the song. Such interactions do not disturb the flow of music, and the performer will often respond musically. (The Irish Gaelic verb cas means to turn or wind, and an idiomatic expression for singing is to turn/wind a song: cas amhrán.) The performance of most songs is not restricted by gender, although the lyrics may imply a song is from a woman's or man's point of view. There are a few songs that men have a tendency not to sing. Women, however, do not seem to have the same hesitation. == Content of lyrics == Many of the songs typically sung sean-nós could be seen as forms of love poetry, laments, or references to historical events such as political rebellions or times of famine, lullabies, nature poetry, devotional songs, or combinations of these. Comic songs are also part of the tradition (e.g., An Spailpin Fanach, Cunnla, Bean Pháidin), as are references to drink (An Bonnan Bui, Preab san Ol, Olaim Puins is Olaim Te). == Regional variation == There are four main styles of sean-nós, corresponding to the three areas where Irish is still spoken as a community language, the Gaeltachtaí of west Munster (parts of Kerry, and Cork), east Munster (Waterford), Connacht (Connemara and Meath); and to Ulster. \\"It would not be correct to say sean nós is not practised outside these areas, but only those four distinct styles can be recognised. Singers from the Galltacht (i.e. outside the Gaeltacht or Irish-speaking areas) and indeed from outside Ireland may blend them, depending on where they learned\\". These differences in style generally correspond geographically to the various dialects of Irish. While sean-nós singing varies around Ireland, with ease of travel and the influence of recording media, these distinctions have become less definite since at least the early twentieth century; singers sometimes adopt different styles from various parts of the country. === Donegal style === The Donegal style has been heavily influenced by Scottish Gaelic singing.Sean-nós in Donegal, Julie Henigan http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/sean-nos.htm It is a relatively unadorned and nasal style. The melody is sometimes less ornamented. As a result, the Donegal style can stand out from other regional styles. === Connemara style === A more decorated style, with forms familiar to a traditional instrumentalist along with other more complex forms. (e.g. as performed by Bridget Fitzgerald) === West Munster style === Also a highly ornamented style. The notes to be ornamented can be adjacent to each other like in Connemara, but at other times the gap between them can be wide. === East Munster style === The Waterford Gaeltacht of An Rinn also has a distinct style, despite the small size of its population, which can be heard in the singing of Nioclás Tóibín. == Language variation == The term \\"sean-nós\\" is popularly applied to songs in English and Irish, with the style of singing that is characteristic. A number of sean-nós songs are macaronic, combining two or more languages. Normally they combine Irish and English, but occasionally Irish and French or other European languages, including Latin. Some traditionalists nevertheless believe that songs must have some Irish lyrics to belong to the tradition. To the first-time listener accustomed to Western music, sean-nós singing may sound \\"Arabic\\" or \\"Indian\\". Film-maker Bob Quinn, in his Atlantean series of films, suggests a north African cultural connection. == History of sean-nós song and modern developments == The tradition of sean-nós song was exclusively oral, and remains customarily so. However a few songs were known to have been conveyed to script as early as the 16th century. A songbook for Elizabeth I contained English interpretations of sean-nós songs. Songs started to be more extensively written down in the eighteenth century and distributed in print from then on. New composition is a controversial issue within sean-nós song circles. Some singers insist that the traditional should be supplemented with new material, arguing that since society has changed, then the content of the lyrics should reflect this. On the other hand, some singers say that only the older, \\"traditional\\" songs represent the essence of sean-nós song and therefore deserve a protected, preferential status. == Means of preserving Irish music and dance == Sean-nós song is a sean-nós activity, which also includes sean-nós dance. These forms of Irish dance and song have been documented by scholars of ethnomusicology, musicology, linguistics and other fields, such as Hugh Shields, Tom Munnelly, Fintan Vallely, and Lillis Ó Laoire. The practice of sean-nós dance, sean-nós song, lilting (also known as \\"mouth music\\"), and \\"the bones\\" (a simple percussion instrument convenient to carry in a pocket) has existed for centuries. It might be interpreted as a minimalist means that helped preserve a musical and dance heritage at a time when musical instruments were too expensive for most peasants.Irish Step Dancing – A Brief History, Don Haurin & Ann Richens == Other Celtic unaccompanied singing styles == Irish lilting is usually performed without musical accompaniment. Scottish Gaelic songs were also typically sung unadorned. == See also == * List of traditional Irish singers * Lilting or \\"mouth music\\" * Waulking song * Puirt á beul (also known as Diddling) * Sean-nós dance * Sean Nós and Sean-nós Activities == References  Sources == * Dorothea E.

According to this history, three men from that village approached Rai Sandal Khan Bhatti who was their tribal chief and Raja, and also the grandfather of famous Rai Abdullah Khan Bhatti a.k.a.

DeLuna first rose to fame in 2007, when she released her debut single \\"Whine Up\\". The single became one of the most played songs on pop radio that summer, and achieved major success worldwide, reaching the top ten in countries such as Belgium and France. The single also became a smash hit in the US, peaking inside the top forty of the Hot 100 single chart, as well as topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The single led to the release of DeLuna's debut album, 9 Lives in the Fall of 2007. The album was met to generally positive critical reception. The album debuted at number 58 in the US, and charted within the top twenty of countries such as Belgium and Poland. In 2008, DeLuna began work on her second studio album. The album spawned several official and promotional singles. The first of these was \\"Unstoppable\\", which became a minor hit in Canada. The song was featured in the film Confessions of a Shopaholic, as well as its accompanying soundtrack. It was followed by the second promotional single \\"Dance Bailalo\\", which became a major hit on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. DeLuna's second album, titled Inside Out later spawned the official singles \\"Push Push\\", \\"Party O'Clock\\" and \\"Dancing Tonight\\". After much delay, Inside Out was released in Belgium on November 5, 2010. It received commercial success, reaching the top twenty of the Belgium album chart. The album is currently released only in some European markets (Belgium, France, Poland). Inside Out was also released in Japan on July 13, 2011. A compilation album, Loading appeared in 2016. Since 2012, DeLuna has been reportedly working on her third album under the title ViVa Out Loud. ==AlbumsStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions !

The name \\"Gibbaeum\\" comes from the Latin gibbosus (hunchback) ==Description== Gibbaeum pubescens in natural habitat. These dwarf succulents are characterized by distinctively asymmetrical pairs of leaves, mostly globular or sometimes thick and arcuate. The sizes of the leaves of each pair are nearly always different. Gibbaeums grow in clumps and produce pink or white flowers in spring.http://www.succulentguide.com/cactus/?genus=Gibbaeumhttp://redlist.sanbi.org/genus.php?genus=114 ==Distribution== Genus Gibbaeum is predominantly indigenous to the Little Karoo region of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. A few species extend outside of this region. Three species extend north into the Great Karoo region: Gibbaeum gibbosum, Gibbaeum heathii and Gibbaeum nuciforme. Two extend south into the Overberg region: Gibbaeum esterhuyseniae and Gibbaeum hartmannianum. ==Cultivation== Sunny exposure and well drained soil. Their natural range spans the boundary between winter and summer rainfall areas of southern Africa, and their growth period (emergence of new leaves and flowering) is therefore in summer for some species and in winter for other ones. However, overall most species can be watered primarily in winter. Temperature must stay above 10 °C in winter. Propagation can be done by cuttings or by seeds. Many of the species hybridise easily - with each other and with the related genus Muiria. ==List of species== * Gibbaeum album * Gibbaeum angulipes * Gibbaeum blackburniae * Gibbaeum comptonii * Gibbaeum dispar * Gibbaeum esterhuyseniae * Gibbaeum geminum * Gibbaeum gibbosum * Gibbaeum hartmannianum * Gibbaeum heathii * Gibbaeum luckhofii * Gibbaeum nebrownii * Gibbaeum nuciforme * Gibbaeum pachypodium * Gibbaeum petrense * Gibbaeum pilosulum * Gibbaeum pubescens * Gibbaeum schwantesii * Gibbaeum velutinum File:Z Gibbaeum album growing among rocks - RSA.jpgGibbaeum album File:Gibbaeum dispar IMG 2483.jpgGibbaeum dispar File:Gibbaeum geminum - SBG 2.jpgGibbaeum geminum File:4 Gibbaeum gibbosum -Touwsrivier - Copy.jpgGibbaeum gibbosum File:5 Gibbaeum hartmannianum - Overberg Malgas - Copy.jpgGibbaeum hartmannianum File:Gibbaeum heathii varieties.jpgGibbaeum heathii forms File:Gibbaeum velutinum barrydale.jpgGibbaeum velutinum File:6 Gibbaeum petrense Brandvlei Rd - Copy.jpgGibbaeum petrense File:Gibbaeum pubescens - N Barrydale 2.jpgGibbaeum pubescens File:1 Gibbaeum shandii - Kirstenbosch gardens.jpgGibbaeum pubescens var. shandii File:Gibbaeum schwantesii IMG 1568.jpgGibbaeum schwantesii File:Gibbaeum pilosulum in cultivation - cape town.jpgGibbaeum pilosulum File:Gibbaeum nuciforme.jpgGibbaeum nuciforme File:Gibbaeum nebrownii.jpgGibbaeum nebrownii ==References * photos on www.AIAPS.org Category:Aizoaceae genera ","title":"Gibbaeum"},{"id":"20535015","text":"A da Rimini altarpiece, 14th century Giuliano da Rimini was an Italian painter, circa 1307 to 1324.

It is located to the northwest of the city centre, close to the point at which Taieri Road becomes the winding rural Three Mile Hill Road. It was this road which gave the suburb its name, as this locality was halfway between the Taieri Plains and central Dunedin in the early days of European settlement, when Three Mile Hill was the main route from Dunedin to the Otago hinterland. This route was superseded by the route through the Caversham Valley in the 1860s. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Halfway Bush has a population of 1,863, a decrease of 30 people since the 2006 census. There were 912 males and 951 females. Halfway Bush is the most inland of the suburbs which comprise Dunedin's main urban area, and is at an altitude of . For these reasons, it often receives harsher winter weather than much of the rest of the city. Whereas central Dunedin may only receive passing snow showers on average one or two days per year, snow will often settle on the streets of Halfway Bush for several days per year. The suburb is connected to central Dunedin by Taieri Road, which runs through the suburb to the suburb of Wakari to the southeast. From Wakari, the road rises to pass under the Roslyn Overbridge before descending into the centre of the city as Stuart Street. The smaller suburb of Helensburgh lies to the east of Halfway Bush, but the suburb is surrounded by rural land to the north and west. To the southwest lies Fraser's Gully, a scenic reserve, which separates Halfway Bush from the suburb of Brockville. A popular alternative route to central Dunedin is via Maori Hill and Drivers Road to George Street. Halfway Bush mainly consists of Taieri Road and a series of crescents which branch from it. Chief among these are Ashmore Street and Gilkison Street, the latter of which connects with Wakari Road, a long, straight semi-rural road which links Taieri Road with Glenleith, to the northwest, by way of Helensburgh and the forest plantations surrounding Ross Creek Reservoir. Prominent buildings in the Halfway Bush area include Halfway Bush School, the local primary school, and two health facilities; Wakari Hospital, which is located at the eastern end of the suburb, and Ashburn Hall, a private psychiatric clinic, at the point where Taieri Road becomes Three Mile Hill Road, close to the suburb's western end. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Dunedin ","title":"Halfway Bush"},{"id":"20535029","text":"The Vibrisseaceae are a family of fungi in the order Helotiales.

The ascospores are typically light-brown to dark-brown and are often multiseptate. Other species of fungi have been known to parasitize ascocarps. The use of a compound microscope is needed for accurate identification.\\"Family: Geoglossaceae.\\" The Hidden Forest. 26 Aug. 2009 . ==Systematics== The fungi that are now included in the fungal class Geoglossomycetes were previously considered by mycologists to be a family (Geoglossaceae) within the class Leotiomycetes. The family Geoglossaceae sensu lato was previously defined with 6 genera and 48 species. Early molecular evidence using ribosomal DNA suggested that Geoglossaceae sensu lato was not a monophyletic group, and that the hyaline spored genera (e.g. Leotia, Microglossum, and Spathularia) were not allied within the same clade as the darker-spored genera (Geoglossum and Trichoglossum). Schoch et al., using a six-gene phylogeny including ribosomal DNA and protein-coding genes, found support for the establishment of a new class (Geoglossomycetes), containing the genera Geoglossum, Sarcoleotia, and Trichoglossum. Further molecular research resulted in the addition of Nothomitra (previously treated as a relative or synonym of Microglossum) to the group in 2011. Glutinoglossum was circumscribed in 2013 to contain the species formerly known as Geoglossum glutinosum, and a new European species, G. heptaseptatum. ==Habitat== Earth tongues are commonly found in soil or among rotting vegetation. In North America, they are commonly found in coniferous woodland, broad-leaved woodland and mixed woodland habitats, whereas in Europe they are commonly found in grassland habitats and are major components of the endangered waxcap grassland habitat. ==References== * ","title":"Geoglossaceae"},{"id":"20535050","text":"The Cudoniaceae are a family of fungi in the Helotiales order.

The OED dates the first express use of the term \\"animal painter\\" to the mid-18th century: by English physician, naturalist and writer John Berkenhout (1726-1791). From the early 20th century, wildlife artist became a more usual term for contemporary animal painters. ==History== Frans Snyders and workshop, The boar hunt, c. 1650. Especially in the 17th century, animal painters would often collaborate with other artists, who would either paint the main subject in a historical or mythological piece, or the landscape background in a decorative one. Frans Snyders, a founder of the Baroque animal painting tradition, often provided the animals, and also still lifes of food, for Peter Paul Rubens; a different landscape specialist might provide the background. The paintings by Snyders and his workshop alone typically lack humans, except in kitchen scenes, and usual show a number of animals of different species (or breeds of dog). There are about equal numbers of paintings of dead animals, usually in a kitchen setting, or as hunting trophies in a landscape, and of live ones, often in ferocious combat. In the Dutch Golden Age such specialists tended to produce smaller genre paintings concentrating on their specialism. Animal painters came lower down in the hierarchy of genres, but the best painters could make a very good living; many royal and aristocratic patrons were more interested in their subject matter than that of the more prestigious genres. Mainly in England, there were still more specialised painters from the 18th century who produced portraits of racehorses and prize specimens of livestock, whereas in France animal subjects continued to be decorative capriccios often set around garden statuary. In 2014 Jonathan Jones of The Guardian proposed The Goldfinch (1654) by Carel Fabritius (1622-1654) as the finest animal portrait; this was not the artist's normal subject matter at all. ==Animalier== Antoine-Louis Barye, Jaguar Devouring a Hare, 1850 Animalier, as a collective plural noun, is a term used in antiques for small-scale sculptures of animals in particular (animalier bronzes), but also paintings of animals. Large numbers of these were produced - often mass-produced - in the 19th century in France and elsewhere. Many earlier examples can be found, but animalier sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th century Paris, with the works of Antoine-Louis Barye (1795-1875) - for whom the term was coined, decisively, by critics in 1831 \\\\- and Christopher Fratin (1801-1864). By the mid 19th-century, a taste for animal subjects was widespread among the middle-classes. ==Wildlife conservation== Many modern wildlife artists or art groups hold benefits to support wildlife conservation, or participate in contests held by wildlife conservation organisations. ==Notable animal paintersBefore 1800=== * Francis Barlow (c. 1626-1704) * Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625) * Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1664) * Nicasius Bernaerts (1620-1678) * Pieter Boel (1626-1674) * Peter van Boucle (between 1600 & 1610-1673) * Charles Catton (1728-1798) * David de Coninck (c. 1644-1701+) * Marmaduke Cradock (1660-1716) * Thomas Davies (c. 1737-1812) * Alexandre-François Desportes (1661-1743) * Karel Dujardin (1622-1678) * C.

The community was part of the Douglas Township until it was named Maitland after Governor General of Nova Scotia Peregrine Maitland (1828–34), when building the Shubenacadie Canal was first attempted (1826–1831).

Oral tradition states that the Oak Island Graveyard was an Acadian burial ground, which was consecrated by Abbe Jean- Louis Le Loutre. Oral tradition also states that a path which connects the \\"French Field\\" in Selma to the cemetery in Maitland is the old Acadian roadway. Several of Jean Denis Pitre’s children married the children of Noel Doiron and Robert Henry from the neighbouring communities of Vil Noel (Noel, Nova Scotia) and Vil Robere respectively. In 1750 the Acadians at Maitland joined the Acadian Exodus during Father Le Loutre's War and moved to Riviere Nord-Est, Ile St. Jean (present day Hillsborough River (Prince Edward Island)). The former of inhabitants of Maitland died in 1758 during the Expulsion of the Acadians in the sinking of the Duke William. ==Ulster Scots (Irish)== After the exodus of the Acadians from Maitland (1750), the land was owned but never settled by Malachy Salter. Decades after the village was vacated by the Acadians, the village was settled by Ulster Scots people such as the Putnams (c. 1771). ==Shipbuilding== Maitland emerged as a major shipbuilding centre in the late 19th century. William Dawson Lawrence became the community's most famous shipbuilder. His ship, the William D. Lawrence, was the largest wooden ship ever built in Canada and third largest in the world, was launched at the William D. Lawrence Shipyard in Maitland on October 27, 1874 to one of the largest crowds assembled in Nova Scotia to that date. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic William D.

Lawrence=== William Dawson Lawrence was one of the most successful ship builders in the Maritimes, most famous for building Canada's largest wooden ship, the William D. Lawrence. In an unpublished manuscript written in 1880 toward the end of his life, he wrote of the maiden voyage of the William D. Lawrence. He described returning to the place of his birth, Lawrencetown, County Down, Ireland (close to Gilford, Ireland). He also recollects being mortified by a bullfight that he saw in Peru and enjoying the masked ball he attended while in Paris. During one of his stays in London, Lawrence also attended a sermon of the famous preacher and writer Charles Spurgeon. Lawrence was also a politician and wrote passionately for Nova Scotia's independence in the anti-Confederation Campaign. He ran successfully as a MLA with Joseph Howe running as an MP, both as anti-Confederates in the Hants County elections of 1867. Two years later, much to Lawrence's dismay, Joseph Howe conceded to Confederation and ran in a by-election on a platform for making \\"better terms\\" for Nova Scotia within Canada. Howe won which later led to Lawrence's defeat in the following election (1871). ===Other notable residents=== *Birthplace of Willard Miller, Spanish–American War hero, recipient of the Medal of Honor one of the famous \\"Miller Brothers\\". *Kate McArthur who was made famous through surviving for many days at sea in a lifeboat and then giving birth upon being rescued. === Film === The story for the television drama \\"The Night They Killed Joe Howe\\" (1960) (TV drama), starring Douglas Rain, Austin Willis and Star Trek's James Doohan, was located in Maitland, Nova Scotia ( Film Review) ==References== * Category:Communities in Hants County, Nova Scotia Category:General Service Areas in Nova Scotia ","title":"Maitland, Hants County, Nova Scotia"},{"id":"20535191","text":"Trichodiadema is a genus of succulent plants of the family Aizoaceae.

Starring Maxim Gaudette, Sebastien Huberdeau, and Karine Vanasse, the film is based on the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre (also known as the \\"Montreal Massacre\\") and re-enacts the events of the incident through the eyes of two students (Huberdeau and Vanasse) who witness a gunman (Gaudette) murder fourteen young women. After a release in Quebec in February 2009, it was featured in the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. It received numerous honours, including nine Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. ==Plot== A young man prepares his rifle and leaves a message for his mother. He then goes to Polytechnique Montreal, an engineering school, and enters a classroom during class with a rifle. He orders the men to leave and the women to stay. They comply after he shoots into the ceiling to show that he is serious. He tells the women that he hates feminists. Although the women deny being feminists, he shoots at them, killing some and wounding others. He then moves through corridors and the cafeteria, specifically targeting women. One of the male students is Jean-François, who was ordered to leave the classroom. He does not merely flee, as he returns to try to stop the killer and/or help the victims. Valérie and Stéphanie, two surviving women, play dead thinking the killer has returned, although Stéphanie later dies of her injuries. Finally, the killer reaches another classroom where he kills a female lecturer. He then commits suicide, and his blood mixes with the blood of his victim. Some time after the massacre, Jean-François, feeling guilty for complying with the order to leave the classroom and abandoning the women, commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Valérie, wearing the Iron Ring, the professional ring of Canadian engineers, learns she is pregnant, planning to tell a potential son to be loving or a potential daughter that the world belongs to her. ==Cast== * Maxim Gaudette as The Killer * Sébastien Huberdeau as Jean-François * Karine Vanasse as Valérie * Évelyne Brochu as Stéphanie * Johanne-Marie Tremblay as Jean-François' mother ** Natalie Hamel-Roy as Jean- François' mother (voice) * Pierre-Yves Cardinal as Éric Karine Vanasse stars as Valérie and helped produce the film. The rest of the cast listed alphabetically: ==ProductionDevelopment=== Karine Vanasse, who played Valérie, helped produce Polytechnique, and wanted to make a film about the massacre for years. She helped secure director Denis Villeneuve for the film, who at the time was respected for making the 2000 film Maelström. Despite the sensitivity to the incident in Quebec, Villeneuve asserted it was not too soon for a film, and that there was an important conversation to be had. Vanasse researched by speaking to the families of women killed in École Polytechnique de Montréal. In the film, one of the women tells The Killer that the students are not feminists, with Vanasse explaining, \\"One of the women who was there told me that it was the first time in her life that she had to confront her femininity head on\\". ===Filming=== Collège Ahuntsic was a filming location. École Polytechnique de Montréal gave the filmmakers the right to use the campus as a location, but Villeneuve opted against filming there to be respectful. The film was shot at Cégep de Maisonneuve and Collège Ahuntsic as well as Griffintown and Westmount. Villeneuve shot the film in black and white, so as to avoid the presence of blood on screen. There were two versions of the film produced, one in English and one in French. The director Denis Villeneuve hoped the film would enter into the English-Canadian market, as well as the U.S. one. Villeneuve said the subject matter was challenging for the cast and crew to work with. ==Release== Polytechnique was screened at the Directors' Fortnight at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May. It was also featured in festivals in London, Spain and Namur in fall 2009. The film was released on 6 February 2009, in Quebec, and on 20 March 2009, in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary. Its release sparked controversy in Quebec and across Canada for its depiction of real life events involving the murder of unarmed students. The film was shown in 45 theatres in Quebec. By August 2009, the distributor Remstar had sold screening rights to around 12 countries. Alliance Films and Remstar released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in August 2009, along with French language documentary films on the real massacre. It was showcased in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in summer 2011. ==ReceptionBox office=== The film grossed $326,000 in Quebec cinemas during its opening weekend, ranking first at the Quebec box office. By August 2009, it grossed $1.6 million. In English Canadian areas, it grossed $100,000. It was considered a financial hit in Quebec. ===Critical response=== The film has received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of professional critics gave the film a positive review based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 6.98/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In Canada, Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three and a half stars out of four, stating \\"Polytechnique makes no judgments, offers no panaceas. It shows the violence, faithfully recreating the historical record, but it doesn't wallow in it. Pierre Gill's brilliant monochrome lensing minimizes the effect of the blood. [...] It stands as a work of art, summoning unspoken thoughts the way Picasso's war abstraction Guernica does in a scene of contemplation with Jean- François.\\" Katherine Monk of Canwest News Services gave the film four stars out of five; \\"The paradox may sound grotesque, but it must be stated loud and clear: Denis Villeneuve and the cast of Polytechnique have transformed the tragedy of the Montreal Massacre into a work of profound beauty.\\" Critics compared Polytechnique, favorably or unfavorably, to Gus Van Sant's Palme d'Or winning 2003 film Elephant. In The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that like Villeneuve's later film Incendies, Polytechnique was a statement on decency being more powerful than savagery, and benefited from a rational look on an extreme matter. In Variety, Rob Nelson compared it unfavourably to Halloween (1978) and other violent horror films, but gave it marks for addressing the misogyny of the crime. Ray Bennett criticized the film in The Hollywood Reporter for not examining the psychology of The Killer, and could not understand why the characters did not pull the fire alarm. Denis Seguin of Screen Daily gave the film a favourable review, writing \\"Polytechnique is a formalist interpretation of an atrocity, with a cool perspective on the events and much for audiences to read between the frames as the film moves back and forth through time.\\" Time Out gave it four stars, saying it avoided tabloid journalism and foreshadowed the message of forgiveness in the face of horror in Incendies. ===Accolades=== In presenting the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award to Polytechnique in January 2010, Toronto Film Critics Association president Brian D.

To these compound rebuilds was added the prototype eight-coupled goods engine No. 2524 which was rebuilt with a larger boiler in 1906. Previously it had been similar to the Class C with a smaller boiler; though was not classified as such since the letter classification was introduced in 1911. ==Numbering== All Ds were numbered in the 18xx or 25xx series by the LNWR. All passed into LMS ownership in 1923, and the LMS assigned them the numbers 9002-64, sequentially in order of rebuild date. The LMS rebuilt all of the Ds with the addition of superheating, taking them into Class G1, nicknamed \\"Super Ds\\" between 1925 and 1934. Many carried their LNWR numbers until rebuilt for a second time, and the LMS number thereafter.

She started her career as a theatre performer before becoming a silent film accompanist, after which she became a leading organist on network radio and television for soap operas and dramas. In 1993 she reprised her film accompaniment career in Florida, providing the scores for early productions, some of which she had accompanied some 80 years earlier, on their release to cinema. ==BiographyEarly life=== Rio was born as Elizabeth Raub and raised in New Orleans. She began playing piano at the age of four and started taking lessons at the age of eight. At age nine she played piano at a silent movie theater for the first time. She studied music at Oberlin College and at the Eastman School of Music. Her instrument of choice was a Wurlitzer pipe organ. She married her professor at Eastman, organist John Hammond; they had a son, John Farnsworth Hammond III, who preceded her in death. The marriage ended in divorce. She later married Bill Yeoman, her husband of 63 years. She had three grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and a pet snail named Iowa. Bill Yeoman, her husband, said that Raub adopted the stage name of Rosa Rio because it fitted easily on a theater marquee. ===Motion Pictures=== As a theater organist, Rio performed in Syracuse, at Loews theaters in New York City, at the Saenger Southeastern theater chain, the Scranton Paramount, Brooklyn Fox Theatre, RKO Albee, and the Brooklyn Paramount.The Golden Age of Radio: Rosa Rio She was working at the Saenger Theatre in her hometown of New Orleans when Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer was released, signaling the end of the silent film era. Among the films she composed for and provided accompaniment for include The Phantom of The Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and the seminal The Birth Of A Nation ===Radio=== Caricature of Rosa Rio reflecting on her career as a staff organist for NBC Radio. Known as \\"Queen of the Soaps,\\" Rio worked for 22 years in radio, providing the organ background music for 24 radio soap operas and radio dramas, and playing an average of five to seven shows per day.\\"Musician Rosa Rio dies at 107: Silent film organist worked on NBC shows\\", Variety, May 16, 2010. Some days she went from one program immediately to another—as when Lorenzo Jones and Bob and Ray were adjacent on NBC's schedule during the early 1950s—with less than 50 seconds to run from one NBC studio to another . Some of the programs she played for included Bob and Ray, Ethel and Albert, Front Page Farrell, Lorenzo Jones, My True Story, The Shadow and When a Girl Marries. During World War II she had her own radio show, Rosa Rio Rhythms. ===Television and teaching=== Rio made a smooth transition into television, playing for shows such as As the World Turns and the Today Show.. However, compared to radio, television offered fewer opportunities for work. Rio later moved to Connecticut, where she opened a music school with classes in voice, organ and piano. ===Video scores=== During the 1980s, she provided scores and Hammond organ accompaniment to more than 370 silent films released on video by Video Yesteryear. ===Later career=== Rosa Rio at the Tampa Theatre Wurlitzer (May 2006) In 1993, Rio moved to Hillsborough County in Florida, where she played accompaniment to silent films at the Tampa Theatre. She was still providing silent film accompaniment up to her death, including a screening of the Buster Keaton film One Week.Tampa Theatre: Rosa Rio It was from the stage of the Tampa Theatre in 2007 that she first publicly gave her real age, which she had kept to herself for decades due to age discrimination dating back to her network radio years.

Leavitt and his wife Mary Ellen (Sturgis).History of Gorham, Me., Hugh Davis McLellan, Katherine B. Lewis, Smith & Sale Printers, Portland, Me., 1903 After attending high school in nearby Gorham, Maine, Leavitt was educated at Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, and then at Harvard University, where he graduated with a Ph.D. in 1917. ==Career== Between stints at Harvard Graduate School, Leavitt taught at Jackson Military Academy in Missouri, Cushing Academy in Massachusetts, Northwestern University and at Harvard College. Following his graduation from Harvard, where he was awarded the Sheldon Traveling Fellowship, Leavitt embarked on a trip to South America. For the next two years, he traveled between Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. Following his tour of South America, Leavitt returned to America, where he was offered a junior teaching job at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1917. Following his Harvard graduation, Leavitt eventually become full professor and later Kenan Professor of Spanish.Sturgis Elleno Leavitt, South Atlantic Modern Language Association, Language Arts & Disciplines, Ayer Company Publishers, 1972 The Maine native's early days in the South as a professor of Spanish studies were not without trials. \\"In 1930 Southern colleges and universities lagged far behind the great Northern and (some) Western universities\\", writes professor Clifford Lyons of UNC Chapel Hill. \\"We had few distinguished scholars and most of them did not have access to a first-class university library.\\" Eventually, because of the efforts of Leavitt and scholars like him, the universities and colleges of the south were able to build modern language departments of stature. \\"All that has changed, and I think SAMLA SAMLA is the South Atlantic Modern Language Association, which Sturgis Leavitt was instrumental in founding. had a lot to do with it\\", writes Lyons. (In the part of the twentieth century, other notable Southern scholars in other fields also fled northward, including Yale University's Cleanth Brooks, a native of Kentucky, and Robert Penn Warren, writer, Yale professor and fellow Kentucky native.) In 1935 the young Spanish professor and Maine native helped found and became editor of The South Atlantic Bulletin, a publication addressed to the Southern Hemisphere of North America. The first issue appeared in May 1935 in broadside format, approximately 11x16 inches. The inaugural issue carried a statement of purpose which made clear that the bulletin would examine all aspects of the field, including the treatment of those teaching in it: \\"It [the Bulletin] should publish, for example, descriptions of important collections in the libraries of the Southeast, and reviews and notices of scholarly publications by our members\\", Leavitt wrote. \\"It should also make known the results of investigations regarding the attitudes of school authorities toward research, sabbatical leaves, and related problems.\\" Leavitt proposed to charge $1 for annual dues - a figure that held for the next 20 years (until 1955). Leavitt remained the Bulletin's editor until 1950, and managed to publish an issue on time each out of readers' annual dues. In 1956 Leavitt was elected to the board of the national Modern Language Association, on which he served three years. He later served as Director of Inter-America Institute, a school for large groups of teachers and students from Latin American countries. Leavitt served as president of the AATSP from 1945-46, and as member of the editor's advisory council for Hispania magazine for many years.Sturgis Elleno Leavitt, 1888-1976, Hispania magazine, Vol. 59, No. 2 (May 1976), pp. 218-224, Sterling Stoudemire, JSTOR The bibliography that Leavitt maintained of Hispanic literature has been called one of his notable contributions to the field of Spanish language studies.Theses Dealing with Hispano-American Language and Literature - 1943, Hispania magazine, Vol. 27, No. 2 (May 1944), pp 163-166, published by American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese, JSTOR ==Awards== Sturgis Leavitt was awarded honorary degrees of Doctor of Letters by Davidson College and by his alma mater Bowdoin.

Three main strike periods occurred in 1933, with length of time and level of violence increased during each one. The cooperative milk pool attempted to coordinate their efforts with larger farm groups, specifically the National Farm Holiday Association and Wisconsin Farmers' Holiday Association. However, during each strike, the larger farm holiday groups ended their strikes prematurely leaving the milk pool to conduct its strike alone. ==Rationale== Distribution of milk production in 1929 from 1930 Census. Wisconsin's Past and Present lists the price of evaporated milk from 1927 to 1929 as $4.79 / 100 lb with 46% to farmers, 33% to manufacturers and 21% to merchandisers. That price fell to an average of $3.48 / 100 lb, with individual farmers receiving a smaller percentage of the proceeds: 30.5% to farmers, 43% to manufacturers and 26.5% to merchandisers between 1930 and 1933. This decrease, combined with inflation during the Depression,Hausman, Joshua K., Paul W. Rhode, and Johannes F. Wieland. 2019. “Recovery from the Great Depression: The Farm Channel in Spring 1933†.” American Economic Review 109 (2): 427–72. doi:10.1257/aer.20170237. put small farmers in an extremely difficult position. Farmers who produced milk for bottling were able to remain solvent, but those who produced milk for cheese, butter and other uses were driven into poverty. The price of milk that was going to urban areas for bottling was around $1.50 for a hundred pounds while the milk going to cheese and butter factories was only getting $0.85 for a hundred pounds of milk. This created a kind of civil war between the two types of dairy farmers. Milk to be bottled was largely unaffected by the strikes. In the 1930s, Wisconsin was the largest producer of milk in the United States.1930 Decennial Census, 1929 Agricultural data tables. 11.052 billion US gallons of milk were produced in the United States in 1929; Wisconsin was the top producer, producing around 10% of milk in the U.S. WI 1.2 Billion US gallons of milk, MN 825 million US gallons of milk, NY 800 million US gallons of milk. According to the 1930 decennial census, there were more than 125,000 dairy farms in the state. 63% of all land in Wisconsin was farmland and 71% of that land was used for dairy farming.1930 Decennial Census. of Dairy farmland, for farms of all types. of land in Wisconsin. Distribution of milk sold as whole milk in Wisconsin in 1929, from 1930 Census. Methods employed in the strikes were initially to simply not sell milk unless a previously agreed upon price of $1.50 per hundred pounds had been met. When the strikers realized they were grossly outnumbered and that some of the members were selling at a reduced price, they resorted to roadblocks to prevent milk deliveries to the manufacturers. Fixed road blocks were established and trucks were turned back if they contained milk. If they refused to turn back, the strikers forcibly dumped the milk at the roadside. In the early strikes, the deliveries simply took alternate routes to avoid the fixed roadblocks. During later strikes, the strikers took to the roads in search of delivery trucks and forced them to turn back as they were found. When they couldn't stop the deliveries, the strikers sometimes resorted to tainting the delivered milk with kerosene or oil, or in a few cases, throwing bombs at the creameries. The state attempted to get milk to market by breaking up the road blocks or escorting convoys carrying milk to their destinations. Tear gas was employed to disburse larger groups of strikers and in one instance guardsmen with fixed bayonets forced farmers from their position. Railways and interurban trains were used to bypass the roadblocks, but some rail lines were blocked by strikers and at least one freight yard was infiltrated resulting in the dumping of the milk in the yard. At this time there were other farmer organizations in different Mid-Western states that had already been protesting the rise in dairy prices and other farm problems. These farmers leagues had a lot to do with the \\"Farmers Holiday\\" organization that emerged in 1932 and 1933 in certain areas that worked with another organization called The United Farmers League that was a communist led group that formed in 1930 and 1931 that worked with Farmers Holiday.Pratt, William C. \\"Women and the Farm Revolt of the 1930s.\\" Agricultural History 67, no. 2 (1993): 214–23. www.jstor.org/stable/3744058. The Farm Holiday Association had done strikes related to other areas of agriculture related industries such as strikes on livestock in different states and trying to keep farmers in different states on the same side of boycotts and protests. Farmers Holiday had a larger impact in the Wisconsin milk strikes by doing milk strikes in other states around the same time and attempting to coordinate strikes to be more affect across state lines targeting certain cities. ==February strike== The first set of strikes ran from February 15 to 22. They were mainly confined to strike strongholds centered on the area controlled by the Wisconsin Cooperative Milk Pool, led by Walter M. Singler, in the Fox Valley. The first blood shed in the strike was reported to be near Appleton, Wisconsin, when milk convoy guards threw heavy objects like horse shoes at a group of 100 strikers.\\"First Blood Reported in Milk Strike,\\" Wisconsin State Journal, Madison, Wisconsin, February 22, 1933, p. 1. ==May strike== The second in the series of strikes ran from May 13 to 19. These strikes spread to a larger part of Wisconsin and resulted in more violence than the February strike. In Shawano County, the Journal sentinel reported 30 people were injured when National Guardsmen, sworn in as deputies charged with keeping the roads open, and pickets \\"engaged in a pitched battle\\" in front of a dairy plant. \\"The strikers won the skirmish, dumping the milk and driving the deputies to cover by throwing back their own tear gas bombs,\\" the Journal Sentinel reported on May 15, 1933. National Guardsmen with fixed bayonets and tear gas forced pickets from Durham Hill in Waukesha County, May 16, 1933.\\"Guardsmen, Bayonets Fixed Patrol Strike Areas,\\" Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune, Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, May 18, 1933, p. 1. of milk was deliberately tainted with kerosene at a creamery near Farmington in Jefferson County.\\"Lake Mills Guard Doubled as Officials Hear Threats to Poison Milk, Bomb Plant,\\" Wisconsin State Journal, Madison, Wisconsin, May 16, 1933, p. 1.

On May 18, a farmer in his 50s was killed when he fell or was pushed from the running board of a milk delivery truck after it left a picket road block between Saukville and Grafton in Ozaukee County.\\"Picket Killed in Fall; Scores Injured, Jailed; Singler, Pool Chiefs Face Charges at Shawano,\\" Wisconsin State Journal, Madison, Wisconsin, May 18, 1933, p. 1. On May 19, the milk pool received a temporary peace with the state government in Madison to discus options to end the strikes. The five points the milk pool wanted examined were: First, to recall the National Guard away from protests. Second, followed by abolition of the two-price system for milk. Third, the reorganization of Department of Agriculture. Fourth, the prohibition against chain stores manufacturing and processing of food to make them weaker. And, fifth, being recognition for the organization of dairy farmers. ==October-to-November strike== The third series of strikes ran from October 21 to November 18 and a larger portion of Wisconsin was affected by them. Creameries near Plymouth and Fond du Lac, Wisconsin were bombed around November 1, 1933.\\"County Factory Is Bombed As Strike Ends,\\" Sheboygan Journal, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, November 1, 1933, p. 1.\\"Blast Damages Cheese Factory at St. Cloud,\\" Sheboygan Journal, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, November 1, 1933, p. 1.\\"End of farmer strike depends on Roosevelt,\\" Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 2, 1933, p. 1.

In all, seven creameries were bombed and thousands of pounds of milk were dumped. On October 28, 1933, a 60-year-old farmer was killed at a picket line in the Town of Burke, Wisconsin after a single bullet was fired into the crowd by a passenger in a car stopped by the crowd. The farmer killed had not been part of the picket and was there delivering food to the strikers. The shooter had been angered over a headlight a striker had broken while the shooter's vehicle was running the picket line earlier in the night. The shooter was later sentenced to two to four years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter charges.\\"McCorison Sentenced to 2–4 Years,\\" Wisconsin State Journal, Madison, Wisconsin, February 28, 1934, p. 1. ==Aftermath== Local newspapers reported that farmers lost $10 million during the strikes. After 1933, Singler's Cooperative Milk Pool purchased creameries to help increase the profits of its members, but the milk pool later faded into obscurity. The economy eventually improved, helping smaller farmers to earn more money, but it is not clear if the strikes aided this recovery.Herbert Jacobs, \\"The Wisconsin Milk Strikes,\\" Wisconsin Magazine of History, 35: 1 (Autumn 1951), p. 35. ==Notable individuals involved== *Walter M.

The movie stars Joanna Kerns in the movie's lead role, seismologist Clare Winslow, who tries to warn city leaders of the possibility that a powerful earthquake may strike southern California. The film aired on NBC on November 11-12, 1990. ==Plot== The movie opens with a small tremor occurring in the hills outside Los Angeles near a United States Geological Survey (USGS) research post, cutting to a scene of a teenage girl on a date with her boyfriend at the Earthquake Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood. The girl is later revealed to be Heather, daughter of Clare Winslow (Joanna Kerns), a seismologist with the USGS. Clare and her staff, among whom is her assistant Jerry Soloway (Ed Begley, Jr.), have been studying a series of tremors near Los Angeles. With this information, she concludes that there is a better-than- average chance that a massive earthquake will strike along the San Andreas Fault and cause severe damage to Los Angeles, and such an earthquake appears imminent. She conducts an interview with Kevin Conrad (Richard Masur), a sensationalist television reporter who prematurely airs it, creating a political firestorm and causing tension between Clare and her husband Steve (Dan Lauria). Steve works closely with high-powered and wealthy real estate developer Wendell Cates (Robert Ginty) who faces losing money and his socio- political reputation from public fear of the possibility of the earthquake. Wendell threatens Clare and attempts to have her fired from her job. Nevertheless, Clare tries to alert the more skeptical city and state government officials including Chad Spaulding (Joe Spano) of the Office of Emergency Management. Fearing political fallout and possible panic, they decide to ignore her warnings. As this unfolds, Clare's family dynamic is further explored through her strained relationship with teenage daughter Heather (Holly Fields), which is mirrored by the relationship of Clare's mother Anita Parker (Bonnie Bartlett) and Clare's sister Laurie (Lindsay Frost), who are estranged from each other due to Anita's open resentment of Laurie's romantic relationship with LAPD officer Matt (Alan Autry). When tremors are detected along the smaller, lesser-known Newport-Inglewood fault, city officials call a news conference to alert citizens of the threat. For most residents, however, it will already be too late. Not long after preparations and evacuations begin, the long-feared earthquake strikes, causing massive damage and killing thousands; among the victims is Anita, who had been trapped in a high-rise condominium elevator with Laurie during the quake. During the time that they are trapped they reconcile shortly before Laurie is rescued by other survivors, but Anita is less fortunate and dies when the elevator crashes to the bottom of the shaft. Another victim is Miguel, son of Clare's housekeeper Sonia, who is fatally injured during the collapse of his high school gymnasium at his graduation rehearsal. Steve Winslow is thought to be dead after being crushed by a wall at the airport, but he is revealed to have survived the quake at the end of the film. Other deaths include those of Wendell Cates, who is thrown to his death from his skyscraper window, and Chad Spaulding, who is electrocuted while attempting to escape from the USGS safety bunker beneath City Hall. A more redeeming storyline is that of Kevin Conrad, who is transformed from a cut-throat reporter looking for a hot story into a more sensitive and humanitarian character deeply affected by the tragedy and devastation. The remainder of the movie centers on the political and social fallout following the earthquake, and Winslow's attempts to reunite with her family. ==Production Notes/Broadcast History== According to an interview in The Los Angeles Times, the film's theme was inspired by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, based on the idea of someone raising the alarm with no action being taken. Executive producer Frank von Zerneck quoted NBC studio executives as saying “L.A., so what? Our network covers 50 states. The attitude of most of the people in the country is, ‘Good for them. It deserves to fall off into the Pacific. People in California are crazy anyway.’” The film was made over a 3-year period for an estimated $9.2 million. Action scenes were filmed on \\"New York Street\\" at the Universal Studios lot, the same location used in Earthquake. Speaking about the production, actress Joanna Kerns said, “The technical advisers thoroughly scared me. I wound up bolting my house to the foundation. I have all my furniture bolted to the walls. I have earthquake kits everywhere-cars, dressing rooms, homes. Lots of water. Emergency numbers.” ==Reception== The Washington Post wrote, “Bad as it is, \\"The Big One\\" does seem an improvement over the 1974 theatrical release \\"Earthquake,\\" which also fantasized the destruction of L.A. Why do filmmakers keep returning to this topic? Guilt. They feel sheepish about all the money they make from mediocre entertainment and are haunted by the fear that there's biblical-scale retribution in the works.” Michael Hill of The Baltimore Sun praised the special effects and compared it to the poignancy of The Day After. He also described it as “a throwback to TV films of more than a decade ago, \\"The Big One\\" is a well-made mess of a melodrama, hitting every one of its predictable notes with force and clarity, adding the bombastic percussion of nearly-spectacular special effects to an appropriately responsible cautionary message.\\" ==See also== * Dante's Peak * Volcano ==References * Category:1990 television films Category:1990 films Category:1990s disaster films Category:American disaster films Category:American films Category:Disaster television films Category:English-language films Category:Films about earthquakes Category:NBC network original films ","title":"The Great Los Angeles Earthquake"},{"id":"20535399","text":"Bornellidae is a family of sea snails or sea slugs, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Tritonioidea.

The UNCRC aims to protect and promote the rights of all children around the world. It was the first international treaty to integrate all human rights in reference to children, allowing them to participate in family, cultural, and social aspects of life. It emphasizes the right to survival, development, and protection against abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It also addresses issues with education, health care, juvenile justice and the rights of children with disabilities. ==Constitutional requirements== Under the United States Constitution, the ratification of treaties involves several steps. First, the president or his/her representative would negotiate, agree and sign a treaty, which would then be submitted to the U.S. Senate for its \\"advice and consent\\". At that time the President would explain and interpret all provisions in the treaty. If the Senate approves the treaty with a two-thirds majority, it goes back to the President who can ratify it. ==History and status== The United States government contributed to the drafting of the Convention. It commented on nearly all of the articles and proposed the original text of seven of them. Three of these come directly from the United States Constitution and were proposed by the administration of President Ronald Reagan.Nancy E. Walker, Catherine M. Brooks, Lawrence S. Wrightsman, Children's rights in the United States: in search of a national policy (SAGE, 1999), page 40. The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1989 and came into effect on 2 September 1990. On 16 February 1995, Madeleine Albright, at the time the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, signed the Convention. However, though generally supportive of the Convention, President Bill Clinton did not submit it to the Senate. Likewise, President Bush did not submit the Convention to the Senate. President Barack Obama has described the failure to ratify the Convention as 'embarrassing' and promised to review this.Walden University Presidential Youth Debate, October 2008 The Obama administration said that it intended to submit the Convention to the Senate, but failed to do so. As of June 2019, the Trump administration has not submitted the convention for Senate ratification. States may, when ratifying the Convention, ratify subject to reservations or interpretations. Besides other obligations, ratification of the Convention would require the United States to submit reports, outlining its implementation on the domestic level, to the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, a panel of child rights experts from around the world. Parties must report initially two years after acceding to (ratifying) the Convention and then every five years. == Support == Many organizations in the United States support ratification of the Convention, including groups that work with children such as the Girl Scouts and Kiwanis. The Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child argues that criticisms mentioned by opponents of the convention \\"are the result of misconceptions, erroneous information, and a lack of understanding about how international human rights treaties are implemented in the United States\\". The Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a volunteer-driven network that includes attorneys, child and human rights advocates, educators, members of religious and faith-based communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), students and other concerned citizens. They help to promote the ratification of the UNCRC. This campaign began in 2002 and works through a National Steering Committee, campaign meetings, youth advisory council and special events with many different partners involved. Its campaign is guided by its mission statement: \\"Our mission is to bring about ratification and implementation of the CRC in the United States. We will achieve this through mobilizing our diverse network to educate communities on the Convention, thereby creating a groundswell of national support for the treaty, and by advocating directly with our government on behalf of ratification.\\" == Opposition == Opposition to ratification comes from some religious groups. These, along with many political conservatives, claim that the Convention conflicts with the United States Constitution because in the original language of the Constitution \\"treaties\\" referred only to international relations (military alliances, trade, etc.) and not domestic policies. This has apparently played a significant role in the non-ratification of the treaty so far. Senator Jesse Helms, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described it as a \\"bag of worms,\\" an effort to \\"chip away at the U.S. Constitution.\\" Some Americans oppose the CRC with the reasoning that the nation already has in place everything the treaty espouses, and therefore it would make no practical difference. ==Sovereignty and federalism== Legal concerns over ratification have mostly focused on issues of sovereignty and federalism. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that to some significant degree, no government--federal, state, or local--may interfere with the parent-child relationship. Meyer 262 U.S. 390 (1923) The Heritage Foundation sees the conflict as an issue of international control over domestic policy: \\"Although not originally promoted as an entity that would become involved in actively seeking to shape member states' domestic policies, the U.N. has become increasingly intrusive in these arenas.Human Rights and Social Issues at the U.N.: A Guide for U.S. Policymakers They express concern about \\"sovereign jurisdiction, over domestic policymaking\\" and \\"preserving the freedom of American Civil Society\\", and argue that the actual practice of some UN Committees has been to review national policies that are unrelated, or are marginally related to the actual language of the Convention. Convention supporters point out that, under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Convention cannot override the Constitution because no treaty can override the Constitution (Reid v. Covert 354 U.S. 1 (1957)). In addition, as a \\"non-self-executing treaty\\", the convention does not grant any international body enforcement authority over the U.S. and/or its citizens, but merely obligates the U.S. federal government to submit periodic reports on how the provisions of the treaty are being met (or not). The sole enforcement mechanism within the Convention is the issuing of a written report. ==Death penalty and life imprisonment== Article 37 of the Convention prohibits sentencing children under 18 years old to death or life imprisonment with no opportunity for parole. The United States does not comply with this article in its entirety. Three successive Supreme Court decisions have moved toward compliance: *In 2005, 22 U.S. states allowed for the execution of juvenile offenders. This ceased after the 2005 Supreme Court decision Roper v. Simmons, which found juvenile execution unconstitutional as \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". The decision cited the Convention as one of several indications that \\"the United States now stands alone in a world that has turned its face against the juvenile death penalty\\". *The 2010 decision Graham v. Florida prohibited the sentencing of juveniles to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for non-homicide crimes. As of the Graham decision, six U.S. states prohibited such sentences in all cases. *The June 2012 Supreme Court decision Miller v. Alabama held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile murderers. The ruling did not prohibit courts from imposing a considered life sentence. ==Parental rights== Some supporters of homeschooling have expressed concern that the Convention will subvert the authority of parents.Klicka, C.J. \\"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: The Most Dangerous Attack on Parents' Rights In the History of the United States\\", Home School Legal Defense Association. Retrieved 8/19/08. One of the most controversial tenets of the Convention is the participatory rights granted to children.Mason, M.A. (2005) \\"The U.S. and the international children's rights crusade: leader or laggard?\\" Journal of Social History. Summer. The Convention champions youth voice in new ways. Article 12 states: David M. Smolin argues that Article 29 limits the fundamental right of parents and others to educate children in private school by requiring that all such schools support the principles contained in the United Nations Charter and a list of specific values and ideals. He argues that \\"Supreme Court case law has provided that a combination of parental rights and religious liberties provide a broader right of parents and private schools to control the values and curriculum of private education free from State interference. Smolin, otherwise a proponent who urges U.S. reservations to the convention, argues that Article 5, which includes a provision stating that parents \\"provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention\\",Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3 \\"is couched in language which seems to reduce the parental role to that of giving advice\\"., pages 81 & 90 The Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child argues that the Convention protects parental responsibility from government interference.Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC FAQs - Myths and Facts The Campaign for the U.S. Ratification of the CRC provides information rebutting this and other proposed conflicts. The CRC does not outline any specific interference with school curriculums, nor would ratification prevent parents from homeschooling their children. In addition, it recognizes the family \\"as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children ...\\" (Preamble to the CRC) and repeatedly underscores the pivotal role parents play in their children's lives. (Particularly with regard to Articles 3, 5, 7-10, 14, 18, 22, and 27.1) Under the Convention, parental responsibility is protected from government interference. Article 5 states that Governments should respect the rights, responsibilities, and duties of parents to raise their children. There is no language in the CRC that dictates the manner in which parents are to raise and instruct their children. Geraldine Van Bueren, the author of the principal textbook on the international rights of the child, and a participant in the drafting of the Convention, has described the \\"best interest of the child standard\\" in the treaty as \\"provid[ing] decision and policy makers with the authority to substitute their own decisions for either the child's or the parents' \\"; ===Issues within parental rights=== #The treaty addresses parental discipline and discipline in schools. There is a concern that it will eliminate parents' right to discipline. The UNCRC does not specify what discipline can be used but enforces parents to provide guidance and direction to children instead of punishment. Educational discipline is addressed by eliminating mental or physical abuse and violence. Dress codes and singing the national anthem are not addressed and left to the school officials and governments to determine if either should be protected. #The age of children and their ability to understand the UNCRC and the rights they get are an issue as well. Parents' decisions on how they address the UNCRC will help the development of children. Parental guidance should help children evolve and teach them to respect their own and others rights. #Another concern is whether or not the UNCRC will give the children more rights than parents. Parents still have control over their children; for example, they can expect children to help around the house. The Convention only prohibits work that is harmful to their health or interferes with education. This concern, however, seems to show a lack of awareness that children are more vulnerable than their adult parents and thus require special protection. ==Other arguments== David Smolin argues that the objections from religious and political conservatives stem from their view that the U.N. is an elitist institution, which they do not trust to properly handle sensitive decisions regarding family issues. He suggests that legitimate concerns of critics could be met with appropriate reservations by the U.S., page 110 ==References== Category:Children's rights in the United States Category:History of the foreign relations of the United States Category:Convention on the Rights of the Child ","title":"U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child"},{"id":"20535439","text":"Neil Gilbert Siegel (born February 19, 1954) is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and engineer, known for his development of many key systems for the United States military, including the Blue-Force Tracking system, the U.S. Army's first unmanned air vehicle system, and the US Army forward-area air defense system.https://neilsiegel.usc.edu/intellectual- property/systems-and-inventions/ Several of his inventions also found their way into consumer products, such as hand-held devices (e.g., mobile GPS devices, smartphones, etc.) whose map displays automatically orient themselves to align with the real-world's cardinal points. == Early life and work == Siegel was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Bernard Siegel and Judith Love Cohen, and has lived most of his life in the area southwest of Los Angeles. He has two siblings, Howard and Rachel, and is an older half-brother of actor Jack Black.https://neilsiegel.usc.edu/appreciations-and-photos/ He attended the University of Southern California, earning degrees in Mathematics. During and after this time, he worked as a professional musician, mostly performing folk and classical music from the Balkans and the Middle East. Later, he earned a PhD in systems engineering (also from USC), where his PhD advisor was noted computer scientist Barry Boehm. In 1976, he began work at what was then TRW (acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002). == Career == Starting in 1993, he led an organization at TRW that developed one-of-a-kind automation systems for the US military and (to a lesser extent) commercial companies. This organization achieved significant business success, growing rapidly every year during his tenure as leader (which continued until 2001). They created many new products whose general theme was automation support to decision-makers who operate in complex and stressful environments. In addition to the US Army and the US Air Force, customers during this time included the US steel industry and the movie industry. In 1993, his team fielded the US Army's first fully automated command-and-control system, the Forward-Area Air Defense C2 System. This system is still in use today. In 1995, his team won the contract to develop the US Army's first \\"digital battlefield\\" system, called Force-XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (generally known by the acronym FBCB2). This has resulted in a highly regarded capability for the US, now used by the Marine Corps, as well as the Army. Also in 1995, his team delivered the US Army's first automated command post, which has been followed by a long series of related capabilities to the present time. In 1997, he was given responsibility for \\"fixing\\" the Hunter UAV program, the US Army's first unmanned air vehicle. The program had suffered a series of crashes during testing, and was nominally \\"cancelled\\". During his tenure, the program became one of the US' most reliable unmanned air vehicles, and is still in service. The Hunter entered operational service in 1999 in the Balkans. His personal science and engineering contributions have centered on techniques for ultra- low bandwidth intra-network routing and achieving acceptable dynamics through what he calls \\"force-structure-aware\\" networks. He has been a pioneer in large-scale deployments of GPS-enabled applicationsUS patent 7,256,731 2004]US patent 5,672,840 (like the Blue-Force Tracking system). He has also been active in the field of structuring large-scale software developments so as to match the skill distribution encountered in real-world teams. Since mid-2001, he has been the chief technology officer of TRW's Systems (now Northrop Grumman Mission Systems). His work during this time has extended his earlier work in military networks, force-structure-aware networks, and large-scale system engineering methodologies. He retired at the end of 2015. As of 2016, Siegel became the IBM Professor of Engineering Management at USC,;http://neilsiegel.usc.edu he is also an Adjunct Professor of Engineering at UCLA.. Additionally, Siegel also teaches undergraduate engineering classes. === Awards and honors === Siegel has received a number of awards and honors, including: * Election to the US National Academy of Engineering in 2005. * Selection as an IEEE Fellow (2011). * The IEEE Simon Ramo Medal (2011), for systems engineering and systems science. * Member, National Academy of Inventors, 2017. * US Army Honorable Order of Saint Barbara, 1996 * iCMG award for system architecture * Northern Virginia Technology Council—CTO of the year award == Consumer Electronics == Siegel has had a major impact on the design and capabilities of many types of mobile consumer electronics, including smart phones, GPS receivers, and so forth.

At the time of George's birth he ran Sutton Seeds Indian Branch in Calcutta. His older brother Kenneth Hubert was born in Reading on 15 September 1919. ==Education== From 1928 aged four, Pinker was educated at Reading School. In 1942, he began medical training at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, Paddington, London, qualifying as a doctor in 1947. As a student in 1946, when the Music Society put on its first post-war production The Mikado, he sang one of the leading roles. He turned down a contract with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to pursue a career in medicine. Queen Elizabeth attended the performance as patron of both the hospital and the medical school, accompanied by the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret. ==Professional career== Deciding to specialize in obstetrics, he served his National Service as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Singapore, where he did much of his specialist training under Benjamin Henry Sheares at the British Military Hospital, Singapore. Returning to civilian life at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, in 1958 he was appointed a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology to St. Mary's Hospital and Samaritan Hospital for Women, both of which he served for the next 31 years. He later also held the position of Consulting Gynaecological Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital; Soho Hospital for Women; Bolingbroke Hospital, Battersea; and the Radcliffe Infirmary from 1969-1980. Pinker accepted an increasing involvement with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, serving as Honorary Treasurer, 1970-77. He was a past president of the British Fertility Society and supported the research that led to the birth in 1978 of Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby. His work at the Royal College earned him international respect amongst obstetricians and gynaecologists. In 1980 he was elected Vice- President and finally President in 1987. ==Wellbeing of Women== In 1964 he and several distinguished colleagues founded the Childbirth Research Centre. Changing its name to Birthright in 1972, it is now Wellbeing of Women. Diana, Princess of Wales, whose two sons had been delivered by Pinker, became a patron in 1984. On 12 October 2011, the Right Reverened Vincent Nichols gave the first annual Sir George Pinker Memorial Address. ==Surgeon and gynecologist to the Queen== In 1973 he succeeded Sir John Peel as surgeon gynaecologist to Queen Elizabeth II. The youngest person to be appointed to the post, he delivered nine royal babies: Earl of Ulster; Lady Rose Windsor; Lady Davina Windsor; Lord Frederick Windsor; Lady Gabriella Windsor; Peter Phillips; Zara Phillips; Prince William; and Prince Harry. All of these births took place at St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, a significant break with royal tradition as all prior royal births had taken place at a royal residence. In 1990, he was replaced by Marcus Setchell CVO. ==Honours== Pinker was appointed a CVO in 1983, and a KCVO in 1990. In the same year he authored the book 'Preparing for Pregnancy'. In 1991 he edited 'Clinical Gynecological Oncology'. He also contributed to several books - Diseases of Women by Ten Teachers (1964), Obstetrics by Ten Teachers (1964), A Short Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1967). ==Personal life== Pinker married former nurse Dorothy Emma Russell in London on 31 March 1951. The couple had four children: Catherine & Ian (twins), Robert and William. His wife died in 2003. Pinker enjoyed all music, but particularly opera. He became assistant concert director of Reading Symphony Orchestra, and then in 1988 vice-president of the London Choral Society. He was a keen skier, sailor, gardener and hill-walker. ==Death and memorial service== In his last years he was disabled by Parkinson's disease and partial blindness. Pinker died in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on 29 April 2007. A Memorial Service was held in October 2007 St Marylebone Church, London, attended by the Duchess of Gloucester and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. In August 2008 it was reported that he left nearly £1.5million in his will to his four children. == References == Category:Medical doctors from Kolkata Category:1924 births Category:2007 deaths Category:British gynaecologists Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Category:People educated at Reading School Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:Alumni of St Mary's Hospital Medical School Category:Presidents of the Royal Society of Medicine ","title":"George Pinker"},{"id":"20535496","text":"\\"Missin' You: It Will Break My Heart\\" is the 14th overall single released by singer Ken Hirai.

He was a 'conciliator', who hoped to reunite the disparate parts of the party, and in that capacity was co-opted to the Central Committee in 1910, but arrested almost immediately afterwards. After the February revolution, he was elected chairman of the Saratov Soviet. In August 1917, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b), and was based in St Petersburg as one of the most active Bolsheviks leaders for the next three months. One week before the Bolshevik revolution, on 29 October, when Lenin emerged from hiding to urge the Central Committee to ready itself to seize power immediately, Milyutin was the first speaker to oppose him, arguing that power should be - and was being - transferred to the soviets, and not exclusively to the Bolsheviks, and that \\"we (the Bolsheviks) are not ready to strike the first blow; we are unable to depose and arrest the authorities in the immediate future.\\" But he accepted the majority decision, and played a central role in the Bolshevik coup, in charge of food supplies. On 7 November, he was named People's Commissar for Agriculture in the original Bolshevik government, but he resigned ten days later, along with Lev Kamenev and three others, who called for the Bolsheviks to form a coalition government with the other socialist parties represented in the soviets. They withdrew their resignations on 12 December, and on 15 December, Kamenev and Milyutin were elected to the steering committee of the Bolshevik faction in the Constituent Assembly. Nine days later, the entire steering committee (which included Josif Stalin) was sacked for being too conciliatory towards the other socialist parties. == Later career == After his reinstatement, Milyutin never intentionally deviated from the party line again. He advocated ending workers' control of factories, which had sprung up spontaneously during the revolution, because it disrupted production. He also opposed Leon Trotsky over the issue of importance of economic planning, which Milyutin disparaged to the extent that Lenin publicly accused him, in an article published in Pravda in February 1921 of writing \\"twaddle\\" and exhibiting \\"highbrow disdain\\" for practical achievements. He inadvertently offended Lenin again, in autumn 1922, by proposing an end to the state monopoly on foreign trade, arguing that private cross-border commerce would boost the soviet economy, and reduce smuggling. Appointed director of the Central Statistical Administration in 1928, he loyally supported Stalin during the drive to force the peasants to move onto collective farms, and - despite his previous opposition to economic planning - he became an enthusiastic supporter for the first Five Year Plan, \\"adept at the timely expression of opinions held at the highest level in the party.\\" == Arrest and execution == Milyutin was arrested on 26 July 1937, and sentenced to death on 29 October 1937. Before his execution, as was customary, he was photographed for the archives of the NKVD. That last photograph was published by David King in his book Ordinary Citizens.

Founded in the early 1990s, the chorus once boasted over 110 members hailing from 5 different states: Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. They are a chapter of Sweet Adelines International, the world's largest women's singing organization. ==History== The Pride of Baltimore chorus (\\"POB\\") was chartered to provide a forum for women from all walks of life who wished to sing and perform at the highest possible level. A focus on outstanding singing, above all else, has been a hallmark of the chorus since its inception. POB competed in their first regional competition in the Spring of 1994 with only twenty women on stage. By 1996 they had 38 singers and placed third in their Regional competition. They also took first place in the first ever Sweet Adelines International Small Chorus Festival, held in St. Louis, Missouri. From this victory, they returned to Regional competition in the spring of 1997 with 47 singers, moving up to second place. In the spring of 1998, POB won their first Regional competition, with 55 women on stage. This qualified them for their first international contest, held in Atlanta, Georgia in the fall of 1999. Their goal in Atlanta was to win a spot among the top ten choruses in the world. With 68 women on stage, they succeeded in meeting their goal. They were the smallest chorus in the top ten and exceeded everyone's expectations by winning sixth place. After again winning Regionals in 2000, they traveled to Portland, Oregon in October 2001 for their second international chorus contest. Hoping to break into the top five, they placed third, winning a bronze medal in the contest with 77 women on stage. Their third International contest came in the fall of 2003, in Phoenix, Arizona. With 99 women on stage, they upset the 3-time international champion The Rich-Tone Chorus to take a silver medal. Their next international competition was in Detroit, Michigan in the fall of 2005, where they repeated as silver medalists and placed first in the semifinal round with 115 women on stage. After the Detroit International, the chorus's Master Director Janet Ashford was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and needed to undergo treatment as soon as possible. This meant that the chorus would be without a director for an unspecified period of time. As the 2007 contest drew near, it became apparent that Ashford would be unable to travel to the International contest in Calgary, Alberta, and another director would need to fill the rather large shoes she left. Jim Arns, director of the four-time international champion Melodeers Chorus willingly stepped in and took 109 women to the Calgary contest. There they won a silver medal, their third silver medal in international competition. Though Ashford won some battles against her illness, the cancer returned and she died on 9 January 2009. This was a difficult time for the chorus but they pulled together, determined to continue Janet Ashford's legacy. The chorus began a search for a new director in April 2009. In July 2009, the Pride of Baltimore announced that its new director was Joe Cerutti, who also directs the Alexandria Harmonizers chorus of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Under his tutelage, the chorus continued to compete at the international level, placing 12th in 2011, 16th in 2013, and 12th in 2015. Cerutti stepped down in 2017, and the chorus selected Lynda Keever as their new music director. Keever stepped down in 2018 and was replaced by current director, Tyler Horton. ==Current activities== The Pride of Baltimore Chorus is now performing in shows and recently returned to the competition stage, competing in the Sweet Adelines International Competition in Houston, Texas on October 20, 2011, placing 12th. This was the first time in chapter history the chorus did not qualify for the chorus finals round at an international competition. On November 6, 2013, the chorus competed in the Sweet Adelines International chorus semifinals once again, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and placed 16th. On October 8, 2015, the chorus once again competed in the Sweet Adelines International chorus semifinals, in Las Vegas, NV and placed 12th. The chorus performs throughout the mid-Atlantic region, presenting a variety of music: Broadway show tunes, classical ballads, and contemporary, popular songs — all arranged in the \\"barbershop style.\\" The chorus rehearses on Monday nights in the Parkville area of Baltimore County, Maryland. ==Bibliography== * \\"The Pitch Pipe,\\" Sweet Adelines International, 2000–2009 * \\"The Sound Source,\\" Pride of Baltimore Chorus, 1993–2009 ==References== Category:A cappella musical groups Category:American choirs Category:American vocal groups Category:Sweet Adelines International Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Women's musical groups Category:Musical groups from Baltimore ","title":"Pride of Baltimore Chorus"},{"id":"20535634","text":"Thor Island is one of the Canadian arctic islands in Nunavut, Canada.

The Kinney estate dates back to 1884, when Francis Kinney, a pioneer in the tobacco industry, built a huge \\"summer cottage\\" here. His son, Morris Kinney, for whom the borough of Kinnelon was named 41 years later, lived most of his life on the estate. The community encompasses more than 900 unique homes located on in addition to Lake Kinnelon.Cheslow, Jerry. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Kinnelon, N.J.; Residential Life Amid Natural Beauty\\", The New York Times, June 1, 2003. Accessed August 21, 2012. \\"Ms. Dunner Parker knew the area through a brother who lived in Kinnelon's Smoke Rise section, a 3,500-acre, 900-home gated community that describes itself in its promotional literature as 'one of America's most prestigious club communities' and 'elite, yet affordable.' Covering the borough's northwestern quadrant, Smoke Rise's lots are heavily wooded and range in area from 1 to 10 acres, with the most valuable properties fronting on the 19-acre Lake Kinnelon.\\" Located in the north woods of New Jersey, the gated lakeside community provides 24-hour security, activities, clubs and special events grounded in a tradition of community spirit and service. The community was conceived and based on a dual philosophy that no two homes would look alike with a minimum size of 2,500 square feet located on a one and a half acre wooded lot.http://www.smokerise- nj.com/smokeriseclub/sub_category_list.asp?category=57&title;=FAQs The community only has two entrances: one from Route 23 south (North Gate entrance) and the other from Kinnelon Road (East Gate entrance). ==History== Smoke Rise East Gate Entrance When Morris Kinney died in 1945, he left the estate to John Talbot, Sr. a longtime friend, former mayor of the borough, and a founder of the Chilton Memorial Hospital, Pompton Plains (John Talbot, Sr. was a real estate developer in New York City and a patron of the arts and was credited with the revival of ballet as a major art form in the United States in the 1930s), as a tribute to their lifetime friendship and mutually shared love of Smoke Rise. In 1946, when the need for suburban housing became evident, John Talbot, Sr., founded The Smoke Rise Club, one of the earliest community club plans in the United States. Unlike so many developers, he insisted that the land be kept in its natural state as far as possible. When friends asked to purchase land on the estate to build homes, Talbot decided to develop a planned community designed primarily to serve New York corporation executives. The Smoke Rise Club was the result in November 1946. The name (Smoke Rise) is a translation of the Pequannock Indian name for the mountainous area, where a heavy mist often rises at sunset. The private family friendly community is located entirely in Kinnelon, whose name comes from Francis S. Kinney, who purchased of land in the 1880s for an estate that included Lake Kinnelon and the surrounding mountainous area. Smoke Rise is administered by residents elected to the Board of Governors of the Smoke Rise Club, which must approve all residents' building plans. Inside the community, which can be entered only through two gates (North Gate & East Gate), there are over of roadway and approximately 900 houses on . The neighborhood is also home to Smoke Rise Lake, and Kitty Ann Mountain, the highest point in Kinnelon. On an island in the lake is St. Hubert's Chapel, built by Mr. Kinney in 1886 and named after his favorite patron saint of the hunt. It was built in the style of an 8th-century stone chapel in tribute to the saint who lived in the 7th and 8th centuries. Kinney later commissioned Louis C Tiffany to expand and enhance the chapel including a (now priceless) Celtic cross stained glass window and a Tiffany-signed mosaic floor among other things. The Chapel is owned by the Smoke Rise Club who can be contacted for more information including tours. Kitty Ann mountain offers views of northern New Jersey and the distant New York City skyline at an elevation of 1,140 feet (350 m) from the Smoke Rise Tower. The neighborhood also includes one church, the Community Church of Smoke Rise, the Smoke Rise Village Inn, and recreation facilities. It is home to the Kinnelon Volunteer Fire Company - Company 3 Fire House. The Village Inn and the Community Church are open to members and non-members of the community. ==Location== Smoke Rise residents also enjoy the close proximity to New York City. Nearby highways include Interstate 287, Route 23, and Route 208\\\\. The population consists of a vast variety of professional, entrepreneurs and executives. There are two entrances to the community.

He then went abroad on a Fulbright fellowship and studied conducting, composition, and piano at the Stuttgart Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Germany. Kapp started his musical career as a vocal coach at the Basel Stadttheater, Switzerland. He then moved back in the United States and served as music director of the Opera Theater of the Manhattan School of Music in New York from 1963 to 1965. While in New York City he earned a law degree from the New York University in 1966. He also studied conducting, piano and harpsichord. In 1968 Richard Kapp founded the chamber orchestra Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York. He served as their musical director for the rest of his life. Among other notable concerts the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York gave the inaugural concert at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase in 1977. The Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York performed and recorded until 2004 when concerts were suspended when Kapp became ill. With the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York Kapp released a series of classical \\"greatest hits\\" records. This included the 1977 album \\"Greatest Hits of 1720\\" on CBS Masterworks. These albums were collections of shorter more accessible repertoire that were designed to have popular appeal.

From the outset it left the management and running of its railways to the Palatine Ludwigsbahn. Because the Ludwigsbahn company and the Palatine Maximilian Railway had already built their railway networks in central and southern Palatinate, the Palatine Northern Railway was only left with the region north of the line Ludwigshafen–Kaiserslautern–Homburg for its area of operations. It began working on 22 September 1868 with the opening of the 29 km long Landstuhl–Kusel railway: Landstuhl–Glan-Münchweiler–Altenglan–Kusel. On 1 January 1870 as it agreed to merge with the other two Palatine railway organisations into the managerial and operating company of the United Palatine Railways, it also took over the entire shareholding of the Neustadt–Dürkheim Railway Company, whose railway line, opened in 1865, had been run by the Palatine Ludwigsbahn to that point in time. The construction of the most important northern railway lines was then started: *The Alsenz Valley Railway—Hochspeyer–Enkenbach–Langmeil–Winnweiler–Bad Münster (49 km)—ran on 29 October 1870 to Winnweiler and was completed on 16 May 1871. From Alsenz station a narrow gauge line branched off to Obermoschel (opened on 1 October 1903). *The Zeller Valley Railway (opened 23 October 1872) ran from Marnheim to what became the Donnersbergbahn and enabled a link via Harxheim- to the Rhine-Hessian hub at Monsheim. *The Palatine Northern Railway from Neustadt an der Weinstraße, Dürkheim ran via Freinsheim–Grünstadt–Bockenheim–Kindenheim to Monsheim (22 km) along the present-day \\"wine road\\" (Weinstraße). On 15 October 1877 a cross-link from Freinsheim to Frankenthal (14 km) was added. *The Donnersberg Railway—Langmeil–Marnheim–Kirchheimbolanden–Alzey (35 km)—appeared in 1873/74 and included the Kaiserslautern–Eselsfürth–Enkenbach section (13 km), which joined it on 15 May 1875. *The Eis Valley Railway (opened 24 June 1876) ran from Grünstadt via Ebertsheim station to Eisenberg (9 km) with a branch from Ebertsheim Hp–Hettenleidelheim (4 km) opened in 1895. *The Lauter Valley Railway (taken into service 15 November 1883)—Kaiserslautern–Wolfstein–Lauterecken-Grumbach (35 km)—was extended in 1896/97 in the Glan valley by 21 km from Meisenheim to Odernheim–Staudernheim and on 1 May 1904 on the right bank of the Nahe river from Odernheim to Bad Münster am Stein (16 km). *On 15 September 1900 Grünstadt station became the departure point for a link to Weiler Neuoffstein on the Worms-Offstein railway run by the South German Railway Company (7 km) and on 1 March 1903 for the Leiningen Valley Railway to Altleiningen (11 km). *Finally on 1 May 1904 the opening of the Homburg–Glan-Münchweiler (22 km) and Altenglan–Offenbach- Hundheim–Lauterecken-Grumbach (20 km) sections of the Glan Valley Railway enabled through trains to run between Mainz and Saarbrücken, something which was also desirable for military reasons.

The town is a coastal resort area. Located about south of Portland, Scarborough is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The population was 18,919 at the 2010 census. ==History== In about 1630, John V. Stratton opened a trading post on Stratton Island in Saco Bay off Scarborough's shore. In 1631, the Plymouth Council for New England granted the \\"Black Point Patent\\" to Captain Thomas Cammock, nephew of the Earl of Warwick. Cammock built a house and began residence in 1635 on the tract of land, which extended from the Spurwink River to Black Point - today this area is known as Prouts Neck. However, he then sold his holdings and moved to the West Indies. Nevertheless, settlements developed at Black Point, Blue Point (i.e., Pine Point), Dunstan (i.e., West Scarborough) and Stratton Island. By 1650, there were fifty homes. The town offered excellent fishing and farming. On July 14, 1658, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated them all as Scarborough, named for Scarborough in Yorkshire, England. At the outbreak of King Philip's War in 1675, Scarborough was an important coastal settlement with over one hundred houses and one thousand head of cattle. By 1676, the town had been laid to waste as a result of the war - some settlers were killed and others were taken hostage by the Native Americans. Subsequently, Massachusetts sent soldiers accompanied by Indian allies in 1677 to secure the town for resettlement. On June 29, 1677, while pursuing some Indians sent as a ruse, the company was ambushed by warriors under Chief Squando. In the New England militia of nearly one hundred soldiers, fifty to sixty were left dead or mortally wounded. Among the casualties was Captain Benjamin Swett. Called the Battle at Moore's Brook. In 1681, a great fort was erected at Black Point. After several attempts to rebuild between guerrilla incursions during King William's War, the survivors evacuated in 1690 and moved south to Portsmouth, New Hampshire or Boston. A truce was signed in 1699 between the Province of Massachusetts Bay and the Eastern Indians. Resettlement of Scarborough started in 1702 when seven settlers arrived from Lynn, Massachusetts, and construction began on a fort located on the western shore of Prout's Neck's Garrison's Cove. This fort was commanded by Captain John Larrabee. Despite the treaty, in August 1703, five hundred French and Indians under command of the Sieur de Beaubassin made a sudden descent upon English settlements from Casco Bay (Portland) to Wells. The fort on Prout's Neck sat atop a bluff. When the French and Native Americans arrived, they were protected from gunfire by the overhanging cliff. They subsequently began tunneling into the bluff to breach the fort from below. Had it not been for a two-day downpour that made the disturbed bank slough, exposing the previously hidden excavators to snipers in the fort, the French and Native Americans might have been successful in their attempts to capture the fort and the eight people inside. However, Beaubassin retreated in search of easier prey. Despite occasional subsequent harassment, the second settlement succeeded. By 1749, it was economically prosperous. Cattle and timber were important local products for export, with Scarborough's many water power sites operating a dozen sawmills. ==Geography== Scarborough from the air, looking to the southeast (December 2015).

The body is elongate with a foot which is distinct from the upper body by a skirt like mantle partially hiding the foot. The branched gills and the rhinophores are orange to yellow and can be withdrawn into pockets under the skin in case of danger.Rudman, W.B., 1999 (March 25) Rhinophore in nudibranchs. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. The main background colour is bluish, the intensity of the latter varying from blue-grey to intense blue. The blue dorsal side has a median black line which may be broken in some individuals and usually some short, finer parallel lines. These longitudinal lines are also present on the foot. The longitudinal discontinuous lines are distinctive of this species and allow the observer to differentiate it from other close species like Chromodoris lochi, Chromodoris willani and Chromodoris annae.Rudman, W.B. 1982.

They married in 1953, with Robert being 21 and Etterlene going on 18. They stayed together for 21 years before divorcing in 1974. The children claimed that their father sexually abused several of them, which the father denied. Robert and Etterlene have 10 children: * Etterlene \\"Bunny\\" DeBarge (b. 1955) * Robert Louis \\"Bobby\\" DeBarge, Jr. (1956–1995) * Thomas Keith \\"Tommy\\" DeBarge (b. 1957) * William Randall \\"Randy\\" DeBarge (b. 1958) * Mark \\"Marty\\" DeBarge (b. 1959) * Eldra Patrick \\"El\\" DeBarge (b. 1961) * James DeBarge (b. 1963) * Jonathan Arthur \\"Chico\\" DeBarge (b. 1966) * Carol \\"Peaches\\" DeBarge (b. 1970) * Darrell \\"Young\\" DeBarge (b. 1970) ==Recording artists and groups within the familyEtterlene DeBarge (Mama)=== She has recorded major label releases, Etterlene has recorded gospel material mostly with members of her family with her own independent gospel releases. She is known by the name, \\"Mama DeBarge\\" or \\"Mama D\\" for short. ===Switch (Bobby and Tommy)=== Brothers Bobby and Tommy rose to fame in the late 1970s as members of the R & B group Switch, which recorded exclusively for the Motown label. Earlier, Bobby had joined a group as background members for Barry White called White Heat. Tommy was included in Bobby's new band Switch and the group would have success in 1978 with the top ten R&B; single, \\"There'll Never Be\\". The group's first two albums became million-selling successes and the band's success would influence a generation of self-contained R&B; bands such as Tony! Toni! Toné! and Mint Condition. ===Bobby DeBarge=== In 1981 Bobby and his brother Tommy left Switch, and started to mentor their younger siblings in the group DeBarge. Though he remained a collaborator with his brothers and sister, Bobby struggled with personal problems that ended his career. In 1988, he and Chico were convicted of drug trafficking charges in Michigan. After serving six years, DeBarge discovered he had AIDS and tried recording an album - It's Not Over, his only solo project, was released in 1996 following DeBarge's death from AIDS in 1995 at the age of 39. ===DeBarge (Bunny, Randy, Mark, El and James)=== Forming in 1979 as The DeBarges, the band originally included four members - Bunny, Randy, Mark and El - moved to Los Angeles and signed with Motown where they went under a two-year training process by Motown's staff before releasing their first album in 1981. With the inclusion of 18-year-old James in early 1982, the group changed their name to DeBarge and released their first million-selling album, All This Love, later that year. From 1982 to 1985, DeBarge released three gold-certified albums and released more than ten hit singles. After disbanding shortly in 1986, a reinvented version of the group now featuring Bobby DeBarge and excluding El and Bunny, released a record in 1988 before disbanding the following year due to Bobby's conviction of drug offenses. ===El DeBarge=== After leaving DeBarge for a solo career in 1986, El DeBarge had modest success as a solo artist peaking with the hit \\"Who's Johnny\\" and finding fame as a featured vocalist on several hip-hop and quiet storm-leaning R&B; productions including most prominently \\"Secret Garden\\" with Quincy Jones and his cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"After the Dance\\" with Fourplay. DeBarge's career was halted in the mid-1990s by personal problems which later resulted in arrests. This period culminated in 2008 with a conviction on crack cocaine charges after DeBarge violated his probation on a previous drug conviction, resulting in two arrest warrants. DeBarge was released from incarceration in October 2009, declaring himself both clean and a born-again Christian. He has since returned to his music career and released his first studio album since 1994, Second Chance, on November 30, 2010. ===Bunny DeBarge=== In 1986, Motown released Bunny's only solo project, In Love, which flopped due to Motown's failure to promote despite the best efforts of her first and only single, \\"Save The Best For Me\\". Most known for writing the hits \\"I Like It\\" and \\"A Dream\\" She now records independently as a gospel artist. She, Randy, James and Bunny's daughter appeared on an episode of Lifechangers to talk about their drug problems. ===James DeBarge=== Though he hasn't had any solo success since DeBarge's breakup, James is most notable for his personal relationship and short marriage to R&B; and pop singer Janet Jackson during the early 1980s. James and Jackson annulled their marriage in 1985 because of James' drug problems and disapproval from Jackson's parents Joseph and Katherine. In 2001, James recorded a song with Won-G Bruny and Traci Bingham called Nothing's Wrong, The music video didn't feature Traci but James has lip-synced both parts of the chorus, his and Traci's. ===Chico DeBarge=== Chico was 18 when he released his first album in 1985. The first single, \\"Talk to Me\\", became a top forty smash for Chico. Branded as the \\"new star\\" of the DeBarge family, his career was interrupted by an arrest on drug trafficking charges with his brother Bobby in 1988. After a six-year prison term, Chico DeBarge was released and returned to music pioneering a new sound in R&B; music titled Neo Classic Soul under the UMG label Kedar Ent. in 1997 recording the hit album, 1997's Long Time No See reemerging in the neo soul scene of the late 1990s., Chico is the only solo DeBarge in the family to date to have achieved certified Gold album status. In 2009, he detailed his drug addiction on his release, Addiction. Since the release of \\"Addiction\\" Chico DeBarge has been sober and touring while recording a new CD. ===Kristinia DeBarge=== James' daughter Kristinia was 19 when Island Records / Sodapop released her debut album, Exposed, in July 2009. ==References== Category:African-American families Category:American families of French ancestry * ","title":"DeBarge family"},{"id":"20535933","text":"Pliny T. Merrick (August 2, 1794 – January 31, 1867) was an American attorney and politician from Massachusetts. He served as an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. ==Early life== Merrick was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, the son of Honorable Pliny Merrick and Ruth (Cutler) Merrick.[Merrick, George B. Genealogy of the Merrick-Mirick-Myrick Family 1636 - 1902, Tracy, Gibbs & Company, Madison, Wis.1902. pg 301.] He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1814, and was admitted to the Worcester bar in 1817. He began the practice of law in Worcester, before moving to Charlton, Swansea and Taunton to practice law. In June, 1824, he returned to Worcester and served as Worcester County's district attorney from 1824-1843. In 1826, Merrick was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory ==Judicial career== In 1844 he was Judge of the Municipal Court, and in 1843 he was named a judge of the Massachusetts Courts of Common Pleas. He resigned this appointment in 1848, and was reappointed in 1851. From 1849-1850, he was senior defense counsel (co-counsel with Edward Dexter Sohier) in the trial of Harvard University Professor John White Webster, accused of murdering Harvard patron Dr. George Parkman. The prosecutors for the trial were John H. Clifford, then Massachusetts Attorney-General and the prosecutor of all capital murder cases, and George Bemis, Esq, and independent attorney. In 1853, Merrick was promoted to the bench of the Supreme Judicial Court by the same John H. Clifford, now Governor of Massachusetts. Merrick received the degree of LL.D. from Harvard in 1853. He served on the bench of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court until 1864. He was a representative of Worcester County in both branches of the state legislature. He was an Overseer of Harvard University from 1852-1856. He also served for two years as president of the Worcester and Nashua Railroad. In 1855 Merrick moved to Boston and lived there until his death in 1867. ==John White Webster Trial== From 1849-1850 Merrick was senior defense counsel in the Parkman-Webster murder case. The gruesome murder drew national attention and although Merrick lost the case, he received much notoriety for the case. The Boston Globe reported Merrick's response, that upon the verdict, \\"In a moment or two, his senior counsel, Judge Merrick, to the dock, and addressed a few words to the prisoner, to which, so far as we could judge, he replied.— Judge Merrick was deeply affected, and so agitated that he could hardly stand.\\"[The Trial of Prof. John W. Webster Indicted for the Murder of Dr. George Parkman, Reported for the Boston Journal, Redding & Company, Boston, MA 1850, pg.55.] ==Anti-Masonic Movement== Merrick was an active promoter of the Anti-Masonic Party. The party developed in the early nineteenth century, opposing political leaders who were members of secretive Masonic brotherhoods. Masonic members held political views on the role of the government and how the country should expand. The Anti-Masonic Party opposed those views as moving away from the original founding fathers intent. Merrick renounced Free Masonry in 1832.[Merrick, Pliny T. Renunciation of Free Masonry, Worcester, MA 1871.] The party was the precursor to the Whig Party.[Holt, Michael F. \\"The Antimasonic and Know Nothing Parties,\\" in History of U.S. Political Parties, ed. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (1999), p. 231.] ==Death== Merrick died of paralysis in Boston on January 31, 1867, in his 73rd year. His obituary in the New York Times (2/4/1867) stated: \\"In 1864 an attack of paralysis obliged him to resign his seat on the Bench. His mind, however, had remained unclouded until a second and fatal attack...\\"[Obituary, New York Times, February 4, 1867.] He bequeathed a fund for the establishment of schools of high grade in Worcester. ==Family life== On May 23, 1827, Merrick married Rebecca Thomas, daughter of Isaiah Thomas, Jr. of Worcester; she died June 17, 1859.

The population was 20,798 in the 2010 census, making it the seventh largest municipality in the state. Situated on the Mousam River, Sanford includes the village of Springvale. The city features many lakes in wooded areas which attract campers. Sanford is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. On November 6, 2012, Sanford voters approved a new charter to re-incorporate Sanford as a city and replace the town meeting format with a city council/mayor/strong manager form of government, along with other changes. The new charter took effect on January 1, 2013. Sanford's new charter provides that the first mayor would be appointed from the ranks of Sanford's seven city councilors and serve interim for one-year period. On January 8, 2013, Maura A. Herlihy was appointed as Sanford's first mayor. In 2014, an elected-at-large mayor took office. On November 5, 2013, Thomas Cote was elected as mayor.http://www.pressherald.com/news/Sanford_voters_chose_Cote_as_city_s_first_popularly_elected_mayor_.html Beginning in 2016, the mayoral position began being elected at-large every two years during legislative election cycles. ==History== Sanford is in the western portion of a tract of land purchased in 1661 from Abenaki Chief Fluellin by Major William Phillips, an owner of mills in Saco. First called Phillipstown, it was willed in 1696 by Mrs. Phillips to her former husband's son, Peleg Sanford.Edwin Emery, William Morrell Emery, The History of Sanford, Maine 1661-1900, \\"Colonial Settlement\\" 1901 Settlement was delayed, however, by hostilities during the French and Indian Wars. In 1724, Norridgewock, a Native stronghold on the Kennebec River, was destroyed by a Massachusetts militia. Subsequently, the region became less dangerous, and Sanford was first settled in 1739. Incorporated a town in 1768, it was named after Peleg Sanford. Until 1794, Alfred was the town's North Parish. The Mousam River provided water power for industry. In 1745, Capt. Market Morrison built a sawmill above Springvale. Following the Civil War, Sanford developed into a textile manufacturing center, connected to markets by the Portland and Rochester Railroad. Factories were built at both Springvale and Sanford villages. Products included cotton and woolen goods, carpets, shoes and lumber. In 1867, British-born Thomas Goodall established the Goodall Mills at Sanford, after selling another mill in 1865 at Troy, New Hampshire which made woolen blankets contoured to fit horses. His factory beside the Mousam River first manufactured carriage robes and blankets. It would expand to make mohair plush for upholstering railroad seats, carpets, draperies, auto fabrics, military uniform fabric and Palm Beach fabric for summer suits. Goodall Mills in 1867 Goodall Mills c. 1912 The company's textiles were known for brilliant and fast colors and found buyers worldwide. From 1880 to 1910, the mill town's population swelled from 2,700 to over 9,000, some living in houses built by the company and sold to workers at cost. In 1914, the Goodall family built Goodall Park, a 784-seat roofed stadium, now a treasured historic site. They also helped build the library, town hall, hospital, airport, and golf club. A bronze statue was erected by the citizens of Sanford in 1917 to the memory of Thomas Goodall. His effigy has a place of honor in Central Park. George and Henrietta Goodall's daughter, Marion C. Goodall Marland, and her husband William Marland continued the Goodall family philanthropy. A dormitory at Nasson College bears the Marland's name. In 1954, Burlington Mills, then the nation's largest textile firm, bought Sanford Mills. After moving the looms to its Southern plants, Burlington closed Sanford Mills—leaving 3,600 unemployed and of empty mills. Local business owners began traveling the northeast, enticing employers to move to the area. In November 1955, NBC's Armstrong Circle Theatre dramatized Sanford's comeback on television in “The Town that Refused to Die”, starring Darren McGavin and Jason Robards. The story was later featured in LIFE magazine's feature on \\"Community Boosters\\" on August 5, 1957. It now has diversified industries, including manufacturing and biotech. When the federal government offered money in the 1960s for urban renewal to rehabilitate aging or blighted districts, more than thirty Sanford structures were razed. In Springvale, three of four corners were leveled. Nevertheless, much fine architecture from the town's prosperous mill era survived. Sanford was the home of Belle Ashton Leavitt, the third woman attorney admitted to the Maine Bar Association. Leavitt was admitted to the Bar in 1900. Leavitt operated in partnership with attorney Fred J. Allen, her brother-in-law (Allen was married to Belle's sister Ida Leavitt), and member of the Maine Legislature. The town gained national notoriety in 1984, when Scott Waterhouse, then age 18, strangled 12-year-old Gycelle Cote. Rumors of Satanism surrounded the case, and some of Waterhouse's personal belongings were deemed to be occult in nature. These included a copy of The Satanic Bible and a notebook carrying Satanic drawings and poetry. The furor culminated in several tabloid stories, national television coverage, and at least one headline referring to the town as \\"Terrortown!\\". The town again gained national notoriety on November 9, 2009, when the Amber Alert system was first used in the state for 2-year-old Hailey Traynham, abducted by her father. In 2003, Maine voters rejected a proposal to build a $650 million casino in South Sanford. The development, ostensibly owned by the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy nations, would have included 4,000 slot machines, 180 gaming tables, a hotel, a convention center and an 18-hole golf course. Proponents argued it would add 4,700 permanent jobs and direct 25% of its revenue to the state. Detractors predicted higher crime, traffic and an erosion of Maine's quality of life. 2017 mill fireOn June 23, 2017, the largest mill fire Sanford firefighters have ever battled erupted. The flaming five-story back building of the former Stenton Trust Mill complex at 13 River Street brought more than 100 firefighters from 20 communities to battle the blaze. The complex, which was built in 1922 as a textile mill, includes two five-story brick and concrete buildings and a one-story connecting structure. Two days later, three boys from Sanford, two 13-year-olds and a 12-year-old, were charged with felony arson in connection with the fire. They pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and were placed on probation for a year.

He resigned his parliamentary seat and leadership post in 2015 at age 65. Gauweiler is considered a Euro-sceptic and made a name with partly successful constitutional complaints against the euro bailout fund and the Lisbon Treaty.Nancy Waldmann (February 27, 2013), Dispute over Europe: “A Homeland is Not a Piece of Earth” Goethe Institute, Prague. ==Political career== Gauweiler was born in Munich, Bavaria. He joined the CSU in 1968 and has been an elected politician since 1972, first in the Munich City Council, and later in the Bavarian state parliament.Nancy Waldmann (February 27, 2013), Dispute over Europe: “A Homeland is Not a Piece of Earth” Goethe Institute, Prague. In 1987, during Gauweiler’s time as secretary of state in the State Interior Ministry, Bavaria put into effect some of the stiffest AIDS regulations ordered anywhere in the world, including mandatory blood tests for prostitutes, drug addicts, prison inmates, applicants for civil-service jobs and some foreigners seeking residence in Bavaria.Serge Schmemann (July 12, 1987), A German Controversy: What To Do? Bavaria Has Some Strict Ideas New York Times. From 1990 to 1994, Gauweiler was Bavarian State Minister for Regional Development and Environment. Most notably during that time, he demanded that the Party of Democratic Socialism and the German Communist Party be outlawed after German reunification.John O. Koehler, Stasi - The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police New York Times. From 2006, Gauweiler served as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Foreign Cultural and Educational Policies of the German Bundestag. In 2009, he accompanied German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on what was the first visit to Iraq by a German foreign minister in 22 years.Ralf Beste (February 17, 2009), Foreign Minister in Baghdad: Visit to Iraq Underscores Germany's Shift in Policy Spiegel Online. Along with fellow lawmakers Günter Gloser, Monika Grütters, Luc Jochimsen and Claudia Roth, Gauweiler traveled to Iran in 2010 to meet with Ali Larijani, Manouchehr Mottaki and others; the trip was heavily criticized by international human rights organizations.Benjamin Weinthal (November 16, 2010), That Treasured German-Iranian Friendship Wall Street Journal. In 2012, he argued that the German government's gold reserves held in the United States should be repatriated.Stephen Beard (November 16, 2012), Tracking down Germany's gold Deutsche Welle. Following the 2009 federal elections, Gauweiler was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the FDP on a coalition agreement; he joined the working group on foreign affairs, defense and development policy, led by Franz Josef Jung and Werner Hoyer. Similarly, he participated in the negotiations on forming a so-called Grand Coalition with the SPD following the 2013 federal elections. In November 2013, Gauweiler was elected deputy chairman of the CSU,Peter Gauweiler: Vom Außenseiter zur CSU-Parteispitze Augsburger Allgemeine, November 13, 2013. in what was widely considered a move to appease the eurosceptic elements within his party.Mehreen Khan (March 31, 2015), Angela Merkel faces euro rebellion as senior official resigns over Greek bail-out support The Daily Telegraph. He resigned the post and his seat in the Bundestag on 31 March 2015, about three months before his 65th birthday; he had previously been strongly criticized by CSU leader Horst Seehofer for voting against the extension of financial aid for Greece.Thorsten Severin (March 31, 2015), German conservative quits after refusing to back Greek aid extension Reuters. After his resignation he was immediately invited to become \\"a top official\\", by one report, in the euro-skeptic Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party but he declined the invitation. The same report speculated that the resignation would cause Chancellor Angela Merkel more difficulty by removing a protector of her right political flank in the parliament.Delamaide, Darrell, \\"Opinion: Euro-skeptic’s resignation exposes Merkel to more dissent\\", MarketWatch, April 3, 2015. The article included a tagesspiegel.de link to his statement, published only in German. Retrieved 2015-04-03. ===Euroscepticism=== Over many years, Gauweiler has led several attempts to have the German constitutional court block measures that he considers enhance the EU’s powers at the cost of national sovereignty.Claire Jones and Stefan Wagstyl (January 18, 2015), The eurozone: A strained bond Financial Times. Although his legal cases have generally failed, he has gained support from conservative voters, including members of the eurosceptic AfD party.Wagstyl, Stefan, and Chris Giles (January 22, 2015), Critics fear ECB quantitative easing will lead to crisis Financial Times. In 1992, Gauweiler described the Maastricht Treaty as a \\"totalitarian dream\\", and called its key component, a common currency by 1999, as \\"Esperanto money\\".Josef Joffe (April 1, 1992), Is the National Symbol in Danger?: Europe, Apple Pie And the D-Mark International Herald Tribune. In 2008, he challenged the German ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, claiming that the treaty was unconstitutional. He launched a similar challenge to the European Constitution in 2005, but the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany made no ruling and a presidential signature was never given.No Success for Peter Gauweiler's applications against the ratification of the EU Constitution, Press Release No 35/2005 dated April 28, 2005. (via Law Web Saarbrücken), April 28, 2005. In 2008, he challenged the Treaty of Lisbon before the constitutional court, saying that the proposed reforms of the EU would undermine the independence of the German Parliament and clash with the German Constitution.Stephen Castle and Judy Dempsey (July 1, 2008), Pursuit of EU treaty 'pointless,' Kaczynski says International Herald Tribune. Gauweiler has also been among the most aggressive challengers of the European Central Bank's efforts to rescue the Euro at the Constitutional Court.Nicholas Kulish (September 26, 2012), Political Shifts in Bavaria, Land of Tradition, Could Have Wide Repercussions New York Times. In 2011, together with a group of academics, he unsuccessfully asked the court to block the country’s participation in the bail-out packages for Greece and in the European Financial Stability Facility, the predecessor of the European Stability Mechanism.Karin Matussek (February 7, 2014), ECB’s ‘Whatever It Takes’ Questioned by Top German Court Bloomberg. In 2012, Gauweiler filed a complaint against the ESM and included opposition to a banking license for the bailout fund.Michelle Martin (August 4, 2012), German politicians concerned about bigger role for ESM Reuters. Gauweiler claimed that the ECB's bond-buying program threatened Germany with unlimited losses,Graeme Wearden (September 10, 2012), Eurozone crisis live: Greece battles with troika over cuts - as it happened The Guardian. arguing that it is an additional ground to reject use of German tax revenue for the rescue fund.Jack Ewing and Melissa Eddy (September 9, 2012), Europe Plan Faces Threat in Germany International Herald Tribune. He managed to convince a majority of justices on the court's second senate that the ECB's program to save the European common currency was contrary to European Union law. The judges subsequently referred the case onward to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, a first for the German court.Europe or Democracy? What German Court Ruling Means for the Euro Spiegel Online, February 10, 2014. On 27 January 2015 Gauweiler voted against the Merkel government’s proposal for a four-month extension of Greece's bailout; in doing so, joining 29 dissenters from the CDU/CSU parliamentary group who expressed scepticism as to whether the Greek government under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras could be trusted to deliver on its reform pledges.Stephen Brown (February 27, 2015), Germany backs Greek extension but bailout fatigue grows Reuters. ==Legal practice== Gauweiler is a partner in the law firm Bub, Gauweiler & Partner in Munich.

Then, at the age of 19, he moved to another Belfast club, Glentoran, where he spent a full ten seasons, playing in 288 league matches and scoring 53 goals. Although he was now 29 years old, Lyner had obviously impressed enough to warrant a transfer to England's Manchester United, who had just been relegated to the Second Division. Signed in August 1922, Lyner made his debut for United on 23 September 1922, playing in a 2–0 away defeat to Coventry City. He also played in the club's next two games, a 2–1 home win over Coventry City on 30 September and a 2–1 home defeat to Port Vale on 7 October, but, having failed to make a decent impression, these were to be his only appearances for Manchester United, and he was transferred to Kilmarnock in December 1922. The 1924–25 season was quite eventful for Lyner. After starting the season at Kilmarnock, he moved back to Northern Ireland to play for Queen's Island. He then moved to Dundela, another Belfast side, before joining Scotland's Clydebank for the end of the season, taking his total of clubs for the 1924–25 season to four. He then spent a brief stint with Wales' Mid Rhondda in the 1925–26 season, before joining New Brighton for the 1926–27 season. The 1927–28 season saw Lyner return to Northern Ireland for the last time, joining Glentoran, before he spent his final season with Queen's Island. He retired from football at the end of the 1928–29 season, at the age of 36. ===International career=== Lyner's international career began in 1919, when he was selected for Ireland's first two matches of the 1920 British Home Championship, against England on 25 October 1919, and against Wales on 14 February 1920. The matches finished at 1–1 and 2–2 respectively. He then played in the matches against Scotland and Wales in the 1922 British Home Championship, losing 2–1 to Scotland and drawing 1–1 with Wales. Lyner's involvement in the 1923 British Home Championship spanned his time with two different clubs: when he played in Ireland's 2–0 away defeat to England, he was a Manchester United player, but by the time of his only win with the Irish team, a 3–0 away win over Wales, he had signed for Kilmarnock. ==Honours== ;Glentoran *Irish Football League (2): 1912–13, 1920–21 *Irish Cup (2): 1913–14, 1916–17 ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com *Profile at Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats Category:1893 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Irish association footballers (before 1923) Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Clydebank F.C.

She was one of the last Vanderbilts to live the luxurious life of the \\"head of society\\" that her predecessors such as Alice and Alva Vanderbilt enjoyed. ==Early years== Grace was born on September 3, 1870 at 512 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. She was the youngest child of New York banker Richard Thornton Wilson and Melissa Clementine Johnston. Grace's sister Mary (\\"May\\") married Ogden Goelet and her sister Belle married Sir Michael Henry Herbert, younger brother of the 13th Earl of Pembroke. The sisters were known in London society as \\"the marrying Wilsons.\\" One of her brothers was banker Richard Thornton Wilson Jr.. Another brother, Marshall Orme Wilson, married Caroline \\"Carrie\\" Astor, youngest daughter of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Webster Schermerhorn of the Astor family. ==Personal life== She eloped with Cornelius \\"Neily\\" Vanderbilt III (1873–1942), son of Cornelius Vanderbilt II and Alice Claypoole Gwynne of the Vanderbilt family, in 1896. This led to a violent disagreement between Neily and his father, which lasted many years. Neily and Grace remained married for the rest of their lives and had two children: * Cornelius Vanderbilt IV (1898–1974), who married seven times throughout his lifetime, but had no children. * Grace Vanderbilt (1899–1964), who married Henry Gassaway Davis (1902–1984) in 1927. They divorced in 1936 and she married Robert Livingston Stevens (1907–1972). Grace and Neily rented Beaulieu House in Newport, Rhode Island, the former home of John Jacob Astor III. Following World War I, Grace and Neily frequently returned to Europe, becoming friends and guests of numerous members of European royalty including Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and his brother, Prince Henry of Prussia, King Albert I of Belgium, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Queen Marie of Romania, the Shah of Iran, and every British monarch since Queen Victoria. In 1940, Neily sold his Fifth Avenue mansion, which he inherited from his uncle George Washington Vanderbilt II upon his death in 1914, in New York City to members of the Astor family but remained living there until his death from a cerebral hemorrhage while vacationing in Miami Beach, Florida aboard his yacht in 1942. Following Neily's death Grace Vanderbilt was forced to move out of their massive Fifth Avenue mansion, and moved into the William Starr Miller House at 1048 Fifth Avenue which still stands today as the Neue Galerie. ===Death and legacy=== Grace lived another eleven years, and she died on January 7, 1953. They are buried together in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum in the Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp on Staten Island, New York. == References  Further reading == *Vanderbilt, Arthur T., II (1989).

The film was also written by McBride. ==Plot== Jon (Jon McBride), Denice (Denice Edeal), and Tom (Tom Casiello) are three kids whose father goes away for a business meeting. He leaves them in care of their Aunt Tess (Patricia McBride) who is a militaristic religious extremist who only lets the kids do homework and chores while preaching to them against dating, staying up late, movies, music, and why their lifestyle is wrong. Tom gets an official Rambo Hunting Knife in the mail and Tess will not let him have it. They get into a physical struggle over Tom keeping it, and Aunt Tess accidentally gets fatally stabbed in the stomach. The three kids then dismember her body, placing it in the freezer. They then take her body out of the freezer so they can put her in the woodchipper. They grind her body to shreds. They then think it's over. But then, Tess's son, Kim (Kim Baily), who was recently released from prison, comes to their home and is told that his mother is \\"not here\\" and has \\"left.\\" He is involved in some kind of money wiring deal and came there to get money from his mother. He decides to take monetary value from the children's home and threatens them if they don't give it to him. Denice and Tom trick him out to the \\"expensive\\" wood chipper, plotting to throw him inside, too. They lure Kim to look inside. Tom turns it on and Kim is pushed in by Jon. Jon drives Kim's car to the airport to hide the evidence and hitches a ride back. Denice and Tom are raking and mowing the lawn which Jon promised his father he would have done by the time he returned from the business meeting. With only a little bit of time before their father's return, Jon assists in the raking and mowing. The father then arrives home and sees his children welcoming him on the driveway. All appears normal, and the children get away with the crime. The camera pans back to the woodchips on the ground and Aunt Tess's bloody ring is lying on the ground when the film ends. ==Cast== * Jon McBride as Jon * Denice Edeal as Denice * Tom Casiello as Tom * Patricia McBride as Aunt Tess * Kim Bailey as Kim * Perren Page as Father ==Budget== According to an interview with Jon McBride on the DVD, the film's final budget was $400 (not including the cost of the camera). ==Crew== Jon McBride acted, wrote, directed, edited, and composed Woodchipper Massacre.

This can be a quick and convenient way to determine theoretical heats of formation without conducting tedious experiments. The technique was developed by professor Sidney William Bensonhttps://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/09/local/la-me-passings-20120109 of the University of Southern California. It is further described in Heat of formation group additivity. Heats of formations are intimately related to bond-dissociation energies and thus are important in understanding chemical structure and reactivity.Benson, S. W. Journal of Chemical Education 42, 502–518 (1965). Furthermore, although the theory is old, it still is practically useful as one of the best group-contribution methods aside from computational methods such as molecular mechanics. However, the BGIT has its limitations, and thus cannot always predict the precise heat of formation. == Origin == Benson and Buss originated the BGIT in a 1958 article. Within this manuscript, Benson and Buss proposed four approximations: # A limiting law for additivity rules. # Zero-order approximation. Additivity of atomic properties. # First-order approximation. Additivity of bond properties. # Second-order approximation. Additivity of group properties. These approximations account for the atomic, bond, and group contributions to heat capacity (Cp), enthalpy (ΔH°), and entropy (ΔS°). The most important of these approximations to the group-increment theory is the second-order approximation, because this approximation \\"leads to the direct method of writing the properties of a compound as the sum of the properties of its group\\".Benson, S. W.; Buss, J. H. Journal of Chemical Physics, 29, 546–572 (1958). The second-order approximation accounts for two molecular atoms or structural elements that are within relative proximity to one another (approximately 3–5 ångstroms as proposed in the article). By using a series of disproportionation reactions of symmetrical and asymmetrical framework, Benson and Buss concluded that neighboring atoms within the disproportionation reaction under study are not affected by the change. ; Symmetrical : Cl-CH2CH2-Cl + H-CH2CH2-H -> 2 Cl- CH2CH2-H ; Asymmetrical : H-CH2O-H + CH3-CH2CH2-CH3 -> CH3-CH2O-H + H-CH2O-CH3 In the symmetrical reaction the cleavage between the CH2 in both reactants leads to one product formation. that the neighboring carbons are not changed as the rearrangement occurs. In the asymmetrical reaction the hydroxyl–methyl bond is cleaved and rearranged on the ethyl moiety of the methoxyethane. The methoxy and hydroxyl rearrangement display clear evidence that the neighboring groups are not affected in the disproportionation reaction. The \\"disproportionation\\" reactions that Benson and Buss refer to are termed loosely as \\"radical disproportionation\\" reactions.International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. \\"disproportionation\\". Compendium of Chemical Terminology (Accessed December 03, 2008). From this they termed a \\"group\\" as a polyvalent atom connected together with its ligands. However, they noted that under all approximations ringed systems and unsaturated centers do not follow additivity rules due to their preservation under disproprotionation reactions. A ring must be broken at more than one site to actually undergo a disproportionation reaction. This holds true with double and triple bonds, as they must break multiple times to break their structure. They concluded that these atoms must be considered as distinct entities. Hence we see Cd and CB groups, which take into account these groups as being individual entities. Furthermore, this leaves error for ring strain, as we will see in its limitations. Heats of formations for alkane chains From this Benson and Buss concluded that the ΔHf of any saturated hydrocarbon can be precisely calculated due to the only two groups being a methylene [C−(C)2(H)2] and the terminating methyl group [C−(C)(H)3].Souders, M.; Matthews, C. S.; Hurd C. O., Ind. & Eng. Chemistry, 41, 1037–1048 (1949). Benson later began to compile actual functional groups from the second-order approximation.Benson, S. W.; Cruicksh, F. R.; Golden, D. M., et al. Chemical Reviews, 69, 279–324 (1969).Benson, S. W.; Cohen, N. Chemical Reviews, 93, 2419–2438 (1993). Ansylyn and Dougherty explained in simple terms how the group increments, or Benson increments, are derived from experimental calculations.Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty, Modern Physical Organic Chemistry, University Science Books, 2006. By calculating the ΔΔHf between extended saturated alkyl chains (which is just the difference between two ΔHf values), as shown in the table, one can approximate the value of the C−(C)2(H)2 group by averaging the ΔΔHf values. Once this is determined, all one needs to do is take the total value of ΔHf, subtract the ΔHf caused by the C−(C)2(H)2 group(s), and then divide that number by two (due to two C−(C)(H)3 groups), obtaining the value of the C−(C)(H)3 group. From the knowledge of these two groups, Benson moved forward obtain and list functional groups derived from countless numbers of experimentation from many sources, some of which are displayed below. == Applications == Simple Benson model of isobutylbenzene As stated above, BGIT can be used to calculate heats of formation, which are important in understanding the strengths of bonds and entire molecules. Furthermore, the method can be used to quickly estimate whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic. These values are for gas-phase thermodynamics and typically at 298 K. Benson and coworkers have continued collecting data since their 1958 publication and have since published even more group increments, including strained rings, radicals, halogens, and more.S. W. Benson, Thermochemical Kinetics: Methods for the Estimation of Thermochemical Data and Rate Parameters 2d ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1976.E. S. Domalski, E. D. Hearing, \\"Estimation of the Thermodynamic Properties of C–H–N–O–S–X Compounds at 298 K\\", J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, 22, 805–1159 (1993).N. Cohen, \\"Revised Group Additivity Values for Enthalpies of Formation (at 298 K) of C–H and C–H–O Compounds\\", J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, 25, 1411–1481 (1996). Even though BGIT was introduced in 1958 and would seem to be antiquated in the modern age of advanced computing, the theory still finds practical applications. In a 2006 article, Gronert states: \\"Aside from molecular mechanics computer packages, the best known additivity scheme is Benson's.\\"Gronert, S. J. Org. Chem., 71, 1209–1219 (2006). Fishtik and Datta also give credit to BGIT: \\"Despite their empirical character, GA methods continue to remain a powerful and relatively accurate technique for the estimation of thermodynamic properties of the chemical species, even in the era of supercomputers\\"Fishtik, I.; Datta, R. J. Phys. Chem. A, 107, 6698–6707 (2003). When calculating the heat of formation, all the atoms in the molecule must be accounted for (hydrogen atoms are not included as specific groups). The figure above displays a simple application for predicting the standard enthalpy of isobutylbenzene. First, it is usually very helpful to start by numbering the atoms. It is much easier then to list the specific groups along with the corresponding number from the table. Each individual atom is accounted for, where CB−(H) accounts for one benzene carbon bound to a hydrogen atom. This would be multiplied by five, since there are five CB−(H) atoms. The CB−(C) molecule further accounts for the other benzene carbon attached to the butyl group. The C−(CB)(C)(H)2 accounts for the carbon linked to the benzene group on the butyl moiety. The 2' carbon of the butyl group would be C−(C)3(H) because it is a tertiary carbon (connecting to three other carbon atoms). The final calculation comes from the CH3 groups connected to the 2' carbon; C−(C)(H)3. The total calculations add to −5.15 kcal/mol (−21.6 kJ/mol), which is identical to the experimental value, which can be found in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Chemistry WebBook NIST Chemistry WebBook (accessed December 3, 2008). Diogo and Piedade used BGIT to confirm their results for the heat of formation of benzo[k]fluoranthene. Another example from the literature is when the BGIT was used to corroborate experimental evidence of the enthalpy of formation of benzo[k]fluoranthene.Diogo, H. P.; Piedade, M. E. M. J. Chem. Thermodynamics, 34, 173–184 (2002). The experimental value was determined to be 296.6 kJ/mol with a standard deviation of 6.4 kJ/mol. This is within the error of the BGIT and is in good agreement with the calculated value. Notice that the carbons at the fused rings are treated differently than regular benzene carbons. Not only can the BGIT be used to confirm experimental values, but can also to confirm theoretical values. Scheme showing a simple application of BGIT to rationalize relative thermodynamics between an alkene (top) and a ketone (bottom). BGIT also can be used for comparing the thermodynamics of simplified hydrogenation reactions for alkene (2-methyl-1-butene) and ketone(2-butanone). This is a thermodynamic argument, and kinetics are ignored. As determined by the enthalpies below the corresponding molecules, the enthalpy of reaction for 2-methyl-1-butene going to 2-methyl-butane is −29.07 kcal/mol, which is in great agreement with the value calculated from NIST, −28.31 kcal/mol. For 2-butanone going to 2-butanol, enthalpy of reaction is −13.75 kcal/mol, which again is in excellent agreement with −14.02 kcal/mol. While both reactions are thermodynamically favored, the alkene will be far more exothermic than the corresponding ketone. == Limitations == As powerful as it is, BGIT does have several limitations that restrict its usage. === Inaccuracy === There is an overall 2–3 kcal/mol error using the Benson group-increment theory to calculate the ΔHf. The value of each group is estimated on the base of the average ΔΔHf0 shown above and there will be a dispersion around the average ΔΔHf0. Also, it can only be as accurate as the experimental accuracy. That's the derivation of the error, and there is nearly no way to make it more accurate. === Group availability === The BGIT is based on empirical data and heat of formation. Some groups are too hard to measure, so not all the existing groups are available in the table. Sometimes approximation should be made when those unavailable groups are encountered. For example, we need to approximate C as Ct and N as NI in C≡N, which clearly cause more inaccuracy, which is another drawback. === Ring strain, intermolecular and intramolecular interactions === In the BGIT, we assumed that a CH2 always makes a constant contribution to ΔHf0 for a molecule. However, a small ring such as cyclobutane leads to a substantial failure for the BGIT, because of its strain energy. A series of correction terms for common ring systems has been developed, with the goal of obtaining accurate ΔHf0 values for cyclic system. Note that these are not identically equal to the accepted strain energies for the parent ring system, although they are quite close. The group-increment correction for a cyclobutane is based on ΔHf0 values for a number of structures and represents an average value that gives the best agreement with the range of experimental data. In contrast, the strain energy of cyclobutane is specific to the parent compound, with their new corrections, it is now possible to predict ΔHf0 values for strained ring system by first adding up all the basic group increments and then adding appropriate ring-strain correction values. The same as ring system, corrections have been made to other situations such as gauche alkane with a 0.8 kcal/mol correction and cis- alkene with a 1.0 kcal/mol correction. Also, the BGIT fails when conjugation and interactions between functional groups exist,Knoll, H. Schliebs, R.; Scherzer, H. Reaction Kinetics and Catalysis Letters, 8, 469–475 (1978).Sudlow, K.; Woolf, A. A. Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 71, 31–37 (1995). such as intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which limits its accuracy and usage in some cases. ==References== Category:Physical chemistry Category:Enthalpy Category:Thermodynamic models ","title":"Benson group increment theory"},{"id":"20536382","text":"Thomas Strong may refer to: * L.

Currently it houses the \\"Center Foundation of Promotion of the Crafts\\", that can be visited and hosts temporary exhibitions. The building continued maintaining the Islamic faith in Spain well beyond the reconquista of the city by the Christian troops of Alfonso VI of León and Castile in 1085, until the period of 1498–1505, when it was desacralizated by the Catholic Monarchs. Already as a building for civil use, it went through various vicissitudes, first as an inn in 1505 and then as the headquarters of different businesses and small factories or as a simple home. Its history was lost until the late 19th century, when historians investigating its origins didn't know whether it was a synagogue or a mosque. After the studies, on the 15 of March 1905, the finding of an Arab mosque in the street of the Tornerías was officially communicated to the Real Academia de la Historia. == Features == The mosque was built on the walls of Roman drinking water tanks for distribution of drinking water throughout the city. The great unevenness of the terrain makes its layout in two floors possible, which is unique. The ground floor, which is accessed from the street of the Tornerías, opens to the Roman water tanks with granite half-point arches. The upper floor houses the place of worship, retaining remains of the mihrab and the wall of the qibla. Its construction was made based on one of the main mosques of the city of Toledo, the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz or of Bab al-Mardum of the 10th century. Its plan is irregular square and the interior spaces are organized like the former in a plan of nine square compartments, covered by sail-vault domes of brick, except the central one, with special relevance of its ribbed dome. The building has horseshoe arches on low columns with large capitals. == Dating == Historians cannot agree on its date of construction. It can be in the second half of the 11th century or in the second half of the 12th century. ==Gallery== File:Visita a las obras de rehabilitación de la Mezquita de Tornerías (43539278162).jpgArches in former prayer hall File:Visita a las obras de rehabilitación de la Mezquita de Tornerías (41778262390).jpg File:Mezquita de las Tornerías, Toledo (6294139090).jpg File:Mezquita de las Tornerías.

In May 1897, he joined Bolton Wanderers where he remained for five years, making 76 appearances in The Football League. During his time with Bolton Wanderers he made three appearances for the Football League in representative matches against the Irish League in November 1899, November 1900 and November 1901, and also played in an unofficial international against Germany in 1901. In the spring of 1902 he joined Manchester United for the first time but, before he could make a first-team appearance, he moved to the south coast to join Southampton of the Southern League in May 1902. At Southampton, he was used as cover for Samuel Meston at left-half and, although he played in five of the first six matches, he lost his place to Meston at the start of November and only made four further appearances, including one in the FA Cup defeat to Notts County. In his time at The Dell, Fitchett was known for his \\"energetic tackling and neat passing\\" as well as for his \\"over-elaboration\\". He returned to Manchester United in March 1903 and made five appearances before the end of the 1902–03 season. His debut for United came on 21 March when he scored in a 5–1 defeat of Leicester City. His stay at Bank Street was short-lived and in May 1903 he returned to the Southern League to join Plymouth Argyle, who were making their debut in the league. Fitchett was known to Argyle's manager Frank Brettell under whom he had played at Bolton Wanderers. At Bolton he had played alongside Bob Jack, who he persuaded to join Argyle for their debut league season. Jack was to go on to make over 100 appearances for Argyle as well as replacing Brettell as manager, a post he held until 1938. Primarily used as a left-back, Pritchett was a regular member of Argyle's first professional side, making 46 appearances in all competitions. In June 1904, he once again returned to Manchester United although his second \\"debut\\" was not until January 1905. By the end of the season, he was a regular at left-back, but in the summer of 1905 he moved across the city to join Manchester City. His stay was very brief and in June 1905, he again returned to the Southern League to join Fulham. At Fulham, he was little used, making only three appearances before bringing his professional career to a close at the end of the 1905–06 season. ==Theatre management== During his youth, Fitchett was an actor and was a member of Fred Karno's Theatrical Company. He had appeared with Charlie Chaplin in The Mumming Birds. Following his retirement from professional football, Fitchett settled in Devon, becoming manager of the Vaudeville Theatre in Exeter. In February 1910, he briefly resumed his football career to assist Exeter City. After World War I, Fitchett became manager of the New Palace Theatre in Union Street, Plymouth. After he retired as the theatre manager, he became the licensee of the Royal Sovereign public house in Union Street. ==Notes== * In total, Fitchett made 40 league appearances for Plymouth Argyle, of which 27 were in the Southern Football League and 13 in the Western League. As the Southampton club historians only include the Southern League appearances in their statistics, the same is done here for consistency. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==External links== *Career details *Bolton Wanderers profile Category:1879 births Category:Association football defenders Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:English footballers Category:English male musical theatre actors Category:English theatre managers and producers Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:People from Chorlton-cum-Hardy Category:Place of death unknown Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Western Football League players Category:Year of death unknown Category:Footballers from Greater Manchester Category:English Football League representative players ","title":"Jack Fitchett"},{"id":"20536485","text":"The International Criminal Court Student Network (ICCSN) is an international student association that brings together young people interested in the International Criminal Court and in international criminal justice.

In its abbreviated second season, the series was switched to Thursday (by its sponsor) to fill the slot left by the cancelled 1920s situation comedy Margie starring Cynthia Pepper.1960-1961; 1961-1962 American network television schedules After The Law and Mr. Jones, Janet De Gore joined the revised cast of Walter Brennan's The Real McCoys, renamed The McCoys and switched from ABC to CBS. Conlan Carter took over the role of \\"Doc\\" on ABC's Combat! for which he secured an Emmy nomination in 1964. In 2000, James Whitmore said of the series, \\"That thing arose out of the American Civil Liberties Union … This was right after the McCarthy thing was so hot in this country, and I thought it was time we did something about the right of people to disagree with one another in a reasonable fashion … That was the predication of that show, and I produced it … It was a wonderful experience.\\" ABC had canceled the series after its first season, but thousands of angry letters from fans convinced them to bring the show back in 1962. Whitmore explained, \\"We were taken off the air after one year, because I didn't want to do the commercials [for] Gleam Toothpaste. They wanted me as that character, that lawyer, to come on and say, 'You ought to use Gleam toothpaste,' and I didn't think I wanted to do that, so they dropped us. Procter and Gamble were our sponsors. Then, they had an astonishing hundreds of thousands of letters. It was engineered by some newspaper guys to get the show back on, and they brought it back on.

The 5th Mob (referred to as such by its former designation as the 5th Mobile Communications Group) is currently based at Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins, Georgia. Its current structure is made up of two active duty Combat Communications Squadrons (51st & 52nd) and the 5th Combat Communications Support Squadron, which handles such activities as the group's Mobility Training Program (known as Mob School). ==Mission== The 5th Combat Communications supports United States United States Air Forces Central Command and Joint Chiefs of Staff worldwide. It also responds to contingencies, emergencies and natural disasters. The group also deploys to a variety of sites around the southeastern United States during training exercises. It has participated in more than five hundred deployments to locations that include Iceland, Egypt, Ecuador, Panama, Virgin Islands, Wake Island, Somalia, Kenya, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Honduras in recent years. The unit has approximately 500 people and can be a self-supporting combat unit. The group can provide its own site security, electrical power and vehicle maintenance. The 5th has more than 100 of its members deployed to remote locations of the world at any given time in support of ongoing operations, typically for 180 days at a time. In addition, the group advises two Air National Guard Combat Communications Groups composed of more than 2,300 people in units throughout the Eastern U.S. from Maine to the Virgin Islands. The unit also participated in the ongoing war on drugs by supplying communications support, providing personnel and equipment which allows the Drug Enforcement Administration access to secure data and voice services from classified locations. ==Units== {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Title !

It has had its current name since 1976, except for the period from 1984 to 1986 when Air Force Communications Command units were designated as \\"Information Systems\\" units.Miller, pp. 462–463 Group air traffic controllers and air traffic control maintenance personnel were included in the force deployed for Operation Eagle Claw, the failed 1980 attempt to rescue the hostages held by the government of Iran in the Tehran embassy. Their mission was to establish and operate air navigation systems at \\"Desert One\\", the base of operations within Iran.See generally Kamps for a description of Operation Eagle Claw as planned and as executed. When civilian government air traffic controllers walked off their jobs the following year, practically the entire air traffic control division of the 5th, along with controllers from the other combat control groups of the Air Force, deployed to civilian airports to maintain the flow of traffic within the United States. The controllers remained deployed until new civilian controllers were trained to replace those who had been dismissed.See Van Horn & Schaffner, Vol. 2, pp. 444–446 (describing PATCO Strike) During the 1980s until the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the Air Force maintained a deployed Airborne Warning and Control System maintaining surveillance of the Persian Gulf. The deployment was referred to as \\"ELF One.\\" 5th Mob personnel rotated to ELF One during this period to provide communications support for the operation. (Providing an overview of the operation). In September 1988, the group reorganized, transferring its people into three combat communications squadrons. Each squadron is assigned approximately 180 persons. The 51st Combat Communications Squadron provides communications and air traffic control support to an Air Force Headquarters. The 52d and 53d Squadrons provide communications and air traffic control support for deployed bases. In 1990, when Air Force Communications Service was disestablished as a major command, the 5th Group became part of Tactical Air Command, which was replaced by Air Combat Command in 1992. In 2009, combat communications units, including the group, were made part of Air Force Space Command. The 5th also lent its communications expertise to the Operation Bright Star in Egypt in 1995. More than 120 members of the 52d Combat Communications Squadron, along with augmentees from the group's other squadrons, participated in the largest multinational exercise of its kind. During Operation Desert Storm, the 5th deployed more than 600 people to a dozen locations. It was the first communications unit in theater. The group's squadrons provided air traffic control and communications support to six deployed wings and Central Command Air Forces headquarters. Group personnel remained deployed to Southwest Asia for an additional three years to support the Cease Fire and maintaining United Nations resolutions. In 1993, the group added the 5th Combat Communications Support Squadron to train and assist the combat communications squadrons for deployment. Later that year, the group added the 54th Combat Communications Squadron, whose mission mirrored that of the 52d and 53d Squadrons. Members of the unit deployed to the Southwest Asia area of responsibility in March 1996 to support an Air Expeditionary Force. The communicators helped Air Force and multinational forces already in Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries patrol the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. When terrorists attacked Khobar Towers that year, the group was called upon again to deploy to the Persian Gulf. More than 140 members of the 5th, along with 250 tons of equipment, left Robins for Prince Sultan Air Base, where they established a complete communications network beside a bare airfield. The 5th again received orders to deploy in early February 2003 to the Central Command theater of operations. They were part of a larger action by the United States to reposition some of its military forces to support the Global War on Terrorism and to prepare for future contingencies. The deployment marked the first time the Air Force's first total force wing, composed of both National Guard and active duty, Air Force and Army, would deploy. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 5th Mobile Communications Group on 20 May 1964 and activated (not organized) : Organized on 1 July 1964 : Redesignated 5th Combat Communications Group on 24 March 1976 : Redesignated 5th Combat Information Systems Group on 15 August 1984 : Redesignated 5th Combat Communications Group on 1 Oct 1986Lineage, including assignments and stations through 1990 in Miller, pp. 462–463On 22 July 1988 the group became Headquarters, 5th Combat Communications Group when squadrons were assigned to it for the first time ===Assignment=== * Air Force Communications Service, 20 May 1964 (not organized) * Tactical Communications Region (later Tactical Communications Area), 1 July 1964 * 12th Tactical Communications Region, 1 December 1969 * Tactical Communications Area (later Tactical Communications Division, Tactical Information Systems Division, Tactical Communications Division), 30 June 1971 * 507th Tactical Air Control Wing (later 507th Air Control Wing), 1 October 1990 * 347th Fighter Wing, 28 May 1992 * Ninth Air Force, 1 March 1994 * 689th Combat Communications Wing, 5 October 2009 * Twenty-Fourth Air Force, 1 October 2013 ===Components=== * 5th Combat Communications Support Squadron, 15 June 1992 – present * 51st Combat Communications Squadron, 15 July 1988 – present * 52d Combat Communications Squadron, 15 July 1988 – present * 53d Combat Communications Squadron, 15 July 1988 – 2015 (Redesignated as an Air Control Squadron and realigned under the active duty 461st Air Control Wing (ACW), also at Robins.) * 54th Combat Communications Squadron, 18 June 1993 – 2014 ===Stations=== * Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, 1 July 1964 – present ===Awards and campaigns=== {  - efefef;\\" !

I had a son in 1966 and I went away when he was five years old or so and again told him \\"someday\\" he would understand everything. Really, all kids ask questions like \\"Daddy, when are we going fishing?\\" and parents always answer with \\"someday\\", but in reality someday never comes and kids never learn what they're supposed to learn. - John Fogerty 1973 :When I wrote this song, my life was pretty chaotic. I knew my marriage was going to break up. My band was falling apart. I was beginning to sense the darkness that was Fantasy Records. This song was inspired by my parents' divorce when I was a young boy and the effect it had on me. At the time, they told me, \\"Someday, you'll understand.\\" The truth of this is that you never do and I found myself facing this as a parent. The irony was painful and inescapable. - John Fogerty, liner notes to \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\", Vanguard Records, 2013 ==References * Category:1972 singles Category:Creedence Clearwater Revival songs Category:Songs written by John Fogerty Category:Song recordings produced by John Fogerty Category:1972 songs Category:Fantasy Records singles ","title":"Someday Never Comes"},{"id":"20536587","text":"Joseph Curry (1887 – 1 April 1936) was an English footballer who played at full-back for Manchester United and Southampton in the early 20th century. ==Football career== Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Curry started his career at Scotswood, before joining Manchester United in February 1908. Over the next three years, he spent most of the time in the reserves, but made a total of 14 first-team appearances. Curry joined Southampton from Manchester United in May 1911. He found few opportunities to break into the first team as the Saints struggled near the foot of the Southern League First Division and was used as cover for Jim McAlpine.

Parish records date back to 1682, indicating that it existed prior to the Act of Establishment (1692) passed by the General Assembly of Maryland laying off the Province into 30 Anglican parishes. The church building is a low, rectangular Flemish bond brick structure with a hip roof. The building was constructed about 1710 as the parish church of All Hallows' or South River Parish, now called All Hallows Parish, South River. The interior was gutted by fire in 1727. It was modernized in 1825 and again in 1885. After a fire in 1940, reconstruction restored the building to its 1710 appearance. The ancient cemetery, shaded by a grove of oak trees, surrounds the church. It contains the graves of many local families. One is Provincial Justice, Deputy-Governor and Lord High Sheriff of Anne Arundel Colonel William Burgess (1622–1686), who donated 100 acres of his lands for the establishment of Londontowne. Among the descendants of pioneer planter/politician Colonel Nicholas Gassaway is his son, the Lord High Sheriff Captain Thomas Gassaway (1683–1739), amidst whose plantations the church itself was built. The bell in the rustic tower bears the date 1727. All Hallows' Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In addition to the Brick Church, the parish maintains a chapel-of-ease at 864 West Central Avenue, in Davidsonville. The Chapel was constructed from 1860 to 1865 because the parish's Brick Church was too far away at distant. The parish's rectory is diagonally across the street from the Chapel.

He was the Democratic nominee for United States Senate in New Jersey in 1918 and served as Chairman of the Board of the Prudential Insurance Company. ==Early life and business career== La Monte was born in 1863 in Danville, Virginia, the son of George T. La Monte and Rebecca Kern. His family later settled in Bound Brook, New Jersey, where he lived until his death. He studied at Columbia University for a year before entering Wesleyan University, where he graduated in 1884. After working as a commercial reporter for the Bradstreet company, he trained at the paper company of Augustine Smith & Co. for several years. La Monte then joined his father in the formation of a company to manufacture safety paper used as an anti-fraud measure in the printing of checks and money orders. The company, George La Monte & Son, had its main office in New York City and its manufacturing plant in Nutley, New Jersey. La Monte was president of the company for thirty-one years. ==Political career== In 1911 La Monte served a term in the New Jersey General Assembly. He was a delegate to the 1912 Democratic National Convention and a presidential elector for Woodrow Wilson. From 1912 to 1916 he was the New Jersey State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. In 1918 he was the Democratic candidate for the open seat in the United States Senate left vacant after the death of William Hughes. (David Baird was elected to fill the remainder of Hughes' term but did not stand for reelection.) Though La Monte did not campaign actively for his candidacy, President Wilson wrote a public letter warmly endorsing him. In the general election, La Monte was defeated by Walter Evans Edge, then serving as governor. ==Later life== After the election, La Monte returned to his business and philanthropic interests. He served as President of the First National Bank of Bound Brook and was a major contributor to Bound Brook civic institutions. After several years on the Board of Directors of the Prudential Insurance Company, he was elected Chairman of the Board in 1925, serving in that position until his death. La Monte lived for many years at the Piedmont Farm in Bound Brook, where he maintained a prized herd of Guernsey cows. He married Anna I. Vaill in 1887, and they had three children: George V. La Monte (vice president of his father's firm), Archibald D. La Monte, and Isabel La Monte (who married Edmond B. Hackett). On December 24, 1927 La Monte died of heart disease at the Weylin Hotel in New York City. He was 64 years old. ==References *Biographical information for George M.

Born in Birmingham, he began his career with Rotherham Town and made guest appearances for Clapton Orient during the First World War. After leaving Brentford in 1921, he played for Sittingbourne for a year before ending his career with Elsecar Main. == Career Early career=== Spratt while with Brentford in 1911. Born in Birmingham, Spratt began his career at Midland League club Rotherham Town in 1910, joining from local club Meadow Hall. A year later, he signed for Southern League First Division club Brentford and made more than 100 appearances for the club before departing Griffin Park in early 1915. ===Manchester United=== In February 1915, Spratt joined Football League First Division club Manchester United. He initially joined on a one-month trial after being released by Brentford (along with all their other professional players). Despite this, Brentford demanded Manchester United pay a fee to sign Spratt; United initially refused, but an Inter-League Board inquiry later ruled that they pay a fee of £175. He made his Football League debut on 6 February, playing at right-back in a 1–0 defeat to Sunderland. He made a total of 12 appearances during the 1914–15 season. Due to the ongoing First World War, Spratt did not make another competitive appearance for the Red Devils again until the 1919–20 season. During the war, he played for Manchester United in the wartime leagues, as well as making guest appearances for Clapton Orient. He was injured while playing for Clapton Orient and was not discharged from hospital until September 1919. He made his comeback from injury in a Manchester United reserve team game in January 1920, before making final appearance for the club a month later in a 1–0 defeat at home to Arsenal on 28 February. === Return to Brentford === Spratt returned to Brentford in June 1920 for the club's first season in the Third Division South. He made just four appearances, with his final game coming in a 2–0 defeat to West London rivals Queens Park Rangers on Christmas Day 1920. Spratt departed Brentford at the end of the 1920–21 season, having made 123 appearances and scored one goal during his two spells with Brentford. === Sittingbourne === At the end of the 1920–21 season, Spratt moved to non-league club Sittingbourne and moved back to Yorkshire in 1922 to end his career with Elsecar Main. == Personal life == In 1906, Spratt served in the Royal Navy aboard HMS Boscawen III. After the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve in February 1915 and served on communications bases at Crystal Palace and on the Isle of Grain. While working as a despatcher for Mosers, Spratt was one of 35 people killed in a V-2 rocket attack on Southwark, London, on 22 January 1945. == Career statistics == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Club ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! colspan=\\"3\\" League ! colspan=\\"2\\" FA Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals -  rowspan=\\"5\\" Brentford 1911–12  rowspan=\\"2\\" Southern League First Division 31 0 5 0 36 0 - 1912–13 30 1 2 0 32 1 - 1913–14  rowspan=\\"2\\" Southern League Second Division 30 0 3 0 33 0 - 1914–15 15 0 3 0 18 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !106 !1 !13 !0 !119 !1 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Manchester United 1914–15  rowspan=\\"2\\" First Division 12 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 12 0 - 1919–20 1 0 0 0 1 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !13 !0 !0 !0 !13 !0 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Brentford 1920–21 Third Division 4 0 0 0 4 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Brentford total !110 !1 !13 !0 !123 !1 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !123 !1 !13 !0 !136 !1 } ==References== Category:1889 births Category:English footballers Category:Sportspeople from Huddersfield Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football fullbacks Category:1945 deaths Category:Southern Football League players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Clapton Orient F.C. wartime guest players Category:Sittingbourne F.C. players Category:Royal Navy personnel of World War I Category:British civilians killed in World War II Category:Rotherham Town F.C.

Ocean temperature and motion fields can be separated into three distinct layers: mixed (surface) layer, upper ocean (above the thermocline), and deep ocean. Ocean dynamics has traditionally been investigated by sampling from instruments in situ. The mixed layer is nearest to the surface and can vary in thickness from 10 to 500 meters. This layer has properties such as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen which are uniform with depth reflecting a history of active turbulence (the atmosphere has an analogous planetary boundary layer). Turbulence is high in the mixed layer. However, it becomes zero at the base of the mixed layer. Turbulence again increases below the base of the mixed layer due to shear instabilities. At extratropical latitudes this layer is deepest in late winter as a result of surface cooling and winter storms and quite shallow in summer. Its dynamics is governed by turbulent mixing as well as Ekman transport, exchanges with the overlying atmosphere, and horizontal advection.DeCaria, Alex J., 2007: \\"Lesson 5 - Oceanic Boundary Layer.\\" Personal Communication, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Millersville, Pa. (Not a WP:RS) The upper ocean, characterized by warm temperatures and active motion, varies in depth from 100 m or less in the tropics and eastern oceans to in excess of 800 meters in the western subtropical oceans. This layer exchanges properties such as heat and freshwater with the atmosphere on timescales of a few years. Below the mixed layer the upper ocean is generally governed by the hydrostatic and geostrophic relationships. Exceptions include the deep tropics and coastal regions. The deep ocean is both cold and dark with generally weak velocities (although limited areas of the deep ocean are known to have significant recirculations). The deep ocean is supplied with water from the upper ocean in only a few limited geographical regions: the subpolar North Atlantic and several sinking regions around the Antarctic. Because of the weak supply of water to the deep ocean the average residence time of water in the deep ocean is measured in hundreds of years. In this layer as well the hydrostatic and geostrophic relationships are generally valid and mixing is generally quite weak. ==Primitive equations== Ocean dynamics are governed by Newton's equations of motion expressed as the Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid element located at (x,y,z) on the surface of our rotating planet and moving at velocity (u,v,w) relative to that surface: * the zonal momentum equation: ::\\\\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} + f v + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_x}{\\\\partial z} * the meridional momentum equation: ::\\\\frac{Dv}{Dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} - f u + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_y}{\\\\partial z} * the vertical momentum equation (assumes the ocean is in hydrostatic balance): ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z} = -\\\\rho g * the continuity equation (assumes the ocean is incompressible): ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial z} = 0 * the temperature equation: ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x} + v \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial y} + w \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial z} = Q. * the salinity equation: ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x} + v \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y} + w \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial z} = (E-P)S(z=0). Here \\"u\\" is zonal velocity, \\"v\\" is meridional velocity, \\"w\\" is vertical velocity, \\"p\\" is pressure, \\"ρ\\" is density, \\"T\\" is temperature, \\"S\\" is salinity, \\"g\\" is acceleration due to gravity, \\"τ\\" is wind stress, and \\"f\\" is the Coriolis parameter. \\"Q\\" is the heat input to the ocean, while \\"P-E\\" is the freshwater input to the ocean. ==Mixed layer dynamics== Mixed layer dynamics are quite complicated; however, in some regions some simplifications are possible. The wind-driven horizontal transport in the mixed layer is approximately described by Ekman Layer dynamics in which vertical diffusion of momentum balances the Coriolis effect and wind stress.Pickard, G.L. and W.J. Emery, 1990: Descriptive Physical Oceanography, Fifth Edition. Butterworth-Heinemann, 320 pp. This Ekman transport is superimposed on geostrophic flow associated with horizontal gradients of density. ==Upper ocean dynamics== Horizontal convergences and divergences within the mixed layer due, for example, to Ekman transport convergence imposes a requirement that ocean below the mixed layer must move fluid particles vertically. But one of the implications of the geostrophic relationship is that the magnitude of horizontal motion must greatly exceed the magnitude of vertical motion. Thus the weak vertical velocities associated with Ekman transport convergence (measured in meters per day) cause horizontal motion with speeds of 10 centimeters per second or more. The mathematical relationship between vertical and horizontal velocities can be derived by expressing the idea of conservation of angular momentum for a fluid on a rotating sphere. This relationship (with a couple of additional approximations) is known to oceanographers as the Sverdrup relation. Among its implications is the result that the horizontal convergence of Ekman transport observed to occur in the subtropical North Atlantic and Pacific forces southward flow throughout the interior of these two oceans. Western boundary currents (the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio) exist in order to return water to higher latitude. ==References== Category:Ocean currents Category:Dynamics (mechanics) Category:Marine energy Category:Water waves Category:Oceanographical terminology ","title":"Ocean dynamics"},{"id":"20536728","text":"Christ Church, or Christ Episcopal Church, West River, is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Episcopal church at Owensville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States.

He was a list member of the House of Representatives for the Labour Party from to 2011, and was re-elected in the as representative of the Napier electorate. He entered Cabinet in October 2017, with the portfolios of Police, Revenue, Small Business and Fisheries. Nash is the great-grandson of Walter Nash, 27th Prime Minister of New Zealand in the Second Labour Government from 1957 to 1960. ==Professional life== Born in Napier and educated at Napier Boys' High School, Nash holds master's degrees in Law, Forestry Science and Management from the University of Canterbury. Before moving back to his home town of Napier, he was the Director of Strategic Development at Auckland University of Technology. ==Political careerEarly political career=== In Nash was the Labour candidate for the safe National seat of Epsom, placing third behind Rodney Hide and Richard Worth; having been directed by then-Prime Minister Helen Clark to ask Labour supporters to vote for the National candidate, Richard Worth, in a strategy designed to defeat ACT MP, Rodney Hide. The tactic didn't work, with Hide winning; though at 9,915 Labour received the highest number of party votes in this electorate at any time under the MMP parliamentary system. Placed at number 60 on the party list, Nash failed to get elected. ===Election to Parliament on the list=== In 2007 Nash contested the Labour Party selection for the Napier seat in the 2008 general election, but lost to Russell Fairbrother, a list MP and the former Napier electorate MP. However Nash was ranked at number 36 on the party list and was subsequently elected to parliament. After becoming a list MP Nash was appointed Labour's spokesperson for Revenue, and associate spokesperson for Trade and Forestry by Labour leader Phil Goff. On 15 June 2010, Opposition Leader Phil Goff appointed Nash to be portfolio spokesperson for Forestry, a position formerly held by Mita Ririnui. In February 2011 Phil Goff announced his new caucus line up and Nash was ranked 27th, retaining all his portfolio responsibilities. ===2011–2014=== Nash and Phil Goff addressing community groups in 2011. In the 2011 general election, Nash contested the Napier electorate seat held by National Cabinet Minister Chris Tremain. Nash reduced Tremain's 2008 majority of 9,018 votes by 5,300 votes (the highest reduction achieved against a sitting National electorate MP) but still came second. As well, Nash was ranked 27 on the Labour list, higher than in 2008 but not high enough on the Labour list to return to Parliament as a List MP. After leaving Parliament, Nash signed on as the chief-of-staff for newly appointed party leader David Shearer. However, Nash resigned after just four months into the job and returned to his home town of Napier, citing the birth of his new child and focusing on winning back the Napier electorate. ===2014–current: return to Parliament=== In February 2014, Nash was selected as Labour's candidate for Napier to contest the 2014 general election. National's Tremain had retired and was succeeded by Wayne Walford, and Nash had a majority of 3,850 votes over Walford. The Napier electorate was also contested by Garth McVicar for the Conservative Party, and McVicar's 7,603 votes cut into traditional National Party votes. Nash retained the Napier electorate in 2017, increasing his majority and becoming only the second Labour MP after Damien O'Connor to win and hold a seat off the National party this century. Nash was elected as a Cabinet Minister by the Labour Party caucus following Labour's formation of a coalition government with New Zealand First and the Greens.

Ulli develops innovative means and ways to bring images from the inner world into being. She gathers wavelengths of color, shape and light and conveys them into an art work to provide a hint toward of a condition, a mood, a story. == Early life == Ulli is the fifth of six children born to Wilhelm Heinrich Kampelmann and Elsa (née Pilz) in Halle (Saale), Sachsen Anhalt, East Germany. She was drawn to the arts from an early age. She attended university in Halle where she earned her Master of Education degree in Art and then continued her study in Educational Philosophy at Technische Universität Berlin. In 1975 she successfully escaped to West Berlin in the trunk of a friend's car. == Artistic career == A section of partition wall created for the bistro within the Mercedes Benz Headquarters showroom in Stuttgart Iconic Turn, a diptych. Her art forms use light as an essential element though time and/or water are also incorporated. Consistently her works express the feeling to push ahead and think forward. She opened her first art studio in Stuttgart in 1980. * \\"I am always extremely interested to see Ulli Kampelmann's art. When I saw her work for the first time I was very surprised at how extraordinary, how innovative this art is to see. I have been looking for very long time to find something truly new in modern art. I found it here:Aesthetic and Beauty. So much new compared to what we normally see. I believe it is an adventure to be with this art. The translation of the word \\"Adventure\\" means you may be uncertain where you arrive. I think this is the invention of Ulli Kampelmann, to attract attention to one point, get the audience in communication with the art and then leave them alone to enjoy their trip through this adventure. Perhaps and this it the beauty of it; you immediately feel that Ulli Kampelmann has the intention to raise this question: What is beauty and harmony?.\\" Rudolf Greiner - Art Historian & Gallerist. * \\"The artist brings the sky into the room.

Kampelmann used ceramic in her earliest artworks. == Filmmaker == While in Stuttgart, Ulli Kampelmann was commissioned by the Mercedes Benz company to create large artworks for their headquarters. In order to research ideas for one of the commissions, she was given access to the Mercedes Benz/Daimler AG corporate archives where she came across the little-known details of the invention of the automobile by Carl Benz in 1885 as well as the charming story of the first ever long distance road trip by Carl's wife Bertha. Once Ulli was in the USA she wished to present this story to Americans. She wrote the screenplay for and directed an educational documentary titled The Car is Born - a documentary about Carl and Bertha Benz. She and her husband, a videographer, entered this documentary into a few film festivals and it won a \\"Best of the Fest\\" award in 2011.Official Best of the Fest Award Winners 2011IMDb The Car is Born A documentary detailing her own personal experiences growing up in and eventually escaping from East Germany called That Damned Wall, is in post- production. Kampelmann interviewed former vice-chancellor of Germany Hans- Dietrich Genscher in Bonn in 2010. == Author == For schools, she wrote \\"the Complete Visual Arts Education\\". (as mentioned above in Educator section) Ulli was a contributing author for Imago Magazine for six months with her article titled Ulli on Art.Tampa Bay Informer Newspaper article about Ulli's various works For The Star, the magazine of the Mercedes Benz Club of America, Ulli wrote an article about the first ever long-distance road-trip in an automobile in 1888, which was made by a woman, Bertha Benz, wife of Carl Benz, inventor of the automobile.The Star magazineThe article -Internet Acrhive She authored a full length screenplay detailing the circumstances surrounding her life in and her three successful escapes from East Germany.Synopsis of the screenplay \\"Escapings\\" == Educator == Ulli Kampelmann as a Master of Education, was invited to give art seminars and to publish educational articles about art and art history in various magazines. After she opened her art studio in the USA, she was commissioned to write a complete visual arts curriculum for schools K-12. This curriculum is currently implemented into a few schools in the USA and Australia. She continued to write educational articles about public art and was commissioned to provide continuing education for architects in the field of public arts projects. Most recently she took up the production of educational films and documentaries. An underlying theme in many of her works is her sensitivity for human rights, specifically one's freedom of expression and right to a good education. In May 2014, Ms. Kampelmann conceived of Kampelmann Academy and with the technical skills of her husband Steve Van Stone, the concept was developed to be an online, video-based education site offering aesthetic tutorials to bring about full conceptual understanding of a subject with concurrent facility in application of that subject in life. The online academy will contain curricula from kindergarten through high school as well as some college level courses. In early 2016, Kampelmann Academy was expanded in order to oversee humanitarian educational projects as well. Kampelmann Academy, Inc, a non-profit, tax-exempt organization was established. Its first order of business was to build a free, online language course called Say Hello! to teach German to the refugees pouring into central Europe.http://www.SayHello.at The videos of the language lessons are subtitled in Arabic, English, Persian, Kurmanji and Sorani for the benefit of the refugees from Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Palestine and elsewhere. == External links == * Website of Kampelmann Academy - Education project * Website of the Kampelmann Academy non-profit organization * Website of the Free German language course for refugees * Official website of Ulli Kampelmann's artworks * Online Art gallery established 2013 to host exceptional artists from around the world - from Internet Archive * Official website of Ulli Kampelmann's film projects * Website for the documentary about life behind the Iron Curtain * Website for the documentary about Carl and Bertha Benz - the Car is Born * Ulli Kampelmann Blog == References == Category:Living people Category:German educational theorists Category:American designers Category:German designers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ulli Kampelmann"},{"id":"20536794","text":"Robert Harrop (25 August 1936 – 8 November 2007) was an English footballer. His regular position was at centre back. He was born in Manchester and played in the Football League for Manchester United and Tranmere Rovers. Harrop joined Manchester United as a youth team player in 1953 and was an FA Youth Cup winner in 1954 and later graduated to the reserve side after turning professional. His first team debut came on 5 March 1958, a month after the Munich air disaster – where eight players were killed and two never played again due to injury, while several other players were still recovering from their injuries. His debut was against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup fifth round replay. He made a further five appearances that season, and five more in 1958–59, but never became a regular player and was sold to Tranmere Rovers for £4,000 in 1961. He spent two seasons at Prenton Park before quitting league football at the age of 27, when he signed for non league Margate in Kent. He played 564 games for the Hartsdown Park club in two spells until 1978. In between these he clocked over a century appearances at both Ashford Town (Kent) and Canterbury City, where he became player-manager for the final two seasons of his stay. Then at the age of 42 he signed for neighbouring Ramsgate. 52 appearances came over the next two seasons and he carried on playing until he was nearly 50, finally hanging up his boots at the end of the 1984–85 season with Dover Athletic, where he was also in charge of the reserve team. He remained in football as a non-league referee, a role he held until just before his death in November 2007 at the age of 71. ==External links== *MUFCInfo.com profile *Tribute to Bobby Harrop *Margate FC profile *Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database profile Category:1936 births Category:2007 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Footballers from Manchester Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Margate F.C. players Category:Canterbury City F.C. players Category:Canterbury City F.C. managers Category:Ramsgate F.C. players Category:Ashford United F.C. players Category:Dover Athletic F.C. players Category:Association football central defenders Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers ","title":"Bobby Harrop"},{"id":"20536803","text":"The Luke LP, or Banned in the U.S.A.: The Luke LP is an alternate version of 2 Live Crew's Banned in the U.S.A. and was marketed as Luther Campbell's debut album, though there were only minor changes to the track listing, notably, remixes to \\"Banned in the U.S.A. and \\"Mama Juanita\\".

It dwells in salt water up to the depth of 40m. It is exclusively found in precorralligene and coralligene communities and is very common in such communities. In the wild, Peltodoris is most abundant between June and September. Adults individuals can be found throughout the year, and two separate generations can coexist at the same time. While Peltodoris is commonly filed under the genus Discodoris, some studies suggest that there may be a large enough difference in their morphology (e.g. the jaws) for it to be classified as a separate genus. ==Distribution== Dotted sea slugs are found almost exclusively in the Mediterranean Sea. There has also been a single report of sighting in the Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Biscay to the Azores == Description == Peltodoris atromaculata between Parazoanthus Peltodoris is characterized by brown spots distributed randomly on its white mantle, each spot has a border of a darker brown color. The spots are generally darkest around the center of the mantle. Different populations exhibit different amounts of brown spots, and there is a general pattern of increasing coverage from west to east. == Life-cycle and growth  Spawning === Reproduction is restricted during the summer, during which the animal will spawn for 3-4 days, followed by 2-3 weeks without spawning, after which the cycle restarts. Adult individuals that are spawning experience a decrease in body size and weight which continues after oviposition. All individuals of the species are simultaneous hermaphrodites. During mating, both animals engage each other with their penises, and the one that successfully penetrates the body wall of the other becomes the male. The eggs of Peltodoris lay are spiral shaped and white- yellow in color which measure around 180μm in diameter. === Growth === After the eggs hatch they develop into a planktonic larvae. The larvae are chemically attracted to fulvinol-like polyacetylenes produced exclusively by their food sponges Petrosia and Haliclona, which can trigger settlement. Adults generally grow to an average length of 5 to 7cm, and are able to grow up to 12cm. The sizes of brown spots on the mantle increase proportionally with mantle area as the slug grows. However, coverage of the brown spots never exceeds 50% of the mantle area. Each individual has a unique pattern of spots which may change with growth but remain distinct from one another. The animals grow fastest around the first 6-7 months of their lifespan, growth rate slows for the following 4-5 months and a final decrease in growth rate occurs 3-4 months before death. === Life span === In the wild, Peltodoris exhibits an annual life-cycle, but have been observed to live up to 15 months in the laboratory. They generally die a few weeks after reproduction. ==Diet== Peltodoris relies exclusively on the sponges Petrosia ficiforms and Haliclona fulva as its food source, which is detects using chemotaxis. There are no other species know to prey on P. ficiforms and H. fulva, due to the fulvinol- like polyacetylenes produced by the sponges as a secondary metabolite, which are known to be cytotoxic. This lack of competition allows Peltodoris to relatively unrestricted by food availability. While Peltodoris prefers to feed on Haliclona over Petrosia, Petrosia are more numerous leading Peltodoris to feed mainly on Petrosia. In rare occasions, Peltodoris will feed on parts of its own mantle tissue. There are no observed daily and seasonal variation in the feeding habits of Peltodoris. == Defense mechanisms == Peltodoris has two main defense mechanisms that have been confirmed: mantle spicules and disruptive coloration. Unlike most dorid species, Peltodoris do not utilize chemical defense through the absorption of cytotoxic chemicals from their prey. === Mantle spicules === The mantle spicules are composed of calcite (CaCO3) and brucite (Mg(OH)2) and fluorite (Ca2F), with calcite making up the largest percentage and fluorite the least. These deter predators by causing physical harm when the predator comes into contact with the spicules. === Disruptive coloration === The bright coloration on the mantle of Peltodoris serves as aposematic signals which warns predators of protective mechanisms, making predators less likely to attack. === Mucus === A colorless mucus secreted from the mantle of Peltodoris both when the animal is stressed and under normal conditions. The fluid has a relatively neutral pH between 6 and 7. However, it is uncertain whether the mucus plays a role in defense. == Autotomy == Certain Peltodoris individuals will undergo autotomy of the mantle margin before death. During this process, most of the mantle is lost except small parts around the gills and head. Most slugs die right after autotomization, a small number are able to survive for a few hours after autotomization but only for maximum 2-3 hours. Unlike in many other animals, autotomy in Peltodoris is not reversible and is not used for defense, but merely a senescent process. ==References External links == * http://naturdata.com/Peltodoris-atromaculata-39418.htm Images and information of Peltodoris atromaculata from Portugal * Category:Discodorididae Category:Molluscs of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Molluscs of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Gastropods described in 1880 ","title":"Peltodoris atromaculata"},{"id":"20536983","text":"China International Electron Commerce Center (CIECC) is a government agency operating under the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, that develops {Electron} information projects.

It is the fifth main installment in the Guitar Hero series. The game was released internationally in September 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online. Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero. The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game. == Gameplay == Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 is similar to previous games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes in time with the music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x). As with Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 supports the playing of lead and bass guitar through guitar controllers, drums through a drum controller, and vocals through a microphone. Players can also play in groups of up to four local or remote players to form a band, co-operatively playing through a song. Whereas in World Tour, a band could only have one of each instrument, Guitar Hero 5 allows players to arrange for any combination of instruments, including all four players on the same instrument if they so choose. While playing in a band, Star Power is now tracked separately for each player, as opposed to collectively for the band as in World Tour. A new play mechanic called \\"Band Moments\\" will require all members of the band to play sections of a song successfully to gain rewards, both in a temporary scoring multiplier and visual effects on screen. The Band Revival meter will appear when a player fails out of the song, requiring the other band members to play well as a group together in order to bring the failed player back into the game. Failing to do so will end the song prematurely. === Game Modes === Guitar Hero 5 allows players to start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch into any of the game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a significant change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games. Two new multiplayer modes are in the game. The first is a \\"Party Play\\" mode, which is immediately launched once the game is started. During \\"Party Play\\", the game will automatically play randomly through the available songs. At any time, players can jump in with any instrument and start playing that song after selecting their difficulty and handedness; additional players can also jump in, drop out, or change their difficulty levels once someone is playing in this mode. The second feature is a \\"RockFest\\" mode, which can be played by four players locally or eight online, with several sub-modes that influence how the game is played and scored. In general, each song is divided into roughly 30-second long sections, and players earn points for their performance over that section based on the specific mode. These points are shown to all players to know how they are faring against the others. Players are able to create a playlist in Rockfest and assign a different mode to each song. The RockFest submodes include: * \\"Momentum\\": Starting at Medium difficulty, players can increase their difficulty and score more points by hitting twenty consecutive notes, but will fall back in difficulty if they miss three notes in a row. * \\"Streakers\\": Points are awarded for making \\"streaks\\" a series of consecutive notes, with the value further increasing for longer streaks. * \\"Perfectionist\\": For each section of a song, players are ranked by the percentage of correct notes hit, with the top player getting the most points. * \\"Do or Die\\": A player is forced to wait out until the next section if they miss three notes in the current section of the song. * \\"Elimination\\": After each section of a song, the lowest scoring player is eliminated. However, if the scoring player decided to stay in, they may do so. * \\"Pro Face-Off\\": A standard score attack mode, with the highest score winning points. === Career mode and Challenges === Guitar Hero 5 features a combined single- and multi-player (both off- and on-line) Career mode similar to Guitar Hero: Metallica. Songs in the game are distributed across 13 venues, with all but the first locked at the start. Each venue contains 5 or more specific songs and 1 or more special sponsored gigs, each with Challenges that can be completed along with playing through the song. To unlock the other venues, the players must collect a number of stars based on their performance playing individual songs, with each song offering up to 9 stars: up to 5 for the general scoring performance, an additional star for a perfect performance, and up to 3 for completing the song's Challenge. Players share the benefits of earning stars for their own respective profiles, thus, a player that may have difficulty completing one song on their own could join with a band that is able to complete it, benefiting from the gain in stars should they then play by themselves or with another group. \\"Gamma Ray\\" by Beck. Guitar Hero 5 introduces Career mode Challenges, that are either tied to specific songs, or allow players to select a song to meet the Challenge requirement in \\"open gigs\\". These were created by Neversoft to allow the developers to take advantage of unique features of many of songs and provide another layer of gameplay, according to Neversoft's Brian Bright. Each Challenge features three possible completion levels—Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, mimicking the music recording sales certification levels—with Diamond being the most difficult to complete. The song-specific challenges include both instrument-specific challenges, such as correctly vocalizing the repeated \\"Fame\\" lyric at the end of David Bowie's \\"Fame\\" as it moves down in pitch, and more general scoring or performance challenges on either specific instruments or for the whole band. Open gig Challenges are presented by sponsors within the game, and are based on performance aspects such as scoring a certain number of points using Star Power or using the guitar controller's whammy bar continuously for a length of time. These allow the player to select any song to complete, with some songs potentially being better suited for completing that challenge. The progress towards these Challenges is shown in-game by a record meter that appears when the challenge is active, and fills up similarly to the overall scoring meter as the player successfully completes towards the challenge. Higher completion levels, particularly Diamond, may only be possible by playing the Expert difficulty of a song, but players can take advantage of the mid-song difficulty adjustment feature to complete these if needed. All players are awarded for completing a challenge if one of the members is able to do so, and will be reflected in the individual players' career progress. in addition, players can unlock new avatars, outfits, and other content by completing challenges. The rewards of the challenges are used to replace the previous in-game money reward in previous Guitar Hero games. However, the PlayStation 2 version does not include this challenge feature. Rather than doing the challenges to unlock avatars/content, all one must do is complete the gig by successfully completing all songs. Not all gigs have content to unlock, rather just those to which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar). === Music studio === The Music Studio feature, which allows players to create their own songs and distribute them through the \\"GHTunes\\" music service, has been improved. The GHMix2.0 mode allows one to precisely create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still be removed from the service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature. === Characters and customization === After three years of negotiations, Kurt Cobain is a playable character in Guitar Hero 5. Avatars of famous musicians are part of the game, performing for songs by that artist and available as unlockable characters. Notably, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana is a playable avatar; Activision had sought to gain permission to use Cobain's image for the game for three years, including obtaining the necessary agreements with Courtney Love, who controls Cobain's estate, and Dave Grohl and Universal Publishing, who control Nirvana's catalog. Cobain's avatar was designed with input from Love, who provided photos and videos for the design team to use, and emphasized how she would like Cobain to appear, starting from his appearance in \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and modifying it from there. The avatar includes the T-shirt design based on Daniel Johnston's \\"Frog\\" that Cobain had popularized. Johnny Cash is also a playable character, with tribute artist Terry Lee Goffee helping to provide motion capture for his character. Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson (of Garbage), and Matthew Bellamy (of Muse) are also playable avatars, all of whom performed motion capture for their own avatars. There are also unlockable fictional characters like Skeleton, Golden God, Shadow, Frankenrocker, and Gerald Contest Winner. Though Activision approached Jon Bon Jovi to appear in the game, Bon Jovi turned down the offer. While the standard character creator is available for all versions of the game, the Xbox 360 version allows players to import their Xbox Live Avatar into the game, while the Freestyle mode on the Wii version of the game allows use of the players' Miis in the game. Nine of the characters from previous installments return in this game. They all have a costume that they start with and 3 more can be unlocked by completing challenges. Doing this will unlock also new pieces of clothing for the costume to use for user generated rockers. Also, while Gibson no longer sponsors the game, other guitar manufacturers, like Ibanez, ESP, Paul Reed Smith and Schecter, lent the likenesses of their instruments, allowing for new combinations on assembling custom guitars and basses. For the first time, also, sponsored clothing pieces can be used in customization (these being shoes from Vans, Dr. Martens and Converse) There is no money in the game leaving everything available to use, including unlockables. Instruments can also be unlocked to use. Also some clothing now can be changed in style. There are four styles for each; the one shown, two others that were separate items in previous games (with exceptions), and one new one (with exceptions). Pregenerated characters outfits can only be changed and users can only decide which outfit they wear. However they can still edit their instruments. Virtual avatars of the real life rockers can also not be changed in any way, including instruments. === Console-specific variations === The Wii version of the game, developed by Vicarious Visions, is \\"full feature parity\\" with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, including support for up to eight players online, each possibly on their own console. Guitar Hero 5 is the first Wii game to support high capacity SD cards, allowing up to about 800 songs to be stored on a 32 GB card. While existing Wii Guitar Hero games allow players to purchase downloadable content one song at a time, Guitar Hero 5 includes the ability to download complete albums and song packs. Players are also able to manage the content of their Wii memory cards through the game's interface. The game does not require players to enter game-specific Friends Codes, but instead uses the global Wii address book to locate friends. The \\"Mii Freestyle\\" mode, introduced in World Tour, is also present, and with changes to address some of the issues with less-skilled players trying to play well together. A \\"Guitar Hero Nintendo Ecosystem\\" is introduced in Guitar Hero 5, letting the Wii version communicate with the Nintendo DS, including a stage manager/video editor DS controller feature in conjunction with the Mii Freestyle mode, and a new game mode called \\"Roadie Battle\\". In Roadie Battle, four players play as two teams; each team has one player performing on an instrument through the Wii, while the other player uses a DS to connect to the Wii and act as the roadie. During play, the roadie players attempt to sabotage the other team by completing mini-games on the DS that affect the other team's music performance in a manner similar to Guitar Hero III's Battle Mode. These can only be cleared by the other DS player performing another mini-game. The PlayStation 2 version of the game, developed by Budcat Creations, features less functionality in comparison to other versions. Besides lacking online play or downloadable content, the game does not include drop-in/drop-out play, multiplayer \\"RockFest\\", nor song challenges. A multitap cannot be used to expand the number of controller ports, limiting the game to two guitars, one drum set and one microphone. == Development == Four player gameplay where all four are playing the same instrument on three different difficulties. The fifth main entry to the Guitar Hero series was announced in December 2008, with confirmation of its release by the end of 2009 coming in May 2009, along with the announcement of other new Guitar Hero titles. Some industry analysts questioned whether the proliferation of Guitar Hero games would soon glut the market.https://www.nbcnews.com/id/30754014/ns/technology_and_science- games/t/how-much-guitar-hero-too-much/#.WIkgtbGZNPO Guitar Hero spokesman Eric Hollreiser said consumer research showed continued strong demand for the various versions. The Party Play mode was inspired by recognizing that past Guitar Hero games made it difficult to jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. This aspect of the game was then brought to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible. A new guitar controller was developed for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions has not yet been determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games. === Promotion === As part of the game's early promotion, a scavenger hunt contest was announced in the last week of May 2009. Players would need to search for articles on specific game- related sites to find information on the bands that are to be in Guitar Hero 5, and then enter those bands at the game's official website for a chance to win a series of concert tickets in their area. Through this promotion, a large number of artists in the final track list were revealed. A viral video in late July 2009 announced the last handful of songs for the game features four naked women walking down a public street, with black censor bars used to cover their bodies but also used to announce the song names. The video attracted the anger of Bill O'Reilly, calling the video \\"shameless\\" and the models as \\"pinheads\\". For the month of September 2009, players in the US that purchase Guitar Hero 5 would be able to redeem a code with the game to receive a free copy of Guitar Hero: Van Halen prior to its retail release with the packaging's offer sticker (printable if lost), a copy of the receipt and a barcode received upon registration. Also in the UK, when pre-ordering Guitar Hero 5 on various websites you would receive a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour when requested. A television commercial was filmed at the Playboy Mansion and was featured in the 29 November 2009 episode of The Girls Next Door. == Soundtrack == Guitar Hero 5 features 85 songs by 83 different artists. Tracks from 30 artists represent their \\"music-rhythm video game debut\\". Brian Bright, project director for the game, has called the track list \\"fresh\\", with 25% of the songs released in the last 18 months, and more than 50% from the current decade. Unlike previous versions of the Guitar Hero series, where players must work through a career mode to unlock all the songs in the game, all songs in Guitar Hero 5 are unlocked and available to play in any mode from the start, Bright noted that previously, while \\"Under Pressure\\" by Queen and David Bowie was always a song they wanted in Guitar Hero, they could not find the masters for it. However, for Guitar Hero 5, the masters have since \\"magically appeared\\" and are part of the game's track list. For Nirvana's \\"Lithium\\", the master recordings did not have the appropriate tracks to build the note track from, and they opted to use the live version of the song from the 1992 Reading Festival, notably famous for Cobain appearing on a wheelchair at first amid rumors of his failing health, but shown to be a ruse as Cobain took the stage and celebrated the recent birth of his daughter Frances Bean. The song \\"You and Me\\" by Attack! Attack! was a result of the band winning a competition to be included in the game. In addition to on-disc songs, Guitar Hero 5 is the first game in the series to reuse content from previous games. All but 6 (the Jimi Hendrix songs) of the 158 World Tour downloadable content songs can be imported into Guitar Hero 5 at no cost. Additionally, 35 songs from World Tour, 21 songs from Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and 61 songs from Band Hero can be imported into the game after paying a small transferring fee; more songs from these games may be made available to Guitar Hero 5 at a later date (including World Tour tracks.) The importing process for World Tour and Smash Hits content requires downloading of the content, as these tracks have been recreated with support for Guitar Hero 5's new gameplay features such as Band Moments. All such imported songs are also playable in Band Hero. Sixty-nine of the Guitar Hero 5 tracks can be imported into Band Hero. In addition, 39 of the tracks from Guitar Hero: Metallica are importable into Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero. Since the September 2010 release of the sequel Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, no additional songs have been made available for DLC and it is unlikely any additional songs will ever be offered for Guitar Hero 5. == Reception == Guitar Hero 5 was well received upon release. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times called Guitar Hero 5 \\"the most enjoyable Guitar Hero game in several years\\" and \\"generally well-tuned, often exhilarating rock ’n’ roll experience\\". Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer commented that there is \\"just nothing wrong\\" with Guitar Hero 5, given the various stumbling blocks the developers had made from previous iterations of the game, and the way the developers have continued to find new additions to the game. Reviewers greatly appreciated the new features in the game to make it easier to jump in and play music, from the simplification of the menu system to the availability of every song in all the game modes from the start. Erik Brudvig of IGN considers the menu change to be \\"one of the best things that Neversoft has done\\", although the menus are a minor part of the game, it removes much of the frustration with the World Tour and other previous Guitar Hero games' menu systems. Arthur Gies of GameSpy noted that by simplification of the interface, \\"Neversoft stripped Guitar Hero down to what works and built up from there\\". Reviewers appreciated the immediate launch of the game's Party Mode once the player put the disk in the system and the ability to jump right into that song through the new menus, and considered this to help make the game enjoyable for social gatherings. Chris Watters of GameSpot considered this mode to be \\"accessible, welcoming, and delightfully low key\\". The changes in Career mode, in which the players need not stick to the same instrument or difficulty throughout, was well appreciated. Brudvig appreciated how this allows the player to complete the Career mode without getting stuck on a song, having to go back to replay the Career mode on other instruments, and that with the addition of song Challenges, provides enough incentive to return to the songs to improve one's performance. The new multiplayer modes in Rockfest, which replaced more \\"arcadey\\" competitive modes, were considered a welcome replacement, as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other, making the game more friendly to the multiplayer experience. However, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer noted that despite the various RockFest modes, it \\"all comes down to hitting the notes correctly\\". The track list, while well received for the most part, was found to be one of the weaker features. While Helgeson and others noted that the track list was \\"extremely diverse and for the most part well selected\\", this diversity was found to work against the game as well. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com noted that with the diverse track list, there would be a good chance players would find songs they liked, but at the same time, would also find songs they loathed. Brudvig noted that while \\"the goal was to include a bit of everything\\", the diversity of the track list ensures \\"that nobody will like everything on the disc\\". Gies noted that while the guitar difficulty progression in the Career mode was strong and better than in previous games, it leaves the vocals and drummer progression \\"all over the place\\", while Schiesel considered the vocals parts \\"somewhat rough\\" in comparison to The Beatles: Rock Band. Haywald noted that the singing portions of the game were still weak, with poor indicators to help the player's performance, and with the possibility of multiple vocalists performing at the same time, would make it hard for a player to keep track of his pitch. While reviews appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, the small number of tracks that were available at launch felt at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process prior to the game's release. The improvements made in GHTunes were seen as \\"leaps and bounds\\" above the original offering in World Tour, though was still considered to be too unwieldy for average players. On its week of release in the United Kingdom, Guitar Hero 5 was the most purchased title across all game systems, beating The Beatles: Rock Band which was also released during that same week in the country. United States sales of Guitar Hero 5 for the Xbox 360 reached 210,800 units on its first month of release, making it the 9th best selling title for the month, and 499,000 units total across all platforms were sold, comparable to World Tour's first month sales of 534,000 units. The total revenue for United States sales in September 2009 was $33 million, driving primarily by sales of the standalone copy of the game. The game sold just under 1 million copies worldwide by the end of 2009. Guitar Hero 5 has been nominated for the \\"Best Family Game\\" Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. === Kurt Cobain controversy === The inclusion of Kurt Cobain as a playable character in the game has been considered a \\"strange concept\\" by some reviewers, reflecting on the possible influence of commercialization pressures that played into Cobain's suicide. Shortly after the game's release, it was discovered that once players unlocked the Kurt Cobain Character Pack (as well as that for any other of the included famous musicians), they could use that character for any other song on disc, leading to what some have considered to be awkward virtual performances of Cobain singing songs from completely different genres; user-created videos of these performances that had attracted the attention to this issue have since been removed from video-sharing sites like YouTube by Activision. Previous games in the series that feature known musicians also allow for the use of their characters, once unlocked, in other songs, except for the case of Jimi Hendrix in Guitar Hero World Tour, the only posthumous artist to appear in the series prior to Guitar Hero 5. Some have seen this as a scar on Cobain's legacy; Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb commented that \\"it's the near-mythic legacy he left behind and the way the Nirvana catalog has been protected from commercial interests over the years that makes this stuff so harsh\\" on his observation of such performances. Tim Walker of The Independent contrasted Cobain's \\"posthumous humiliation\\" to the appearance of virtual characters based on living artists that have appeared in rhythm music games, noting that deceased artists do not have the same fair consideration as live artists that can opt to license their images for such rhythm games. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times countered these arguments, noting that as long as no legal contracts were broken, Cobain and the other artists in the game \\"are too big and too important to be damaged in a cultural sense by mere inclusion in a video game\\". On her Twitter account, Courtney Love expressed her anger at Cobain's representation in the game and threatened legal action alongside other companies that represent Cobain's intellectual property. Love further stated that she received no monetary arrangements for Cobain's appearance, in response to comments that believe Love had \\"sold out\\" to Activision and from a statement by Activision CEO Dan Rosensweig claiming that the Cobain estate has \\"cashed the cheque\\". Both Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic have made statements disapproving the inclusion of Cobain as an unlockable character in the game and have requested that he be locked to only Nirvana songs, and Jon Bon Jovi, who had denied Activision's offer to include him in the game, supports their concerns about having his image be used to sing other artists' songs. In response to these statements, Activision claims it had secured all the proper publication rights for Cobain's image for the game. However, according to attorneys for Love, the contract was not meant to allow Activision to \\"denigrate his image\\". Joystiq noted that the crux of the legal issues revolve around the \\"right of personality\\", which is defined at the state level within the United States; these rights are presently held by Love due to her ownership of Cobain's estate, but may have been overridden in the contract with Activision. Band Hero suffered a similar issue, as the group No Doubt, avatars in that game, filed a lawsuit against Activision due to having their avatars be usable to play or sing any song in the game. Love stated to the magazine NME that she will be joining No Doubt in their lawsuit against Activision. == Notes  References  External links == * Category:2009 video games Category:Activision games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Drumming video games 05 Category:Guitar video games Category:Karaoke video games Category:Cultural depictions of Kurt Cobain Category:Music video games Category:Musician video games Category:Neversoft games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Rock music mass media Category:Wii games Category:Wii Wi-Fi games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Motion capture in video games ","title":"Guitar Hero 5"},{"id":"20537037","text":"Kate Fleetwood (born 24 September 1972) is an English actress.

Rudolph Bergh (15 October 1824 – 20 July 1909), full name Ludvig Sophus Rudolph Bergh, was a Danish physician and malacologist. He worked in Copenhagen. As a doctor his speciality was sexually transmitted diseases. In Copenhagen a hospital and a street are named after him. Bergh was also an active malacologist, i.e. a zoologist who studies molluscs, in particular the nudibranchs, shell-less marine gastropods. He had well over 90 publications in this field and took part in a scientific expedition to Indonesia. He named and described numerous species of nudibranchs. == Biography == Rudolph Bergh was born in Copenhagen. His father was the son of the chief physician in the army of Louis Anton Berg. His mother was Anne Sophie Kirstine (maiden name Pedersen). Bergh graduated from the Det von Westenske Institut in 1842, and received his medical degree in 1849. Dr. Rudolph Bergh became an attending physician at what was then Almindeligt Hospital, the general hospital in Amaliegade, Copenhagen, in 1863. He worked in the department of skin diseases and venereal diseases. In 1886, he moved from there to Vestre Hospital, where he worked until 1903. Bergh died in 1909. One year after his death, Vestre Hospital was renamed Rudolph Bergh Hospital in honor of his memory. Zachariae H. (2007). \\"Sophus Engelsted og Rudolph Bergh\\". Ugeskrift for Læger 169(35): 2864. PDF At that hospital, anyone who wished to could be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, and get advice on safe sex and birth control without any change and while retaining their anonymity. In 2000, some of these functions were transferred to Bispebjerg Hospital. There is a bust of Bergh in Copenhagen, in front of the eponymous \\"Rudolph Bergh's Hospital\\", on Tietgensgade.Dr Rudolph Bergh (1824-1909), accessed 4 December 2008. The bust was a gift from his colleagues and stood for years in his home. After his death Bergh's widow donated it to the hospital. Bergh was awarded a knighthood of the Third Class Order (Ridder af Dannebrog) of Order of the Dannebrog and also the Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn (Cross of Honour of the Order of the Dannebrog). In Copenhagen there is a street named in honor of him: Rudolph Berghs Gade (in English: Rudolph Bergh's Street) in Ydre Østerbro. His son Rudolph Sophus Bergh (September 22, 1859 - December 7, 1924) was a zoologist and a composer. ==As a physician== His medical specialization was sexually transmitted diseases. Among the many texts that Rudolph Bergh wrote was About Tattoos in the public woman, which was published in the Hospital Journal in 1891. The work is about connections between prostitution, crime and tattoos. The article seems antiquated today and should not be taken as the sole expression of Rudolph Bergh great efforts to improve public health and in particular reduce the harmful effects of sexually transmitted diseases. Bergh was also one of the editors of the hospital magazine Hospitalstidende, where he published nearly all of his over 50 medical articles.Schlesch H. (1946). \\"Rudolph Bergh\\".

Copenhagen. ==As a zoologist== Bergh started to study molluscs when he was nearly 30, probably under the influence of Japetus Steenstrup, a Danish biologist who was 11 years older than he was and who was a professor of zoology at the University of Copenhagen. He wrote reports of the Challenger expedition (1884) and the Albatross expedition (1894). He took part in the examination of species that were collected during the \\"Siboga Expedition\\".Michael D. Miller. 1999. Nudi branch of the Week is Phyllodesmium longicirra. The Slug Site, accessed 4 December 2008. Bergh became the world's leading expert on nudibranchs. He wrote his main malacological works as well as over 90 malacological articles and papers. Among other notable works are his work about the anatomy of the radula of the genus Conus (1896).Dall W. H. (October 1909). \\"Ludwig Rudolph Sophus Bergh\\". The Nautilus 23(5): 72. His malacological drawing are considered to be \\"excellent\\". He was mainly anatomist and reached great progress in systematics based on anatomy of nervous system and of reproductive system of gastropods. Bergh was very active in naming and describing species of nudibranchs and other sea slugs. The species he named include: * Armina semperi (Bergh, 1861) * Chromodoris annae Bergh, 1877 * Chromodoris dalli (Bergh, 1879) * Chromodoris elisabethina (Bergh, 1877) * Chromodoris morchii Bergh, 1879 * Chromodoris punctilucens Bergh, 1890 * Thuridilla lineolata Bergh, 1905 * Phyllodesmium briareum (Bergh, 1896) * Phyllodesmium longicirrum (Bergh, 1905) The nudibranch genus Berghia was named after him by Salvatore Trinchese in 1877.

Appunti dalle lezioni di fisiologia umana. La Goliardica Pavese, Pavia, 1992. is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).Interpreting spirometry . gp-training.net The result of this ratio is expressed as FEV1%. Normal values are approximately 75%. Predicted normal values can be calculated online and depend on age, sex, height, and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based upon. A derived value of FEV1% is FEV1% predicted, which is defined as FEV1% of the patient divided by the average FEV1% in the population for any person of similar age, sex, and body composition. == Disease states == In obstructive lung disease, the FEV1 is reduced due to an obstruction of air escaping from the lungs. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio will be reduced. More specifically, according to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the diagnosis of COPD is made when the FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.7 orChronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults in primary and secondary care (partial update).

June 2010 the FEV1 is less than 75% of predicted;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults in primary and secondary care (partial update).

The Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease criteria also require that values are after bronchodilator medication has been given to make the diagnosis. According to the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria, it is FEV1% predicted that defines when a patient has COPD—that is, when the patient's FEV1% is less than 88% of the predicted value for men, or less than 89% for women. In restrictive lung disease, the FEV1 and FVC are equally reduced due to fibrosis or other lung pathology (not obstructive pathology). Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio should be approximately normal, or even increased due to a decrease in magnitude of FVC as compared to FEV1 (because of the decreased compliance associated with the presence of fibrosis in some pathological conditions). == References == Category:Respiratory physiology ","title":"FEV1/FVC ratio"},{"id":"20537091","text":"Ole Landmark functionalist/art deco Forum Kino in Bergen Ole Landmark (June 15, 1885 – February 7, 1970) was a Norwegian architect.

He attended the Trondheim Cathedral School and was educated at the Trondhjems Tekniske Læreanstalt, a predecessor of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He also made several trips to study abroad, including to Sweden, Germany and France. He was employed as an assistant for architects Schak Bull and Einar Oscar Schou. He established his own practice in Bergen in 1910. Landmark let himself be inspired by a diverse set of architectural styles throughout his career, including roccoco, Empire style and functionalism. He designed a number of monumental buildings in Bergen, particularly during the period 1925-1940. Among his main works are the gallery building for the Rasmus Meyer Collection (Rasmus Meyers Samlinger). Other notable works include the Forum Kino at Kronstad and Bergen Kunsthall at Lille Lungegårdsvann in the center of Bergen.

At the 2016 census, Nurcoung recorded a population of 40. ==Nurcoung State School== Nurcoung State School was a state school located in the Parish of Nurcoung. The school officially opened on 11 September 1886 to serve the educational needs of children belonging to the new selectors on Spring Hill Station. The surveyed site of the school was in the centre of the Parish of Nurcoung being approximately 37 miles west of Horsham and 12 miles northwest of Mount Arapiles. According to an official record, the first head teacher was Miss M. Manckton. Before the Nurcoung State School was built, the teachers and students used an old farmhouse of Thomas Sheriff. The school obtained desks from a closed school at Booroopki, west of Goroke. When the Nurcoung school closed down, the building was taken to Goroke P-12 College to be used as a classroom. ==References== * Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) Category:Wimmera Category:Educational institutions established in 1886 Category:Defunct schools in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Nurcoung, Victoria"},{"id":"20537120","text":"Acatlán is a town and municipality located in the Mexican state of Hidalgo, about ten km northwest of the city of Tulancingo and 147 km from Mexico City. The main landmark is the San Miguel monastery which was built in the 16th century. It is partially in ruins but there have been efforts since the 1980s to restore it. Acatlán comes from a Nahuatl phrase which means “near the reeds”. ==History== Before the arrival of the Spanish, this area was part of an Aztec tributary province. After the Conquest, it became part of the encomienda controlled b D. Pedro de Paz, which encompassed the area of what is now the municipalities of Atotonilco, Huasca de Ocampo and Acatlán. Later in the colonial period, it became part of an “Indian Republic,” meaning the Otomi and Mexicas here had some amount of autonomy from Spanish rule. The town's founding is dated as 1518, but the first records in which the town appears dates to 1564, when governor Domingo de Alvardo has a color map drawn. The monastery was built by the Augustinians in between 1544 and 1569 and dedicated to the Archangel Michael. The town would take on “San Miguel” as a prefix late into the 18th century. It is not known who exactly built it as the earliest surviving record is a registry of marriages from 1569. Other records from this time indicate that it was in operation with three monks in residence, including one who could speak both Nahuatl and Otomi. The monastery was turned over to regular clergy in 1745, becoming the parish of the community under Father Miguel Echeverría. Originally it was under the jurisdiction of Mexico City but became part of the Tulancingo archdiocese in 1864. At the end of the 16th century, the encomiendas were broken up into the hacienda system, with the Totopa, Mixquiapan, Zupitlán, Tpenacasco and Cacaloapan located in what is now the municipality. In the middle of the 18th century, natives of the area struggled against María Dolores Romero de Terreros over lands that were annexed to the San Juan Hueyapan Hacienda in Huasca. These and other problems with the landed elite cause most of the populace here to side with the insurgents during the Mexican War of Independence in the early 19th century, recruiting a number of soldiers here after Nicolás Bravo occupied nearly Tulancingo. The town was temporarily occupied by forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza during the Mexican Revolution, using the monastery as a barracks. The municipality was created in 1869. The church and monastery complex area is undergoing restoration work, which were begun by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia in 1988. ==The town== View of the church and former monastery The town itself straddles the Huasca-Tulancingo road and serves as a commerce center for the surrounding rural Tulancingo Valley. The town center has municipality's main public buildings, including the area's only library, the Biblioteca Pública Municipal Profra. Matilde Sánchez Soto . The main structure is the San Miguel Monastery, which was one of the largest built by the Augustinians in the 16th century in Hidalgo. The complex is partially in ruins although there have been efforts starting from the 1980s to restore it. The facade has flat belfry with four slots for bells. Both the facade and the cloister are nearly devoid of decoration, with traces of the original painted decoration in the cloister and open chapel. It conserves three of its four “capillas posas” or chapels on each of the corners of the large atrium. In the middle of this atrium is a large stone cross. The town hosts the Expo-Acatlán at the end of September, which features dairy products and crafts as well as rides, cultural events and other attractions. The feast in honor of the Archangel Michael is held from the 20-29 of September, with religious events, traditional dances and other activities. At these and other events, are traditional foods such as cueritos (pig skin in chili pepper sauce) and varieties of pulque. ==The municipality== Silos in Acatlán As the municipal seat, the town of Acatlán is the governing authority for about sixty five other communities (inegi) which cover an area of 174.70km2. However, as of 2005, only 418 out of the total municipal population of 17914 lives in the town proper (inegi). The municipality borders the municipalities of Huasca de Ocampo, Agua Blanca de Iturbide, Metepec, Tulancingo de Bravo and Singuilucan. The town and municipality are located in the Tulancingo Valley. Notable elevations include the Cerro la Providencia and Cerro Prieto. Other elevations are located near the municipality's borders with Huasca and Tulancingo. It is located in the Moctezuma River basin with rivers and streams such as the Grande Tulancingo, Los Enlamaderos, Las Vegas, El Meco and Salto de Alcholoya. Depending on elevation, the climate ranges from temperate and semi-arid (70% of the territory) to temperate and semi-humid, with rains mostly in the summer and early autumn. Average annual temperature is 14C. Most of the vegetation is adapted to dry conditions and includes grasses, cactus, palm trees and mesquites. In higher elevations, some broadleaf trees can be found. Wildlife mostly consists of small mammals such as squirrels, opossums, foxes and others. Bird species include eagles, owls and buzzards and reptiles include rattlesnakes and chameleons. The major natural attraction of the area is the Alcholoya Canyon which contains a waterfall. Other landmarks in the area include Supitlán Lake, the San Pablo thermal springs, which are reputed to have healing capabilities, Cerro del Yolo Mountain, the Santa Elena Dam the former haciendas of Totoapa and Tepaenacascasco, now known as the Rancho Alicia. The Hacienda El Lucero is known for its restaurant which serves exotic dishes such as crocodile ceviche, Sinaloa style, filets of wild boar and ostrich and dishes made with deer, buffalo and other meats. ==Economy== The municipality is poor with agriculture, both commercial and sustenance, being the basis of the economy. Between half to two-thirds of the population farms, either full or part-time, with just over half earning minimum wage and 28% receiving no monetary income at all. While much of the agriculture is mechanized, due to the relative flatness of the land, animal pulled plows can still be found here. Main crops include corn, beans, barley and maguey for pulque. Two-thirds of the municipality's land is cultivated, with the most valuable crops being hay and barley grain. About two-thirds of agriculture is dependent on the rainy season with the rest on irrigation. Much of the rest of the territory is used as pasture, especially for goats. Other domesticated animals include turkeys, chickens, sheep, cows, pigs and horses. Industry is mostly limited to wood products, dairy products and the mining of kaolinite and some other industrial minerals. There is an asbestos production facility in Alcholoya. Commerce is limited to serving local needs. ==Education== The municipality has kindergartens and primary schools, with middle school education available through “telesecundarias,” sites where lessons are delivered via media from other places. Less than 17% of the population finishes middle school. Those seeking further education must go to Tulancingo or Pachuca. The illiteracy rate is 26.5% although this number is slowly diminishing. The major issue for education is that there are too few schools and many people do not have the resources to travel to school. There are almost no speakers of indigenous languages, but there is a primary school targeted to the indigenous. ==References== Category:Municipalities of Hidalgo (state) Category:Populated places in Hidalgo (state) Category:Populated places established in 1518 ","title":"Acatlán, Hidalgo"},{"id":"20537137","text":"Aranucidae is a family of sea slugs, nudibranchs, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Tritonioidea. == Taxonomy == This family is within the clade Cladobranchia (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).

Pp. 538–541. . ==Bradford Clay== Bradford Clay in geology, is a thin, rather inconstant bed of clay or marl situated in England at the base of the Forest Marble, the two together constituting the Bradfordian group in the Bathonian series of Jurassic rocks. The term \\"Bradford Clay\\" appears to have been first used by J. de. C. Sowerby in 1823 as an alternative for W. Smith's \\"Clay on Upper Oolite\\". The clay came into notice late in the 18th century on account of the local abundance of the crinoid Apiocrinus Parkinsoni. It takes its name from Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire, whence it is traceable southward to the Dorset coast and northward towards Cirencester. It may be regarded as a local phase of the basement beds of the Forest Marble, from which it cannot be separated upon either stratigraphical or paleontological grounds. It is seldom more than 10 feet thick, and it contains, as a rule, a few irregular layers of limestone and calcareous sandstone. The lowest layer is often highly fossiliferous; some of the common forms being Arca minuta, Ostrea gregaria, Waldheimia digona, Terebratula coarctata and Cidaris bradfordensis. This cites H. B. Woodward, \\"Jurassic Rocks of Britain,\\" Mem. Geol. Survey, vol. iv. (1904). == Lithology == The primary lithology of the formation typically consists of greenish grey silicate mudstone, with lenticular cross bedded limestone units deposited in a marine setting. ==Dinosaurian faunaOrnithischians=== {  align=\\"center\\" width=\\"100%\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" align=\\"center\\" Ornithischians of the Forest Marble Formation - !

The House was founded by Victor Canard and Léonie Duchêne, who gave their names to the champagne house. Majestic Wines Blog Oddbins ==History== In 1860, a barrel-maker called Victor Canard met a winemaker called Léonie Duchêne. They fell madly in love and got married. They both shared a great passion for wine and so they worked collaboratively to produce their own unique Champagne. Using Victor's skills in farming grapes and ageing wines in barrels and Léonie's expertise in wine-tasting and viniculture, they produced a Champagne only 8 years after they met. Leonie was able to work in the wine industry during a time when the role of women was largely consigned to household duties. Both Victor and Léonie put their surnames together to create Canard-Duchêne. It is still one of the few wineries in Champagne to be family-run. During the tumultuous aftermath of the French Revolution, Canard- Duchêne still managed to appeal to the citizens of France who abhorred any symbols of aristocracy. This was probably because Canard-Duchêne never had large profit margins, unlike other houses such as Laurent-Perrier, and Moët & Chandon. It was also due to the lucky fact that Napoleon loved drinking Champagne. Indeed, it was just after the French Revolution that the art of sabrage (opening a Champagne bottle with a sword) was invented and developed. Canard-Duchêne has always been well-associated with this noble yet fun art form and holds tournaments where sommeliers compete in the art of sabrage. In 1890, Victor and Léonie's son Edmond brought international fame to the Champagne House. He even penetrated the very close circle of the suppliers to the Court of Tsar Nicolas II of Russia. After Edmond secured a contract to be the official supplier of Champagne to the Romanov king, Canard-Duchêne adopted the Russian Imperial coat of arms as part of its logo, the two-headed eagle. The symbol of the two-headed eagle is itself steeped in history: it is one of the oldest symbols of the duality of power of the emperor over both the state and the church, dating right back to the Byzantine period. Photo of Tsar Nicholas II and King George V in Berlin, 1913 In 1978, Canard-Duchêne was associated with Veuve Clicquot and then joined the LVMH Group, which transmitted its rigour and search for quality. Subsequently, the House saw substantial growth on European markets. The takeover by the independent Champagne group Thiénot occurred in October 2003. ==Champagnes== Canard- Duchêne produces a diverse range of champagnes. ===Canard-Duchêne Brut Non- Vintage Champagne=== The Authentic Brut Non-Vintage epitomises the Canard- Duchêne style, where freshness and intensity unite nobility and nature. It is made from a blend of 60 different Cru wines, and the blend of grapes is made up of 45% Pinot Noir, 35% Pinot Meunier and 20% Chardonnay. Reserve wines from several years make up at least 20% of the blend in order to give a consistent style year after year. Canard-Duchêne Authentic Brut is characterised by its straw-yellow appearance and delicate mousse. Intense aromas of fresh fruit can be detected on the nose, typical of the Pinot grape varietals. On the palate, fruit aromas intermingle with pastry notes, a sign of excellent maturity. The Canard-Duchêne Authentic Brut can be enjoyed with light foods, and particularly as an aperitif. ===Canard-Duchêne Brut Non-Vintage Rosé Champagne=== Delicate and feminine, the Canard-Duchêne Authentic Rosé reveals its distinctly elegant style. Canard-Duchêne Authentic Rosé is a blend of 50% Pinot noir, 20% Pinot Meunier and 30% Chardonnay. The reserve wines, particularly red wines crafted from Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims, make up at least 10% of the blend in order to give a consistent style year after year. With its delicate, pinkish hue and magnificent, pearlised ribbon, the Canard-Duchêne Authentic Rosé stands out for its intense, fresh fruit aromas of strawberries and raspberries against a backdrop of mineral notes for enhanced freshness. This rosé is delightful as an aperitif, can be enjoyed at parties or to accompany delicately-sweet desserts. ===Grande Cuvée Charles VII NV Champagne=== Charles VII was launched in 1968 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Canard-Duchêne. The original name refers to the king who was led by Joan of Arc to be crowned in the Reims Cathedral in 1429. The Charles VII champagnes offer great finesse and a subtle elegance, the expression of the know-how of Canard-Duchêne. From the very beginning, the concept of the Grande Cuvée Charles VII has remained unchanged: a selection from among Champagne's most prestigious crus, a blend of several exceptional vintages that perpetuates the House's distinctive style: Fruity, elegant and versatile. ==Environment== Unlike most major Champagne houses which are situated near the town, Canard-Duchêne is firmly established in the countryside of Ludes. They aim for harmony between the buildings, the gardens and the Montagne de Reims National Park. For the last 20 years Canard-Duchêne has made a commitment to sustainable agriculture and environmentally friendly production techniques. The House recently launched an 'Authentic Green' initiative wherein they produced a Champagne made solely from organically-grown grapes. According to the Canard-Duchêne website, \\"No words can express Canard-Duchêne's commitment to authentic organic principles better than its own hallmark 'Naturellement Noble'. 'Naturellement' contains the word 'Nature' which suggests love, respect and protection of Nature. 'Noble' conveys a feeling of greatness, generosity and responsibility\\". ==Awards== Canard-Duchêne wines consistently obtain awards across the board for the Champagnes they produce. Below is a summary of the awards some of their Champagnes won in 2012: Canard-Duchêne Brut Non-Vintage Champagne * 'Bronze' in the Decanter World Wine Awards * 'Silver' in the International Wine & Spirit Competition * 'Bronze' in the International Wine Challenge * Given 14/20 by Jancis Robinson, wine expert.

Mora worked in watercolor, oils and tempera. He produced drawings in pen and ink, and graphite; and etchings and monotypes. He is known for his paintings and drawings depicting American life in the early 20th century; Spanish life and society; historical and allegorical subjects; with murals, easel painting and illustrations. He also was a popular art instructor. == Early years and education == F. Luis Mora was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, to Domingo Mora, a noted sculptor from Catalonia, and Laura Gaillard, a cultured French woman originally from the Bordeaux region of France. Laura Gaillard Mora had two sisters, Ernestina and Gabriella, who married into the Bacardi family, famous for its rum. Mora was close to the Bacardi family all of his life.Biography. fluismora.org. Retrieved 6 Feb. 2009. He had a younger brother, Joseph Jacinto \\"Jo\\" Mora, who would go on to become a noted sculptor, photographer and author in California. The Moras left Uruguay during an insurgency in 1877, when they went to Catalonia. In 1880, they arrived in New York City, and quickly relocated to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Domingo Mora accepted a position with the A.H. White Terra Cotta Company, which was renamed The Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company. The family would later relocate to Allston, Massachusetts (near Boston), where Domingo Mora had sculpture commissions. Mora graduated from Allston High School, and stated in a later interview that he remembered the school fondly. During the Economic Crash of 1893, they all went back to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which remained Mora's home base all of his life. While he was a child, Mora's father oversaw his early education in the arts, and young Luis produced hundreds of drawings and watercolors. He was a precocious young artist, drawing historical scenes and scenes of his contemporary environs. At the age of fifteen Mora enrolled in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he studied under the American Impressionists Edmund Charles Tarbell and Frank Weston Benson. In 1892, Mora went on to complete his education at the Art Students League of New York, studying with Henry Siddons Mowbray. By 1892, he was also receiving commissions for illustrations in popular magazines of the era. His formal art education was complete in 1893, when he was just 19 years old. In 1896 when he was 22 years old, Mora traveled to Europe with his mother, his third trip to Europe. The two visited family in Barcelona and then headed to Madrid, where Mora coincidentally saw William Merritt Chase in the Museo del Prado. It was there, alongside Chase, that Mora became inspired by the art of Diego Velázquez and other Spanish Old Masters. Over the course of many visits to the Prado, Mora practiced and refined his technique by painting copies of Velasquez's works.Boone, Mary Elizabeth. Vistas De España: American Views of Art and Life in Spain, 1860–1914. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007. Google Books. Retrieved 1 Dec. 2008. p. 192 In 1900, Mora married the daughter of the mayor of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, Sophia (\\"Sonia\\") Brown Compton, who was his childhood sweetheart. She encouraged his easel painting, and he set forth on a successful career. == Professional career == Out of Town Trolley (1916) Subway riders in NYC In 1904 Mora was voted an Associate member of the National Academy of Design, and was elected a full member in 1906, probably its first Hispanic member. He was also voted as a member to 15 other art societies. Mora won numerous medals and awards within the New York artistic community, including the Rothschild Prize, the Carnegie Prize, the Shaw Purchase Prize at the Salmagundi Club; and in 1915 he won a gold medal at the Panama Pacific International Exhibition in San Francisco. Mora taught illustration and life classes at both William Merritt Chase's Chase School of Art (renamed the New York School of Art in 1898, later to become Parsons) and the Art Students League. Among his students was Georgia O'Keeffe, who studied with him between 1907 and 1908;Eldredge, Charles C, Georgia O'Keeffe, Hayward Hayward, and Yokohama Yokohama.

During this time Mora also embarked upon a successful and prolific career as an illustrator, producing work for several books and publications, including Harper's Weekly, Scribner's, The Century, Collier's, Sunday Magazine, and Ladies' Home Journal. Additionally, during World War I Mora was one of several illustrators who volunteered to create motivational World War I posters for the Third and Fourth Liberty Loan Boards, U.S. Committee on Public Information.Gallatin, Albert Eugene. Art and the Great War. New York: E.P. Dutton & Company, 1919. Internet Archive. Retrieved 3 Dec. 2008. p. 38 In addition to his success as an easel painter and illustrator, Mora became a well known muralist. His first mural, in 1900, was a commission for the Lynn Public Library in Lynn, Massachusetts. Following that, Mora received a commission for the Missouri State Building at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (also known as the St. Louis World's Fair)in 1904. He continued to receive commissions, including murals for Columbia College, the Governor's Mansion of New Jersey, the Red Cross, The Town Club and Bar in Manhattan, the 1939 New York World's Fair, and in the Sears family (Sears & Roebuck) country home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Mora was also a successful portraitist who counted Andrew Carnegie among his subjects. After at least one attempt by another artist, Mora was selected by the Fine Arts Commission to paint a posthumous portrait of President Warren G. Harding.\\"Harding Hung.\\" Time 28 Jul. 1930. Retrieved 2 Dec. 2008. That portrait remains on permanent display in the White House. He painted portraits of Society matrons and their children, prominent physicians and attorneys; and around 1915 he painted a series of portraits of actresses and dancers, including Isadora Duncan and Jeanne Cartier. Mora would return to Spain frequently throughout his career, and he had at least two extended stays when he painted. During 1905, he rented a studio in Madrid from which to work, and in 1909 he and Sonia spent an entire year abroad when he took a studio in Seville. He and Sonia bought land in Gaylordsville, Connecticut in 1913, where he painted an array of easel paintings of everyday life in the countryside. On July 22, 1918, Mora's daughter, Rosemary, was born. She became his constant subject, and in 1921 he had a solo exhibition at the venerable William Macbeth Gallery, entitled \\"An American Summer,\\" with many watercolors picturing toddler Rosemary. In 1923, he completed his summer home and studio; and in 1924, Mora was a co-founder of the Kent Art Association in Connecticut. In 192709, Mora had a solo exhibition at the Buenos Aires Museo de Bellas Artes (Argentina), which received glowing reviews in The New York Times. In January 1928 Luis visited his younger brother, Jo Mora, in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California and was feted by the Carmel Art Association, which opened a highly publicized “special exhibition” of his paintings on May 1. Unfortunately, he plunged headlong into a raging controversy over juried exhibitions at the Association; Luis opposed culling by juries. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). In 1931, Luis Mora's beloved wife, Sonia, died suddenly of food poisoning. A few months later, he took Rosemary out of school and went to live with Jo who had recently moved from Carmel to nearby Pebble Beach. He soon returned to New York in 1932 to marry a former portrait sitter and wealthy widow, May Safford. Mora was 58 years old, and May was 53 and had a grown daughter who was already married. Although he continued to exhibit, he won no further medals and few, if any, of his easel paintings were selling. Because of the Great Depression, he also suffered a dearth of portrait commissions, and his illustrations became few. Sadly, May did not get along with Rosemary; and Mora sent Rosemary to expensive boarding schools, further compromising his financial situation. Mora gradually ran out of money, and in 1939 he rented his beloved Gaylordsville property to strangers. Mora died on June 5, 1940, in May's elegant apartment in New York. He was 64, just six weeks before his 65th birthday. == Artistic significance == Mora is known for his attempts to translate the techniques of the Spanish Old Masters to a modern American idiom. Since Mora's initial travels in Spain coincided with the emergence of the Generation of '98, a portion of his oeuvre has been interpreted as an attempt to understand modern Spain and Spanish–U.S. relations in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.Boone, pp. 175–176 He also produced a series of nudes, many with Spanish shawls as backdrops. He painted a portrait of his only daughter, Rosemary, \\"In Costume\\" in 1925, showing her as a little Senorita pushing a doll carriage. Mora also produced a large series of Impressionist paintings with American subjects. Many pictured life in the Connecticut and New Jersey countryside, and picnic scenes. He loved children, and some of his most notable and published scenes pictured happy youngsters at play. He was also interested in music and theater, and painted scenes with American actresses and dancers. He was elected to fifteen art societies where he won many medals and awards. He had numerous solo shows in museums and in galleries. He exhibited across the United States, in New York City and State, Indiana, California, Georgia, and others. His galleryist patrons were William Macbeth, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Milch, all known for showing the best American artists of the era. Mora participated in group shows in dozens of art societies, museums and galleries. He was famous in his lifetime, but was quickly forgotten because his works were poorly handled after his death. Only recently, with the publication of his comprehensive biography by Lynne Pauls Baron, edited by Peter Hastings Falk, has Mora's memory and works experienced accolades that he deserves. On September 20, 2008, Bacardi U.S.A., Inc. sponsored a gala celebration and lectures in Mora's honor at New York's National Art Club on Gramercy Park. == Legacy == Mora's works are currently held or on display in 34 museums,Mora Book Announcement. fluismora.org.

Luis Mora at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1902 F. Luis Mora was married for 31 years to Sophia (\\"Sonia\\") Brown Compton Mora. They had one daughter, Rosemary, who never married and never had children; and therefore Mora's direct lineage ended with her. After Sophia died, in 1932 Mora married May Safford. May was 53 at the time, and there were no children from the marriage. Mora does not have any grandchildren or great- grandchildren. Mora was closely related to the Bacardi family, famous for its rum. His mother was a Gaillard with two sisters who married into the Bacardi family which had many children. Mora's uncle Facundo Bacardi (married to Ernestina Gaillard) was the company's \\"master blender\\" who made rum a light, pleasant-tasting spirit. Luis Mora's father, Domingo Mora, was Catalan with a large family in Spain. It is not known whether any Mora family members are still living in Spain. Mora's only known living descendants are a great-niece in California, a nephew in California, a niece in New Jersey who has vivid memories of him; and many cousins in the Bacardi-Gaillard family who are directly related.

Crestani had one win and finished behind Pasquale Di Sabatino, Mihai Marinescu and Jaime Alguersuari in the championship. He also made his debut in the Italian Formula Three Championship for Corbetta Competizioni at the final round at the Misano World Circuit. Having qualified 7th for both races, Fabrizio recorded a sixth and a seventh from the two races, allowing him to finish 13th in the championship. Crestani moved up full-time to Italian F3 for 2006, continuing with Corbetta Competizioni. Over the course of the season, he recorded one pole position at Vallelunga, and five podiums (four of which being second places) on his way to fifth in the championship. He also made an appearance in the British Formula 3 Championship when the series visited Mugello. Driving in the Invitational Class, he finished both races outside of the points recording a 15th and a 14th with lap times matching the National Class runners. A third season of Italian F3 followed, again with Corbetta. Having recorded two more pole positions at Misano, Crestani finally recorded his first wins in the championship at Mugello, leading home 2008 champion Mirko Bortolotti in both races. A third win would follow later in the year at Vallelunga, but Crestani could not improve on his championship position from 2006 by again finishing fifth, 41 points behind champion Paolo Maria Nocera. Crestani would not return to the series for 2008, instead moving to the Euroseries 3000 championship for GP Racing. Again, a fifth place championship position was the net result of the season including wins at Mugello, and a double at the Magione season finale. He finished 8th in the counterpart Italian series, which ran at the same time as the Euro series, at four of the first five rounds. He also forayed into the International Formula Master series, racing at Valencia, Pau and Brno for Euronova Racing. His best finish was first in the race at Pau – holding off champion Chris van der Drift by 0.058 seconds, giving him a total of 0.5 points in the championship. After Tiago Monteiro acquired the former BCN Competición team and renamed it as Ocean Racing Technology, Monteiro replaced both drivers from round one (Hiroki Yoshimoto and Luca Filippi), hiring Yelmer Buurman and Crestani to be the drivers to replace them from round two of the 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series season onwards. He scored no points and finished 28th in the championship. He resumed his Euroseries career with the TP Formula team, although he then switched to the Emmebi Motorsport outfit for the final round of the championship. He took six podium finishes, a pole position and a fastest lap from the 13 races to finish fourth in the championship and fifth in the concurrent Italian F3000 championship. Crestani had a fragmented 2010, competing four races in Auto GP for the DAMS and Trident teams, and six races for David Price Racing in the main GP2 Series after replacing Giacomo Ricci in the team. Due to lack of sponsorship, Fabrizio Crestani then undertook a full 2011 season in Auto GP with the Lazarus team alongside compatriot Fabio Onidi; he finished fourth in the championship. Crestani remained with Lazarus as the team made its GP2 Series début in 2012, and was partnered by Giancarlo Serenelli. He has since scored his best series points with a second-place finish in the season-opening feature race in 2013. Reputed by racing insiders to be one of the fastest drivers who is already ready to compete in the Formula One category, Fabrizio Crestani who is presently racing with Team Lazarus is nonetheless very busy looking for a potential sponsor given that his dream is to compete for a Formula One team. == Racing record  Career summary === {  style=\\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\\" !Season !Series !Team !Races !Wins !Poles !F/Laps !Podiums !Points !Position - !rowspan=2 2005 align=left Formula Junior 1600 Italy align=left PSR Motorsport  12  1  ?  ?  4  141  4th - align=left Italian Formula 3 Championship align=left Corbetta  2  0  0  0  0  10  13th - !rowspan=2 2006 align=left Italian Formula 3 Championship align=left rowspan=2 Corbetta Competizioni  16  0  1  2  5  76  5th - align=left British Formula 3 Championship - National Class  2  0  0  0  1  20  17th - ! 2007 align=left Italian Formula 3 Championship align=left Corbetta Competizioni  16  3  2  3  7  73  5th - !rowspan=3 2008 align=left Euroseries 3000 align=left rowspan=2 GP Racing  10  3  0  1  5  49  5th - align=left Italian Formula 3000  4  1  0  1  1  15  9th - align=left International Formula Master align=left Euronova Racing  6  0  0  0  0  0.5  27th - ! 2008–09 align=left GP2 Asia Series align=left Ocean Racing Technology  9  0  0  0  0  0  28th - !rowspan=2 2009 align=left Euroseries 3000 align=left rowspan=2 TP Formula  12  0  1  2  6  54  4th - align=left Italian Formula 3000  6  0  0  1  2  26  5th - !rowspan=3 2010 align=left GP2 Series align=left David Price Racing  6  0  0  0  0  0  30th - align=left rowspan=2 Auto GP align=left DAMS  2  0  0  0  0 rowspan=2 0 rowspan=2 22nd - align=left Trident Racing  2  0  0  0  0 - ! 2011 align=left Auto GP align=left Lazarus  14  1  0  0  4  92  6th - ! 2012 align=left GP2 Series align=left Venezuela GP Lazarus  14  0  0  0  0  1  24th - !rowspan=2 2013 align=left GP2 Series align=left Venezuela GP Lazarus  4  0  0  0  0  0  33rd - align=left Auto GP align=left Ibiza Racing Team  2  0  0  0  0  11  17th - ! 2015 align=left Lamborghini Super Trofeo Europe align=left Team Lazarus  11  0  0  1  5  84  4th - !rowspan=2 2016 align=left International GT Open align=left rowspan=2 Orange 1 Team Lazarus  14  2  0  0  9  114 FFFFBF;\\" 1st - align=left International GT Open - Pro- Am  14  1  3  2  8  78 FFFFBF;\\" 1st - !rowspan=4 2017 align=left Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup align=left rowspan=3 Orange 1 Team Lazarus  8  0  0  0  0  0  NC - align=left Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup - Silver Cup  4  0  0  0  2  34  7th - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup  5  0  0  0  0  0  NC - align=left Intercontinental GT Challenge align=left Lamborghini  1  0  0  0  0  0  NC - !rowspan=5 2018 align=left International GT Open align=left rowspan=5 Daiko Lazarus Racing  14  0  0  0  1  28  16th - align=left International GT Open - Pro-Am  14  0  0  0  8  78 DFDFDF;\\" 2nd - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup  5  0  0  0  0  0  NC - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup - Pro-Am  4  1  0  0  1  49  6th - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup - Silver Cup  1  0  0  0  0  7  19th - !rowspan=3 2019 align=left International GT Open align=left SPS Automotive Performance  14  1  0  2  5  92  5th - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup align=left rowspan=2 Daiko Lazarus Racing  2  0  0  0  0  0  NC - align=left Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup - Silver Cup  2  0  0  0  0  0  NC - ! 2020 align=left International GT Open align=left Team Lazarus  6  1  1  1  1  41  7th* } * Season still in progress. === Complete GP2 Series results === (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\\" !

Having spent most of his 16-year career with Real Sociedad – 196 official games and 109 goals – he was the first player to win the Pichichi Trophy award, given to the top scorer in La Liga. ==Club career== Born in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Bienzobas arrived at local Real Sociedad at the age of 17 from amateurs Unión Deportiva de San Sebastián, helping the Basques win the regional championship in his first year. He reached his first Copa del Rey final with the former in 1928, facing FC Barcelona in three games (two 1–1 draws and a 1–3 loss). In 1929, a national league was created and Real Sociedad participated in La Liga's first edition, finishing fourth out of the ten teams competing. Bienzobas scored 17 goals during the season, being the first player to be crowned Pichichi; he spent a further four years with the club. In 1934, Bienzobas joined CA Osasuna, at the time in Segunda División, helping the Navarrese club immediately achieve promotion, only to be being relegated back the next season. The Spanish Civil War put a stop to his career for three years and subsequently he returned to Real Sociedad in 1940, retiring from football at the end of 1941–42 (aged 33) after making only five appearances during the campaign. He amassed Spanish top division totals of 92 games and 50 goals, and overall totals of 196 games and 109 goals for Real Sociedad. He was a penalty specialist, failing to convert only one of 75 spot kicks in his career. ==International career== Bienzobas appeared for Spain on two occasions, scoring as many goals. His debut came on 4 June 1928, as the national team lost 1–7 against Italy in the Summer Olympics. ==Coaching and refereeing== After his retirement, Bienzobas worked briefly as a manager with Osasuna. In 1942 he began a referee in a spell that would eventually feature him in 48 Spanish top flight games, his debut coming in 1948. ==Personal life== Paco Bienzobas had two brothers who were also footballers: the older Custodio, a forward, was a teammate at Real Sociedad for two seasons; the younger Anastasio (Cuqui), a midfielder, also started his career at the Txuriurdin club but became established at Osasuna where he was joined by Paco, and after the Spanish Civil War was a regular in the team at Deportivo La Coruña for most of the 1940s. He died in 30 April 1981, a day after being informed that Real Sociedad had finally won La Liga for the first time. ==References*Spain stats at Eu-Football * Category:1909 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Sportspeople from San Sebastián Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Real Sociedad footballers Category:CA Osasuna players Category:Spain international footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Spain Category:Footballers at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Spanish football managers Category:CA Osasuna managers Category:Pichichi Trophy winners Category:Spanish football referees Category:Segunda División players Category:Basque Country international footballers ","title":"Paco Bienzobas"},{"id":"20537542","text":"The Allied oil campaign of World War II pitted the RAF and the USAAF against facilities supplying Nazi Germany with petroleum, oil, and lubrication (POL) products. It formed part of the immense Allied strategic bombing effort during the war. The targets in Germany and in Axis Europe included refineries, synthetic fuel factories, storage depots and other POL-infrastructure. Before the war, Britain had identified Germany's reliance on oil and oil products for its war machine, and the strategic bombing started with RAF attacks on Germany in 1940. After the US entered the war (December 1941), it carried out daytime \\"precision bombing\\" attacks – such as Operation Tidal Wave against refineries in Romania in 1943. The last major strategic raid of the European theater of the war targeted a refinery in Norway in April 1945. During the war the effort expended against POL targets varied, with relative priority sometimes given to other objectives such as to defeating the German V-weapon attacks or to preparations for the invasion of western Europe in 1944. The strategic importance of oil resources in World War II also showed in campaigns such as: * the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (August–September 1941) to secure access to Persian oil * Japan's strategic offensive against the Dutch East Indies (1941–1942) to re-access embargoed oil- and rubber-resources * the Wehrmacht's drive towards Baku and the oilfields of the Caucasus (Case Blue and Operation Edelweiss) in the summer of 1942 * the Soviet occupation of Romania in 1944, which deprived the Axis of the important Ploesti oil-fields == Campaign strategy == The British had identified the importance of Germany's fuel supplies before the war in their \\"Western Air Plan 5(c)\\". The focus of British bombing during 1940 changed repeatedly in response to directives from the Air Ministry. At the start of June, oil targets were made a priority of night bombing with attacks on other war industry to be made on dark nights (when the oil targets could not be located) but with the proviso that \\"indiscriminate action\\" should be avoided. On 20 June oil targets were made third priority below the German aircraft industry and lines of communication between Germany and the armies at the front. Following a brief period when German shipping was given priority, oil targets were made secondary priority in mid July under a policy of concentrated attack with five oil refineries listed for attention. Sir Charles Portal was sceptical of the likelihood of success, saying that only a few targets could be located by average crews under moonlit conditions. The RAF viewed Axis oil as a \\"vital centre\\", and in February 1941, the British Air Staff expected that RAF Bomber Command would, by destruction of half of a list of 17 targets, reduce Axis oil production capacity by 80%.: May–June 1940 (Battle of France) , January–April 1941 , May–August 1941 ==Ploiești oilfield== Although the Butt Report of August 1941 identified the poor accuracy and performance of RAF bombing, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris maintained at the subsequent Casablanca Conference the great importance of oil targets in Axis territory. The first US bombing of a European target was of the Ploieşti refineries on 12 June 1942 and the oil campaign continued at a lower priority until 1944. Priority fell with the need for attacks on German V-weapon targets (\\"Operation Crossbow\\") in France and then the attacks on lines of communication in preparation for the invasion of France (described as the \\"Transportation Plan\\"). Columbia Aquila refinery at Ploieşti burning after the raid of B-24 Liberator bombers, Operation Tidal Wave In March 1944 the \\"Plan for Completion of Combined Bomber Offensive\\" was put forward which found favour with the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. The plan proposed attacking \\"fourteen synthetic plants and thirteen refineries\\" of Nazi Germany. (in same folder of Box 48) (in same folder of Box 48) The plan estimated Axis oil production could be reduced by 50% by bombing—33% below the amount Nazi Germany needed—but also included 4 additional priorities: first oil, then fighter and ball bearing production, rubber production, and bomber output. The damage caused by the 12 and 28 May trial bombings of oil targets, as well as the confirmation of the oil facilities' importance and vulnerability from Ultra intercepts and other intelligence reports, would result in the oil targets becoming the highest priority on 3 September 1944. In June 1944, in response to Air Ministry query on resources, Bomber Command staff estimated it would take 32,000 tons of bombs to destroy 10 oil targets in the Ruhr. Harris agreed to divert spare effort to oil targets. They were deemed to be of such importance that one raid was staged that consisted only of bomb carrying fighters, to rest the bomber crews and surprise the defenders. In late summer 1944 the Allies began using reconnaissance photo information to time bombing with the resumption of production at a facility. Even with the weather limitations: \\"This was the big breakthrough ... a plant would be wounded ... by successive attacks on its electrical grid—its nervous system—and on its gas and water mains.\\" (author Donald Miller). However, due to bad fall and winter weather, a \\"far greater tonnage\\" was expended on Transportation Plan targets than oil targets. The benzol (oil) plant at Linz in Austria was bombed on 16 October 1944. In January 1945, the priority of oil targets was lowered. To prevent oil supplies from Romania reaching Germany, the RAF had extended its aerial mining activities to the Danube. ==Post-war== Despite the RAF and Harris claims regarding the great importance of oil targets, Harris had opposed assigning the highest priority to oil targets but acknowledged post- war that the campaign was \\"a complete success\\" with the qualifier: \\"I still do not think that it was reasonable, at that time, to expect that the [oil] campaign would succeed; what the Allied strategists did was to bet on an outsider, and it happened to win the race.\\" Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067 prohibited German post-war production of oil through July 1947, and the United States Army made post-war provisions to rehabilitate and use petroleum installations where needed, as well as to dispose of unneeded captured equipment. After inspections of various plants by the \\"European technology mission\\" (Plan for Examination of Oil Industry of Axis Europe) and a report in March 1946, the United States Bureau of Mines employed seven Operation Paperclip synthetic fuel scientists in a Fischer-Tropsch chemical plant in Louisiana, Missouri. In October 1975, Texas A&M; University began the German Document Retrieval Project and completed a report on 28 April 1977. The report identified final investigations of the German plants and interrogations of German scientists by the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee, the US Field Information Agency (Technical), and the Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee. ==Opinions on outcome== Despite its successes, by the spring of 1944 the Combined Bomber Offensive had failed to severely damage the German economy or significantly interrupt production of a vital item. The oil campaign was the first to accomplish these goals. The US strategic bombing survey (USSBS) identified \\"catastrophic\\" damage. Of itself, German industry was not significantly affected by attacks on oil targets as coal was its primary source of energy. And in its analysis of strategic bombing as a whole the USSBS identified the consequences of the breakdown of transportation resulting from attacks against transportation targets as \\"probably greater than any other single factor\\" in the final collapse of the German economy. Several prominent Germans, however, described the oil campaign as critical to the defeat of Nazi Germany. Adolf Galland, Inspector of Fighters of the Luftwaffe until relieved of command in January 1945, wrote in his book \\"the most important of the combined factors which brought about the collapse of Germany\\", and the Luftwaffe's wartime leader, Hermann Göring, described it as \\"the utmost in deadliness\\". Albert Speer, writing in his memoir, said that \\"It meant the end of German armaments production.\\" It has been stated to have been \\"effective immediately, and decisive within less than a year\\". Luftwaffe Field Marshal Erhard Milch, referring to the consequences of the oil campaign, claimed that \\"The British left us with deep and bleeding wounds, but the Americans stabbed us in the heart.\\" ==Statistics== The following statistics are from the British Bombing Survey Unit. Figures are for the oil campaign in the last year of the war.

Working from German records for certain sites, the USSBS determined that on average 87% of Allied bombs fell outside the factory perimeter and that only a few percent struck plant or equipment inside the boundary. The USAAF could put 26% of their bombing within the factories in good bombing conditions, 12% when using a mix of visual and instruments but only 5% when it had to use instrument-only bombing techniques; and 80% of their tonnage was delivered under partly or fully instrument conditions. The RAF averaged 16% inside the factory. Bomber Command's efforts against oil were more efficient in some regards – although delivering a smaller total tonnage it did so from base area. The USSBS believed that Bomber Command's heavy bombs Blockbuster bombswere more effective than an equivalent weight of smaller bombs. Both RAF and USAAF dropped a large number of bombs on oil targets that failed to explode: 19% and 12% respectively. == See also == * Oil campaign chronology of World War II * Oil campaign targets of World War II ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Category:World War II strategic bombing Category:Campaigns of World War II Category:Campaigns, operations and battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom ","title":"Oil campaign of World War II"},{"id":"20537561","text":"This is a list of islands of Kuwait.

A Zellenleiter was higher in rank than a Blockleiter and was in charge of a \\"Nazi Cell\\", composed of eight to twelve city blocks. ==History and Usage== The position of Zellenleiter was first created in 1930 as a mid-level political leadership title. Originally known as Zellenwart, in 1933 after the Nazis came to power, the rank of Zellenwart was replaced by a new rank known as Stellenleiter. It was the Stellenleiters, on the local level of the Nazi Party encompassing German towns and cities, who held the positional title of Zellenleiter, and were often referred to as such in contrast to their actual political rank. Such persons answered to an official known as an Ortsgruppenleiter, considered the chief Nazi in a municipal region. In 1939, the Nazi Party completed revamped its political ranking system and created a plethora of new Nazi Party political ranks and the title of Zellenleiter was adopted into its final form. Holders of the position now held a standard Nazi political rank (normally Bereitschaftsleiter or Einsatzleiter) while also displaying a political armband denoting their position as a Zellenleiter. There were also three primary Zellenleiter positions, these being: * Zellenleiter (Cell Leader) * Zellenwalter (Cell Administrator) * Zellenobmann (Cell Foreman) Two special positions, known as Betriebszellenobmann and Hauptbetriebszellenobmann also existed, but were more focused on war production duties rather than the Nazi Cell command chain. ==Duties== The original political rank of Zellenwart was used to supervise local Nazi political leaders during a time when the Nazi Party was attempting to gain power in the Weimar Republic. After the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933, the political position of Zellenleiter became a type of political strongman and was usually the highest Nazi official that the general population would have direct dealings with on a day-to-day basis. During World War II, the Zellenleiters oversaw the activities of the Blockleiters under their command. Primary focus was on the enforcement of Nazi policies, the promulgation of war production, and the administration of civil relief efforts, especially towards the end of the war when Germany was invaded. As defeat loomed for Nazi Germany, many Zellenleiters became associated with the Volksturm and served as ad hoc military commanders when the need arose. ==Sources== * Clark, J. (2007).

It is a distinctive subspecies of the Eurasian wren endemic to the islands of the isolated St Kilda archipelago, in the Atlantic Ocean west of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. ==Description== The St Kilda wren is distinguished from the mainland form by its larger size and heavier barring, as well as its generally greyer and less rufous colouration. It differs from other Scottish island sub-species by its heavy barring, long and strong bill, and its greyer and paler plumage. The voice is somewhat louder than the mainland subspecies. ==Distribution and habitat== This wren is known only from St Kilda in the Outer Hebrides, where it is present on all islands in the group. In the breeding season it is largely found on the cliffs and steep rocky slopes with thick vegetation, but also around old buildings. Outside the breeding season it is more widely dispersed around the islands. ==Ecology== The St Kilda wren feeds on small invertebrates such as beetles and their larvae, flies, moth larvae, spiders, centipedes and sandhoppers. Most birds breed in crevices and holes on cliffs concealed behind grasses and dead thrift. Some choose old walls and buildings, or the steep grassy slopes where puffins breed. The nest is built by the male and is rather bulky and is composed of dead grasses, mosses and bits of dead bracken, lined with white feathers moulted by seabirds. There are usually four to six eggs, white with reddish-brown speckles, mostly on the wide end. ==Status== The St Kilda wren is a fairly common breeding resident on St Kilda. The population was estimated at about 230 breeding pairs in 2002. ==References== Category:Endemic fauna of Scotland Category:Fauna of St Kilda, Scotland Category:Troglodytes (bird) Category:Birds described in 1884 Category:1884 in Scotland Category:Taxa named by Henry Seebohm Category:Endemic biota of the Scottish islands ","title":"St Kilda wren"},{"id":"20537622","text":"Keith Skinner (born 1949) is a British actor and crime historian and author. ==Acting career== He worked as an actor in cinema and television.

It was held from 6–15 August and was the first carnival to be hosted by the Tasmanian city of Hobart. It was won by Victoria. After only three states had contested the 1921 Perth Carnival due to high travelling expenses, the 1924 Carnival was contested by all six states. The carnival was staged as a full round-robin amongst the states. All fifteen matches were played at North Hobart Oval. Since the weaker footballing states of Queensland and New South Wales were grouped together with the likes of Victoria, there were many one sided games. Queensland in particular was uncompetitive against the main states. Western Australia managed to kick a senior record 43 goals in one match against the Queenslanders, 23 of which were kicked by full-forward Bonny Campbell – also a senior record. Victoria's game against Queensland was described in the Tasmanian press as \\"one of the most farcial football matches ever witnessed in Hobart\\", with Victoria applying little defensive pressure (resulting in Queensland's highest score of the tournament), and making positional changes which resulted in all eighteen Victorian players scoring at least one goal. The best regarded match of the tournament, and ultimately the Championship- deciding match, was played on the first Saturday of the carnival between Victoria and Western Australia. Campbell (Western Australia) and Lloyd Hagger (Victoria) both scored seven goals. The Victorians won the encounter by eight points. The carnival was the biggest sporting event to have been held in Tasmania's history at that time. Huge crowds were drawn to the marquee days of the carnival, attracting visitors from all over Tasmania. The crowd of 15,687 which attended the first Saturday set a new record as the highest sporting crowd in the history of Tasmania, and the second Saturday drew more than 12,000. A gazetted half-holiday was observed on the opening Wednesday, and businesses also closed on the second Wednesday, resulting in crowds of around 10,000 on both days. Overall, the carnival drew 60,706 paying spectators across nine days, and took a carnival record £5823/1/– at the gate. The average tournament crowd was reduced by the Tuesday and Thursday matches played during the second week – which featured predictably one-sided affairs, did not feature Tasmania, and one of which was played in heavy rain – which each drew only a couple of hundred of spectators. As occurred at many carnivals, overuse of the ground and untimely heavy rain resulted in the condition of the playing surface degenerating to a bog by the end of the carnival. ==ResultsLadder=== {  style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; width: 60%\\" -  colspan=\\"10\\" style=\\"background: #EBEBEB;\\"  { border=\\"0\\" width=\\"100%\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - style=\\"background: #EBEBEB;\\"  width=\\"25%\\" style=\\"border: 0;\\"   style=\\"border: 0; font-size: 115%;\\"  1924 Hobart Carnival ladder  width=\\"25%\\" style=\\"border: 0;\\"  } - style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%;\\" ! !!

Littlehey Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. The Prison only holds those that have been convicted of a sexual offence. ==History== The site was originally known as Gaynes Hall Youth Custody Centre, and was used as a borstal for juvenile males from 1945 to 1983, when the establishment was closed and demolished. Littlehey was built in its place and opened as an integrated Category C prison for adult males in 1988. In April 2003 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Littlehey Prison for not helping inmates integrate back into society. The report found that \\"prisoners needed more help with finding jobs and accommodation before their release\\", but noted positively that the staff had good relationships with the prisoners and were doing better managing the health care of prisoners. Littlehey is a purpose-built category C prison for adult males. Accommodation at Littlehey comprises eight residential units, two of which are 'Ready to Use' units, one added in 1997 and the second in 2003. Most cells are single occupancy but there are some shared cells. Littlehey Prison reports that it provides a range of work provision for inmates including accredited vocational training courses in forklift trucks, carpentry, joinery, motor mechanics, hospitality and educational. Classes range from basic and key skills to degree level learning. In January 2010, HMP Littlehey opened a large expansion to its current site to accommodate a population of up to 480 young offenders. This investment has allowed for the addition of four new accommodation blocks, an all-weather sports pitch and a gymnasium, adult learning and kitchen buildings. The regime claims to focus on providing young offenders with a portfolio of skills and qualifications to change their futures. Employability and functional skills are said to be at the centre of the establishment's drive towards reducing re-offending. There is also a Prison Visitor Centre which is operated by the Ormiston Children and Families Trust. In January 2011, a disturbance at the prison left two prison officers injured. ==The prison today== In 2014, the prison was re-categorised to accommodate prisoners convicted of sex offences (falling within category C security level). A 2015 report from the Independent Monitoring Boardhttp://www.imb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Littlhey-Annual- Report-2014-15.pdf observed that HMP Littlehey had an unusually high population of inmates over the age of 50 (34%). Concerns were raised over the lack of provision for elderly and disabled prisoners, and reports have emerged of inmates struggling with wheelchair access and not receiving support for health problems such as incontinence.http://www.prisonphone.co.uk/hmp- littlehey-and-other-uk-prisons-unable-to-cope-with-elderly-inmates/ In 2018 it was found that there were serious problems over outstanding maintenance work, 1,300 maintenance jobs were outstanding in January 2018. Some showers had been out of action for two years and some prisoners were without heating for 8 months. Prison officers spent disproportionate time dealing with maintenance problems. Trust between prisoners and staff had broken down because staff could not meet prisoners' basic needs. Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said, \\"The lamentable conditions in Littlehey are indicative of the pressures that exist in our overburdened and under-resourced prison system. No prison should be allowed to deteriorate in this way, but it is particularly shocking in a jail where around half of the prisoners are over 50 and a significant number are elderly and disabled.\\"HMP Littlehey conditions 'lamentable', says charity BBC In 2019 HMIP inspected the prison and overall, and despite some criticisms, the report reflects some very good findings and some excellent outcomes for prisoners at Littlehey. The prison had a clearly defined function and held a substantial number of elevated risk men in safe and respectful conditions. Prisoners benefited from a very good daily regime and we saw examples of good practice. Going forward, the prison’s main priorities are to assess and reduce the risks of the prisoners it holds, and to prepare those being released for successful resettlement into the community. ==Notable inmates and former inmates== * Stephen DowningINNOCENT – Fighting miscarriages of justice After spending 27 years in prison Stephen Downing is obsessed by being a copper – mirror.co.uk * Max Clifford (died whilst a prisoner) * Alex Hepburn ==References * Ministry of Justice pages on Littlehey Category:Prisons in Cambridgeshire Category:Category C prisons in England Category:1988 establishments in England Category:Buildings and structures in Huntingdonshire Category:Men's prisons ","title":"HM Prison Littlehey"},{"id":"20537862","text":"St. Paul's Chapel is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Episcopal church at Crownsville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

A banana plantation is a commercial agricultural facility found in tropical climates where bananas are grown. ==Geographic distribution== Banana plants may grow with varying degrees of success in diverse climatic conditions, but commercial banana plantations are primarily found in equatorial regions, in banana exporting countries. The four leading banana export countries worldwide are Ecuador, Costa Rica, Philippines, and Colombia. Ecuador provides more than 33% of global banana exports. In 2004, banana producing countries totaled 130. Production, as well as exports and imports of bananas, are nonetheless concentrated in a few equatorial countries. 75% of total banana production in 2004 was generated in 10 counties. India, Ecuador, Brazil and China produced half of total bananas. Latin American and Caribbean countries led banana production up to the 1980s, and Asian nations took the lead in banana production during the 1990s. African production levels have remained mostly unchanged. ==Elements== Banana plantations, as well as growing the fruit, may also package, process, and ship their product directly from the plantation to worldwide markets. Depending on the scope of the operation, a plantation's size may vary from a small family farm operation to a corporate facility encompassing large tracts of land, multiple physical plants, and many employees. Production-related activities on a plantation may include cultivating and harvesting the fruit, transporting the picked bunches to a packing shed, hanging to ripen in large bunches, dividing large bunches into smaller market-friendly bunches, sorting, labeling, washing, drying, packing, boxing, storing, refrigeration, shipping, and marketing. Depending on the scope of the operation, other activities may include drying, food preparation, tourism, and market research. ===Soil=== Bananas will grow and fruit under poor soil conditions but will be less productive without deep, well-drained soil; forest loam, rocky sand, marl, red laterite, volcanic ash, sandy clay, or even heavy clay. The key element in soil type for successful banana plant growth is good drainage. Alluvial soils of river valleys are ideal for banana growing. Bananas prefer an acid soil.Morton, J. 1987. Fruits of warm climates, p. 29–46, Julia F. Morton, Miami, FL. ===Physical plant=== The Big Banana - A tourist facility on an Australian banana plantation. Physical plants on banana plantations, aside from growing fields, may include facilities or machinery for plant propagation, cultivation, labor housing, fertilization and pest mitigation, harvesting assists such as tractors or overhead cable systems, washing tanks, storage buildings, boxing or bagging, shipping docks, offices, public relations/tourism, and general maintenance. Cultivation techniques specific to the type of banana produced may dictate the specific physical plant makeup. Much of banana cultivation since the mid-1950s has centered around a single monoculture: The Cavendish banana. The ravages of Panama Disease in that particular cultivar may cause a shift in variety selection, subsequently causing a major change in the physical plant structure of banana plantations.Interview. Dan Koeppel, author of the book Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World Scientific American, April 2008. Transcript at: Scientific American ==Economy== Banana growing is a significant economic engine in many banana-exporting countries because it is labor-intensive, delivers a relatively quick return on effort and investment, provides a weekly income year round, and the crop recovers quickly from hurricanes and other natural disasters. Banana industry exports worldwide total over 100 million tonshttp://bananas.bioversityinternational.org/content/view/67/97/lang,en/ in a market which generates over US$5 billion per year Intergovernmental Group on Bananas and on Tropical Fruit and employs millions of workers. ==Farming techniques== Banana plantations generally follow one of four major agricultural techniques: Intensive farming,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Commodities and trade - Bananas sustainable farming, organic farming, and fair trade farming. An intensive agricultural technique which requires clearing most if not all native vegetation from tracts of land, then densely planting and fertilizing the crop may produce the highest yield of fruit per acre, but it is viewed by environmental scientists as a technique which involves a history of high risk for damage to the local environment, and health risk to the agricultural workers.BANANAS! - the film that triggered Big Boys ===Sustainable farming=== As with broader sustainable agriculture, sustainable banana production aims to integrate three main goals: environmental stewardship, farm profitability, and prosperous farming communities. Producing goods without depleting an ecosystem's natural resources is a key goal of sustainable banana farming. The further goals of farm profitability and prosperous farming communities address free market viability issues which might threaten the viability of the business, rendering the ecological sustainability efforts moot. Because of the lower per-acre crop yield and higher wage cost intrinsic to this type of farming, profitability is addressed by the introduction of a price premium charged for the product at market. Such premiums are readily paid by a segment of the consumer market which places a value on the benefits of sustainable farming. ===Organic farming=== According to the United Nations, \\"no information is available regarding how many hectares are currently under conversion or how many producers are planning to convert to organic production methods.\\" http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/Y1767e.HTM#P25_1982 However major banana producers in 2008 indicated they were responding to demands for organic bananas with new facilities tailored to that market. ===Fair Trade farming=== Some consumers are willing to pay a premium price for a product, including bananas, if the means of production are consistent with the philosophies of Fair Trade. The United Nations has published a description of fair trade banana production which states, \\"for banana producers this means they obtain a price which covers the cost of production and an additional price premium to be invested in social, environmental or quality improvements.\\"THE MARKET FOR \\"FAIR-TRADE\\" BANANAS === Banana farming in flood prone areas === Sand deposition from flood makes soil unsuitable for growing other food crops due to very low nutrient availability, low water holding capacity and poor physical attributes. Thus more time and effort is required to completely restore the land into its original state after the sand deposition. As a result, farmers face difficulties to go back to normalcy and sustain their life. There are various strategies developed so far to revitalize flood degraded soil. However, most of the strategies require higher initial investment and/or take longer time to restore due to which farmers are unable to generate income as before.  Method of establishing banana orchard in flood deposited sandy soil  Banana can be grown in variety of soil. However, while planting in flood prone area and sand deposited soil, regular management practice should be slightly amended. If sand deposition is above 0.5 m and the area gets inundate for longer duration (more than 2-3 days) during monsoon, then such site should not be considered for banana plantation. These are the necessary things to be considered in each step of banana farming in flood affected area: I. Variety selection In flood affected areas, there is always a high chance of banana plant being submerged in flood during monsoon. If it is fully submerged for more than two days, plant can eventually die. Therefore tall variety plants with deep root system should be planted in such areas. In Nepal, people usually grow malbhog variety of banana in the areas which are prone to annual flood but are not inundate for longer than three days. Malbhog variety grows up to the height of 5 m and root goes down to more than 1 m deep into the soil. Production is quiet lower compared to hybrid varieties but fetch good market price because of its taste. II. Propagation material In Nepal, banana is propagated exclusively using suckers. Suckers are lateral shoot that develops from the rhizome near the mother plant and are categorically of two types, sword sucker and water sucker. Generally, sword suckers are preferred over water suckers as the plant developed from water suckers are weak and take longer to bear fruits. Sword suckers can be easily distinguished because of its well developed base with narrow sword shaped blades at the early stages. Two to four months old suckers from healthy and high yielding mother plant should be selected for propagation. III. Planting method Banana suckers are usually planted in a 0.2 to 0.25 m furrow or pit of size 0.6x0.6x0.6 m3 at a depth of 0.3 m. But in flood affected areas, suckers should be planted in a pit of size more or less equal to 1 m3. The pit is filled with mixture of topsoil and farmyard manure at a 1:1 ratio and sucker is planted at 0.5 to 0.75 m depth depending upon the height of sand above original ground level. A total of 2 x 3 m spacing should be maintained between the plants. IV. Crop management Crop management begins with the planting, continues with crop maintenance during growth and development, and ends with crop harvest, storage and distribution. For good harvest, crop management strategy should be contextualized based on the soil type, topography, climate and availability and affordability of inputs. ==Social aspectsEarly benefits in tribal/clanship culture=== Certain aboriginal clanships benefited from early development of intensive banana cultivation by expanding previously territorial land views into concepts of cooperative inter-clan trading relationships. ===Labor conditions=== Labor conditions in the banana industry have historically drawn attention both in criticism of the traditionally poor industry working conditions, and more recently in attempts by labor advocacy groups and some producers to improve labor conditions.http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/research/researchcentres/CGLR/events/09012008.html Workers on banana plantations in Central America have been exposed to pesticides which have been found to cause various health conditions including sterility. Banana industry advocates maintain that exposure levels were too low to produce health issues, but juries in the United States found Dole Food Company guilty of specific cases of worker sterility related to pesticide exposure in the late 1970s. One successful lawsuit presented evidence that Dole continued to use the pesticide DBCP on banana plantations in Nicaragua after the agent was found by the manufacturer to cause health problems and was banned in California in 1977. The jury found the chemical manufacturer, Dow Chemical, 20% liable and Dole 80% liable because Dow had warned Dole of the dangers of aerial spraying in the presence of workers, yet evidence presented in court indicated Dole continued using the agent in close proximity to workers on its Nicaraguan banana plantations. Financial liability in the case was later stricken because of international jurisdiction issues, however the finding of culpability by the jury was left intact.Spano, John. - \\"Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million\\". - Los Angeles Times. - November 6, 2007.

It is also known as the R. Thornton Brodhead Armory. The armory was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1980 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. ==Description== The Detroit Naval Armory is a limestone structure with four main sections: a vestibule, a drill hall, an office / penthouse section, and a company drill hall. The building mixes Art Moderne and Art Deco influences, and contains a large array of nautically themed WPA art by artists including John Tabaczuk, Edgar Yaeger, David Fredenthal and Gustave Hildebrand. The building faces East Jefferson; the entrance is heavily decorated in military and naval themes using Pewabic tiles. In front of the building is a semi-circular drive encircling a flagpole, unvailed May 26, 1942, in honor of Captain R. Thornton Brodhead and a large Navy anchor from the USS Yantic, a Civil War gunboat whose hull is buried in a filled-in boat slip in Gabriel Richard Park. ==History== In the 1880s, several states formed \\"naval militias\\", the forerunners of present-day Navy and Marine Corps Reserve units. Michigan formed the Michigan Naval Militia in 1893; the militia quickly became a popular pastime for wealthy Detroiters. Even so, the militia fought in both the Spanish–American War and World War I. By 1929, over 600 men were part of the militia, and it had outgrown its existing headquarters. Captain Richard Thorton Brodhead convinced the Michigan state legislature to construct a new building.R. Thornton Brodhead Naval Armory Marine Corps Reserve Center/Detroit Naval Armory from Detroit1701.org The state of Michigan and the city of Detroit pooled $375,000 to build a new armory on Jefferson near the foot of the Belle Isle bridge. Postcard of the Detroit Naval Armory The new armory opened in 1930, and was used as both a training facility and civic event site. The indoor drill floor was used for dances, USO mixers, auto shows, and political and sporting events. In 1932, future heavyweight champion Joe Louis fought his first career bout. Between May 1936 and 1939, improvements were made to the facility by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency that provided employment and created public works projects throughout the United States during the Great Depression. The extensive remodeling and expansion project included a basement motorpool and gymnasium; enlargement of the third floor, to add an officer's wardroom, mess hall and kitchen; and a fourth-floor penthouse wing to accommodate visiting officers. The WPA also funded numerous Federal Art Project contributions to the armory between 1936 and 1941. Captain Brodhead and architect William Stratton accepted a proposal by artist David Fredenthal and reconfigured an entire wall in the wardroom to include bookshelves and a fireplace. Fredenthal and his assistants then created a mural in five panels, in true fresco, depicting the range of experiences on shipboard. He also created a smaller mural in the adjacent bar area. A mural on the four walls of the mess hall was painted by Edgar Yaeger; one of his assistants, John Tabaczuk, carved some 20 insets for wooden doors in the building, as well as a fanciful bannister on the stairway to the penthouse. Gustave Hildebrand, assisted by James Johnson, incised plaster on the four walls at the main east entrance to create 800 feet of bas relief depicting the everyday activities of sailors. This collection of WPA art is the largest collection of federally funded Depression-era artwork of any building in the state; one authority stated that the Detroit Naval Armory contains \\"the richest WPA art collection of any building in Michigan, with the greatest variety of different media in one collection.\\" During World War II, the armory was used as a barracks and schoolhouse for Navy diesel and electrical schools. After the war ended, it was again used as a training center for reservists. The armory was eventually renamed the R. Thornton Brodhead Armory, in memory of its first Naval leader. The armory was home to Marines and Sailors of Headquarters and Service Company, 1st Battalion, 24th Marines until 2004.\\"Brodhead Armory eyed for renovation\\" Detroit Free Press, 2/14/2008 As of 2008, plans were to refurbish the armory to include bowling, fitness and youth boxing club facilities. ==References * \\"Detroit's Abandoned Naval Armory in 43 Ghostly Photos\\" Curbed Detroit (January 16, 2015) Category:Armories on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Armories in Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Infrastructure completed in 1930 Category:Works Progress Administration in Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Art Deco architecture in Michigan Category:Unused buildings in Michigan Category:Federal Art Project Category:1930 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Detroit Naval Armory"},{"id":"20537922","text":"Madlyn L.

After fighting in smaller shows while working as a screen printer in Las Cruces, New Mexico, he joined up with Urijah Faber's Team Alpha Male in 2007. He has since fought in Dream, WEC and now the UFC. His fighting style has drawn comparisons to training partner and former WEC Featherweight Champion Urijah Faber.

Benavidez grew up with his single mother and two brothers. He attended Las Cruces High School, where he began training boxing. At the age of 16, he also began wrestling, discipline in which he became a New Mexico State champion. He continued to wrestle for one semester at William Penn University before dropping out. From the college onwards Benavidez struggled with alcohol and drug abuse before becoming sober, subsequently turning his interest into mixed martial arts. ==Mixed martial arts careerTeam Alpha Male=== Before joining up with Urijah Faber, Benavidez fought in smaller shows and trained while working as a screen printer in New Mexico. Hoping to eventually make a living fighting MMA, he sought out Faber on a trip to California in January 2007. Unable to find Faber's gym, he visited one in Roseville hoping to locate him. There his fighting ability impressed the members and instructors enough (or, in Faber's words: \\"[he] basically beat the crap out of everyone\\") to refer him to Faber. This was only hours before Benavidez' flight home was due and he had to leave for the airport, unable to meet up with him. His flight was then canceled, giving him the chance to meet up with Faber as he had hoped. Benavidez impressed Faber enough to offer him a job at the front desk of his gym, enabling him to leave New Mexico to come train with him and his team. Benavidez then went back to New Mexico, \\"jammed everything into his car\\" and moved to California. After fighting with smaller US-based promotions, Benavidez was offered a fight with Norifumi Yamamoto by Japanese MMA-promoter Dream in July 2008 at Dream 5. The bout was canceled only days before the fight, and Benavidez was instead matched against Junya Kodo whom he defeated by guillotine choke submission. ===World Extreme Cagefighting=== Benavidez was then signed by US-based World Extreme Cagefighting. On December 3, 2008, he fought Danny Martinez at WEC 37 and won by unanimous decision. Benavidez faced Jeff Curran on April 5, 2009 at WEC 40. Benavidez dominated Curran from the opening bell with superior grappling and striking, knocking the opponent down in the first round.

The season concluded after 37 episodes. == Plot == In its 12th and final year, the newly formed Medical Response Unit (MRU) takes centre stage treating patients at the site of accidents and then bringing them to the Emergency Department for continued medical care. The MRU, led by Mike Vlasek, is on the front line of a vast range of medical disasters, including an explosion at a winery and a devastating bus crash. The year starts with the ED team dealing with the shocking aftermath of the news of Erica's death. Bart and Amy continue to be at logger-heads until Bart's wise counsel to a troubled patient results in them starting a secret love affair. Steve joins the MRU and is confronted with demons from his past. Gabrielle must deal with her father's heart attack and new paramedic Jo learns whether she has Huntington's disease. Frank continues to fiercely protect his team, and starts the new intern program.

They would then bring those patients back to the ED and the staff there would assist in their treatment. Along with the addition of the new \\"department\\" the show was also renamed to All Saints: Medical Response Unit, the introduction of Mirrah Foulkes and the new MRU proved to lift the ratings substantially, but then levelled out at where they were prior to the revamp. == Cancellation == In June 2009, after months of rumours that the cancellation of All Saints was imminent, a spokeswoman from the Seven Network informed The Daily Telegraph that the episode order had been trimmed. Season twelve of All Saints would screen 24 episodes instead of the usual 40 episodes and that production would cease in August instead of November. In July 2009, exactly one month later after the first announcement, Tim Worner, Seven's Director of Programming at the time announced that All Saints had been cancelled. He told Michael Idato of the Sydney Morning Herald, \\"All Saints is a show which Seven and viewers have loved. However, an audience shift and increased production costs are behind this tough decision.\\" He also informed Idato that the episode order trim had been reverted and the season would complete a 37 episode order, finishing on episode 493. It was reported after the announcement that since the introduction of the MRU in 2009 it inflated the cost of each episode to $500,000. Many people still argue as to why the MRU was introduced in the first place or should have been removed instead of axing the show if the network was wanting to cut costs. In the Feb/Mar 2010 GQ magazine in 2010, Tim Worner said his one regret was \\"Axing All Saints. But it was the right call at the time and we have two new drama projects in development.\\" ==Episodes References == Category:All Saints (TV series) seasons Category:2009 Australian television seasons Category:2009 Australian television series endings ","title":"All Saints (season 12)"},{"id":"20538184","text":"Privacy protocols are guildlines intended to allow computation while still protecting the individuals involved. It can be developed from just two individuals trying to discover if they both know the same secret, without leaking information about the secret itself. In this case, after the protocol runs, both individuals will either know that they share the secret, or know that they do not share it; they will have gained no additional information about the other's secret. ==Examples of privacy protocols== For example, say the secret is a name of a person. One protocol is to use a random phone number, such as 555-111-2222, then replace the last n digits of the phone number with the secret such as 555-111-JOHN. Then the first person calls the number and leaves a message with the person on the other end for the second person. Next the second person calls the number of their secret and asks if there are any messages for him. One issue with this protocol is that the phone number created might not exist. Another protocol without this issue is to designate an airline, destination and date, and have the first person make a reservation using the name of their secret, then the second person goes and cancels the reservation using the name of their secret. If the second person is not successful, then they don't share the secret. A simple protocol that does not rely on a human third party involves password changing. This works anywhere one has to type in new passwords the same twice before the password is changed. The first individual will type their secret in the first box, and the second person will type their secret in the second box, if the password is successfully changed then the secret is shared. However the computer is still a third party and must be trusted not to have a key logger. A more involved protocol that does not involve any reliance on a third party, human or machine, involves n cups, each with a label of the name of a person that could be the secret. Each individual will then place a slip of paper under each cup, one slip of paper will say 'yes' on it and will go under the cup with the name of the secret on it, all the other slips will say 'no'. Then the labels will be removed, the cups shuffled, then flipped over to reveal the slips of paper. If there is a cup with both slips of paper saying 'yes' on them then they share the secret. There are many other protocols that involve two individuals. ==References== Category:Privacy Category:Secrecy Category:Information sensitivity ","title":"Privacy protocol"},{"id":"20538223","text":"The Baháʼí Faith in Dominica begins with a mention by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, in 1916 as Latin America being among the places Baháʼís should take the religion to. The island of Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939 by Shoghi Effendi, who succeeded ʻAbdu'l-Baha as head of the religion. In 1983, William Nedden is credited with being the first pioneer to Dominica (he arrived on April 19, 1966) at the festivities associated with the inaugural election of the Dominican Baháʼís National Spiritual Assembly with Hand of the Cause, Dhikru'llah Khadem representing the Universal House of Justice. Later research records Ivor Ellard arrived two days before, April 17, 1966. The first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly of Dominica was elected in 1976. Since then, Baháʼís have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community, and in 2001 various sources report between less than 1.4% and up to 1.7% of the island's approximately 70,000 citizens are Baháʼís. ==Pre-history== ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Baháʼí community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world > and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.…(travel to) the Islands of the > West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the > Lesser Antilles (which includes Dominica), Bahama Islands, even the small > Watling Island, have great importance… ===Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades=== Shoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous > stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His > World Order. Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís in Latin American, Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939. There is a record of an Elena Marsella, from Boston, in Dominica before June 1947 though other sources claim no Baháʼí had settled in Dominica through 1966 and other references of Marella show her in the Dominican Republic. ==Establishment== As far back as 1951 the Baháʼís had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands. A Baháʼí made a trip to Dominica specifically to try to reach the Carib Indians on May 7, 1959. Pioneers arrived on April 17 (Ivor Ellard) and 19 (William Nedden), 1966. From 1966 the region was reorganized among the Baháʼís of Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte Amalie with Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assemblies in neighboring islands to Dominica by the end of 1963. Nedden moved to other nearby islands. For five weeks in 1970 Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum toured Caribbean Islands. On the island of Dominica she could only find one Baháʼí, a pioneer from Haita, as the rest were semi-nomadic. From 1972 the regional assembly was reorganized for Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent, Grenada and other Windward Islands. About December 1975 Bahá´ís again visited the Carib Indians; this time leaving them with Baháʼí literature. The first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly of Dominica was elected in 1976 in St. George. In 1977 the first Carib joined the religion Joe Rabess. In 1978 assemblies were elected in St. Luke, St. Paul and St. Joseph. In 1979, Category 5 Hurricane David impacted Dominica and Errol (Bobby) Martin, who was vice-chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Leeward and Virgin Islands and an officer of the Montserrat Amateur Radio Society provided the lone link off the island for communication for some time. Early in 1983 a team of Dominican Baháʼís set out to tour several cities and villages to makes contact isolated Baháʼís as well as promulgate the religion in new areas - they may have been the first time to do so composed only of Dominican citizens. Later in 1983 Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem represented the Universal House of Justice, which succeeded Shoghi Effendi as the head of the religion, at the inaugural Convention for the National Spiritual Assembly of Dominica in Roseau. In October 1984 the Baháʼís of Roseau held a youth conference. In 1988 the National Assembly oversaw the translation and publication of the Hidden Words of Baháʼu'lláh. ==Modern community== Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1982 the Baháʼís starting holding observances of World Religion Day and in 1986 the observance included a tribute of Martin Luther King, Jr. by a Dominican official brought the largest audience so far and coverage by national radio news. Through the rest of 1986 the distribution of a publication of the Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace reached a point where it or the author were noticed in a number of venues from non-Baháʼís until the Baháʼís themselves lead a procession through several villages and an art contest celebrating peace. In 1988 Carib Indians from Belize visited Dominica as part of a Trail of Light series of events Baháʼí Native Americans have been undertaking. Interviews of the travelers was taken and broadcast on Dominican radio several times as well as in print for the island newspaper. Public performances and private audiences between the visiting and native Caribs took place. In 1989 a translation in Creole of The Hidden Words was published and was recognized as a contribution to the preservation of the Dominican culture. In 1990 teams of Caribbean youth traveled among the islands and a team went to Dominica and worked for the Association for the Disabled. In 2000 Baháʼís of Dominica hosted a prayer gathering in an auditorium at the University of West Indies Centre in Roseau and accomplished literacy and education projects. The Dominican government supported the United Nations General Assembly vote on the \\"Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran\\" (A/56/583/Add.3 Draft Resolution) on 19 December 2001. ===Demographics=== According to the 2001 population and housing census for Dominica, 1.4% of the population belonged to \\"other\\" religious groups, including the Baháʼí Faith. However, the 2001 World Christian Database reported 1.7% of Dominicans were Baháʼís. ==See also== *Baháʼí Faith by country *Culture of Dominica *History of Dominica ==References== Category:Religion in Dominica Dominica Dominica ","title":"Baháʼí Faith in Dominica"},{"id":"20538230","text":"Chromodoris thompsoni is a species of very colourful sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Chromodorididae.Caballer, M.; Bouchet, P.

The address is 678 Green Street, although the portion of Green Street in front of the club was renamed Beach Blanket Babylon Boulevard in 1996, in honor of the musical revue that has played at the Club Fugazi since 1974. The theater is on the ground floor in a building which is formally known as Casa Coloniale Italiana John F. Fugazi, a community center for the Italian Colony of San Francisco. The building was financed by a donation from Cavaliere Ufficiale John F. Fugazi, who founded the Columbus Savings and Loan Society in 1893 as well as the Banca Popolare Operaia Italiana in 1906. Both banks eventually merged with the Bank of Italy, which was later renamed the Bank of America. Fugazi had promised to establish a community center for the Italian Colony of San Francisco following the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906, but it wasn't until 1913 that the project began. Fugazi Hall was built in 1913 on a parcel of land donated by Fugazi's second wife, Joanna Fugazi. The building was designed by Italian architect Italo Zanolini, who also designed the Banca Popolare Operaia Italiana building at 2 Columbus Avenue (1906) most recently occupied by the Church of Scientology, as well as the building at 255 Columbus Avenue (1916), most recently occupied by Vesuvio Restaurant. Zanolini also designed John F. Fugazi's private mausoleum chapel at the Italian Cemetery in Colma. Fugazi establish a trust to ensure that future generations of Italian-Americans would be able to utilize the building. The Trust is administered by the Italian- American Community Services Agency (formally known as the Italian Board of Relief and the Italian-American Welfare Agency), which was established in 1916. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Fugazi Hall was a common venue for poetry reading by members of the beat community. Although many might believe that Club Fugazi is referenced in Allen Ginsberg's \\"Howl\\": \\"Noon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack...\\", this actually refers to Fugazzi's in New York City, another Beat hangout (note the two z's in the name in the poem, as well as all the geographical references in that part of the poem being in NYC. The famous Thelonious Alone in San Francisco album was recorded by Thelonious Monk in October 1959 at the Fugazi Hall. ==References== *.

The seat was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model in 1909. Its final member, John Earle, successfully stood for the multi-member seat of Franklin and, shortly after the 1909 election, became Tasmania's the first Labor premier, albeit of an unstable minority government which lasted a week.

There were 18 gang related shootings, seven of which were homicides. Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn called a meeting of community leaders, the Los Angeles Police Department, school representatives, service providers, gang intervention workers, and city departments and facilitated by Patricia Villasenor of the City of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission, to see how, together, they could stop the violence and improve police and community relations.

He is known for his involvement in the Salem Witch Trials and the formation of the Brattle Street Church. Brattle was also a mathematician, astronomer, and an experienced traveler. == Early life == Thomas Brattle was born on June 20, 1658 in Boston, Massachusetts to Elizabeth Brattle née Tyng and Captain Thomas Brattle. He was the couple's second child and the first son to survive past infancy. He had eight siblings, including William Brattle and Catherine Winthrop. Brattle's date of birth is often confused with the first-born son of the Brattle family (also named Thomas Brattle) – who was born on, and died on, September 5, 1657. As a child, Thomas Brattle was exposed to radical forms of the Puritan faith, primarily through his father's participation in the controversial founding of the Third (South) Church, which advocated for ecclesiastical reforms. The church's membership included many notable members such as Samuel Sewall, Samuel Adams, and Benjamin Franklin. At one point in time, Thomas' father, Captain Brattle, was named the wealthiest man in the colony. After the death of his father, Thomas was appointed administrator of the estate on April 12, 1683, leaving him with a large sum of money and a healthy plot of land. Before attending Harvard University in 1676, he attended the Boston Latin School. This school was open to all boys regardless of class, and served to educate and prepare the young men for university. The Boston Latin School is where Brattle met influential Puritan leader Cotton Mather. Although the two men agreed on many social and political ideologies later in life, they did not see eye to eye during their time at the Boston Latin School. It is documented that Thomas Brattle and other schoolmates enjoyed picking on Cotton Mather (to the point where he wrote to his father, Increase Mather, and requested to come home early). After his time at the Boston Latin School, Brattle attended Harvard University and received an AB in mathematics and science. ==Education== In 1676, Brattle graduated from Harvard College with an A.B., equivalent to our modern B.A. At Harvard, Brattle developed marked skill in mathematics and science. Though he is most well known for The Witchcraft Delusion, which was written to argue against the Salem Witch Trials, Brattle was interested in many areas including mathematics, architecture, and astronomy. Brattle gained most of his education on his own due to the bad leadership at Harvard in his undergraduate years. He used whatever books that were available and studied with John Foster and Dr. William Avery. Brattle wrote a letter to John Flamsteed, a mentor of his, stating that no one at Harvard could teach him mathematics so he took it upon himself to do so. Thomas and a group of other prominent colonists studied several comets that appeared in the late seventeenth century. He wrote several essays on these comets. Brattle later travelled abroad and then settled in Boston in 1693, where he pursued a short business career and gave several gifts to Harvard. That same year, he was appointed as the Harvard College treasurer and he served in that position for twenty years until his death. During his time as treasurer, the finances of the college grew exponentially. Brattle was a member of the intellectually elite Royal Society. The Royal Society was a new group of scientific thinkers that practiced a more intense and rational thought process. This group grew much larger in the eighteenth century when it was headed by Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton was so impressed with Brattle's work that he planned to procure his papers on astronomy and math after Brattle's death in order to benefit the Royal Society. In an attempt to obtain them, Newton tried to make his brother, William Brattle, a member of the Society, however William declined. In 1711, Brattle attempted to use a mathematical algorithm in order to end smallpox. Although he failed, it can be seen that Brattle was heavily involved in education and scientific discovery. (Kennedy) Brattle made more substantial contributions to science than any other American of the day. == Personal life == Thomas Brattle's mother was Elizabeth Brattle and his father Captain Thomas Brattle, who was one of Boston's wealthy maritime merchant. He was one of four children, including his brother, William Brattle (and nephew William Brattle), and his two sisters, Elizabeth Oliver and Katherine Winthrop Eyre. Brattle was an accomplished amateur mathematician and astronomer which eventually led him to becoming the unofficial professor of mathematics and astrology at Harvard. There he taught and trained students in return for their assistance in his research. His work was directly influenced by the ideas of Robert Boyle and John Flamsteed, which he communicated to his students. In addition to being a professor, he became the treasurer of Harvard College after numerous donations. Circumstantial evidence indicates that he designed Stoughton Hall at Harvard and his own Brattle Street Meeting House. Brattle lived in London from 1682-1689 in order to study science. There he was involved in both scientific communities which can \\"help us understand a good deal about the progress of scientific expertise in colonial New England,\\" since he was able to communicate information to both communities. Among his accomplishments, he was also a member of Royal Society, and Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. Brattle was also the principal founder of the Brattle Street Church, which broke away from the Congregational church. This sparked an intense dispute between Brattle and famous Puritan minister, Cotton Mather. Rather than being similar to the Puritans, his church was more like the Church of England. He was eulogized by the Reverend Benjamin Colman as \\"worth Christian philosopher, who was also the glory of his country in respect to his excelling knowledge of mathematics\\". Brattle died in Boston, MA, but his death date is still questioned to this day. He was buried in Boston, MA. == Legacy  Salem Witch Trials === Brattle participated in the Salem Witch Trials as one of the observers and commentators. Later, he was one of personages who became more open about their criticisms of the trials. Along with Robert Calef and Thomas Maule, he was particularly critical of the procedures adopted. In October 8, 1692, Brattle wrote a letter to an unnamed English clergyman containing his sentiments. The letter was circulated widely in Boston at the time, and it continues to be studied for its reasoned attack on the witchcraft trials in Salem. The \\"highly literate\\" and \\"satirical tone\\" of the letter was seen as writing beyond its time, leading Perry Miller to call it a \\"milestone in American literature.\\" Brattle denounced the persecution of suspected witches, and his letter revealed a \\"chink in the armor\\" of Puritan ideology. Brattle presents a compelling argument against the legal premises and procedures involved in the afflictions, accusations, and executions, with a particular focus on the invalidity of spectral evidence in proceedings. He argued that the procedures were so contrary to established practice and were dire in their consequences. Brattle's letter was designed to illustrate the wrongful convictions that the Court of Oyer and Terminer made during this time as they based their evidence on witchcraft from intangible evidence. He was careful to not critique the \\"Salem Gentlemen\\", which he referred to as the judges and ministers, but rather focused on critiquing the methods they used. After Governor Phips read Brattle's letter, he ordered that the courts could no longer use intangible evidence as a source to convict individuals of witchcraft. Phips dissolved the court entirely within the same month. Six months later, the Superior Court of Massachusetts took over the remaining witchcraft cases and no one else was found guilty thereafter. Although Brattle's letter was written after 20 people were already wrongfully convicted, his powerful letter helped shape the future of Salem. === Church Reformation === As a result of the reaction toward theological, political, and cultural transformations that affected the whole of New England in the later half of the 17th century, the Brattle Street Church was formed as a result of radical development in the evolution of colonial congregationalism - bringing reason and religion together in a new church. The Congregational Church was broadly catholic, but used conservative principles of congregationalism (that just liberty and privilege should be allowed to all, while imposing nothing upon an individual). Although it did not make any radical changes from contemporary theological consensus - its foundation did represent the first concrete fragmentation of a previously united New England Congregational Community. Outside of his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Brattle and his younger brother William provided new radical ideas that the Puritan Church did not agree with. Brattle preached some of these more liberal ideas in the church he founded, the Brattle Street Church, which led to an argument with Puritan minister Cotton Mather. Also, both Thomas and William improved Harvard College. Thomas donated money many times, served as treasurer of the college, and was an unofficial professor of astronomy and mathematics. When Thomas died, he left the New World with a new rational approach towards thought.  Other Achievements  Brattle is also credited as being the first person to import an organ to the colonies. ==References * Burr, George Lincoln, 1857-1938. \\"Letter of Thomas Brattle\\", F.R.S., 1692\\", Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, 1648-1706.

Hubbard was 17 years old in the spring of 1692 when the trials began. In the 15 months the trials took place, 20 people were executed. == Early life == Elizabeth Hubbard was born in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1674. Hubbard was an orphan who lived with her uncle, Dr. William Griggs. She served as his maidservant. == Involvement in Salem Witch Trials == A group of girls ranging in age from 12 to 20 were the main accusers in the Salem witch trials. This group, of which Elizabeth Hubbard was a part, also included Ann Putnam, Jr., Mary Walcott, Elizabeth “Betty” Parris, Abigail Williams, Elizabeth Booth, Mercy Lewis, and Mary Warren. Abigail Williams and Betty Parris were the first to experience mysterious \\"fits\\", of which symptoms included throwing of objects, screaming, and contortion of the body. Dr. Griggs, acting as town physician, concluded that the source of the girls' behavior was supernatural. As Elizabeth Hubbard was the maidservant of Griggs, it is likely that she was intimately aware of the symptoms involved in the fits. Hubbard had her first recorded fit on February 1, 1692. Hubbard's age allowed her to testify under oath, leading her to have a major role in the trials. Her testimony was considered especially convincing, and she was known for being particularly susceptible to being thrown into fits during trials. During Elizabeth Proctor’s trial, Hubbard purported to be under a deep trance and unable to speak: > \\"I saw the apparition of Sarah Good, which did torture me most grievously, > but I did not know her name until the 27th of February, and then she told me > her name was Sarah Good, and then she did prick me and pinch me most > grievously, and also since, several times, urging me vehemently to write in > her [devil’s] book” As the trials progressed, Hubbard began instigating more and more accusations. She gave her last testimony on January 7, 1693. Records show that she filed 40 legal complaints and testified 32 times. As a result of her testimonies, 17 people were arrested, 13 were hanged, and two died in jail. == Life After Trials == It is unclear what happened to Hubbard after the trials concluded. American historian Mary Beth Norton states in her book In the Devil’s Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692 that Hubbard moved from Salem to Gloucester in Massachusetts. Norton purports that Hubbard married a man named John Bennett, with whom she had four children. Norton cites a published marriage record of a woman named Elizabeth Hibbert, but it is not known with certainty that Elizabeth Hibbert was Elizabeth Hubbard. ==References== Category:1670s births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Place of death unknown Category:Accusers in witch trials Category:American children Category:Colonial American women Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Indentured servants Category:People from Boston Category:People of the Salem witch trials Category:American domestic workers ","title":"Elizabeth Hubbard (Salem witch trials)"},{"id":"20538532","text":"Edwin Regan (born 31 December 1935) is a Welsh prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the second Bishop of Wrexham from 1994 to 2012. ==Biography== Edwin Regan was born in Port Talbot, and studied at St. John's Seminary, Waterford, Ireland, where he was ordained to the priesthood on 5 July 1959. He then served as assistant pastor at St. Alban's Church in Pontypool (1959) and at St. Joseph's Church in Neath (1959–1966). From 1966 to 1967, he attended Corpus Christi College in London, obtaining a diploma in catechetics. Regan served as chaplain to Porthcawl Convent from 1967 to 1971, whence he became director of catechetics and cathedral administrator for the Archdiocese of Cardiff. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Canon in 1978, and Chapter Canon in 1985. He was later pastor of St Helen's Church in Barry (1984–1989) and of St. Mary's Church in Bridgend (1989–1994). On 7 November 1994, Regan was appointed Bishop of Wrexham by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 13 December from Archbishop John Ward, OFM Cap, with Bishops Daniel Mullins and Vincent Nichols serving as co- consecrators. In addition to his Wrexham post, Regan was named Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Cardiff in December 2000, to assist the ailing Archbishop Ward in governing the archdiocese. This appointment was considered unusual, as an Apostolic Administrator is normally named when the sitting Ordinary has either died or resigned. Regan remained in the post until the appointment of Peter Smith as the new Archbishop of Cardiff on 26 October 2001. On 27 June 2012 it was announced that Pope Benedict had accepted Bishop Regan's resignation on reaching the age limit and had appointed Mgr Peter Brignall, Vicar General of Wrexham, to succeed him as third bishop of the diocese. Bishop Regan moved to Blaenau Ffestiniog to serve as a parish priest for five years before finally retiring from ministry. ==References *Diocese of Wrexham *Catholic-Hierarchy *Catholic Church of England and Wales Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh Roman Catholic priests Category:Welsh bishops Category:Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Wales Category:People from Port Talbot Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People educated at Port Talbot County Boys' Grammar School Category:20th-century Welsh clergy Category:21st-century Welsh clergy ","title":"Edwin Regan"},{"id":"20538552","text":"Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by Ronald Reagan even before his presidency officially began, due to the advanced ages of several justices, and Reagan's own highlighting of Supreme Court nominations as a campaign issue. Reagan had promised \\"to appoint only those opposed to abortion and the 'judicial activism' of the Warren and Burger Courts\\".David M. O'Brien, Storm Center, Sixth Edition (2003), p. 69. Conversely, some opposed to Reagan argued that he could \\"appoint as many as five Justices\\" and would \\"use the opportunity to stack the Court against women, minorities and social justice\\".The National Journal (November 1, 1980), Vol. 12, No. 44; Pg. 1838. ==Sandra Day O'Connor nomination== During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.David M.

Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) did not vote. ==William Rehnquist elevation== In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes - Nomination of William Rehnquist, senate.gov Rehnquist's confirmation was largely split along party lines, showing that he had not improved his standing among Senate Democrats since his contentious 1971 nomination to the Court. Rehnquist's elevation to Chief Justice was approved by the Senate by a vote of 65–33 on September 17, 1986. Senators Jake Garn (R-UT) and Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) did not vote. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) made public note on the Senate floor that Senator Garn's vote would have been to confirm had he been present. Democratic Senators who voted against Rehnquist's confirmation as an Associate Justice in 1971 and as Chief Justice in 1986 were Alan Cranston (CA), Daniel Inouye (HI), Edward M. Kennedy (MA) and Claiborne Pell (RI). Two Democrats who voted for Rehnquist's nomination as Associate Justice voted against his nomination as Chief Justice, Thomas Eagleton (MO) and Robert Byrd (WV). ==Antonin Scalia nomination== After deciding to elevate Rehnquist to Chief Justice, Reagan considered both Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat left by Rehnquist's elevation, but ultimately chose the younger and more charismatic Scalia.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes - Nomination of Antonin Scalia, senate.govDavid M. O'Brien, Storm Center, Sixth Edition (2003), p. 71. Scalia was approved by the Senate by a vote of 98–0 on September 17, 1986. Senators Jake Garn (R-UT) and Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) did not vote. ==Anthony Kennedy nomination== Bork (right) with President Ronald Reagan, 1987 ===Robert Bork selection=== Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell was a moderate, and even before his expected retirement on June 27, 1987, Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to form \\"a solid phalanx\\" to oppose whomever President Ronald Reagan nominated to replace him, assuming it would tilt the court rightward; Democrats warned Reagan there would be a fight. Reagan considered appointing Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to the seat, but Congress had approved $6,000 pay raises for Supreme Court Justices in February, raising a problem under the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution, which prohibits a member of Congress from accepting an appointment for which the pay had been increased during that member's term. A memorandum by Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the notion that a Saxbe fix—a rollback of the salary for the position—could satisfy the Ineligibility Clause.Memorandum for the Counselor to the Attorney General, from Charles J. Cooper, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Ineligibility of Sitting Congressman to Assume a Vacancy on the Supreme Court (Aug. 24, 1987) Hatch had been on the short list of two finalists with Robert Bork, but after the Ineligibility Clause had been brought to light, Hatch was no longer under consideration. Reagan nominated Robert Bork for the seat on July 1, 1987. Within 45 minutes of Bork's nomination to the Court, Ted Kennedy (D-MA) took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of Bork in a nationally televised speech, declaring, \\"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens.\\" A brief was prepared for Joe Biden, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the Biden Report. Bork later said in his best-selling book The Tempting of America that the report \\"so thoroughly misrepresented a plain record that it easily qualifies as world class in the category of scurrility\\". TV ads narrated by Gregory Peck attacked Bork as an extremist, and Kennedy's speech successfully fueled widespread public skepticism of Bork's nomination. The rapid response of Kennedy's \\"Robert Bork's America\\" speech stunned the Reagan White House; though conservatives considered Kennedy's accusations slanderous, the attacks went unanswered for two-and-a-half months. A hotly contested United States Senate debate over Bork's nomination ensued, partly fueled by strong opposition by civil rights and women's rights groups concerned with what they claimed was Bork's desire to roll back civil rights decisions of the Warren and Burger courts. Bork is one of only four Supreme Court nominees to ever be opposed by the ACLU. Bork was also criticized for being an \\"advocate of disproportionate powers for the executive branch of Government, almost executive supremacy\\",New Views Emerge of Bork's Role in Watergate Dismissals, The New York Times. as demonstrated by his role in the Saturday Night Massacre. During debate over his nomination, Bork's video rental history was leaked to the press, which led to the enactment of the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act. His video rental history was unremarkable, and included such harmless titles as A Day at the Races, Ruthless People and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The list of rentals was originally printed by Washington D.C.'s City Paper. To pro-choice legal groups, Bork's originalist views and his belief that the Constitution does not contain a general \\"right to privacy\\" were viewed as a clear signal that, should he become a Justice of the Supreme Court, he would vote to reverse the Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. Accordingly, a large number of liberal advocacy groups mobilized to press for Bork's rejection, and the resulting 1987 Senate confirmation hearings became an intensely partisan battle. Bork was faulted for his bluntness before the committee, including his criticism of the reasoning underlying Roe v. Wade. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Joe Biden presided over Bork's hearing.Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 364. Biden stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately. pp. 138–139, 214, 305. At the close, Biden won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage, as his 1988 presidential campaign collapsed in the middle of the hearings. Biden framed his discussion around the belief that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text, and that Bork's strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view. Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote, and then rejected in the full Senate by a 58–42 margin.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes - Nomination of Robert Bork, senate.gov On October 23, 1987, the Senate rejected Bork's confirmation, with 42 senators voting in favor and 58 voting against. Senators David Boren (D-OK) and Ernest Hollings (D-SC) voted in favor, with Senators John Chafee (R-RI), Bob Packwood (R-OR), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Robert Stafford (R-VT), John Warner (R-VA) and Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT) all voting no. ===Douglas Ginsburg selection=== Following Bork's defeat, Reagan announced his intention to nominate Douglas H. Ginsburg, a former Harvard Law professor whom Reagan had appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit the previous year. Ginsburg almost immediately came under some fire for an entirely different reason when NPR's Nina TotenbergNina Totenberg, NPR Biography revealed that Ginsburg had used marijuana \\"on a few occasions\\" during his student days in the 1960s and while an Assistant Professor at Harvard in the 1970s. In 1991, a similar admission by then-nominee Clarence Thomas that he had used the drug during his law school days had no effect on his nomination. It was Ginsburg's continued use of marijuana after graduation and as a professor that made his indiscretions more serious in the minds of many senators and members of the public.The Washington Post: \\"Media Frenzies in Our Time\\"Ginsburg was also accused of a financial conflict of interest during his work in the Reagan Administration, but a Department of Justice investigation under the Ethics in Government Act found that allegation baseless in a February 1988 report. Hall, Kermit, ed., The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States, page 339, Oxford Press, 1992. Prior to being formally nominated, Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration due to the allegations but remained on the federal appellate bench. ===Anthony Kennedy selection=== After Ginsburg's withdrawal, Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy on November 11, 1987, and he was then confirmed to fill the vacancy on February 3, 1988.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes - Nomination of Anthony Kennedy, senate.gov While vetting Kennedy for potential nomination, some of Reagan's Justice Department lawyers said Kennedy was too eager to put courts in disputes many conservatives would rather leave to legislatures, and to identify rights not expressly written in the Constitution.Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 53. Kennedy's stance in favor of privacy rights drew criticism; Kennedy cited Roe v. Wade and other privacy right cases favorably, which one lawyer called \\"really very distressing\\".Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 54. In another of the opinions Kennedy wrote before coming to the Supreme Court, he criticized (in dissent) the police for bribing a child into showing them where the child's mother hid her heroin; Kennedy wrote that \\"indifference to personal liberty is but the precursor of the state's hostility to it\\".Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 55. The Reagan lawyers also criticized Kennedy for citing a report from Amnesty International to bolster his views in that case. Another lawyer pointed out \\"Generally, [Kennedy] seems to favor the judiciary in any contest between the judiciary and another branch.\\" Kennedy endorsed Griswold as well as the right to privacy, calling it \\"a zone of liberty, a zone of protection, a line that's drawn where the individual can tell the Government, 'Beyond this line you may not go.'\\"Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 189. This gave Kennedy more bipartisan support than Bork and Ginsburg. The Senate confirmed him by a vote of 97 to 0. ==Names frequently mentioned== Following is a list of individuals who were mentioned in various news accounts and books as having been considered by Reagan or being the most likely potential nominees for a Supreme Court appointment under Reagan: ===United States Supreme Court (considered for elevation to Chief Justice)=== * William Rehnquist (1924-2005) (nominated and elevated) * Byron R.

It comprises three schools: an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. The elementary and middle school are in the same building, which was built in 1991. Iowa-Grant high school was built in 1960. Across from the current campus is a renovated historical one-room schoolhouse known as Hazel Dell. The school colors are red and black. The school song is Across the Field. The school's mascot is the panther. ==Sports== Iowa-Grant competes in the Southwest Wisconsin Conference (SWC), in Division 5 in football, and in Division 3 in other sports.

Her first solo effort in three years, Case stated that \\"it took a very long time to make\\". As the title of the album suggests, the record's lyrics are permeated with imagery of tornadoes and, more-generally, nature. Thematically Middle Cyclone concerns how Case's upbringing socialized her to form strong emotional attachments to nature and animals, to the neglect of human relationships, and her reconciling \\"the fact that I need love\\". Middle Cyclone features a variety of guest performers, including M. Ward, Garth Hudson, Sarah Harmer, and members of The New Pornographers, Los Lobos, Calexico, The Sadies, Visqueen, Kurt Heasley of Lilys, and Giant Sand. It also features two prominent covers: \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" by Sparks and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" by Harry Nilsson. Middle Cyclone debuted to strong reviews from contemporary mainstream and independent music critics. In particular, Case's voice garnered unanimous praise for its strength, clarity, and emotional range. In December 2009 Case was nominated for two Grammys for her work on Middle Cyclone: Best Contemporary Folk Album and Best Recording Package (the latter nomination shared with artist Kathleen Judge). ==Conception and recording== The recording of Middle Cyclone took place in Tucson, Brooklyn, Toronto, and Vermont. Case herself stated that only the \\"piano orchestra\\" sessions were recorded in Vermont and that the rest was recorded using WaveLab in Tucson. At the time, Case was transitioning from living in Tucson to a recently purchased farm in Vermont, where she recorded in a barn on the property. Case described how the barn was retrofitted to suit her musical needs, as well as the \\"piano orchestra\\" that appears in three of Middle Cyclone's tracks: Of the eight pianos that Case rescued, six were playable after two days of tuning by two tuners. One was a broken player piano, which Case decided had the potential to be repurposed. The open and unconstrained nature of the barn-as-recording studio resulted in several of the tracks on Middle Cyclone having elements akin to a field recording. Case asserted that because of the barn \\"We ended up with robins on the recording and frogs and all kinds of stuff. And with a barn, you just don't have control, which was another element I really liked.\\" \\"Polar Nettles\\" features the aforementioned birdsong 39 seconds into the track, as well as a chorus of spring peeper frogs at the track's end. (The latter fortuitous event was recorded on video and published on ANTI-'s YouTube channel.) \\"Don't Forget Me\\" contains a gust of wind close to the song's end. The final track, \\"Marais La Nuit\\" (French for \\"Marsh at Night\\"), is an actual field recording of the environs around a pond on Case's farm. When asked about the track in an interview with Paste magazine, Case responded \\"I actually went down to the pond and recorded that myself.\\" ==Publicity== New material from Middle Cyclone was first widely publicized when Case performed at Bumbershoot in Seattle, WA on Saturday August 30, 2008, from 1–2:15 pm. In addition to older material such as \\"Favorite\\", \\"Margaret vs. Pauline\\", and \\"That Teenage Feeling\\", the set included four songs from the unreleased album, including \\"I'm an Animal\\", \\"The Pharaohs\\", \\"Don't Forget Me\\", and \\"Vengeance Is Sleeping\\". Fan-made video recordings of the songs were posted the next day to YouTube and received widespread attention shortly thereafter in early September when the videos were posted to websites such as Stereogum. The cover art for Middle Cyclone was released in early December 2008. The image of Case, crouched and ready to spring off the hood of her 1967 Mercury Cougar with a sword in hand received enthusiastic responses from Internet-based media. In a news article entitled \\"Neko Case, Reigning 2009 Album Art Champ\\", Matthew Solarski of Pitchfork Media, stated \\"So Fox Confessor Brings the Flood had some awfully lovely, subtle artwork. But this? My friends, pictures created to accompany music just don't come any better than this.\\" \\"Dear God she is wielding a sword\\" was the subtitle of the article. Images from the sword-and-muscle car photo shoot were also used in advertisements on the ANTI- blog to encourage preordering of Middle Cyclone. On December 15, 2008, ANTI- released an Electronic Press Kit for Middle Cyclone in the form of a YouTube video. It features selections of an interview with Case, excerpts from several Middle Cyclone songs, footage of Case and her band performing the songs, and collage art and animation to bridge segments. The video also provided fans a first listen to parts of \\"Magpie to the Morning\\", \\"This Tornado Loves You\\", \\"Middle Cyclone\\", \\"Polar Nettles\\", and \\"Fever\\" (in addition to two already featured at Bumbershoot: \\"Don't Forget Me\\" and \\"People Got a Lotta Nerve\\"). On February 18, the entirety of Middle Cyclone was streamed by NPR until the album's release on March 3. On February 24 the ANTI- blog released a free mp3 of Neko Case's song \\"Middle Cyclone\\" to commemorate the one year anniversary of the label's blog. The promotion also included a give-away of four autographed copies of the album, with the fifth winner receiving not only a signed copy of Middle Cyclone but also her entire ANTI- catalog: The Tigers Have Spoken, Blacklisted (reissue), Furnace Room Lullaby (reissue), Fox Confessor Brings the Flood (bonus), and Fox Confessor Brings the Flood. ===\\"People Got A Lotta Nerve\\"=== The first single from Middle Cyclone is \\"People Got a Lotta Nerve\\", which initially was released as a free download on January 13, 2009, on the ANTI- blog and the day after on their website. In celebration of Best Friends Animal Society's 25th anniversary in 2009, for every blogger that reposted \\"People Got a Lotta Nerve\\" or iLike user who added it to their profile, Neko Case and ANTI- made a cash donation to the charity. The promotion ran from January 13 to February 3, 2009, with five dollars donated per blog post and one per iLike profile-add. On February 24, \\"People Got a Lotta Nerve\\" was featured as a downloadable track in the \\"Alt Country Pack 01\\" extension for the video game Rock Band 2. Case was interviewed and performed \\"People Got A Lotta Nerve\\" live for QTV on February 24, accompanied by Paul Rigby on acoustic guitar and Kelly Hogan on backing vocals. On March 4, 2009, Case performed on The Tonight Show. The red-head takes aim at a monkey. On March 20 ANTI- released a music video for \\"People Got A Lotta Nerve\\" on both MTV2's early-morning show \\"Subterranean\\" and its YouTube channel. The animated video, created by brother/sister team Paul and Julie Morstad, depicts a red-headed schoolgirl – ostensibly Case – who is ejected from a killer whale's blowhole onto the grounds of an estate. The red-head witnesses the interactions of a multitude of other girls with animals, but is returned to the belly of the whale when she takes aim at one of the animals with a rifle found in the estate's manor house. Various types of interactions between humans and animals are presented in the video, including the care, stewardship and play associated with domesticated animals, hunting, animal servitude, and man-eating. Despite the prominent repetition of the lyric \\"man-eater\\" the video does not depict men or boys. The schoolgirls' childlike activities (climbing, swinging, walking on stilts, jumping rope, piggy-back riding, pillow fighting, and clapping games) take place near and even on animals such as elephants, greyhounds, tigers, rheas, falcons, and monkeys. Animals are depicted in the video with as much agency as the humans: monkeys read pieces of paper, falcons intervene to prevent the red-head from shooting a monkey, the rhea allows two girls to ride on its back, and the tiger eats the girls brushing him. The video also contains several depictions of Case in the form of a portrait hung in the manor's stairwell and the transposition of one of Case's promotional portraits from Middle Cyclone onto the paper one of the monkeys possesses. The black comic scene in which the tiger has eaten his youthful groomers (their shoes and brushes have been left behind as the animal licks its chops) alludes to Case's song \\"The Tigers Have Spoken\\", whose lyrics describe a man-eating tiger driven mad by the isolation of captivity and shot on his chain. ==Reception== Middle Cyclone received generally positive reviews from critics. NPR praised the album's songs as \\"heartbreakingly-beautiful and, at times, comical\\" and praised Case's voice as \\"one of the most memorable and seductive voices in music.\\" The New York Times Daniel Menaker praised her \\"real richness and body,\\" writing that \\"She has often been described as a belter, a force of nature, a kind of vocal tornado. So this increased admixture of playfulness, delicacy and orchestral effects strikes you as the kind of variegation that artists — and species — make in order to survive and thrive.\\" Middle Cyclone debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 albums chart in its first week of release, making it Case's first album to reach the top ten in the United States. As of 2013, sales in the United States have exceeded 223,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of 2010 it has sold 17,000 copies in Canada. ==Middle Cyclone tour== The Europe February 2009 Tour, described as \\"a sneak of the new album\\", began in Berlin, Germany on Wednesday February 18, 2009, and ended on the 23rd in London England. Middle Cyclone's Spring 2009 Tour began at Stubb's BBQ in Austin, Texas on March 31, 2009. It then snaked through the Southeast, US east coast, Canada, and Midwest through the end of April. It was expanded to include locales in the Southwest, US west coast, other locales across North America, and eventually expanded to other continents/countries such as Australia. The band Crooked Fingers opened for the majority of Case's spring 2009 shows. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" - \\" ! colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Middle Cyclone tour itinerary - !

It is a Baroque structure, with a ground floor entrance and a high-ceilinged, second-story sanctuary.Andrzej Trzciński, Traces of Monuments of Jewish Culture in the Lublin Region, Lublin: Wojewódzki Ośrodek Informacji Turystycznej, 1988, p. 21Brian Knox, The Architecture of Poland, New York: Praeger, 1971 (also: London: Barrie & Jenkins, 1971 ), p. 37Jerzy Z.

Also unusual is the three-tiered copper roof that takes the general form of the unique wooden synagogues of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. The first official inventory of important buildings in Poland, A General View of the Nature of Ancient Monuments in the Kingdom of Poland, led by Kazimierz Stronczynski in 1844–55, describes the Great Synagogue of Włodawa as one of Poland's architecturally notable buildings.Piechotka, Heaven's Gates; p. 174 Bird and animal rosettes The original one-story building was expanded in the nineteenth century. The present building is cross-vaulted with lunettes and nine fields. It is supported by four weight-bearing columns, which surround but do not form part of the bimah. The bimah is a 1936 reproduction of the bimah lost in a fire in 1934. The masonry columns survived the fire. The walls and ceilings are molded and painted, and bear both Jewish and Polish motifs. One of the ceiling rosette paintings features the stork, a highly popular symbol of Poland, and the central of the nine ceiling rosettes, in the place of honor over the bimah, is an eagle, which is both a symbol of both Poland and Israel.Malgorzata Podlewska-Bem, The Complex of Synagogue Buildings in Włodawa, Włodawa: Leczynsko-Wlodawskie Lakeland Museum ===Torah Ark=== Torah Ark The Torah Ark is particularly fine.Martin Gilbert, Holocaust Journey: traveling in search of the past, New York: Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 51 It is a 2004 restoration of the Torah Ark built in 1936, itself reproducing from old photographs the wooden Torah Ark lost to fire in 1934.

The Ark is three stories high, with windows on the second and third stories. Elaborate carved arks of this kind were not unusual in Polish synagogues; the Wlodawa Ark was regarded as a particularly fine example, but it is unusual mostly because it survives. At the top of the ark, two Griffins support window openings in the form of symbolic tablets of the Covenant, above this is a \\"Crown of the Torah\\", shaped like a royal crown. The carving of the tablets as a window through which the light of the Torah shines is unusual. Below it is another window, a carved image of a Menorah with carved, scrolling openwork surmounted by a quotation from Psalm 5:8: \\"And in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy Temple.\\" This is surrounded by symbolic references to the ancient Temple service. At the right, priestly hands are carved in a gesture of blessing, on the left there is a basket of fruit representing the Temple offerings. At the first floor level, on both sides of the recess for the scrolls, there are carved musical instruments of which the congregation was particularly proud.Shmuel Spector, Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust, New York: NYU Press, 2001, Vol 3, p. 1452 These allude to the service of the Levites in the Temple and the quotation from Psalm 150:3-4-5: \\"Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre, praise him with tambourine and dancing, praise him with the strings and flute, praise him with the clash of cymbals...\\"Psalm 150:3-4-5 (New International Version) at BibleGateway.com, 1995–2008. The instruments depicted, however, are not ancient in form, but, rather, a distinctly eighteenth-century European style drum, violin, and horn alongside a shofar. There are four Solomonic columns, in the tortile shape believed to have been used in the Temple of Solomon. On the frieze there is a sign in the middle of which the date the new Aron ha-kodesh was built is encrypted: 5696 according to the Jewish calendar, 1936. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, both synagogues were used as German military storehouses. They became museums in 1983, and restoration work continued through till 1998. ==Small synagogue== The Small synagogue or Beit Medrash of 1782–86 is a well-built, -story, hip- roofed building. It has a women's prayer room above the vestibule. The windows were replaced and some alterations made after the devastation of the First World War. The building bears a plaque commemorating these repairs. The elaborate, polychrome folk paintings on the synagogue walls are reproduced from surviving plaster fragments and old photographs. In the post-World War II era the small synagogue was used as a garage.Synagogues of Europe: Architecture, History, Meaning, Carol Herselle Krinsky, M.I.T. Press, 1985, p. 102 In the 1980s it stood as a roofless ruin. ==Kahal office building== The third building in the complex is the Kahal, an administrative building of the Wlodawa Jewish community, built in 1927 or 28. It was continuous use, but was renovated after 1979 and is now the administrative building of the museum. All three buildings hold exhibition rooms that have been used to display both Jewish and non-Jewish exhibits. ==History of the Jewish community of Włodawa== The existence of a Jewish community in Włodawa is first recorded in connection with the Lublin fair of 1531. By 1623 Włodawa had a representative in the Council of the Four Lands. The community's prosperity was due to the granting of a city charter in 1534. For much of the early modern period, a time when the Polish-speaking community of the region was predominately engaged in agriculture, Jews appear to have composed much of the population of the city, engaged in all forms of craft production and trade.Janusz Tazbir, A State Without Stakes: Polish religious toleration in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; translated by A. T. Jordan. New York: Kościuszko Foundation, 1973, p. 128 The community was devastated by the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, but afterwards was re-established and rebuilt. By 1765 the town had 630 Jews. In 1693, the town had 197 dwellings, 89 of which were owned by Jewish families. The census of 1773 records Jewish physicians, butchers, millers, barbers, goldsmiths, tailors, furriers, merchants, and carters, in addition to one Jew in each of the trades of coppersmith, cobbler, glazier, chandler, and wheelwright. There were also 8 Jewish schoolmasters, 2 educators, a cantor, a bass player and a cymbal player. There were 2,236 Jews in 1827 and 6,706 in 1907. In the late nineteenth century Włodawa had a Jewish-owned steam-powered flour mill, tannery and soap factory. Of the 184 stores in the town, 177 were owned by Jews. Wlodawa's first Zionist organization was formed in 1898, the town also had Bund, Agudath Israel and Poalei Zion organizations. There was a Beis Yaakov school for girls. The synagogue complex is unusual not only because it escaped destruction by the Nazi occupiers of Poland, and because the entire suite of Jewish communal buildings is intact, but also because, unlike many other former synagogues in Poland that were destroyed, left to decay, or turned to other uses in the Communist era,Virtually Jewish: Reinventing Jewish Culture in Europe, Ruth Ellen Gruber, University of California Press, 2002, p. 77–8 it was meticulously restored. No Jews are known to be living in the town today. ==Wlodowa Synagogue (London)== The Wlodowa Synagogue was a synagogue in Bethnal Green, London, England.The Jewish Year Book, London: Jewish Chronicle Publications, 1988, p. 98 The congregation was established in 1901 by Jews from Włodawa, Poland, and by London Jewish cabinetmakers. The congregation therefore had two names, Wlodowa Synagogue and The United Workingmen's Synagogue. Immigrant synagogues were frequently named after towns of immigrant origin, much as immigrant parishes were frequently named after the patron saint of towns of the immigrants' origin. The congregation's first building was in Spital Square, and the 1910 move to Cheshire Street was concurrent with a merger with the Hare Street Synagogue. Because of the large number of cabinetmakers in the congregation, the interior woodwork of the simple, three-story brick building was said to be particularly beautiful. The synagogue closed in 1987.Bethnal Green Judaism, British History onlineLindsay, Paul, The Synagogues of London, London: Vallentime Mitchell, 1993, p. 66 ==Gallery== Image:W%C5%82odawa_Great_Synagogue_38.jpg Image:W%C5%82odawa_Great_Synagogue_12.jpg Image:W%C5%82odawa_Great_Synagogue_17.jpg Image:W%C5%82odawa_Great_Synagogue_15.jpg ==References External links == *The United Workmen's and Wlodowa Synagogue on Jewish Communities and Records - UK (hosted by jewishgen.org).

Vaile was born at Hampstead, London, England in 1869. He was a very strong advocate for the building of a government railway between Rotorua and Taupo via Waiotapu and Reporoa. From 1911 onwards he led campaigns and lobbied vigorously for many years to have a railway built between Rotorua and Taupo. He formed and led the Rotorua Taupo Railway League and the Reporoa Railway League, and in 1928 published a campaign pamphlet advocating the construction of a railway between Rotorua and Taupo. In 1929 published another campaign pamphlet titled \\"The truth about the Taupo railway - the story of a great crime\\" advocating the need for and the numerous benefits such a line would bring, in response to the government stopping the project in that year. He stood in the in the electorate as an independent supporter of the Reform Party with the construction of the line as his main issue. The United and Reform Parties had formed the United/Reform Coalition, and Vaile was heavily beaten by both the official coalition and the Labour candidates. In the 1952 Queen's Birthday Honours, Vaile was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community in Auckland. ==Bibliography== * Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966, A.

It has 3 ski lifts, and a snow tubing facility operating in the winter. In the summers, Snow Valley offers weddings, banquet and corporate events. Ski Snow Valley was named \\"best Ontario hill for kids\\" by Ski Canada Magazine in 2001. ==Operations== Snow Valley has 3 chair lifts operating continuously. In the east, the Quad, a 4-person lift services a number of runs. Central to the chalet, there is a 6-person fixed-grip chairlift with a rolling carpet for easy use. Further west, a smaller 3-person chairlift services a terrain park and 3 other hills. The ski resort runs snow machines principally in the start of the season, and grooms all runs daily. All runs (except for one) are lit with lights for snow-skiing year-round. The resort is generally focused on beginner-level, or family recreation. The resort has a learning area with a handle-lift, called the 'Pony Express'. The largest trail, 'Family Hill' is a green-diamond that connects the 4-person and 6-person lifts. The hill has 4 black-diamond runs, and one short double black- diamond run. Occasionally moguls are created on some black-diamond hills. A snow-tubing park, with automated lifts was built immediately west of the ski area in 2002. It features 14 different chutes, with varied elevations. Snow Valley hosts ski races several times a year through Alpine Ontario. Apart from skiing & snowboarding, there is snow tubing, a child care program, and ski/snowboard lessons. They also accept the Grade 4 & 5 SnowPass. ==History== The resort was created by 10 members called the \\"Triple S Club\\" (Ski, Safety and Sociability), in 1952. In 1987 the resort began a fundraiser called M*A*S*H Bash which runs each year for the local RVH Hospital The popular day includes events with themes from the television show, including bedpan races. Snow Valley has had two serious chairlift incidents in its history. One occurred in 1995, but no one was hurt. In 1996 a 19-year-old ski instructor was killed at Snow Valley Resort when his lift derailed. The resort was initially charged with nine counts of failing to comply with safety standards, but the charges were dismissed in 2003 after review. In 2009 a 13 year old boy died after a collision with a tree on a beginner trail. He was skiing on a school trip. In 2012, for its 50th anniversary, Snow Valley offered very discounted season passes to anyone with their 50th birthday that year. ==Related Ski Areas== * Blue Mountain Ski Resort * Horseshoe Resort * Mount St. Louis Moonstone Ski Resort * Beaver Valley Ski Club ==See also== * List of ski areas and resorts in Canada ==References External links == * Snow Valley Category:Ski areas and resorts in Ontario Category:Sport in Barrie Category:Tourist attractions in Simcoe County ","title":"Ski Snow Valley"},{"id":"20538724","text":"Artists for Obama was a series of ten limited-edition fine-art prints created and donated by various artists under the direction of U.S. President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign organization, Obama for America.

The town is first mentioned in the year 767 AD as Chirichheim in the Lorsch Codex. It belonged to the Kurpfalz and formed the heart of an administrative unit called Zent. The early medieval village was composed of three fields, where related settlements were combined by the formation of a central church of representatives of the \\"fraenisch\\" kingdom. Hence the name Kirchheim. The village was largely destroyed in the Thirty Years' War and reconstruction efforts were subsequently thwarted when the village was once again burned during the Palatine war of succession. Kirchheim repopulated slowly, with 350 people in 1766 and 2,000 in 1861. The building of a station on the Rhine Valley Railway in 1865 brought industry to the village. In 1920 Kirchheim was annexed to Heidelberg at which point building boomed and the population swelled to 8,000. Today, Kirchheim has 5 buslines and one tramline.http://www.vrn.de/ With a population of 15,683 it is on the way to becoming the largest district in Heidelberg.http://www.hd- kirchheim.de/html/geschichte_kerches.html ==Neighboring Towns== The following towns border Kirchheim Leimen, Sandhausen, Rohrbach and Pleikartsfoersterhof which all part of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. ==Climate== Kirchheim has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), defined by the protected valley between the Pfälzerwald and the Odenwald. Year-round, the mild temperatures are determined by maritime air masses coming from the west. In comparison to the nearby Upper Rhine Plain, Kirchheim's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. The warmest month is July, the coldest is January. Temperatures rising to more than 30 °C in midsummer are no rarity. According to the German Meteorological Service, nearby Heidelberg was the warmest place in Germany in 2009.Mechthild Henneke: Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009. In: Südkurier, 28. April 2010Kreisbeschreibung Bd. 1, S. 54ffwww.klimadiagramme.de ==Demographics== Although the majority of the population is ethnically German, Kirchheim does have a significant immigrant population from Turkey and the Balkans, as well as Italians, Indians, and Americans. ==Economy== Kirchheim is home to many small businesses. This includes shops, bakeries, restaurants, and hotels; as well as the Holiday Inn Heidelberg which is located on the northern part of town across from the SG Kirchheim sport complex. There is also a tram line and the Heidelberg Kirchheim/Rohrbach train station. ==Art and Culture== Hip Hop had a large influence on the cultural development of Kirchheim in the 1980s and 1990s. Perhaps because of the presence of the American Forces Network which broadcast rap music to US service members stationed in Europe, youth in Kirchheim emulated the music forming their own rap groups and taking up graffiti art. The Stieber Twins, a rap duo consisting of brothers Martin (Marshall Mar, a.k.a. Martin Jekyll) and Christian (Luxus Chris a.k.a. Christian Hyde) are from Kirchheim; and Painter Crew Kirchheim, a graffiti troupe originating on one of the town's main streets (Schwartzwald Strasse) was known for creating vandalistic artwork on public spaces. Kirchheim is also home to several restaurants popular throughout the Heidelberg region including Cafe Pizza Europa, Gasthaus zum Golden Rose, and the Goldener Hirsch. ==Athletics== Kirchheim is home to the Heidelberg Sharks of the German Rugby League, as well as two sporting clubs Sportgemeinschaft Heidelberg-Kirchheim (SGK Heidelberg) which is known for its football and basketball clubs, and Frien Turner (FT) Kirchheim. There is also a horse riding club, Reit und Fahrverein Heidelberg-Kirchheim e.V., as well as a shooting club Schützenverein 1906 e.V. ==Notable people== Due to the location of the headquarters United States Army Europe in Heidelberg, Kirchheim was home to many Americans such as foreign policy expert Alberto Lucini. == Notes  External links == * Category:Geography of Heidelberg ","title":"Heidelberg-Kirchheim"},{"id":"20538774","text":"Cedar hemlock douglas-fir forest is a vegetation association in California, United States.

They have exhibited and collaborated with artists, designers and fashion brands around the world, producing work across a diverse range of mediums. PHUNK was awarded Gold and Silver medals by Promax Asia in six consecutive years between 2001 and 2006. In 2007, the collective was conferred the Designer of the Year Award at the President’s Design Award in Singapore. == Style == The work of PHUNK is greatly influenced by popular culture and its ever-evolving series of metaphors, codes and iconography. Having grown up in the ‘70s and ‘80s, its members are inspired by Hong Kong's kungfu movies and Cantonese TV series, Japanese anime and manga, American TV programmes, DC and Marvel comics, British indie pop, new wave and American rock music, as well as MTV. These continue to be part of a recurring theme that they express through their work. Upon entering art college in the '90s, they began looking to various art and design movements such as the Bauhaus, Fluxus, Situationism, Pop Art, Swiss Modernist and Postmodernist design. This drove them to explore work that blurs the boundaries between fine art and commercial design. PHUNK is known for taking an experimental approach to their projects, combining various contexts and symbols to create a signature visual language and system. To date, they have produced across the fields of art, design, publishing, fashion, music, film and interactive art, exploring mediums ranging from silkscreen prints, mixed media pieces and sculptures to acrylic, wood, and vinyl figurines. == History  1992 – 1994: The Early Years === The members of PHUNK met as design students at LASALLE College of the Arts, where they studied Visual Communications. They had initially thought of starting a band while in college, but decided to found an art collective to further their shared interest in visual art. After graduating in 1994, they started PHUNK as a streetwear label. While the business endeavour did not take off, the name PHUNK remained. === 1995 – 1997: Experimentation, Guerilla Fonts === Between 1995 and 1997, the artists served a two-year period of mandatory National Service with the Singapore Armed Forces. They spent their weekends creating visual works and experimenting with various modes of artistic expression. Eventually, they began to produce visuals and graphics which they sent out to friends and family. This led to their founding of type foundry Guerilla Fonts, which saw them create original digital typeface designs. These typeface designs were later sent to Garage Fonts in Del Mar, California. === 1998 – 1999: Trigger Magazine, MTV Asia === Phiz dingbatsIn 1998, Garage Fonts began distributing Guerilla Fonts' typeface designs worldwide. PHUNK was invited to write the introduction to the book New Typographics 2, published by Japanese publishers PIE books. They subsequently founded Trigger Magazine, distributing 20,000 copies within a week. The launch of the magazine at Zouk further initiated a series of themed nights that the club became known for. PHUNK started a long-standing working relationship with MTV Asia in 1999, while in the design sphere, their creation of Phiz dingbats, marked the start of the collective's unique illustration style. === Early 2000s: Global Recognition, Publishing === The early 2000s saw PHUNK gain recognition regionally and globally. Their artwork featured in numerous group and solo exhibitions, including the retrospective showcase A Decade of Decadence, which was held at the Singapore History Museum to commemorate their 10th anniversary. In 2004, they were selected to represent Singapore at the Place project, which opened at the Museu Valencia de la Il.lustració i La Modernitat, in València, Spain. The following year, PHUNK exhibited as part of the Gwangju Design Biennale, and subsequently presented at London Design Festival 2006 as part of 20/20 Singapore Design Movement. The collective also furthered their foray into publishing with the launch of two books during this period: Transmission 02: Utopia and Mono Number One: Phunk Studio. === 2007 – 2008: Solo Exhibitions, President's Design Award, TRANSMISSION === In 2007, PHUNK was selected to exhibit at the Young Talents show in Art Cologne, where they were nominated for Best of Show. They launched several solo exhibitions, including Universality, which opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei; Universe, at Art Seasons in Singapore; and Universe II, at the Gallery J. Chen in Taipei. PHUNK was also appointed as artists for the Circle Line Art Project by the Land Transport Authority. They began collaborating with Levi Strauss & Co. on a number of T-shirt series that were launched in Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, and presented a solo exhibition at the Levi's flagship store in Paris. That same year, PHUNK was recognised for their work for MTV's Top 100 Hits show packaging, receiving the Certificate of Typographic Excellence at the 54th Type Directors Club’s Type Design Awards. They were subsequently commissioned by MTV Asia to re-design their on-air channel. 2007 also saw PHUNK launch Universality, an art book published by Page One. PHUNK made history when they were named Designer of the Year at the President's Design Award 2007, becoming the youngest recipient of the highest design accolade in Singapore. In 2008, PHUNK was named as part of the inaugural design jury for the Cannes Lions. They were also invited to participate in STPI’s artist-in- residence program, for the BMW Young Asian Artist Series. They launched TRANSMISSION, an experimental, multi-disciplinary laboratory that saw them mentor and share their experience, knowledge and skills with younger creators. Subsequent editions were held in 2010, 2012 and 2014. Elsewhere, PHUNK was represented at New Wave – Singapore's Contemporary Design Culture, an exhibition hosted by the Center for Creative Communications in Shizuoka, Japan. They launched a solo exhibition at the Korea International Art Fair, and was named as one of 50 Local Heroes in Singapore by Time Out.

His father was also a good poet of Persian language. Har Karan is best known for his book Insha-i-Har Karan written in Persian language during the last days of Jahangir and early days of Shah Jahan. \\"One day in the reign of the Emperor Shah Jahan, Har Karan Kamboh had sat at the seat of Empire in the city of Matura (Mathura) in the company of his agreeable companions and chosen friends and devoted himself to improving his skills as Munshi (Secretary)\\".Empire and Information : Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India, 1780-1870 (Cambridge Studies in Indian History and Society), Cambridge University Press 2000, p 285, C.

And there followed a selection of letters to different classes of people indicating how princes write to princes, diplomatic (firmans, parwanahs), letters between notables and legal documents including certificate for the sale of a slave girl etc. The result was his famous Insha-i-Har Karan (The Form of Har Karan) in Persian language which soon became an established model of excellence.Eastern Librarian, 1968, p 15, East Pakistan Library Association; Empire and Information : Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India, 1780-1870 (Cambridge Studies in Indian History and Society), Cambridge University Press 2000, p 285, C.

The work was compiled between 1625 AD and 1631 AD. Insha-i-Har Karan is divided into seven sections and contains models of letters and other documents relating to the State. Furthermore, Insha-i-Har Karan was also used as a model for diplomatic correspondence with the native princes and potentates by the British in India and also as a model for school children learning Persian-letter writing in the schools. Not much is known about his other works but Insha-i- Har Karan was indeed considered an excellent book till British rule. It was translated into English language by Francis Balfour M.D. The second edition of it was printed in England in 1804. In the beginning of his book, Har Karan introduces himself as “the ignorant lowly pauper, the weakest servant of the eternal God, Har Karan, son of Mathuradas Kamboh from Multan” (Faqir-i haqir-i hechmadan, azhaf min ibad Allah As-Samad, Har Karan Valad-i Mathuradas Kamboh Multani).Aian-i- Khemkaran, Lahore, 1925, p 283, S Pratap Singh Nibber. ==See also== Kamboj in Muslim and British Era ==References== Category:Medieval India Category:People from Multan ","title":"Har Karan Ibn Mathuradas Kamboh Multani"},{"id":"20538807","text":"Austin Island is one of several Canadian arctic islands in Nunavut, Canada within western Hudson Bay.

Porter was the president of the Boston Red Stockings of the National League from through . During his tenure as president, the club made a tour of England. In 1900, Porter was part of a group that attempted to secure a Boston franchise in the new American League. Porter negotiated a deal for the club to play in Charles River Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had selected a person to manage the affairs of the team, but his group backed out after the league's backers met with a rival group. Boston would join the American League in 1901 when Cleveland businessman Charles Somers formed what would become the Boston Red Sox. Porter was a member of the Adams Academy's board of management from the school's organization in 1871 until 1888. ==Political career== Porter was a member of the Quincy board of selectmen from 1879 to 1880. From 1881 to 1882 he represented Quincy and Weymouth in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1888, Porter was elected Mayor of Quincy in the city's first mayoral election. Porter also served on Quincy's school committee for seven years and was a member of the inaugural Quincy's park commission. Porter served a member of the state board of health during the governorships of Roger Wolcott and Curtis Guild Jr. In 1899 he was appointed to the state civil service commission. In 1910 he was appointed by Governor Eben Sumner Draper to serve on a commission that investigated and reported on the care of tuberculosis patients. ==Illness and death== Porter underwent an operation in the spring of 1910. His health declined afterwards and he died on August 10, 1911, at his home in Quincy. ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1911 deaths Category:American businesspeople in insurance Category:Major League Baseball team presidents Category:Boston Braves owners Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:Mayors of Quincy, Massachusetts Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:Union Army officers ","title":"Charles H.

It was first discovered in the eyes of a dog in China in 1910. By 2000, over 250 human cases had been reported in the medical literature. ==Morphology== The adult Thelazia callipaeda worm typically measures 5 to 20 mm in length and 250 to 800 µm in diameter. The males tend to be smaller than the females in size. In distinguishing this species from other worms, they have a distinct buccal capsule and a cuticle with spaced transverse striations giving it a ridged appearance. Adult females could also be identified by the position of their vulva which is anterior to the oesophagus-intestinal junction. The males can be distinguished by their possession of five pairs of postcloacal papillae. ==Hosts== In addition to humans, cats and dogs, definitive hosts of T. callipaeda include the wolf (Canis lupus), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), red fox (Vulpes fulva), and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This species has been found in China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Croatia and Thailand. Two intermediate hosts have been identified so far: Amiota (Phortica) variegata (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in Europe and Phortica okadai in China, which feed on tears of humans and carnivores. Some data suggests that only the males of A. (P.) variegata carry Thelazia callipaeda larvae. This is noteworthy because in all other known cases of blood-feeding flies which transmit parasites, the parasites are carried by the females. ==Life cycle== The eggs of Thelazia callipaeda develop into first stage larvae (L1), in utero while the female is in the tissues in and around the eye of the definitive host. The female deposits these larvae, which are still enclosed in the egg membranes, in the tears (lacrymal secretions) of the host. When a tear-feeding fly (intermediate host) feeds, it ingests the T. callipaeda larvae. Once inside the fly, the L1 larvae \\"hatch\\" from the egg membrane and penetrate the gut wall. They remain in the hemocoel (the fly's circulatory system) for 2 days, and then invade either the fat body or testes of the flies. In these tissues, the larvae develop into third stage larvae (L3). The L3 migrates to the head of the fly, and is released in or near the eye of a new host mammal when the fly feeds again. Once in the eye, eyelid, tear glands, or tear ducts of the mammalian host, the L3 larvae develop through the L4 larval stage and into adults in about 1 month. The seasonal timing of L1 and L4 larvae in the lacrymal (tear) secretions of naturally infested dogs in Italy was found to coincide with the activity of the fly vectors. ==Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment== Thelazia callipaeda in the eye of a dog Symptoms of T. callipaeda infestation include conjunctivitis, excessive watering (lacrimation), visual impairment, and ulcers or scarring of the cornea. In some cases, the only symptom is the worm obscuring the host's vision as a \\"floater\\". Diagnosis is made by finding the adult worms in the eye or surrounding tissues. Human cases are treated by simply removing the worms. In canines, topical imidacloprid with moxidectin, or milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) have been recommended. In canines, prevention against canine thelaziosis by monthly administrations of a combination of milbemycin oxime and afoxolaner has been found effective. == References == Category:Parasitic nematodes of humans Category:Parasites of cats Category:Parasites of dogs Category:Spirurida Category:Parasitic nematodes of mammals Category:Veterinary helminthology Category:Nematodes described in 1910 ","title":"Thelazia callipaeda"},{"id":"20538886","text":"HNNK Hrvat Chicago ( Chicago Croatians) is a Croatian-backed soccer club from Chicago, Illinois.

Khan served as a parliamentarian and one of the senior most members of the All India Muslim League. Muhammad Yamin Khan was a close confidant of Quaid-e- Azam. He was a member of the working committee of All India Muslim League. He also remained Deputy President of the Indian legislative Council. He also presided over the third \\"Kamboh Conference\\" held in Bareilly in 1936.

The St Kilda wren on the island of Hirta is often found nesting in crevices on the cliffs, and in association with puffin colonies, but that is not the case with the Fair Isle wren, where the low red sandstone cliffs are rather bare, with friable rock and earth slides, and small patches of tufted vegetation. The main breeding habitat of Fair Isle wrens is boulder beaches at the tip of long inlets. The boulders provide the shelter lacking on the cliffs, but even so, the windswept south-west of the island hosts few wrens. No breeding seems to occur in the crofting area, although the birds may feed here later in the year when the young are independent. ==Ecology== The Fair Isle wren spends much time feeding on the foreshore among the dead seaweed cast up by the tide. Their diet includes sandhoppers and other crustaceans, and the larvae of flies. ==Status== Fair Isle is a small island, in area, and the population of the wren is tiny, varying from ten to fifty pairs, breeding mainly on boulder beaches. ==References== Category:Troglodytes (bird) Category:Endemic fauna of Scotland Category:Biota of Shetland Category:Birds described in 1951 Category:1951 in Scotland Wren Category:Endemic biota of the Scottish islands ","title":"Fair Isle wren"},{"id":"20539009","text":"The Moonlight Brewing Company is a brewery founded in 1992 by Brian Hunt in Santa Rosa, California, USA.

With a degree in Fermentation Science from UC Davis, and years experience as a brewmaster and beer consultant, Hunt saw the brewery as a chance to become self-employed. At the age of 35, he rented an tractor barn in Windsor, California and bought 200 used beer kegs. In 2003 the brewery was moved to a building designed specifically for the purpose of brewing beer and was designated an Abbey through the Universal Life Church. Moonlight Brewing cultivates a large field of hops for its seasonal Homegrown Ale on the old property. In 2018, Moonlight opened a small taproom with limited retail sales in Santa Rosa. ==Production== Due to its relatively small production, 2,700 barrels in 2017, beer is limited mostly to kegs served almost exclusively in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2018, Moonlight began selling the flagship Death & Taxes in cans. ==Beer== Currently, the brewery produces a large variety of beer, including frequent seasonals. The five year- round production beers includes Death & Taxes (black lager), Reality Czeck (Czech-style pilsner), Lunatic Lager, Misspent Youth (Dry) Pale Ale, Bombay by Boat (IPA), and Twist of Fate (bitter ale). Homegrown is a fresh hop ale that is produced using hops that are solely from the brewery's quarter-acre hopyard and harvested in mid-September. Working for Tips Ale is brewed with Springtime Coastal Redwood branch tips around late May. Bony Fingers is a seasonally produced black lager, brewed specifically for Halloween.

The adults of all Thelazia species discovered so far inhabit the eyes and associated tissues (such as eyelids, tear ducts, etc.) of various mammal and bird hosts, including humans. Thelazia nematodes are often referred to as \\"eyeworms\\". ==Signs and symptoms== In animal and human hosts, infestation by Thelazia may be asymptomatic, though it frequently causes watery eyes (epiphora), conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, or corneal ulcers (ulcerative keratitis). Infested humans have also reported \\"foreign body sensation\\"the feeling that something is in the eye. ==CauseLife cycle=== In the uterus of the adult female, the embryos develop into first-stage larvae (L1), which remain in the eggshell (sheath). The female deposits these sheathed larvae in the tears of the mammal or bird definitive host, and the larvae are ingested by tear-feeding flies. In the fly, the larvae \\"hatch\\" (exsheath), penetrate the gut wall, and migrate to either the fat body, testes or egg follicles (depending on the species). There they develop into third- stage larvae (L3), which migrate to the head of the fly. The infective L3 larvae wiggle out of the straw-like feeding apparatus of the fly when it feeds on the tears of another mammal or bird host. The L3 larvae develop into adults in the eye or surrounding tissues of the host, where they may live for over one year. In the definitive host, Thelazia have been found in various tissues of the orbit (or socket) of the eye, including within the eyelids, in the tear glands, tear ducts, or the so-called \\"third eyelid\\" (nictitating membrane) or in the eyeball itself. ===Hosts and geographic range=== While a few dozen species of Thelazia have been described in the literature, only three have been reported to infest humans, and only seven are commonly reported in veterinary contexts. The remaining species are occasionally found in birds or wild mammals. In humans, dogs and cats, thelaziasis cases due to Thelazia callipaeda (Asia, Europe), and occasionally T. californiensis and T. gulosa (western North America), have been reported. Horses are infested by T. lacrymalis (worldwide) and, less frequently, by T. rhodesii (Africa, Asia, Europe). In cattle, T. gulosa (Asia, Europe, North America), T. rhodesii (Africa, Asia, Europe) and T. skrjabini (Europe, North America) are the primary species of concern. In camels, T. leesei infestations have been reported from the Post-Soviet states and India. The intermediate hosts of several Thelazia species are known, and in each case they are tear-feeding flies of the genera Musca (family Muscidae), Phortica (family Drosophilidae), or Fannia (family Fanniidae). ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis involves simply examining the eyes and nearby tissues for the worms. Adult Thelazia are very active, one author described T. californiensis as a \\"short lively piece of nylon fishing line about 10 mm long.\\" ==Treatment== Because they live so close to the outside of the body, Thelazia is one of the few nematode infections which can be treated topically. Topical treatment of livestock,http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30401.htm dogs and catshttp://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30402.htm with organophosphates (such as ecothiopate iodide or isofluorophate) and systemic treatment with anthelmintics (such as ivermectin, levamisole, and doramectin) are recommended by the Merck Veterinary Manual. Other sources have reported positive results treating dogs with moxidectin, imidacloprid, or milbemycin oxime. For the treatment of human cases, removal of the worm is suggested. Topical treatment with cocaine or thiabendazole have also been reported to kill the worms in human cases. Because most, if not all, species of Thelazia are spread by flies, sanitary practices which reduce the presence of flies will also reduce the spread of thelaziasis. In canines, prevention against canine thelaziosis by monthly administrations of a combination of milbemycin oxime and afoxolaner (NexGard Spectra) has been found effective. ==Prevalence== By one author's count, 257 human cases of Thelazia callipaeda had been reported worldwide by the year 2000, though thelaziasis is still considered to be a rare disease. Various livestock and wildlife surveys suggest that thelaziasis is quite common among animals. *A slaughterhouse survey in Canada found that about one-third (32%) of cattle over an 8-month period were infested with eyeworms. *A survey of horses in Kentucky revealed a 42% rate of infestation with Thelazia lacrymalis. *In Wyoming and Utah, a survey of hunter-harvested mule deer found 15% to be infested by Thelazia californiensis. *A survey of various sites in Italy found 23-60% of dogs, 5% of foxes and 4 out of 4 cats to be infested with Thelazia callipaeda. *In a study of dogs living in western Spain, 39.9% of the dogs were found to have Thelazia Callipaeda worms living in their eyes. == References  External links == Category:Bovine diseases Category:Cat diseases Category:Dog diseases Category:Helminthiases Category:Spirurida Category:Veterinary helminthology ","title":"Thelaziasis"},{"id":"20539082","text":"Dolok Sanggul is a town in North Sumatra province of Indonesia and it is the seat (capital) of Humbang Hasundutan Regency.
