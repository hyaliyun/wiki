The track was written and composed by Fredrik Kempe, David Kreuger, Hamed \\"K-One\\" Pirouzpanah. It premiered on 8 February 2014, as part of the second semi-final in Melodifestivalen 2014. The song successfully progressed to the final. The single was officially released on 23 February 2014, part of the EP of the same title. Undo is an uptempo ballad. On 8 March, the song won the Melodifestivalen 2014 final beating Ace Wilder's \\"Busy Doin' Nothin'\\" by only two points and represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in the first semifinal on 6 May. In the final, on 10 May 2014, after the results came through, \\"Undo\\" finished the contest in 3rd place with 218 points. With this score, \\"Undo\\" became the second highest scoring Swedish entry at Eurovision after Euphoria. \\"Undo\\" won the OGAE vote with 354 winning the voting after all countries had voted. \\"Undo\\" was sung by Lucia Wu, a Chinese singer from Brazil on Season 1 of Sing! China in 2016. This led to the song charting on streaming platforms in China in October 2016. == Critical reception == The song's reviews were mostly positive and was often described as the selection's favorite. Olivier Rocher of Oikotimes described it as \\"the hot favorite of the night\\". He also said that \\"Undo\\" is less memorable compared to her previous Melodifestivalen entries. Billy Xifaras of Wiwibloggs said that Nielsen is perhaps one of the strongest artists in the second semi-final. He also compared the song with \\"Wrecking Ball\\" by saying that \\"in the beginning it is similar to Miley Cyrus' hit\\". With 10 reviews from the Wiwibloggs, \\"Undo\\" received an average of 8.2 out of 10, the second highest score at the final of Melodifestivalen, with Elena Paparizou's \\"Survivor\\" being first with an average of 8.48 out of 10. Deban gave the song a rate of 8.5 and said that vocally the song is epic. He also said that \\"the song is well-crafted, and although the formula is predictable, Sanna Nielsen's performance keeps us guessing\\". Padraig gave the song 9 out of 10 and said that after developing an urge to listen very often, the song became his favorite of the selection. Both Deban and Padraig criticized the contestant's clothing appearance with the first saying \\"please don't age a beautiful twenty something year old girl. It doesn't win votes!\\" while the second said that \\"Sanna is 29 and not 49\\" and pleased the Melodifestivalen wardrobe department to \\"quit dressing lamb up as mutton.\\" Angus described the song as an excellent entry that could do well for the Swedes and gave it 9.5 out of 10. Zach gave the song 10 out of 10 and said that as all her other Melodifestivalen entries, \\"Undo\\" was one of his favorites. Patrick said that the song is \\"a masterpiece of music\\" and gave it 10 out of 10. Even though Sami gave the song a rather good rating – 6 out of 10 – he said that the song is overrated and is just an okay pop ballad. He also compared it with a song by Eric Saade, \\"It's Gonna Rain\\", which is also written by one of \\"Undo\\"'s writers, Fredrik Kempe. Anthony gave it 8 out of 10 and described it as \\"a very good entry and I can see why it's one of the favorites to win this year\\". James and Franceska gave the song 8 out of 10 and 9 out of 10 respectively. Lastly, Ramadan gave the lowest score for the song – 4 out of 10 – and said that \\"it's alright song but it takes quite a while to get going\\" and also criticized Sanna's clothing. == Melodifestivalen == Being Nielsen's seventh participation in the selection, \\"Undo\\" participated in the second semi-final of the 2014 Melodifestivalen which was held in Linköping's Cloetta Center on 8 February 2014. The previews of the second semi-final songs, including \\"Undo\\", were published on 6 February 2014. The song was performed sixth at the second semi-final. It direct qualified to the final as it got one of the first two places. Right after the second chance, the running order of the final was revealed with \\"Undo\\" being performed at the eighth place. \\"Undo\\" won the selection just with two points ahead Ace Wilder; it received 90 points from the international jury and 122 points from the public. ==Track listingCharts Weekly charts === { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" !Chart (2014) !align=\\"center\\"Peak position - !scope=rowAustralia (ARIA)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 81 - - - - - - - - ! scope=\\"row\\" Iceland (RÚV)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 11 - - - - - - - } === Year-end charts === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !Chart (2014) !Position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 52 } ===Certifications=References== Category:2014 songs Category:Eurovision songs of 2014 Category:Melodifestivalen songs of 2014 Category:2014 singles Category:Parlophone singles Category:2010s ballads Category:Pop ballads Category:Sanna Nielsen songs Category:Songs written by Fredrik Kempe Category:Songs written by David Kreuger Category:Songs about loneliness Category:English-language Swedish songs Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Undo (Sanna Nielsen song)"},{"id":"42045602","text":"Dongshan is a subdistrict of the Yuexiu District in Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, southern China. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Guangdong Category:Administrative divisions of Yuexiu District ","title":"Dongshan Subdistrict, Guangzhou"},{"id":"42045604","text":"The Desha County Courthouse, on Robert S.

Vroman's family moved frequently throughout much of his early life, residing in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia before settling once again in Camp Hill, where Vroman graduated from high school in 1993. Vroman attended eight different schools over the course of these moves; he has stated that he often had difficulty becoming involved with his peers due to the regularity of his being introduced to new communities. This experience later inspired his philosophy to \\"live life in the 'front row'\\" by actively taking charge of one’s own life, after Vroman witnessed a group of ecstatic college students at the front row of a concert, and made the observation that their enjoyment of the show differed from the disinterest of attendees sitting further back. Vroman’s motivational speaking continues to emphasize the importance of cultivating strong interpersonal relationships and building a sense of community with the various people in one’s life. Vroman married his wife, Russian native Tatyana, in 2008 at a ceremony in Siberia. They reside in the town of Austin Texas, with their two sons, Tiger and Ocean. ==Front Row Foundation== In 2005, Jon co-founded The Front Row Foundation. The initial funds for the Foundation were raised after a 53-mile, double marathon in 2005. This non-profit organization works to help people with critical health challenges take part in an experience that they have always dreamed of. The foundation helps these people live their lives to the fullest by providing front row seats to any live event of their choice so that they can “experience life in the front row.” The goal of the Foundation is to provide a Front Row experience that will allow individuals to set aside any physical or emotional challenges while they celebrate the beauty and emotional energy of life. Because great experiences in one's life are remembered forever, The Front Row Foundation focuses on providing individuals with a life-changing memory, one experience at a time. Volunteers of the Front Row Foundation do what they do because of their deep belief in the healing powers of the mind and its immeasurable ability to nourish the human spirit. To date, the charity has raised over $1,000,000 and has been instrumental in over 60 life-changing experiences. Jon and the Front Row Foundation were featured on the Today Show in 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD_MJvwD-3E On May 14, 2018, Vroman gave a TEDx Traverse City talk about Front Row. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DqMeYwJFMo ==Front Row Global== As the author of “Living College Life in the Front Row”, Jon was able to draw on his past experiences and help motivate individuals to live up to their fullest potential. In 2005, Jon started Front Row Global, where he travels across the country to speak with college students and corporate team members about how they can move from the back row of life to the front row. Vroman facilitates his hour long keynote message at numerous locations throughout America. The message Jon delivers as a speaker of Front Row Global is to capture the key ideas individuals need for their personal growth and change. This is captured through the idea of being a participant, not a spectator. This encourages individuals to step out of their comfort zone and live life to the fullest. Vroman was voted \\"Campus Speaker of the Year\\" two years in a row by the Association for the Promotion of Campus Activities. Vroman founded an organization, Front Row Dads, for fathers looking to be more present and engaged with their children.

Their top team most recently played in the USPHL in the Premier Division while also fielding a team in the Elite Division. ==History== thumbnail thumbnail In 1996, the Syracuse Junior Crunch were founded to play Canadian Junior A in the Metro Junior A Hockey League, which was absorbed by the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League in 1998. The team moved to Auburn that year, and was renamed the Auburn Junior Crunch. In 2005 the franchise was sold and renamed the Syracuse Stars, joining the American Tier III Junior A Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL). While they played in Syracuse, they also had a Junior B team in the Empire Junior Hockey League (EmJHL). On December 9, 2009, Maksymum Hockey LLC, based in Rochester, New York, announced plans to operate the Stars and move them to Rochester beginning with the 2010–11 season. During this time they were called the Rochester Stars and were affiliated with the Tier III Junior B Maksymum Junior Hockey Club in the (EmJHL) and were no longer affiliated with the Junior B Syracuse Stars that continued to play in the EmJHL. The Rochester Stars began playing at the Bill Gray's Regional Iceplex. In 2013, the EJHL dissolved after several members left to form the United States Premier Hockey League. By the beginning of the 2013–14 season, the Stars joined the USPHL in the Elite and Empire Divisions (with the former EJHL team in Elite and the former EmJHL team in the Empire). Both teams were renamed to the Rochester Jr. Americans. In 2014, the Jr. Americans promoted their Elite Division Tier III team to the USPHL's Premier Division for the 2014–15 season and began playing against many of the former EJHL members. For the 2015–16 season they switched their team from the Empire Division (recently renamed USP3 Division) to the Elite Division. In 2016, the USPHL removed the Jr. Americans from the league and announced a new organization called the Rochester Jr. Monarchs would take their place in the Elite and youth divisions. ==Team members and regular season== The Rochester Jr. Americans held tryouts in April of each year. The season started the day after Labor Day and playoffs finished during the third week of March each year.

Vitamix has been based in Olmsted Township, Ohio, since 1948. It employs more than 700 people, most at its Northeast Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities. Although soap operas came earlier, Vitamix was the first company to produce (1949) and broadcast (1950) an infomercial for a specific manufactured product.After several live broadcasts from several cities during 1949, the company founder's recorded in 1949 what became the infomercial initially broadcast in 1950: ==History== Vitamix is privately owned and operated by the Barnard family. The company was founded in 1921Barnard saw a blender at a trade show in 1937 and .. when William Grover Barnard began traveling the country selling modern kitchen products. It was by helping a friend through his illness that Barnard began to recognize the importance and impact that whole-food nutrition had on one's health and well- being. At that point, Barnard changed the name of the company to The Natural Food Institute. In 1937 Barnard saw a blender at a trade show and introduced his own variations, creating a more durable and reliable series of blending machines. The name \\"Vita-Mix\\" emphasized \\"vita,\\" meaning \\"life.\\" In 1949, Bill Barnard, son of William, convinced his father to take his Vita-Mix demonstrations to local television advertising. The company pioneered the first infomercial. Bill Barnard inherited the business and in 1964 officially changed the name to Vita-Mix Corporation. The company's Vitamix 3600, the first blender that could make hot soup, blend ice cream, grind grain, and knead bread dough, was released in 1969. In 1985, John Barnard and his brother created the Mix'n Machine, a high-performance commercial blender. In February 2006, Blendtec sued Vitamix Corporation for infringing its patents on Blendtec's \\"Wild Side\\" jar design, which Vitamix had allegedly copied as its own MP and XP containers. The court concluded Vitamix had infringed Blendtec's patents, and awarded Blendtec total damages of approximately $24 million, the largest patent-related penalty in the history of Utah.Vitamix Infringement Case Summary In 2009, Dr. Jodi Berg became President of Vitamix, making her the fourth generation of the Barnard family to hold the title. She became CEO in 2011.The most distinguishing characteristic of Vitamix models is the 2 different motors featuring 2HP and 2.2HP. The 2HP motors were produced over many years since the introduction of the Vitamix 5000 model and the 2.2HP was first released 2012 only. == Patent Lawsuit == In February 2006, Blendtec sued Vitamix Corporation for infringing its patents on Blendtec’s “Wild Side” jar design, which Vitamix had allegedly copied as its own MP and XP containers. Vitamix lost the suit and was ordered to pay 23 million dollars in damages. ==21st century== The Vitamix product line, described as having a $400 starting price,, has been covered by The New York Times. ==Product recalls== Over 100,000 products sold in 2017 and 2018 were recalled because of danger; one magazine headlined \\"Vitamix recall: Your $500 blender might hurt you.\\" ==Community Involvement== In 2019, Vitamix entered into a $200,000 partnership with Olmsted Falls City Schools, an Ohio “Triple A” public school district located in Olmsted Falls, Ohio, where the company is headquartered. The sponsorship deal includes naming rights to the district’s high school football field, student curriculum enhancements, and food services support. ==References *Vitamix web site Category:Kitchenware brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1921 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Ohio Category:Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:American brands ","title":"Vitamix"},{"id":"42045833","text":"Herrman S. Saroni (February 1824 in Bernburg, Germany – August 29, 1900 in Marietta, Ohio) was an American composer, author, and publisher.David Frances Urrows, Grove online Title page of Saroni's 1855 work \\"The Lover's Leap Galop\\" from the Library of Congress. ==Biography== Saroni was born and educated in Germany, and referred to himself as a student of Mendelssohn. However, in a biography published during his lifetime, he was said to have studied under Friedrich Schneider. In 1844 he applied for naturalization in New York city, where he later edited Saroni's Musical Times between 1849 and 1851. He organized a successful series of chamber music recitals during those years, featuring performers such as Theodore Eisfeld, Julia Northall, and Otto Dresel. Through critical writing and translating, he helped to spread German pedagogical approaches to American music education and appreciation. Despite the resulting \\"vogue of Mendelssohn in America\\", Saroni's influence remained obscure and only vaguely identifiable in its development for many years.Grace D. Yerbury, Song in America, p. 244 After 1851 he moved to Georgia, where he founded the Columbus Symphony Orchestra (1855). He later lived in Alabama, but eventually settled in Marietta, Ohio, where he taught pianoYerbury, p. 250 at Marietta College. He died there in 1900. His wife died the following year, on September 16, 1901. Her obituary mentions four granddaughters: three in Marietta (Mrs. W. B. Gaitree, Miss Small, and Miss Kittie Small) and a fourth in Knoxville, Tennessee.Marietta Daily Leader, September 17, 1901 A “Brief Account of His Life and Work” in the August 30, 1900, Marietta Daily Leader, mentioned that he “made and lost several large fortunes” in America, “but in his later years he was in comfortable circumstances.” “Those who knew him best, knew him as a kind-hearted, well-educated and refined man.”Marietta Daily Leader, August 30, 1900 ==Music== Saroni composed parlor songs in English. These songs \\"demonstrate a shift away from bel canto traditions towards a lied-influenced style in this genre.\\" He also composed light piano pieces, two operettas, The Twin Sisters (1860) and Lily-Bell, the Culprit Fay (1868), and a Centennial Ode (1888). ==Inventions== Saroni is well known for his music. The Library of Congress holds many of his works. Grace D. Yerbury ascribes an American school of music to him in her 1971 book America in Song: from Early Times to About 1850 and David F. Urrows credits him with writing the first operetta in America in his 2008 article “Herrman S. Saroni and the first American Operetta” in the Bulletin of the Society of American Music. However, Saroni’s many inventions went virtually unnoticed until Daniel A. Bellware detailed them in the 2018 article “The Musical and Mechanical Genius of Herrman S. Saroni” in Muscogiana, the most complete biography of the musician/inventor to date. Many of Saroni’s inventions were related to the use of “petroleum vapors” or what is commonly called gasoline in place of heavier and more expensive coal. Starting just after the American Civil War, Saroni began dabbling in uses for that fuel. He went into business selling petroleum vapor stoves in the Augusta, Georgia in 1866. He converted a coal-powered steamboat to gasoline power and demonstrated it on the Ohio River between Louisville and Cincinnati in 1867. Saroni lit the streets of St. Paul, Minnesota with petroleum vapor lights in 1878 and ran the first automobile through the streets of that city in 1879. He obtained at least seventeen patents between 1866 and 1892 in the United States and Canada. Most of the patents involved uses for gasoline but a few were musical. ==Writings== *\\"The Power of Music,\\" Union Magazine of Literature and Art, July 1848 *Saroni's Musical Times, editor, 1849-1851 *The Musical Vade Mecum, 1852 *English translation of Theory and Practice of Musical Composition by Adolph Berhard Marx (1852)Yerbury, p. 247 ==Music== Larger works *Centennial Ode (1888) *Lily-Bell, the Culprit Fay, operetta (John Church Co.), 1868 *The Twin Sisters, operetta (Oliver Ditson), 1860 Piano music *The Atlantic: Grande Valse Brilliante (Firth, Hall & Pond), 1847 *Autumn: Grand Waltz(Firth, Hall & Pond), 1847The Seasons no. 3.

Joseph Achille Le Bel and Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff both announced this hypothesis in 1874 and that this accounted for all molecular asymmetry known at the time. As an example, four of the carbon atoms of the aldohexose class of molecules are asymmetric, therefore the Le Bel–Van 't Hoff rule gives a calculation of 24 = 16 stereoisomers. This is indeed the case: these chemicals are two enantiomers each of eight different diastereomers: allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and talose. :Four asymmetric carbon atoms in glucose (the four carbon–oxygen bonds marked in red) ==References== Category:Stereochemistry Category:Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff ","title":"Le Bel–Van 't Hoff rule"},{"id":"42045857","text":"Georg Fleps (* b. 1922 in Romania) was a Sturmmann and assistant gunner to Hans Siptrott, serving in the Waffen-SS under Joachim Peiper.

Moore Avenue in Arkansas City, Arkansas. This 1.5 story Craftsman style house was built c. 1915, probably for a member of the locally prominent Dickinson family, one of its early occupants. The house is distinctive for being built on a brick foundation high, for protection against floods that regularly visited the area. (Despite this precaution, the house was under eight feet of water in a major 1927 flood.) The house has retained its original siding and windows, and exhibits typical Craftsman details such as exposed rafter ends and large knee brackets in the eaves.

It served in North Carolina and Virginia. ==History== The regiment was recruited from Pasquotank, Edgecombe, Hertford, Bertie, Currituck, and Beaufort counties in northeastern North Carolina. W.F. Martin was the regiment's colonel, with George W. Johnson as lieutenant colonel and Henry A. Gilliam as major. The regiment was captured in August 1861 at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. After being held prisoners of war at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York harbor and Fort Warren in Boston harbor and the survivors of the regiment were exchanged, it was reorganized with Martin remaining colonel, John C. Lamb becoming lieutenant colonel, and Thomas H. Sharp becoming major. In this second organization several companies were infused with reinforcements, including Company L which included new enlistments of many older men from Cabarrus, Union and Stanly counties. The regiment continued to be stationed in eastern North Carolina and fought in several small skirmishes as part of James G. Martin's brigade. It participated in the operations to recapture New Bern in 1864. In May it was transferred with the rest of the brigade to Virginia, where it fought in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. Lamb was mortally wounded during the campaign and Sharp was promoted to lieutenant colonel in his place, with Captain Lucius J. Johnson of Company L promoted to major. The regiment then fought at the Battle of Cold Harbor and then in the Siege of Petersburg, as part of Robert F. Hoke's division. The regiment then fought in the Wilmington Campaign in North Carolina, followed by the Battle of Bentonville. It surrendered with the rest of the Army of Tennessee at the Bennett Place on April 26, 1865. However, the Regiment was strung out for many miles to the west. Several companies were discharged at Centre Church in Randolph County. ==See also== *List of North Carolina Confederate Civil War units ==Sources== * National Park Service * Civil War Index Category:North Carolina Confederate Civil War regiments Category:1861 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"17th North Carolina Infantry"},{"id":"42045892","text":"Erdal Pekdemir (born 13 June 1992) is a Turkish footballer who plays for Karaköprü Belediyespor.

He was the uncle and successor of Rustam III. == Rise to the throne == Ali I was the son of Shahriyar IV, and had four brothers, named Qarin III, Yazdagird, Rustam and Bahram. In 1106, the Seljuq Sultan Muhammad I conquered the Ismaili fortress of Shahdiz, and ordered Shahriyar IV to participate in the Seljuq campaign against Ismailis. Shahriyar, greatly angered and feeling offended by the message Muhammad sent him, refused to aid him against the Ismailis. Shortly after the sultan sent an army headed by Amir Chavli who tried to capture Sari but was unexpectedly defeated by an army under Shahriyar and his son Qarin III. Muhammad then sent a letter, which requested Shahriyar to send one of his sons to the Seljuq court in Isfahan. He sent his son Ali I, who impressed Muhammad so much that he offered him his daughter in marriage, but Ali refused and told him to grant the honor to his brother and heir of the Bavand dynasty, Qarin III. Qarin III then went to Isfahan court and married her. After his return to Sari, however, he began claiming the Bavand throne for himself, and started abusing his father Shahriyar and his servants. Shahriyar then moved to Amol and later Rudsar, where he built a Khanqah, and devoted himself to religion. However, when he got sick, Qarin III apologized and restored him as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. Qarin III's refusal to submit to the Seljuq atabeg of Ray, made the atabeg offer Ali an opportunity to conquer Mazandaran, with he agreed to. Shahriyar quickly sided with Qarin III and convinced Ali to withdraw. Nevertheless the strife continued among the two brothers. Ali later went to Marw and joined the Seljuq prince Ahmad Sanjar, the ruler of Khorasan. Ahmad Sanjar was preparing for an expedition to the west in order to take control of Gorgan, but an attack made by Muhammad Khan on the Seljuq borders, forced Ahmad Sanjar to move east in order to repel Muhammad Khan. This allowed Qarin III to capture Gorgan while Shahriyar stayed in Tamisha. Shahriyar later fell ill and died in 1117 and was succeeded by Qarin III. Qarin later fell ill, and died in 1117 after he asked the local people to pledge allegiance to his son Rustam III, whom succeeded him as the ruler of the Bavand kingdom. Rustam III, shortly after his accession of the Bavandid throne, was challenged by Ali I, who still claimed the Bavandid throne. The Seljuq Sultan Muhammad I, then requested the two Bavandid rivals to appear in the Seljuq court of Isfahan. Rustam, however, refused, but later changed his mind and went to Isfahan, where he shortly fell ill and died. According to some sources, Rustam was poisoned by his stepmother, the sister of Muhammad I, who wanted to marry Ali I. Ali I then ascended the Bavandid throne. == Reign == However, Muhammad I wanted himself to dominate Mazandaran, and had Ali and his brother Yazdagird imprisoned. Meanwhile, in Mazandaran, Ali's brother Bahram and his nephew, Faramurz were struggling for the Bavandid throne. Muhammad shortly died, and was succeeded by his son Mahmud II who released Ali from prison, gave him his aunt in marriage, and recognized him as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. Faramurz agreed to recognize the authority of Ali, but Bahram resisted, until he was defeated. Bahram then fled to the court of Mahmud II, and requested his help. Mahmud supported Bahram for sometime, but later stopped doing so. Bahram then tried unsuccessfully to make the Ismailis murder Ali. In 1119, Ahmad Sanjar, with the aid of the Kakuyid ruler Garshasp II and several other minor rulers, invaded Jibal and forced Mahmud II to cede him Mazandaran and other parts of western Iran. Bahram then joined Ahmad Sanjar. Ahmad Sanjar then ordered Ali to meet him at his court. Ali, however, disobeyed, and instead sent his son Shah Ghazi Rustam IV, who was also related to Ahmad Sanjar from his mother's side. Ahmad Sanjar was angered by Ali's action, and later sent Shah Ghazi Rustam back to Mazandaran. Ahmad Sanjar then recognized Bahram as the ruler of Mazandaran, and gave him an army to conquer the region. Ali immediately lost the support of many of his supporters, but those who remained loyal to him helped him to repelled Bahram. Bahram then withdrew to Nishapur, where he stayed with the amir Öner, until the latter was murdered by the Ismailis in 1121. Bahram then fled to Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud, who had recently become the ruler of Gorgan and promised to aid him in his conquest of Mazandaran. However, Ali managed to have Bahram assassinated in 1122. In 1127, Ahmad Sanjar once again invaded western Iran, and Ali this time obeyed Ahmad Sanjar's summons, but did not meet with Ahmad Sanjar when he was informed of serious opposition from the latter's nephews. Ahmad Sanjar shortly returned, and once again ordered Ali to meet him, but the latter once again refused and used his advanced age as an excuse. Ali then instead sent one of his sons to Ahmad Sanjar. Ahmad Sanjar, once again enraged by Ali's refusal to obey, sent an army under amir Arghash to capture Shahriyarkuh, but Ali managed to defeat the army before it managed to reach the city. Ahmad Sanjar then inspired amir Chavli to invade Mazandaran. During the same time he offered his nephew Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud the opportunity to annex Shahriyarkuh. Ghiyath, however, was twice defeated by near Tamisha. Arghash was shortly ordered to return to Mazandaran to avenge the embarrassing Seljuq defeats, and besieged the Bavandid fortress of Ruhin for eight months but was forced to withdraw. Mahmud II later died in 1131, and a civil war later ensured between various Seljuq princes. Ahmad Sanjar was then forced to summon Arghash to aid him in an expedition in western Iran. He then pardoned Ali and ordered him to join him in western Iran. Ali, however, sent his son Shah Ghazi Rustam IV instead, who distinguished himself during the expedition and was wounded at the Battle of Dinavar where Ahmad Sanjar was victorious. Ahmad Sanjar then granted Shah Ghazi Rustam IV several honors and allowed him to return to his father in Mazandaran. However, Ahmad Sanjar's relations with Ali still remained tense. After the death of Ali's wife, Ahmad Sanjar, who was her brother, demanded the properties she had left in Mazandaran which was in reality given to Ali. Ahmad Sanjar then sent the ispahsalar Muhammad Kashi to take it. Ali, however, managed to persuade Ahmad Sanjar to share the properties with him. During the later years, several deposed rulers and princes took refuge in Mazandaran. Some of these included the Seljuq prince Toghrul II, who later managed to conquer Jibal with the aid of Ali. Several other deposed rulers and princes took refuge in Mazandaran, including the Ghaznavid Shirzad ibn Mas'ud III, two sons of the Khwarazmian Qutb al-Din Muhammad, and a member of the Mazyadids. Some time later, Ahmad Sanjar ordered Abbas, the amir of Ray, to invade Mazandaran. Abbas managed to enter Amol, but after a short time he made peace with Ali. In 1141/1142, the Khwarazmian ruler Atsiz invaded Khorasan and seized Gorgan from Ali. He then imprisoned the local Bavandid governor Rustam Kabudjama. Shah Ghazi Rustam IV, without the agreement of his father, then met Atsiz, and persuaded him to release Rustam Kabudjama. Ali, after hearing about his son's meeting with Atsiz, criticized his actions. Some time later, Ali, who was too old to rule, abdicated in favor of his son Shah Ghazi Rustam IV. Ali died three years later in Tamisha and was buried in Sari. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:Bavand dynasty Category:12th-century monarchs in Asia Category:11th-century Iranian people Category:12th-century Iranian people Category:1070 births Category:1145 deaths ","title":"Ali I (Bavandid ruler)"},{"id":"42045934","text":"Walter Paska (November 29, 1923 – August 16, 2008) was a bishop of the Catholic Church in the United States.

Completed in 2006 and entirely paved, it spans one of the four lengths of the fortified quadrangle created under Austrian rule during the first half of the 19th century. The cycleway is intended for bicycle touring. Heading southwards, it starts near the Peschiera del Garda railway viaduct, on the right bank of the Mincio, passing over to the left bank just before the village of Monzambano, near the Salionze dam. Shortly after this the castle of Valeggio sul Mincio, once a stronghold of the Veronese Scaligers, comes into view. This is followed by Borghetto sul Mincio, a settlement distinguished by its many watermills and the Ponte visconteo, a bridge erected by the Milanese House of Visconti. From here it continues, still along the Mincio, as far as Pozzolo, where an alternative route leads to Volta Mantovana. The track then veers away from the river, along the canals of the Mantuan plains. After approximately 40 km it reaches the historic city of Mantua. Although the railway station is within easy reach, visitors are advised to continue along the cycling and pedestrian track which runs along the Lago di mezzo (Middle Lake, one of the three basins formed by the Mincio, which wraps around the city), as far as the Ducal Palace, the very heart of town. The cycleway is clearly signposted all the way and offers several rest stops with facilities. It is particularly popular in springtime (see the stats below). ===Route=== The cycleway stars near the Peschiera del Garda railway viaduct, and follows the course of the Mincio to Pozzolo. From there, it follows the canals of the Mantuan plains until it reaches the Lago di Mezzo in Mantua. The cycleway is clearly marked with signposts along its route, and offers several rest stops with facilities. ==ReferencesSee also=== Bicycle touring Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle Touring bicycle File:Borghetto_valeggio_2.jpgBorghetto along the path File:MappaCiclabilePeschieraMantova.jpgcycleway map File:Grafico_passaggi_Peschiera-Mantova_2009.pngChart Category:Cycleways in Italy ","title":"Mincio Cycleway"},{"id":"42046010","text":"2-Hydroxymuconate semialdehyde is formed from catechol by the enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase during the degradation of benzoates.

It is located in a relatively flat depression around Lake Cuitzeo, a large, very shallow lake, which is in danger of disappearing. The town was officially founded in 1550, with the founding of a large Augustinian monastery, which still stands. Today, the town is the seat of a rural municipality, providing local government to surrounding communities. ==The town== The town of Cuitzeo is located just over thirty km north of Morelia, on the north shore of Lake Cuitzeo. It is a quiet, rural town, with narrow streets and buildings of white facades with thatched or tile roofs. The streets are mostly traveled by people and pack animals and most of the ambient noise comes from birds in overhead trees, especially in the main plaza. Its main activities are agriculture, livestock, commerce and fishing with a population of 8,760 (2010) . The main structure in the town is the former Santa María Magdalena monastery complex located to one side of the main plaza. The complex consists of a church, cloister, garden and open chapel. Its main attraction is its Plateresque facade, with carvings of Spanish royal arms, Christian symbolism, Augustinian insignia and indigenous imagery, reflecting that the monastery was one of the most sumptuous of its time. Its style is influenced that the church front at Acolman, but it is larger and more imposing. The design and carving of the façade is attributed to a Purépecha craftsman named Juan Metl, whose signature is found inscribed on an ornamental plaque beside the main entrance. It is the only example of this from early colonial Mexico. Another important aspect of the exterior is the open chapel, which is elaborately framed, located behind the portería of the monastery complex. It contains a well preserved 16th century fresco of the Last Judgment and a 17th-century mural of a crucified friar, which may be Antonio de Roa. The monastery was founded by the Augustinians, with construction started in 1550 over the ruins of a former Purépecha temple to the sun god Curicaueri, using stone from the old building. The structure served as a headquarters for the order and a school. In 1865, it was used as a military fort. In 1965, the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia took control of the structure, and en 1974, a graphic arts museum ( Museo de la Estampa) was opened, renovating the refectory and other living quarters. The museum contains a permanent collection from over forty artists including Leopoldo Méndez and Alfredo Zalce . There are also halls and passageways dedicated to Purépecha archeology and religious items from the colonial era. The upper floor of the cloister contains the Sala Capitular, which houses the monastery library with over 1,100 volumes, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. Another important structure is the former Franciscan hospital which dates from the 18th century, as well as the Santa Magdalena Church, the Concepción Church, the San Pablo Church, the Calvario Church and the Virgin of Guadalupe Sanctuary. These churches have sculptures and paintings that date from the colonial period as far back as the 16th century. In 2006, the town was named a “Pueblo Mágico.” ==The municipality== The town of Cuitzeo del Porvenir is the local government for a number of other communities, which together cover a territory of 257.87km2. The municipality borders those of Santa Ana Maya, Alvaro Obregon, Tarímbaro, Huandacareo and Copándaro with the state of Guanajuato to the north and east. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic and 7 representatives called “regidors.” Outside of the seat, other important communities include Cuaracurio (pop. 1,656), San Agustín del Pulque (2,924), Mariano Escobedo (2,859), Cuamio (2,353), Dr. Miguel Silva (1, 021) and Jeruco (960) (2010 figures) . Important landmarks include the Tres Cerritos archeological sites where burial chambers for adults and children have been excavated. It was a ceremonial center which dates back to about 600 CE. Another site is Manuna Hill, on the northwest shore. A number of communities have important churches such as the Chapel of the Child Jesus in the community of Cuamio, the San Juan Bautista Church in Jeruco and the San Agustín Church in San Agustín del Pulque. ==Geography and environment== View of Lake Cuitzeo The town/municipality is located in the north of the state of Michoacán, in the Cuitzeo Depression, with only small hills such as the Manuna and Melón. Its hydrography is centered on Lake Cuitzeo with some seasonal streams and thermal springs such as the San Agustín del Maíz. It is a large, very shallow lake fed by fresh water springs. It is home to over ninety pieces of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants, and produces silversides, catfish and carp. In the winter swallows and ducks spend the winter here, migrating from Canada and the United States. The lake is in danger of disappearing. That which is not lake is primarily grasslands with some opuntia, huisache (Acacia) and other arid plants. Wildlife includes coyotes, raccoons, armadillos, and fish. There are some stands of pine trees. The climate is temperate with rains in the summer. Average annual rainfall is 906.2 ml with temperatures varying between 10.2 and 27.5C. ==History== 16th century fresco of the Last Judgment at the monastery's open chapel The name derives from the Purépecha “cuiseo” which means place of water containers. The current spelling dates to the 16th century. During the pre Hispanic period, the area was influenced by several cultures including those of Chupícuaro, Teotihuacán and Tula . By the end of that era, it was under the control of the Purépecha Empire. At the beginning of the colonial period, in 1528, the area was assigned as an encomienda to Gonzalo López, but by 1547, it has become a semi-autonomous “Republic of Indians.” Evangelization was first carried out by the Augustinians under Francisco de Villafuerte and Miguel de Alvarado, who began construction of the Santa María Magdalena monastery in 1550. This is considered the founding of the modern town. The 19th century is marked by political changes. In 1825, it was part of the “Departamento Norte” and in 1831, it became a municipality as part of the Puruándiro district. In 1861 it is officially named the seat of the current municipality with the name of Cuitzeo del Porvenir. Liberal forces took the town on April 7, 1865 during the Reform War. In 1870, Santa Ana Maya separated from Cuitzeo to form a new municipality. The 20th century began with the town sacked during the Mexican Revolution by a band of highway robbers under Inés Chávez García. In 1919, Huandacareo separated to form a new municipality. In 1950, Copándaro did the same. Running water was installed in 1955 and electricity in 1964. In 1975, all of the facades of the town were renovated. ==Socioeconomics and culture== Basketry items for sale in the center of Cuitzeo The main economic activities of the municipality are agriculture, livestock, commerce and fishing. The most common handcraft is baskets and other items made with various types of vegetable fiber, including floor mats, and hats, using reeds and other plants from the lake. They are generally available for sale in the Cuitzeo town center. Major festivals include the feasts of the Virgin of the Conception in February and that of the patron saint of Mary Magdalene in July. There is also a secular event commemorating the arrival of Spanish culture in October. Other celebrations include the Fiesta del Buen Temporal in September and an annual festival as the Cerrito Temple in November. Traditional dishes include corundas, tamales, uchepos, esquites, along with silversides fish charales, from the lake prepared in various ways. The most traditional drinks are pulque and atole. ==References== Category:Populated places in Michoacán Category:Populated places established in 1550 Category:Pueblos Mágicos Category:1550 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Cuitzeo"},{"id":"42046203","text":"The Osmonds is a 1972 ABC-TV Saturday morning cartoon series produced by Rankin/Bass Productions starring the Osmond Brothers.

His father, who has a wife and two daughters sends him to an elite music boarding school, the fictional National Boychoir Academy, to keep Stet’s existence a secret. Stet is admitted due to his vocal ability but also the generous amount of money the father pays them. Stet struggles to fit in, because the other pupils are privileged children, and he cannot read music. Stet’s behaviour is also problematic for some of the staff. However, he works hard, learning music theory and practicing his vocal technique, and becomes one of the best singers, which allows him to join on the choir’s tours. Stet's father’s family receives tickets, anonymously sent by the academy, for an important performance of the choir. Stet’s father does not want to go, for fear of revealing his secret son, but the family attend. After the concert he decides to transfer Stet to a school in Switzerland, but Stet, encouraged by staff member Carvelle, refuses to go. Carvelle threatens the father to expose his secret, and the father keeps Stet at the school. Stet and Devon, another student, develop an antagonistic relationship. Devon exposes Stet's mother's criminal record to the other students, causing Stet to beat him in his room. The teachers councils considers expulsions for both of them, but delays the decision as those students are needed for a representation in New York. The New York representation goes without any incident, but soon after, Stet's voice starts to change as he grows older. The father ultimately tells his family, and his wife accepts this. Stet starts living with them. ==Cast== * Dustin Hoffman as Mr. Anton Carvelle * Kathy Bates as Headminister * Debra Winger as Ms. Patricia Steel * Garrett Wareing as Stetson \\"Stet\\" Tate * Eddie Izzard as Drake * Kevin McHale as Mr. Wooly * Josh Lucas as Gerard Olin * Joe West as Devon * River Alexander as Rafael \\"Raffi\\" Abrams * Grant Venable as Andre * Janine DiVita as Sally Olin ==Production== Hoffman stars in Boychoir as the choir master Carvelle, with Bates as the school's headmistress; the director is François Girard with a script by Ben Ripley.

Wareing plays a young man who joins a boys' choir; Winger plays the boy's Odessa, Texas school principal; Izzard, replacing Alfred Molina, will play Drake, the choir master's right-hand at the school; Lucas plays the boy's estranged father. McHale portrayed a young music teacher who champions the boy and West, Alexander and Venable play other boys in the chorus. ===Filming=== Principal photography began in February 2014 in New York City and in Stamford, New Haven, and Fairfield, Connecticut, some at Fairfield University. ==Release== Boychoir premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 5, 2014 before receiving a limited release in the United States on April 3, 2015. Hallmark Cards subsequently bought the distribution rights to air the film on its Hallmark Hall of Fame program. Boychoir was retitled Hear My Song and was planned to air on CBS on April 16, 2016.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 45% rating based on 44 reviews for an average rating of 5.22/10. The consensus states: \\"Boychoir rests heavily -- and not always comfortably -- on the shoulders of Dustin Hoffman, whose typically excellent work isn't always quite enough to compensate for an overly predictable drama.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 51 out of 100 rating based on 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". ==Soundtrack== * Groban - The Mystery of Your Gift * Howe - Battle Hymn * Bottleneck - Home Grown Country Folk * Ogura - Hotaru Koi * Britten - This Little Babe * Wagner - Parsifal * Woolner and Sena - Lose their mind * Tallis - Spem in Alium * Fauré - Pie Jesu * Page - Niska Banja * Mendelssohn - Denn Er Hat Seinen... * Britten - Balulalow * Britten - That yonge child * Hopkins - Past life melodies * Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-sharp minor * Jenkins - Adiemus * Handel - Coronation Anthem * Handel - Queen Anne Aria * Handel - Hallelujah from Messiah (in a new arrangement which includes solos) ==References* Category:2014 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2014 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films about educators Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Films directed by François Girard ","title":"Boychoir (film)"},{"id":"42046272","text":"\\"Breakout\\" is a song by Danish rock band Cryoshell, released as a stand-alone single on December 9, 2012. Written by Mikkel Maltha, the song was recorded in late 2011 and produced by Jacob Hansen. It is an alternative rock song that features elements of pop rock and symphonic pop. The song features Danish vocalist Tine Midtgaard standing in for incumbent lead singer Christine Lorentzen while she took maternity leave. \\"Breakout\\" was essentially produced as a promotional score for the 2012 sets of the Lego toy series Hero Factory, a succession theme to Lego's Bionicle franchise that Cryoshell also produced scores for. \\"Breakout\\" received positive reviews, with music critics labelling it \\"poppy and catchy\\" and \\"a brighter feel\\" in comparison to Cryoshell's previous work. ==Background== \\"Breakout\\" was written by Mikkel Maltha and recorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with producer Jacob Hansen in late 2011. The track features Danish singer Tine Midtgaard standing in for regular vocalist Christine Lorentzen while the latter took maternity leave from the band. The song was essentially recorded as the promotional score for the 2012 sets of the Lego toy series Hero Factory. Its lyrics allude to elements from the theme's 2012 storyline, also titled Breakout. However, the song was only used in the closing credits of the eighth and ninth episodes of the animated TV series Hero Factory and has not featured in any other media. Released as a digital single on December 9, 2012, \\"Breakout\\" was later announced to be included in a global reissue of Cryoshell's self-titled debut album as one of two bonus tracks (the other being a remix of the band's 2008 song \\"Gravity Hurts\\" that also features Midgaard). However, a release date was never announced and the reissue is thought to have been scrapped. ==Reception== \\"Breakout\\" has received positive reviews from music critics. Greek Rebels applauded the track as \\"diversified and dynamic with a very nice introductory melody\\", while Ravenheart Music described it as \\"poppy and very catchy\\". iTunes A to Z reviewed the track as \\"A little lighter\\" and \\"A brighter feel\\" in comparison's to Cryoshell's earlier work while criticizing its production as more of a b-side track, but overall calling it \\"A good, solid rock track\\", and Midtgaard's contribution as \\"A serviceable job\\" in emulating Lorentzon’s voice while seemingly stifling her own. ==Track listing== ;Digital download *\\"Breakout\\" – 3:15 ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording *Recorded at Hansen Studios, Ribe, Denmark ;Personnel *Mikkel Maltha – Songwriting, programming, keyboards, composition *Jacob Hansen – Production, recording, engineering, mixing *Tine Midtgaard – Vocals *Kasper Søderlund – Lead guitar, bass guitar, composition *Martin Pagaard – Drums, composition ==Release history== { !Region !Date !Format !Label - Worldwide December 9, 2012 Digital download Cryoshell I/S } ==References * Category:2012 songs Category:2012 singles Category:Cryoshell songs ","title":"Breakout (Cryoshell song)"},{"id":"42046307","text":"Gregory J.

Deguingand was a short-lived French automobile manufacturer.Linz, Schrader: Die Internationale Automobil- Enzyklopädie.Georgano: The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile.Georgano: Autos. Encyclopédie complète. 1885 à nos jours. ==The business== Since 1901 Albert Deguingand (1872–1943) had been in partnership as an automobile manufacturer with Lucien-Marie Vinot-Préfontaine (1858–1915), but his business partner had died in the war and in 1926 Vinot-Deguingand, the company they had founded together, had run out of customers and its factory in the west of France was sold to Donnet-Zédel. With the foundation of Société des Nouveaux Ateliers A. Deguingand, Deguingand returned to the Paris region where the French automobile industry and its supplier base were heavily concentrated. The cars carried the Deguingand name. There was also a change of direction in terms of the market segment contested, the cars being now targeted squarely at the small car sector. The company did not meet with great success, however, and Deguingand production had ended by 1930. ==The cars== The first model was a small car powered by a 4-cylinder engine of 1170cc from S.C.A.P.. A choice was offered between a side-valve version of the power unit and an overhead valve version, for which power outputs of respectively and were listed. The model failed to gain traction in the market place, however, in an increasingly price sensitive market segment that by now was hotly contested by the volume makers, above all Citroën, whose mass-production strategy left the products of second tier French auto-makers looking expensive. The Deguingand had been delisted by the end of 1928. At the 22nd Paris Motor Show, Deguingand exhibited a smaller model, now in the 5CV car tax band, using a two-stroke 4-cylinder unit designed by Marcel Violet whose two-stroke engine designs were at this time appearing in a number of cars produced in the Paris region. The engine in the Deguingand 5CV was unusual in that the four cylinders operated in just two combustion chambers, the pistons being placed in pairs, one at each end of a shared combustion tube. The car sat on a wheel base and was aggressively priced at just 11,000 francs in October 1928. It nevertheless failed to find customers and disappeared at the end of 1929. The same basic design nevertheless reappeared in 1931, now manufactured in Nanterre as a Donnet. == External links == * GTÜ Gesellschaft für Technische Überwachung mbH (abgerufen am 24.

In 1118, Ali I ascended the Bavandid throne, but was shortly imprisoned by the Seljuq Sultan Muhammad I, who wanted to have direct rule over Mazandaran. Meanwhile, in Mazandaran, Ali's brother Bahram and his nephew, Faramurz were struggling for the Bavandid throne. Muhammad shortly died, and was succeeded by his son Mahmud II who released Ali from prison, gave him his aunt in marriage, and recognized him as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. Faramurz agreed to recognize the authority of Ali, but Bahram resisted, until he was defeated. Bahram then fled to the court of Mahmud II, and requested his help. Mahmud supported Bahram for sometime, but later stopped doing so. Bahram then unsuccessfully to make the Ismailis murder Ali. In 1119, Ahmad Sanjar, with the aid of the Kakuyid ruler Garshasp II and several other minor rulers, invaded Jibal and forced Mahmud II to cede him Mazandaran and other parts of western Iran. Bahram then joined Ahmad Sanjar. Ahmad Sanjar then ordered Ali to meet him at his court. Ali, however, disobeyed, and instead sent his son Shah Ghazi Rustam, who was also related to Ahmad Sanjar from his mother's side. Ahmad Sanjar was angered by Ali's action, and later sent Shah Ghazi Rustam back to Mazandaran. Ahmad Sanjar then recognized Bahram as the ruler of Mazandaran, and gave him an army to conquer the region. Ali immediately lost the support of many of his supporters, but those who remained loyal to him helped him to repelled Bahram. Bahram then withdrew to Nishapur, where he stayed with the amir Öner, until the latter was murdered by the Ismailis in 1121. Bahram then fled to Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud, who had recently become the ruler of Gorgan and promised to aid him in his conquest of Mazandaran.

In 1994, they were one of the first companies in the UK to receive the Fairtrade Mark. Clipper was purchased in 2012, by Royal Wessanen, for around £50 million. ==History== Clipper Tea was started in 1984 by wife and husband Lorraine and Mike Brehme, who were master tasters. They wanted to start a company with ingredients had been ethically sourced and naturally produced. It started in their Dorset kitchen with two chests of Assam tea, which they bought for £50 and sold to local health food shops in the Dorset area. The principles laid down were \\"always a pure, natural product – there isn't a single artificial ingredient in any of our products\\". However, the couple divorced and in 2007 they sold to Fleming Family & Partners, a fund backed by one of Britain's wealthiest families, for around £25- £30 million. In 2008, Perry Haydn Taylor's creative branding agency, big fish, was approached to rebrand the business. They created new Clipper packaging and slogan \\"Natural, fair & delicious\\". In 2012, the business was sold to Royal Wessanen. Creative branding agency big fish continues to work with the brand. Clipper is the UK's sixth biggest tea brand and export sales represent 20% of group turnover with products currently sold in 45 countries. In the first six months of 2013 exports grew by 36% while the 2012 full year increase was 40% above 2011. Export growth is vitally important to the business and has allowed Clipper Teas to invest over £1 million in capital expenditure upgrading its manufacturing facility in Beaminster. Clipper produces 95 varieties of tea with up to two million tea bags made per day. In Germany the brand is called \\"Cupper tee\\", because another tea-brand had already registered the brandname \\"Clipper\\". ==Ethics== Clipper is the UK market leader in Fairtrade and organic tea. It was an ethical business from the start. Mike Brehme said \\"I was in tea already, and I realised there was child labour involved and I thought, \\"That's no way to make a living.\\"\\" \\"When we first started\\" Lorraine says, \\"Fairtrade was very much in its infancy\\". Whilst out shopping one day she wandered into the Body Shop and picked up a book about how to shop with a conscience. She didn't buy it, but instead copied the telephone number of the Fairtrade Foundation, and resolved to approach them for advice. So Clipper became involved with the Fairtrade Foundation in its earliest stages and policy development. All of Clipper's tea is purchased from estates where there is no exploitation of workers. In 1994, Clipper was one of the first three companies in the UK to receive the Fairtrade mark and then decided to produce a magazine, called \\"The Teapot Times\\", about the history of tea production and the positive impact buying Fairtrade goods had on communities around the world. Clipper also became official advisors to the Fairtrade Foundation for tea. ==References== Category:Tea companies of the United Kingdom Category:Drink brands Category:Tea brands in United Kingdom Category:Fair trade organizations Category:Fair trade brands ","title":"Clipper Teas"},{"id":"42046687","text":"The 1972 Star World Championships were held at Puerto Azul in Naiguatá, Venezuela in 1972. ==ResultsReferences== * * Category:Star World Championships Category:1972 in sailing Category:Sailing competitions in Venezuela ","title":"1972 Star World Championships"},{"id":"42046730","text":"Tuuli Rand (born 1 March 1990 in Kuressaare, Saaremaa)Eesti Laul 2013 final: Get to know the participants is an Estonian singer. ==Early life and education== She is a graduate of Kuressaare Gymnasium and Georg Ots Music Singing School. ==Career== She is the lead singer in bands TuuliKustiPeep, Funkifize, Bliss, Estonian Dream Dixieland Band and the vocal ensemble Söörömöö.

The couple had two sons, Earle III in 1984 and Elliot in 1987, and one daughter, Leslye. Earle and Boothe-Wilson's marriage began to worsen in 1994, and they divorced after a discharge from the Marine Corps in August 1994. Earle also usually made late child support payments. Boothe-Wilson left and traveled across the country with her children to her native New York. The family moved into an apartment and moved to different locations, such as Boothe-Wilson's mother's home. Boothe-Wilson was working as a security guard for a Manhattan museum at the time. On October 28, 1994, Boothe-Wilson left her children to go visit her sister in Queens, New York, but never arrived. Later, Boothe-Wilson's vehicle would be found abandoned at a disputed location. Letters to her children were discovered that indicated she planned to leave them. Her credit cards were later mailed to her husband. Forensic analysis of the letters addressed to her children was inconclusive with determining who had written them, although Boothe-Wilson's handwriting was similar. ==Discovery== Facial reconstruction of the victim, who was inaccurately classified as Caucasian. The body was found in a field in Jacksonville, North Carolina. The remains were believed to have been disposed around two years before. She stood at approximately between 5'5\\" and 5'8\\" tall and her weight could not be estimated due to the condition of her body. The victim's age range was estimated to have been between the early and late 30s, although The Doe Network reported that the age range was as large as 25 to 40. She was inaccurately believed to be Caucasian. Near the skeleton was a strand of reddish hair that may have belonged to her. She had various evidence of dental work on her teeth, although some had protruded from her mouth. Examination of her body also indicated she had a divided rib. Items such as a Nike shoe, gold jewelry, hoop earrings, red, black and yellow clothing, a hotel key, and subway tokens from New York were also present at the scene. No evidence of foul play was found on her bones, although it is believed that she was murdered. ==Investigation== The case remains unsolved, although in 2012 police had a suspect in Matt Adler, who had a possible connection with her death. He was imprisoned in 1995 for the rape and murder of Lisa Gipson. In 2013, he pleaded guilty to the murder of Wanda Musk. He currently is serving a life sentence for his crimes. The Jane Doe's case was featured on the website for America's Most Wanted but did not lead to her identification. Investigators, as of February 2019, would like to speak to anyone who knew Boothe-Wilson in the Marines or the circumstances of her presence in Jacksonville. Her face was reconstructed, in 2D as well as 3D, as an attempt to show what she may have looked like when she was alive. Bone marrow was used as a source to develop a DNA Profile. It was announced in February 2019 that the remains were identified as Boothe-Wilson after DNA was matched between the unidentified remains and her DNA profile in January. The match was made after DNA from an envelope sent by Boothe-Wilson was extracted from a stamp. Dental records were also compared. ==See also== *List of solved missing persons cases *List of unsolved deaths ==References== Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1990s murders in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Missing person cases in New York (state) Category:Unsolved murders in the United States Category:Violence against women in the United States Category:United States Marines ","title":"Murder of Randi Boothe-Wilson"},{"id":"42046764","text":"Ingrid Trøite Lorentzen (born 9 March 1972) is a Norwegian ballet dancer.

It was the second squadron to be assigned the VP-93 designation. The squadron was established on 1 July 1976 and disestablished 18 years later, on 30 September 1994. It flew the Lockheed P-3 Orion, and was based at NAF Detroit during its entire life. Units of the squadron made 17 major overseas deployments. ==Operational history== P-3B landing at NAS Dallas May 1986 *1 July 1976: VP-93 was the last reserve patrol squadron to be formed as part of the reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve during the 1970s. The squadron’s home port was NAF Detroit, and it came under the operational and administrative control of Commander Reserve Patrol Wing, Atlantic. VP-93 began its career flying the P-3A Orion aircraft. The Executioners quickly devised a motto to go with their new nickname, Paratus Persequi—Ready to Execute. *8 August 1979: The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration requested the assistance of the Navy in monitoring the environmental effects of the Bay of Campeche oil spill that devastated the western Gulf Coast. The mammoth oil spill was the result of a blowout on an off-shore oil well rig in early August 1979. VP-93 was tasked with flights along the path of the spill, monitoring its track and collecting a photographic record of the disaster. During the assignment the squadron was based for two weeks at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. Several active duty Navy patrol squadrons and augment reserve squadrons participated in this mission through 31 October 1979. *January–October 1993: VP-93 deployed to NAS Sigonella, Sicily, and Naval Station Rota, Spain, in support of Adriatic Sea embargo flights for Operation Maritime Guard against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. These were armed flights carrying Harpoon antiship missiles. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire between warring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, and to prevent outside factions from providing resupply by sea. The squadron also supplied single aircrews and aircraft over the period of May and June 1993 for Operation Sharp Guard. Three aircrews returned to NAS Sigonella again in October for continued Sharp Guard support. This detachment was hastily repositioned within 24 hours to NAS Key West, Florida, to provide support for operations Uphold Democracy and Able Mariner, the UN sanctioned embargo of Haiti. *14–24 March 1994: VP-93 flew the Navy’s last operational mission of the P-3B and ended its own flight operations on 24 March 1994 after flying over 40,000 mishap-free hours. *17 September 1994: VP-93 disestablishment ceremonies were held at NAF Detroit, with an official disestablishment of 30 September. ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * P-3A Orion – July 1976 * P-3B Orion – 1981 * P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Orion – January 1986 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References * VP-93 Alumni website Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-93"},{"id":"42046776","text":"Christopher Darnell Cook (born October 5, 1988), professionally known as Sonaro, is an American music producer from Far Rockaway, New York.

It was written and produced by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Chris Martin, with production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson, and co-production from Jon Hopkins. A music video for the Ghost Stories track was released on 25 February 2014 as a teaser for the then-unannounced sixth studio album. A promotional \\"Midnight\\" 7-inch vinyl single was pressed by Parlophone for Record Store Day 2014. The single, featuring the track on a single side of the record, was released on 17 April 2014, becoming the second music release by the band in promotion of Ghost Stories. A live version of the song, recorded and filmed at the Royal Albert Hall, in London, was included in the Ghost Stories Live 2014. ==Composition== \\"Midnight\\" has been described as an ambient and folktronica song. It was built over a previously unreleased original track produced by Jon Hopkins in 2003. The track, named \\"Amphora\\", was never completed by Hopkins and was partly released by ambient/electronic music blog A Strangely Isolated Place on SoundCloud in early 2012, as part of their playlist \\"ASIP - 1.00.00\\". The song also incorporates elements from a Jon Hopkins recording titled by Hopkins as \\"The Fourth State II\\", a reproduction of his 2008 extended play The Fourth Estate. ==Recording== The song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011's Mylo Xyloto respectively. Chris Martin's recorded vocals for the song were put through a vocoder. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== The song received mostly positive reviews from critics, who noted a change in the sound of the band and drew comparisons to Bon Iver and Justin Vernon. Al Horner of NME approved of the band's new musical direction and lauded the song as a \\"dive into icy electronic experimentalism\\". Contactmusic.com's Lauren James similarly praised the song, writing: \\"gone are the crashing pianos, guitar and soaring vocals of the Brit rockers' more famous ballads, replaced with a pared back, minimalist electronic song\\". Micahel Nelson of Stereogum concurred, commenting that the song brought out Coldplay \\"at their most spacious and ambient, stripped down to a ghostly essence.\\" Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated the song 8/10 and summarized it as \\"chilly, moody, and evocative\\". Rolling Stones Cory Grow compared Martin's vocals to Peter Gabriel \\"as he sings about darkness, while the synths build throughout the track before a skittery, rave-like keyboard line flits about noisy static\\". Idolator's Carl Williot described the song as \\"a haunting electronic soundscape that not only lacks the band's trademark anthemic choruses and stadium-filling guitar lines, but boasts nary a hook and has few decipherable lyrics\\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy opined that the song was \\"subdued, murky, twinkling, but definitely not lead single material on first listen\\" and hailed the band for \\"never fail[ing] to shake up their sound and become even more successful with it.\\" Jamieson Cox of Time magazine felt the song \\"never blossoms into one of Coldplay's trademark climaxes, instead blurring into a phosphene cloud of synth melodies\\" but praised it for being \\"another step in a new direction for a band that's never been content with staying in place\\". ===Accolades=== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !Ceremony !Year !Award !Result - ! scope=\\"row\\" World Music Awards 2014 World's Best Song  } ==Promotion== The music video for \\"Midnight\\" was noted for its use of night vision filters. A 5-minute music video for \\"Midnight\\", directed by Mary Wigmore, was premiered on music video hosting service Vevo at 6pm UTC (Midnight in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia time), on 25 February 2014. The video was shot nearly in its entirety in thermal infrared imaging and negative imagery, incorporating various visual effects. The thermal infrared camera was a FLIR SC8303 with either a 25 or a 50mm prime lens, depending on the shot. The lenses were made by Janos Corporation. The wavelength range is 3 to 5 microns, or mid wave infrared. The thermal infrared video was recorded as HD-SDI on an Atomos Samurai Blade with a 480 GB solid state hard drive. Simultaneously, raw digital video was captured at 30 frames per second into FLIR ExaminIR software. The video was watched over 1 million times in less than 24 hours after it was posted on their Facebook page. Just two days later it reached 3 million views, later passing 31 million views by 24 June 2015. \\"Midnight\\" was first performed live by Coldplay on the opening night of the 2014 iTunes Festival at SXSW on 12 March 2014 at the Moody Theater in Austin, Texas.

Kory Grow of the Rolling Stone magazine wrote that Moroder turned an understated EDM track into a \\"dance floor banger\\" and \\"eight-minute affair with no time squandered\\": \\"One of Coldplay's most unassuming tracks off their forthcoming record Ghost Stories is now its most danceable.\\" He also commented that the producer \\"adds a pounding bass-drum beat from the onset and then uses the synth filigrees toward the end of the track ... to build it into something that would have once backed Summer. Vocal 'aahs' and soft pads of synths, alongside robotic chanting in French, make the track more Moroder than Martin for the final four minutes.\\" Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times wrote in similar tone, \\"The producer's lengthy reworking, which climaxes in a surging synth fantasia complete with robot voices, adds some verve to Coldplay's rather sedate original.\\" Tom Breihan of Stereogum noted that while the remix \\"might not have the same spacey majesty as peak Moroder, it still does a nice job translating the inward sweep of the original track into an orchestral disco pulse.\\" According to Ryan Kristobak of The Huffington Post, Moroder transformed \\"Midnight\\" into \\"a dance-floor hit, without abandoning the song's Brian Eno/Bon Iver-influenced ambience.\\" Idolator's Robbie Daw commented, \\"Here Moroder lays a hypnotic click-click-click disco beat below the Kid A-esque atmosphere of the track, and the whole thing eventually builds into a tornado of majestic synths and menacing piano chords. And, of course, no modern day remix by Giorgio Moroder would be complete without the addition of his own ghostly robot vocals.\\" ===Track listing=References* Category:2014 songs Category:2014 singles Category:Parlophone singles Category:Coldplay songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jon Hopkins Category:Songs written by Chris Martin Category:Songs written by Jonny Buckland Category:Songs written by Guy Berryman Category:Songs written by Will Champion Category:Record Store Day releases Category:Song recordings produced by Paul Epworth Category:Song recordings produced by Rik Simpson Category:Song recordings produced by Giorgio Moroder Category:Ultratop 50 Singles (Wallonia) number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Hungary ","title":"Midnight (Coldplay song)"},{"id":"42046813","text":"John Cochran may refer to: * John Cochran (cricketer) (1909–1987), South African cricketer * John Cochran (fl. 1680s), Scottish negotiator for land purchase for Stuarts Town, Carolina in 1684 * John Cochran (physician) (1730–1807), American Revolutionary War military physician * John Cochran (artist) (fl. 1821–1865), British portrait miniaturist and engraver * John J.

A container is any receptacle or enclosure for holding a product used in storage, packaging, and shipping. Things kept inside of a container are protected by being inside of its structure. The term is most frequently applied to devices made from materials that are durable and are usually at least partly rigid. A container can also be considered as a basic tool,David P. Braun, \\"Pots as Tools\\", in J. A. Moore and A. S. Keene, eds., Archaeological Hammers and Theories (1983), pp. 108–134.Karen Gayle Harry, Stephanie Michelle Whittlesey, Trixi Bubemyre, Pots, Potters, And Models: Archaeological Investigations at the SRI Locus of the West Branch Site, Tucson, Arizona (2005), p. 283: \\"The perspective taken in this chapter is that ceramic containers are tools (Braun 1983) and, as a crucial part of the technological repertoire, can provide considerable information about activity organization, production technology, food- preparation and storage technology, settlement function, and economic organization\\". consisting of any device creating a partially or fully enclosed space that can be used to contain, store, and transport objects or materials. ==History== Humans have used containers for at least 100,000 years, and possibly for millions of years.Clive Gamble, Origins and Revolutions: Human Identity in Earliest Prehistory (2007), p. 204. The first containers were probably invented for storing food,David A. Munro, A Place For Everything (1968), p. 92. allowing early humans to preserve more of their food for a longer time, to carry it more easily, and also to protect it from other animals. The development of food storage containers was \\"of immense importance to the evolving human populations\\", and \\"was a totally innovative behavior\\" not seen in other primates.Bernard Grant Campbell, Human Evolution: An Introduction to Mans Adaptations (2009), p. 306. The earliest containers were probably objects found in nature such as hollow gourds,Chuck Groth, Exploring Package Design (2005), p. 3. of which primitive examples have been found in cultures such as those of the Tharu people,Sameera Maiti, The Tharu: Their Arts and Crafts (2004), p. 178. and native Hawaiian people.Irving Jenkins, The Hawaiian Calabash (1989), p. 5. These were followed by woven baskets, carved wood, and pottery. Containers thereafter continued to develop along with related advances in human technology, and with the development of new materials and new means of manufacture. Early glass bottles were produced by the Phoenicians; specimens of Phoenician translucent and transparent glass bottles have been found in Cyprus and Rhodes generally varying in length from three to six inches.Perrot and Chipiez, Histoire de l'art, v iii, 734–744 These Phoenician examples from the first millennium BC were thought to have been used to contain perfume.George Rawlinson, History of Phoenicia, 1889, Green Longmans publisher, 583 pages The Romans learned glass-making from the Phoenicians and produced many extant examples of fine glass bottles, mostly relatively small. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, sizes for retail containers such as glass bottles had become standardized for their markets.Warren Belasco, Roger Horowitz, Food Chains: From Farmyard to Shopping Cart, pp. 98–99. In 1810, Frenchman Philippe de Girard came to London and used British merchant Peter Durand as an agent to patent his own idea for a process for making tin cans. The canning concept was based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers the year before by the French inventor Nicholas Appert. Durand did not pursue food canning, but, in 1812, sold his patent to two Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product, and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813 they were producing their first tin canned goods for the Royal Navy. For transportation of goods on a larger scale, larger containers remained a problem, as customs officials inspecting imports had to deal with a lack of standardization in this field, and because predominantly wooden containers in use well into the twentieth century were prone to leaking or breaking. The standardized steel shipping container was developed in the 1950s, and quickly became ubiquitous for the large-scale transportation of commercial goods. Towards the end of the Twentieth century, the introduction of computer-aided design made it possible to design highly specialized containers and container arrangements, and also to make form- fitting labels for containers of unusual shapes.Geoff A. Giles, Design and Technology of Packaging Decoration for the Consumer Market (2000), p. 82: \\"Container designers also found that shrink sleeves gave them new-found freedom to design containers that until then had been viewed as impossible to decorate\\". ==Modern characteristics== A number of considerations go into the design of modern containers: ==Variety== Practical examples of containers are listed below. * Ceramic cylindrical vessels including: ** Ancient vessels, including Amphoras, Kvevri, Pithos, and Dolium ** Bottles, similar to a jar in being traditionally symmetrical about the axis perpendicular to its base and made of glass ** Jars, traditionally cylindrical and made of glass * Cylindrical vessels including: ** Barrels, made of wooden staves bound by rope, wooden or metal hoops. ** Cans, traditionally cylindrical and sheet- metallic. ** Drums, similar to a can but definitely cylindrical and not necessarily metallic **Tub * Rectilinear vessels including: ** Boxes ** Crates, a box or rectilinear exoskeleton, designed for hoisting or loading ** Wooden boxes ** Lift-vans ** Corf * Flexible containers including: ** Bags, such as shopping bags, mail bags, sick bag ** Luggage, including satchels, backpacks, and briefcases ** Packets ** Gunny sacks, flour sacks ** Wallets * Shipping containers, including: ** Corrugated boxes, made of corrugated fiberboard ** Intermodal containers, a.k.a. ship container or cargo container *** Twenty-foot equivalent units, an industry standard intermodal container size ** Intermediate bulk containers ** Unit load devices, similar to a crate ** Flexible intermediate bulk containers ==ReferencesBooks=== * Yam, K.L., \\"Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology\\", John Wiley & Sons, 2009, ==External links== * * Category:Food packaging Category:Packaging ","title":"Container"},{"id":"42046843","text":"Gregg Amore (born October 28, 1966) is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives representing District 65 since January 1, 2013. == Education == Amore earned his bachelor's degree in history from Providence College and his MA in public policy from New England College. == Elections == *2012 When District 65 Republican Representative John Savage retired and left the seat open, Amore ran in the three-way September 11, 2012 Democratic Primary, winning by 61 votes with 845 votes (40.4%) and won the November 6, 2012 General election with 3,898 votes (67.4%) against Joseph Botelho, running as a Moderate. == House of Representatives == Since taking office in 2013, Amore has moved up the ranks in the House, seen as a rising star and a potential future Speaker.

Since 2 January 2016 this request is no longer listed on Interpol's website. ==BiographyEarly life=== Yarosh was born on 30 September 1971 in Dniprodzerzhynsk, a town in predominantly Russian- speaking Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central-eastern Ukraine. Short biography of Dmytro Yarosh, Korrespondent.net Yarosh grew up in a Russian-speaking family. His mother worked in a car factory and his father an engineer at a machine plant. Yarosh has described his early ears as \\"a happy Soviet childhood.\\" His father refused to join the Communist Party, although Yarosh claims he was asked to join many times. In 1988 Yarosh graduated from High School #24 of Dniprodzerzhynsk. The love story of Dmitry Yarosh: Wife hides and shows children, Bigmir.net (15 May 2014) As almost all pre-teens and young teenagers in the Soviet Union, he was a member of Young Pioneers and later the Countrywide Leninist Communist Youth League organizations, youth-based sub- organizations of the Communist Party. Yarosh: I was an Octobrion, a pioneer, and a Komsomol, Ukrayinska Pravda (14 January 2019) In the mid-1980s Yarosh became interested in politics and according to him the Soviet Union \\"It became clear that the system was false. In 1989 Yarosh who was 18 at the time and a group of friends (who were all about twelve years old) were, allegedly, the first person who first raised the yellow-blue flag of Ukraine in East Ukraine, more precisely in Dneprodzerzhinsk. The flag was sewed by his grandmother and her sister with cloth bought by Yarosh. Starting in February 1989, Yarosh was a member of People's Movement of Ukraine organisation. From October 1989 to November 1991 he was drafted and served two years in the Soviet army as a private. During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yarosh joined Ukrainian nationalist groups. In 1994, he joined the Tryzub organization which he has led since 2005. ===Political activities=== Since October 1988 Yarosh takes an active part in political activities. In February 1989 he became a member of the People’s Movement of Ukraine. In 1989-1991 Yarosh served in the ranks of the Soviet army. In 1994 Yarosh was one of the founders of the nationalist organization Tryzub. An organization he became head of in 2005. In October 2010 he tried to create a unified Nationalist movement. In 2001 Yarosh graduated from the State University of Education in Drohobych, Ukraine (). On 1 April 2013, Yarosh became an assistant-consultant to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) deputy from the UDAR party Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, they are long-time friends. ===2014 revolution=== Percentage of votes won by Yarosh during the 2014 presidential election During the Euromaidan protests in early 2014, Tryzub became the core of the newly founded Right Sector, a coalition of right-wing nationalists. During these protests Yarosh advocated for a \\"national revolution\\" and dismissed the Viktor Yanukovych administration as an \\"internal occupational regime\\". In early February, weeks before the ousting of President Yanukovych, Yarosh stated in an interview that there would be no civil war in Ukraine because 80% of the population did not support Yanukovych. Right before the 21 February ouster of Yanukovych, in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Yarosh claims he and the Right Sector leadership was consulted by Yanukovych on the deal Yanukovych had signed with the opposition to end Euromaidan. Yarosh refused to endorse this agreement and refused to disarm Right Sector. Following a March 10, 2014, Lenta.ru interview by of from the Right Sector's Kyiv branch, Roskomnadzor immediately issued a press release on March 12, 2014, in which Lenta.ru was implicated in violating numerous Russian media laws, information laws, and laws to counter extremism because the interview allowed a leader from the informal group to appeal to persons in the nation of Ukraine (Ukrainians, Crimean Tartars, and others) to support causes for the inviolable territory of Ukraine which has always included Crimea and that the article contained a link to Dmytro Yarosh's March 1, 2014, appeal to fight Moscow's imperialism. Since the warning by Roskomnadzor was the second issued in a 12 month period, Roskomnadzor would ask the courts to terminate Lenta.ru's mass media license. However, Lenta.ru's owner Alexander Mamut fired nearly half its staff and established a very pro Kremlin media source. The fired personnel stated that the new Editor-in-Chief Alexey Goreslavsky is Kremlin controlled for the Kremlin's propaganda purposes. In the aftermath of the collapse of Yanukovych's regime, Yarosh demanded to be appointed Vice Prime Minister for the law enforcement matters, but his demand was rejected; he was offered a post of the Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine instead, but Yarosh rejected this position as being beneath him. There were discussions of appointing Yarosh deputy head of the Security Service of Ukraine, but these discussions quickly petered out for unknown reasons. On 20 April 2014, Dmytro Yarosh claims he was ordered by acting President Oleksandr Turchinov to lead 20 Right Sector members to sabotage an insurgent-controlled television tower in Sloviansk, leading to the first combat fatalities in the Siege of Sloviansk.

RT Deutsch. 2016-05-05 (English translation ) Yarosh was a candidate in the 25 May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election. A poll conducted by the \\"Socis\\" research center (from 25 February – 4 March 2014) predicted that Yarosh's candidacy received the support of 1.6% of the people who were surveyed. On election day he actually received 0.7% of the votes. In January 2019 Yarosh stated he only took part in the election \\"not to destroy the revolutionary structures after the revolution\\". He also stated that he was fully aware it was \\"virtually impossible\\" he could win the election and that because he was engaged in military action since the first days of April 2014 he did not campaign. Yarosh took part in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election as a Right Sector candidate in single-member district number 39 (first-past-the-post wins a parliament seat) located in Vasylkivka Raion. He won a parliamentary seat by winning this constituency with 29.76% of the votes. Yarosh did not join a faction in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament).

Late December 2015 Yarosh announced he was forming a new political party that would have its founding congress in February 2016. ===Governmental Initiative of Yarosh=== In February 2016 Yarosh started a new organisation called Governmental Initiative of Yarosh (DIYA). The departure of Yarosh resulted in at least 20% of Right Sector members leaving with him. According to Yarosh DIYA will be a public movement like People's Movement of Ukraine was in its early days. Yarosh did not participate in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. In the election he endorsed the candidacy of Ruslan Koshulynskyi. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election DIYA joined a united party list with the political parties of Svoboda, Right Sector and National Corps.https://m.glavcom.ua/country/politics/yarosh-tyagnibok- bileckiy-taki-sformuvali-jediniy-spisok-na-vibori-600508.html Yarosh himself was placed 3rd on the party list.

He believes that \\"anti-Christian\\" powers are afoot in the European Union and that Brussels forces people into lifestyles such as gay marriage. ... He doesn't see Europe or NATO as a potential partner and has stated that the US is also part of an \\"anti-Ukrainian front\\".\\" *Yarosh has denied allegations of anti-Semitism, but in a book he wrote \\"I wonder how it came to pass that most of the billionaires in Ukraine are Jews?\\" *\\"For all the years of Ukraine's independence, Russia has pursued a systematic, targeted policy of subjugation toward Ukraine ... So of course we will prepare for a conflict with them, ...If they stick their faces here like they did in Georgia in 2008, they'll get it in the teeth.\\" * \\"Sooner or later, we are doomed to fight a war with [the] Moscow empire.\\" * \\"We're not using oligarchs' money in politics, but when a war is on, we do not object to their funding the army.\\" ==Public image== Yarosh is a controversial figure. In Russia's state-run media he has been described as a \\"radical nationalist\\", a \\"fascist\\". Mainstream Western media has generally called him a radical or extreme nationalist. Some mainstream and left-wing sources have denounced him as a \\"fascist\\". ==Reactions in Russia== On 12 March, an editor of privately owned Lenta.ru website, Galina Timchenko, was fired by the company's owner Alexander Mamut for publishing a link to an interview with Yarosh he gave two days earlier, after Russian media regulatory agency Roskomnadzor formally warned the Lenta.ru website for publishing this link. In this interview Yarosh said: \\"Sooner or later, we are doomed to fight a war with [the] Moscow empire\\". ===Criminal charges=== On 1 March 2014 Right Sector's page on Russian online social networking service VKontakte showed an entry with Dmytro Yarosh's alleged appeal to Dokka Umarov, a Chechen militant guerrilla leader associated with Al-Qaeda, for support of Ukraine. On 2 March 2014, Right Sector's spokesman Art Skoropadskyi denied the message was posted and approved by Yarosh. According to the spokesman, this alleged appeal to Umarov appeared on Right Sector's VKontakte webpage after one of its administrator's accounts was hacked. VKontakte blocks the page at a request of an Attorney General of Russia.

The concept of a nilpotent Lie algebra has a different definition, which depends upon the Lie bracket. (There is no Lie bracket for many algebras over commutative rings; a Lie algebra involves its Lie bracket, whereas, there is no Lie bracket defined in the general case of an algebra over a commutative ring.) Another possible source of confusion in terminology is the quantum nilpotent algebra, a concept related to quantum groups and Hopf algebras. ==Formal definition== An associative algebra A over a commutative ring R is defined to be a nilpotent algebra if and only if there exists some positive integer n such that 0=y_1\\\\ y_2\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ y_n for all y_1, \\\\ y_2, \\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ y_n in the algebra A.

In collaboration with Antoine Le Moiturier, he sculpted the tombs for Duke John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria, which currently reside at the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. The job was originally assigned to the workshop of Claus Sluter, but went to Le Moiturier and De la Huerta. There is a work by this sculptor in the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, (\\"Mourner from Tomb of John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria\\" alabaster) ==References== * Jean de la Huerta and Burgundian sculpture in the middle of the fifteenth century, dir.

One of the paper's contributors was Dutch author and critic of the colonial system Multatuli.Van der Veur 18. The paper was known as conservative, and editorialized vehemently against the emancipation of the native people. Its editor in chief during the 1920s was K.W. Wybrands, who put such a personal stamp on the paper that it was also known as Wybrands' paper.Maters 38. In 1938, Willem Belonje became the editor in chief of the paper; he had earlier run De Indische Courant, in the 1920s. The paper was closed in 1942 by the Japanese occupying forces.

This subgenre also includes parody of historical or contemporary events such as political scandals. The subgenre has gained acceptance by the adult industry to the extent that major awards are presented in this category by organizations such as AVN and XRCO. ==Origin== PornParody.com, a website dedicated to reviewing porn parodies, cites the Batman spoof Bat Pussy ( 1970) as possibly the earliest known pornographic parody film, a title which is also shared with the 1973 German animated short Snow White and the Seven Perverts. The subgenre began taking off in the 1990s, experiencing a surge in popularity during the 2000s and 2010s. William Shakespeare's works have been used as inspiration, titles include Hamlet: For the Love of Ophelia and Othello: Dangerous Desire. ==Types== In 2002, Shaving Ryan's Privates, a movie starring actor-turned- infosec analyst Jeff Bardin, was released. The movie documented porn films that parody classic Hollywood movies. There have been porn parodies produced of sitcoms such as Who's The Boss and Parks and Recreation, horror and drama movies such as Edward Scissorhands and Silence of the Lambs, sci-fi and action movie blockbusters such as Star Wars and The Avengers, and of period drama such as Downton Abbey, titled Down on Abby. The genre includes both heterosexual as well as homosexual versions as a \\"gay porn parody\\" of the reality television series Duck Dynasty has been produced among others. Parodies also include non-story or event specific productions such as the several parodies that feature a Sarah Palin-like character. ==Production== Some parodies utilize techniques such as CGI. One movie reviewer commented that the costume of a particular comic book character in a porn parody was a \\"better version\\" of the one used in the mainstream movie. ==Reception and review== Journalist and author Charlie Jane Anders wrote, prior to blogging on the subject, \\"I didn't realize just how many porn parodies there are — and how terrible most of them actually are.\\" A New York magazine writer commented that although the parody of the PBS series Downton Abbey titled Down on Abby starring Lexi Lowe is humorous, it is \\"rife with historical inaccuracies\\" and \\"not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off French tips and thongs.\\" ===Industry acceptance=== Acknowledging its origins and public appeal, several industry publications and trade groups have created award categories for the genre. Two of the industry's major award programs offer recognition for this category of adult film. The AVN Award added the categories of \\"Best Parody - Comedy\\" and \\"Best Parody - Drama\\" in 2009. In 2013, the Star Wars parody Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody was that year's most nominated production as well as the winner of the Comedy category. In 2012, the category of \\"Best Director\\" for a \\"Parody and Best Celebrity Sex Tape\\" was added. The XRCO Award added its category of \\"Best Parody\\" in 2003. Coincidentally, the award went to the Wicked Pictures- produced and Jonathan Morgan-directed film Space Nuts, a parody of the Mel Brooks film Spaceballs - itself a parody of Star Wars. Space Nuts also won the 2004 AVN award for Best Parody - Comedy. ===Mainstream media=== The genre has gained the attention of the mainstream press. In 2009 director Jeff Mullen (a.k.a. Will Ryder) was interviewed by Newsweek writer Joshua Alston about his leading role in the resurgence of porn parodies. In 2009, Adult Video News writer Tom Hymes observed, \\"I have come to the realization that a very real expectation is being created among the celebrity elite: Will my show be the next XXX parody... please?\\" \\"What is kind of brilliant about the whole thing is the fact that these mainstream shows and the actors on them now get to rub shoulders with the porn industry without any actual rubbing. That's why I call them the new celebrity-safe sex tapes for safe-sex celebrities.\\" Alan Ball, creator of the HBO series True Blood stated in 2010 that \\"We just found out that they're doing a porn parody of True Blood. That's certainly a moment of going 'Wow, we've arrived.'\\" In 2010, actress Anna Paquin talked about the porn parody of True Blood on the late night talk show Lopez Tonight. Paquin said \\"You know, actually what's interesting is that [fellow cast member] Steve [Moyer] and I were so amused by it that we got it for everyone on our cast and crew as a wrap gift so I think we probably bought every copy in existence.\\" Copies of Tru: A XXX Parody were given to the entire cast and crew at the wrap party for the show's third season. ==Fictional pornography== Fictional pornography is sometimes used for plot or humor in mainstream film and TV. In Friends, Phoebe's twin sister starred in Buffay, the Vampire Layer among others. Lyndsey in Two and a Half Men was the title role of Cinnamon's Buns, and Wilson in House acted in Feral Pleasures. Peter Stormare's character in The Big Lebowski can be seen in Logjammin'. ==See also== * Axel Braun, director known for parody productions * This Ain't..., a list of the Hustler- produced parody series * Tijuana bible, pornographic comic books that often featured parodies of comic strips and celebrities *Rule 34 (Internet meme) ==References *The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies (NSFW) by io9.com *Ultimate Guide to Porn Spoofs Pt. 2: Superheroes, Star Trek, Star Wars and Horror (NSFW) by io9.com Category:Parody films ","title":"Pornographic parody film"},{"id":"42047122","text":"Homozeugos conciliatum is a species of grass endemic to Angola.

In May 1846, Sir William purchased a large quantity of Indian meal to bridge the period before the first potato crops became available. He lobbied the government in London on numerous occasions, warning in October 1846 that, \\"the people have endured their wants & privations with resignation and patience but if employment and relief are delayed much longer, the peace & tranquillity of this district must be seriously endangered.\\"Sir William Godfrey to Earl of Bessborough, 12 October 1846, National Archives Ireland, CSO RP-D/6648/1846.

They finished 14th in the final, scoring 62 points. This has caused controversy as in the tele-vote result Poland was ranked 5th, with 162 points (top marks from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway and Ukraine). However, Poland did not receive any points from the UK and Ireland despite being first in the public voting. This occurred as both the British and the Irish juries placed them last (25th).

When Mizell rode to collect taxes from Barber, he was waylaid and killed.Wilbanks, Williams. Forgotten Heroes: Police Officers Killed in Early Florida, 1840–1925. Turner Publishing; Limited edition (June 15, 1998). p. 17. . In the resultant feud, 41 men were killed.Eriksen, John M., Brevard County ... A Short History to 1955 ==Feud== Barber, a staunch Confederate supporter, did not want to pay taxes to the government and felt that Mizell—himself a Confederate veteran—was a carpetbagging traitor out to exploit his former comrades. As a result of the man's non-compliance, Mizell repeatedly took Barber's cattle as payment for taxes. Then on February 21, 1870, Barber—fed up at this point and having warned Mizell not to set foot on his land again—fatally shot the sheriff as he ventured into his property to take more cattle. Although the dying sheriff asked his family not to avenge his death, they nevertheless went on a revenge spree which was reciprocated by the Barbers and their supporters. Eight died, and no one was convicted for the murders. But the feud finally ended during the 1940s when a Barber married a Mizell. == Feud-related deaths == These feud-related deaths were enumerated in the 1870 Mortality schedule of Orange County, Florida: *Isaac Barber, 35, white male, married, born in Georgia, shot in March. *Moses Barber, 37, white male, married, born in Georgia, Farmer, drowned in March. *William Bronson, 37, white male, married, farmer, born in South Carolina, shot in March. *David Mizell, Orange County Sheriff, 36, white male, married, born 12 Nov 1833 Columbia County Florida, shot from ambush 21 Feb 1870. *Needham Yates, 52, white male, married, born in Georgia, Farmer, shot in March. *William Yates, 32, white male, married, born in Georgia, Farmer, shot in March. *Needham Yates, Jr. == Further reading == *\\"Cattle Feud Slaughtered Mizells, Barbers during Reconstruction,\\" by Mark Andrews, The Orlando Sentinel, Sunday, March 29, 1992, Page K-6. *Orlando: A Centennial History, by Eve Bacon, The Mickler House Publishers, Chuluota, Florida, 1975. *Pine Castle: A Walk Down Memory Lane, by Ruth Barber Linton, Book Crafters, Chelsea, Michigan, 1993. *Pioneers of Wiregrass Georgia, by Huxford Folks (A series of genealogical compilations covering the counties of Irwin, Appling, Wayne, Camden, and Glynn). *Orlando in the Long, long, ago.. . and now, by Kena Fries, Florida Press, Orlando, 1938. *Florida's Frontier: The Way Hit Wuz, by Mary Ida Bass Shearhart, Magnolia Press, Gainesville, Georgia, 1992.

It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest with some areas additionally designated as Special Protection Areas and/or Special Areas of Conservation. The hill provides a range of habitats with both wet and dry heathland, coniferous and broadleaf woodland and scrubland; and is home to some rare flora and fauna including the sand lizard, smooth snake, silver- studded blue butterfly and two types of carnivorous plant. Humans have been visiting the hill as far back as the Bronze Age and there are a number of ancient monuments sited there including several tumuli, a Roman signal station and what is thought to be an Iron Age animal pound. The military have made extensive use of the area since at least the Roman occupation; it served as training ground for troops during the Crimean War and both World Wars, and was the site of a nuclear bunker during the Cold War. Most visitors today use the hill as an area to exercise their dogs or for other recreational activities such as cycling, jogging and horse riding. ==Toponymy== The hill takes its name from a chapel dedicated to St Catherine that once stood on its summit.Hodges (p.14) The chapel was associated with nearby Christchurch Priory. Documents from the 12th century indicate that the hill was formerly known as Richedon. This name probably means ‘Great Hill’, perhaps to compare with Littledown across the River Stour to the south-west. In 1331 a chapel dedicated to St Catherine was described as being \\"newly built on the hill of Richesdon\\".The Register of John de Stratford, Bishop of Winchester, 1323-1333. Volume I. Surrey Record Society 2011. Ref: 618, 613. . It is presumed that the hill acquired the name of the chapel soon after that date. Modern histories have often confused Richedon (in which the suffix ‘-don’ indicates a ‘hill’) with nearby Rishton (which probably means the ‘farm by the rushes’), which was located north of St Catherine’s Hill beside the little Moors River at Palmersford and was the site of a chapel dedicated to St Leonard. This has led to a mistaken belief that a chapel dedicated to St Leonard formerly existed on StCatherine’s Hill. An example of this error is found in From Harbour to Harbour by Nancy Bell (1916), where reference is made to \\"an unlicensed chapel dedicated to St. Leonard at Rishton – which is probably the same as Richedon\\". St Catherine’s Hill has also been known locally as Kattern’s Hill. This has prompted speculation that this name pre-dates the chapel and is linked to a Pagan deity.Hodges (p.11) However, there is little doubt that this name is post-Christian and derived from Catherine. Elsewhere in the country Kattern’s Day celebrations were held on the feast day of St Catherine, 25 November. ==History== Animal remains from before the ice age have been discovered on the hill although much of the gravel that covers the area was deposited by fast moving melting ice and it is possible therefore that some of the remains were washed there. Large numbers of Mesolithic tools and a few Paleolithic tools have been found there and across the local area, including a flint knapping site at nearby Ramsdown Hill.Hodges (p.2) The presence of long barrows in the adjacent Stour valley demonstrates that Neolithic peoples were using the area but if they visited the hill, there is no direct evidence remaining.Hodges (pp.2–3) There are however, Bronze Age tumuli over all three hills including St Catherine's and agricultural sites in the valley below from both the Neolithic and Bronze Age.Hodges (p.3) There is also an unexcavated enclosure on top of the hill which is considered too small to be a fort and is currently thought to be an Iron Age animal pound.Hodges (p.6) View over Christchurch towards Hengistbury Head It is likely that St Catherine's Hill with its commanding views was used as a lookout post.Hodges (p.1) Christchurch Harbour was an important trading port in the Iron Age and through the Saxon and Roman periods; and the hill overlooks the Avon and Stour rivers, both navigable, until the 18th century, as far as Salisbury and Blandford respectively.Stannard (p.1)Hoodless (pp.31 & 64) Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in a ditch, which appears to be part of a fortification or signal station overlooking the main road from Christchurch to Wimborne and an important fording point on the River Stour.Hodges (p.6) With the addition of a simple wooden tower, the River Avon, the harbour and Hengistbury Head would also have been viewable from this point.Hodges (pp.8–9) A chapel was later built within the boundaries of the old Roman signal station. Although it is not known for certain when the chapel was constructed, a document from 1331 states that a chapel dedicated to St Catherine was \\"newly built on the hill of Richesdon\\", seemingly without the knowledge of the Bishop of Winchester, John de Stratford, who prohibited regular services being held there until the matter had been fully investigated. The following year permission was granted for weekly divine services to be held in the chapel. It is presumed that the chapel fell out of use after the dissolution of Christchurch Priory in 1539 and was robbed of any usable building material.Hodges (p.18) Exploratory trenches were dug at the chapel site in 1921 by the Bournemouth Natural Science Society with the guidance of Heyward Sumner. Though abundant fragments of Purbeck stone and pieces of stone roof tiles and glazed floor tiles were found, no hewn stones nor any foundations were discovered. It was concluded that a substantial building had formerly existed on the site, but because all usable materials had since been removed it was impossible to determine its size or form. The chapel site was more fully excavated in 1967 by the Bournemouth Archaeological Association directed by Michael Ridley. A number of artefacts were found including an ichthys drawn on a piece of stone, glazed and unglazed pottery, and some shards of mediaeval coloured glass. The discovery of two types of flooring, a glazed tile floor and an earlier marble one, along with seven types of building stone and eight different roof tiles, led to the conclusion that the chapel had stood for a considerable amount of time. It is said that the hill was initially chosen as the site for Christchurch Priory but the building materials were moved each night to the church's present location.Hodges (p.10) Across the Avon Valley to the Solent, Isle of Wight and the Needles. As seen from St Catherine's Hill During Tudor times the hill was classified as a Coast Hill Beacon, meaning it had two fire baskets. Shore Beacons, such as nearby Warren Hill had three fire baskets while those inland had one. It is possible that these beacons were lit to warn of the approaching Spanish Armada. The hill continued to be used as a beacon hill throughout the Napoleonic Era when an invasion by the French was expected.Hodges (p.22) The military has made extensive use of the hill for training purposes. During the Crimean War, when a battalion of the Royal Horse Artillery was stationed at Christchurch Barracks, the hill was used for training in the pulling and unlimbering of guns on rough terrain. ===20th century=== During World War I a complete set of trenches were built on the hill including firing, communication and second line trenches; observation and machine gun posts, dressing stations, latrines, mine shafts, and various rooms and strong points. Soldiers were trained in trench warfare and construction there prior to being sent to Flanders.Hodges (P.23) The area was also used during the Second World War, for tank driving practice. Anti-aircraft guns were also positioned there to protect the aerodrome at Hurn. After the war, a nuclear bunker was built into the hill by the Royal Observer Corps. It was designed so that a three-man team could survive within for up to three weeks whilst observing the effects of a nuclear blast. After closing in 1991 the ROC Post was filled in, with the only remaining feature being a single disused telegraph pole 15 yards away.Hodges (p.24) Sand and gravel extraction has taken place over various parts of the hill, most notably on the east side of the plateau, where the whole of what was once Toothill has been removed. The remaining pit is today partly filled with water. Gravel extraction continued until at least 1933 when a local newspaper complained that a tumulus was being sold off at a shilling a load. A reservoir was first constructed on the hill in 1895. It was rebuilt in 1930 and a second reservoir was added in 1960. The reservoirs provide Christchurch and West Hampshire with 4,000,000 gallons of water. In the 1960s and 70s, most of the west side of the hill was developed for housing.Hodges (p.25) ===Today=== Today the hill is mainly used for leisure and educational activities, such as walking, jogging, cycling and horse riding. Dog walking in particular is popular with 70% of visitors using it for this purpose; and although prohibited, off-road quadbiking and motorcycling also occurs. A local branch of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation group (ARC) manage an area of heath on the north and east sides of the hill, and is one of a number of groups that conduct guided walks around the hill and surrounding area; while on the south side, the local gun club practises target shooting in one of the old, disused quarries. ==Geography== Quarrying on the hill has exposed its geological make up. St Catherine's Hill, together with Ramsdown and Blackwater hills, comprise a three-mile long ridge which runs roughly north to south between the Avon and Stour valleys just to the north-west of where the rivers converge in the borough of Christchurch in Dorset. The top of this ridge is almost a level plateau, above sea-level at the southern end and in the north. St Catherine's hill, in the south, forms the highest point of this three hill chain at and has some of the steepest slopes at 1:1 or 45°. The 400 acre site is a mixture of woodland and heath and is part of a larger Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The eastern slopes and foot of the hill, an area referred to as the Town Common, is almost exclusively open heath and as such has also been designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC). St Catherine's Hill was formed during the Eocene and Pleistocene eras. The hilltop is covered with river terrace gravels, comprising mainly flints and coarse sands, on top of finer Branksome Sands below which is Parkstone Clay and the Poole Formation. A number of these strata can be observed at the old quarry works and believed to have been deposited during a fluvial or estuarine period (all others were formed in a marine environment). If this is so, they are the only known sediments of this age in Southern England to be laid down in this way and indicate an Eocene shoreline between Christchurch and Hengistbury Head. These strata add to the value of the site as a geological SSSI. View over the heath covered eastern slopes and Town Common The soils covering the hill and surrounding area are acidic and generally low in nutrients. These soils support a selection of habitats from wet and dry heathland, to deciduous and coniferous woodland and scrubland. Dry heath occurs mainly on the top of the hill, well above the water table, where there is good drainage. It is composed mainly of heather and dwarf shrubs but there are bare sandy areas where the rare Mossy Stonecrop (Crassula tillaea) is able to flourish. All six native species of reptile breed here including the endangered sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and smooth snake (Coronella austriaca). The smooth snake is also found in the areas of wet heath which occur mainly at the foot of the hill and are created by seepage and flushes from below the hill's water table; and where free draining gravelly soils meet less permeable clay. Rare flora found in these areas include bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), hare's-tail cotton- grass (Eriophorum vaginatum), bog moss (Sphagnum), the carnivorous sundews Drosera intermedia and Drosera rotundifolia, and pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica). Conifers and Rhodedendron dominate the western slopes. Coniferous woodland dominates the top and western slopes of the hill and comprises mostly maritime and Scots pine. Broadleaf trees are mainly confined to the south and west side but also occur on the lower east side. They include grey willow and downy birch and the occasional aspen in damper areas. Some trees, particularly the conifers have become invasive and a programme of removal has been instigated. The hill's mix of woodland and heath provide habitats for a number of important bird species including birds of prey such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo), buzzard (Buteo buteo), hen harrier(Circus cyaneus) and merlin (Falco columbarius); woodland birds including the song thrush (Turdus philomelos), crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) and green (Picus viridus) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), all of which are declining in numbers; and wetland birds such as snipe and the red shank (Tringa totanus). Many of these birds also use the area for breeding along with the rare Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) and nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus). Some rare invertebrates inhabit the hill and its surrounding area. The scarce chaser (Libellula fulva), hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense) and downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) all make use of the ponds in the wetter areas of the heath, while the heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) can be found on the sandy areas among the heather along with the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus). ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Dorset Category:Geography of Christchurch, Dorset ","title":"St Catherine's Hill, Dorset"},{"id":"42047224","text":"The Fifth Beatle is a graphic novel by writer Vivek Tiwary, artist Andrew Robinson, and cartoonist Kyle Baker.

It was a special episode of WWE NXT and the first live professional wrestling event streamed online via the WWE Network. Six professional wrestling matches were contested during the event. In the main event, Adrian Neville defeated Bo Dallas in a ladder match to win the NXT Championship. The card also featured Paige defeating Emma to retain the NXT Women's Championship and Cesaro defeating Sami Zayn. The event was praised by critics, but some experienced technical issues viewing the live stream, which WWE later acknowledged. ==ProductionBackground=== Arrival was the first live event produced by WWE for their then developmental league NXT. It was also the first live event to be broadcast on the WWE Network, which launched just a few days prior to the event. NXT's next live event, TakeOver, broadcast in May. Arrival was the only NXT event to not carry the \\"TakeOver\\" name, as beginning with that inaugural TakeOver event in May, the TakeOver name was subsequently used as the brand name for NXT's live shows held several times each year. ===Storylines=== The card comprised six matches. The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on their weekly television program, NXT. Bo Dallas, the defending NXT Champion heading into NXT Arrival. Three matches were promoted for the event. The main event featured Bo Dallas defending the NXT Championship against Adrian Neville in a ladder match. Neville first won a number one contender match (against Sami Zayn) for Dallas' title on the November 27, 2013 episode of NXT. Neville faced Dallas for the title on the next episode and won by count-out, which meant that the title did not change hands. Two episodes later, Neville faced Dallas again for the title in a lumberjack match, but lost when lumberjack Tyler Breeze interfered. Neville once again became number one contender after Dallas failed to defeat Neville in a beat-the-clock challenge match on the January 22 episode of NXT that arose due to Dallas' boasting. On the February 5 episode of NXT, Triple H announced that the championship match would be a ladder match at NXT Arrival. Emma, the challenger for the NXT Women's Championship at NXT Arrival. The NXT Women's Championship was defended at NXT Arrival by Paige against Emma. Back on the July 24, 2013 episode of NXT, Paige defeated Emma in the finals of the tournament to crown the inaugural NXT Women's Champion. Emma earned number one contendership status to Paige's title on the August 7 episode of NXT by winning a dance-off. Emma later successfully defended her number one contender status against Natalya on the January 1, 2014 NXT. It was announced on the February 12 episode of NXT that Emma would receive her championship match at NXT Arrival. Cesaro and Sami Zayn's rivalry started on the May 22, 2013 episode of NXT where Zayn made his NXT television debut and scored an upset win over Cesaro, which was the second match he won on that episode. Cesaro then won the second and third matches of their series, the latter being a two- out-of-three falls match in August 2013. On the January 22, 2014 episode of NXT, Zayn revealed that he had been obsessing about his last match with Cesaro, because \\"they called [it] the best match all year\\" but Zayn had lost that match. Thus, he challenged Cesaro to another rematch, who declined. On the February 12 episode of NXT, Cesaro denied Zayn's challenge again, but Triple H instead made the rematch official for NXT Arrival. == Event == The show started with Triple H proclaiming that \\"NXT is the next generation, and the next generation has arrived.\\" The commentators for the event were Tom Phillips, William Regal, and Byron Saxton. The pre-show panel consisted of Bret Hart, Kevin Nash, Paul Heyman, and Renee Young. It was shown at different times during the event that Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs, Full Sail University President Garry Jones, as well as Ric Flair, Pat Patterson, Dusty Rhodes, and John Cena were in attendance at ringside. ===Preliminary matches=== In the first match, Cesaro defeated Sami Zayn. In the first half of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature \\"Helluva Kick\\" to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature \\"Neutralizer\\", but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the \\"Neutralizer\\" on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn. Mojo Rawley defeated CJ Parker in the show's second match. Rawley picked up the win with two stinger splashes, a hip attack and the \\"Hyper Driver\\". In the show's third match, The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) successfully defended their NXT Tag Team Championship against mystery opponents Too Cool (Scotty 2 Hotty and Grandmaster Sexay). Near the end of the match, Viktor countered Scotty's signature \\"Worm\\" maneuver, leading to the Ascension hitting their double-team \\"Fall of Man\\" maneuver for the victory. The fourth match (which received a pre-match endorsement from Stephanie McMahon) featured Paige retaining her NXT Women's Championship over Emma. Paige managed to prevent Emma from applying her \\"Emma Lock\\" submission hold during the match and also withstood several other holds applied by Emma. When Paige attempted a superplex, Emma countered with a sitout powerbomb on Paige, but it was not enough to secure a win. A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with her signature \\"Paige Turner\\". Yet, Emma became the first person to kick out of the \\"Paige Turner\\". Paige responded by applying the \\"Paige Tapout\\" submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match. Adrian Neville captured the NXT Championship in the main event. The next match saw Tyler Breeze taking on Xavier Woods. As the match started, they were interrupted by Alexander Rusev and Lana. Rusev caused a no contest when he attacked both Breeze and Woods; Breeze received a Samoan drop and Woods was placed in \\"The Accolade\\" submission hold. ===Main event=== The main event match (which received a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder match for the NXT Championship. In the first half of the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature \\"Red Arrow\\", but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his \\"Red Arrow\\" while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship. == Reception == The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that about 200 ticket holders who had purchased tickets were not allowed in because Full Sail University had oversold the 400-seat theater. The newsletter also received a lot of feedback on people unable to watch the show. \\"Some had the Roku box problems that have plagued the network from the start\\", but most said their feed cut out at the Breeze-Woods match. WWE later revealed that the initial number of WWE Network subscribers by April 1 was 495,000, which would be the maximum number of people who could have watched the show. NXT Arrival was well received by critics. Aaron Oster of the Baltimore Sun described the event as fantastic, but \\"marred by technical issues\\". He streamed the show live and the stream cut out from Breeze-Woods, which caused him to miss that match and half of the main event. Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival \\"was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE a chance to show off the NXT roster\\". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match \\"wasn't the same as their previous encounters, and they actually built on it\\" and that \\"they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match\\". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it \\"was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster for the past few years, featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves.\\" He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant \\"Better than Batista\\". For the main event, Oster felt that there were \\"some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match\\", so it was not \\"overly special\\" but still \\"pretty good\\". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who \\"worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE should really consider going back to this format for the main shows\\". Justin James of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter praised the event, stating \\"I would gladly have paid PPV money for this\\" and \\"if Raw had this kind of quality, I would gladly sign up for a three-hour show.\\" He also pointed out that there were no commercial breaks or dead time, making the event \\"mighty close in total content to a three-hour Raw\\". James wrote that the \\"announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring\\", especially \\"in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match\\". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was \\"match of the year by a country mile\\", describing it as \\"better, more emotionally intense, and more exciting than anything WWE has put on since their previous encounter\\". \\"Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together\\" and there was \\"hard hitting action\\". Sami Zayn's match received high praise from critics. James felt that the Ascension's title match was bland, but he liked that their characters had gone from cheesy to serious. James said that the women's match was fantastic and he \\"loved the small touches\\", while praising Paige's new look, saying that it \\"just exudes danger\\". For the main event, James said that \\"this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply did not take the risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title\\". However, he was not disappointed because he did not \\"expect too much from a Bo Dallas match\\". James felt that it was a problem to close the show with Dallas-Neville because \\"the show could only go down\\" from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started. Sky Sports summed up the event that \\"WWE's stars of tomorrow showed they are ready for the limelight now by engaging in some brilliant bouts\\" and \\"some quite spectacular wrestling\\". The Dallas-Neville main event was described as \\"high-octane\\", while the Cesaro- Zayn match being a \\"near 23-minute epic\\" that \\"also lived up to the hype\\" and \\"earned the fans' seal of approval once more\\". The Canadian Online Explorer's Nolan Howell gave a positive review, awarding the entire event 4 stars out of 5. He went on to rate each match of NXT Arrival out of 5 stars (*****). The Cesaro-Zayn match was the highest rated at a full *****. The Rawley-Parker match was rated *3/4 and the Ascension-Too Cool title match **1/4. Howell rated the Paige-Emma title match ***3/4 stars and did not rate the Breeze- Woods match. Finally, Howell rated the main event Dallas-Neville match ***1/4. == Aftermath == Paige debuted on the main roster less than two months after NXT Arrival and immediately won the WWE Divas Championship. In response to viewers who had technical issues watching the show, WWE released the following statement. After NXT Arrival, new NXT Champion Adrian Neville continued to feud with former champion Bo Dallas, who received a rematch for the title on the March 27 episode of NXT; Neville defeated Dallas to retain his title and end the feud. Meanwhile, Sami Zayn moved on to feud with Corey Graves, who had criticized Zayn for not winning a match for some time. Less than two months later at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, Cesaro had a big moment at WrestleMania; in a scene reminiscent of Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André the Giant, with only Cesaro (who had also wrestled on the pre-show) and Big Show remaining in the battle royal held as a memorial to André, Cesaro body-slammed Big Show over the top rope to win the match. A day later on the post- WrestleMania Raw on April 7, Paige made an unannounced main roster debut and was immediately challenged to a title match by WWE Divas Champion AJ Lee; Paige won that match to capture the WWE Divas Championship and become a double champion. Also on the post-WrestleMania Raw, Alexander Rusev won his first singles match on the main roster, and introductory videos for Bo Dallas started airing. On the April 24 episode of NXT, due to her elevation to the WWE main roster and win of the WWE Divas Championship, Paige was forced to relinquish her NXT Women's Championship. The second live special episode of NXT was called NXT TakeOver and was held on May 29, during which Charlotte won the vacant NXT Women's Championship. The third live special episode was called NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way was held on September 11; during which the Ascension's reign as NXT Tag Team Champions ended at the hands of the Lucha Dragons, Kalisto and Sin Cara. At the fourth live special episode, NXT TakeOver: R Evolution on December 11, 2014, Adrian Neville lost the NXT Championship to Sami Zayn. Bo Dallas returned to the main roster on the May 23, 2014 episode of SmackDown. The Ascension were promoted to the main roster on the December 29, 2014 episode of Raw. Neville was promoted to the main roster on the post-WrestleMania Raw on March 30, 2015. CJ Parker left WWE in April 2015. == Results  References  External links == * Event results on WWE.com * Event photos on WWE.com Category:2014 in Florida NXT Arrival Category:Events in Florida Category:Professional wrestling in Winter Park, Florida Arrival; ","title":"NXT Arrival"},{"id":"42047347","text":"The 1955 Star World Championship was held in Havana, Cuba in 1955. ==ResultsReferences== * * Category:Star World Championships Category:1955 in sailing Category:Sailing competitions in Cuba Category:1955 in Cuban sport ","title":"1955 Star World Championship"},{"id":"42047354","text":"The Municipality of Mirna Peč (; ) is a municipality in southeast Slovenia, located in the traditional region of Lower Carniola. The seat of the municipality, which was established in 1998, is Mirna Peč. With an estimated population of 2,800, the municipality is included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. ==Geography== The municipality lies at the junction of the Dinaric Alps, the Pannonian Basin, and the Alps, making shallow carbonate bedrocks, in particular limestone, the prevailing substratum. The predominantly hilly landscape with frequent karst features consists of three valleys: the Igmanca Valley, the Temenica Valley, and the Globodol Polje. ===The Igmanca Valley=== The Igmanca Valley northeast of Mirna Peč is bounded by Šentjurij Peak () to the south, Snakaš Hill to the west, and Mount Poljane (, with the highest peak at 477 m) and Plešivica Hill to the northeast. Although white or gray Jurassic limestone is most common, the northeast slope is covered with brown marl and red limestone from the Cretaceous period. There are five karst caves on its slopes, the largest one being Giant's House Cave () on Plešivica Hill. The valley, with an elevation of about 260 m, contains a shallow aquifer with a limited groundwater supply. Igmanca Creek, also known as Poljane Creek (), surfaces and disappears underground twice along the valley. Karst features such as small swallow holes, estavelles, and, to a lesser extent, an outcrop of carbonate rock are also present. ===The Temenica Valley=== South of Saint Anne Hill (), the Temenica River surfaces below a 35 m cliff at Zijalo. The initially narrow river valley gradually stretches into the undulating terraced countryside east of Golobinjek Hill. The river meanders through the floodplain at Mirna Peč and disappears beneath the surface in the swallow holes at Goriška Vas. Due to seasonal flooding in spring and autumn, fertile alluvial soil along the river bank is spread across the valley. Loam and clay deposits cover the surrounding hillsides. The Temenica River is preserved as an ecological important area due to its unique and characteristic natural features, including varied riverside biodiversity, and the network of karst springs at Zijalo is listed as a site of local importance and a special conservation area. ===The Globodol Polje=== Globodol is a dry polje surrounded by an 80 to 120 m higher oval ridge to the north and the Ajdovec Plateau to the south, Koprivnica Hill to the west and Golobinjek Hill to the east. Its bottom at an elevation of 200 m is 4 km long and 1 km wide, covered mostly with red clay and rendzina.

There is the Sun or day, represented by a circle. There is man, represented by a ring shape. There is a thing, represented by a square. There is thought, represented by a triangle with a slightly cut off top. There is feeling, represented by a heart. There is land or place, represented by a low straight line. There the question indicator, a question mark. There is, lastly, a point or existence, represented by a single point. ==Words== Words are made by combining different symbols in different ways. For example if you put a dot inside a circle it will represent today, or if you put a fish in a ring shape it will be a fisherman. There an around 80 words that are official according to Yukio Ota. Words can be created as long as they follow the basic word syntax. ==Sentences== Sentences are formed by a combination of certain words. There are three rows that you use when writing sentences. The middle row is used for the core words (nouns, verbs, and direct/indirect objects). The top row is used to modify verbs with adverbs.

It is notable for not being a profile. Joachim Deschler (sometimes Joachim Teschler or, incorrectly, Johann Teschler; c.1500 - after 1 October 1571, Vienna) was a German sculptor and medalist. == Life and work == Little is known about his life. The St. Lorenz Church Book states that he married his first wife in 1532 and his second wife (the widow of painter Nikolaus Glockendon) in 1537. That same year, he was granted full rights as a citizen of Nuremberg. There are no further details for the period 1533 to 1547, except that he studied in Italy for two years; mostly, it is thought, in Venice and Rome, returning with many drawings and sketches. Also, his first contacts with the Archduke Maximilian (later, Maximilian II), date from 1543. He was still a resident of Nuremberg in 1554, when his daughter by his first wife was married, but moved to Vienna sometime in the late 50s. It was there, in 1564, that he became Maximilian's Imperial Court Sculptor. The last record of his being paid a salary dates from 1 October 1571, so it is believed that he died later that year. Deschler's workshop produced small sculptures made from limestone and boxwood in the German Renaissance style. He also produced a great number of artistically executed medals, which may be identified by the letters \\"ID\\" inscribed on the arm of the person depicted. The Coat of Arms on their reverse sides indicate that they were modelled with limestone from the Solnhofen quarries. Most of his medals were cast at the mint in Kremnitz. Although Deschler's work shows Italian influence, its genre-like nature marks it as distinctively German. After Hans Bolsterer, he is considered one of the greatest German medalists of that period. == References  Further reading == *Des Johann Neudörfer, Schreib- und Rechenmeisters zu Nürnberg, Nachrichten von Künstlern und Werkleuten daselbst aus dem Jahre 1547: nebst der Fortsetzung des Andreas Gulden (Of Johann Neudörfer, writing and arithmetic master to Nuremberg, news of artists and workmen there from 1547: together with the continuation of Andreas Gulden), G.

André Previn has composed film scores (including many songs), jazz pieces and contemporary classical music. His earliest compositions known at least by name/type are student works from the mid-1940s (a clarinet sonata, a string quartet, a rhapsody for violin and orchestra and some art songs). They were written at the same time as he did his first work for the movies (1946) and his first jazz recordings (1945). He composed the music for the film musical It's Always Fair Weather (1955), and music for five new songs written with Alan Jay Lerner for the film Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Hollywood between 1946 and 1969, Previn also worked extensively as an adaptor, winning his four Academy Awards (out of 13 nominations) for works in this category: Gigi (Original score by Frederick Loewe for the film), Porgy and Bess (stage-to-film adaptation of George Gershwin's opera score), Irma la Douce (the film used the score of the stage musical by Marguerite Monnot, but the songs themselves were omitted) and My Fair Lady (stage-to-film adaptation of Fredrick Loewe's musical score). While working as an adaptor, Previn regularly modified the original compositions. At times, he was adding some own music, orchestrating, conducting and playing piano, as well. In later years, he has concentrated on composing contemporary classical music. In this field, Previn's works as a composer \\"combine expressionistic harmony with a strong tendency towards tonality. They are rhythmic and metrically complex, marvelously orchestrated, and include flashes of idioms associated with jazz and symphonic film music. Despite the crossover appeal that Previn's art music provokes in the ears of many commentators, Previn does not see himself as a postmodern musician, trying to mix musical styles and elements to create new kinds of aesthetic experiences.\\"Frédéric Döhl, André Previn, in: Charles Hiroshi Garrett (Ed.): New Grove Dictionary of American Music. 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press, New York 2012. For example, he collaborated with Tom Stoppard on Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, a play with substantial musical content, which was first performed in London in 1977 with Previn conducting the LSO. His first opera, A Streetcar Named Desire, premiered at the San Francisco Opera in 1998. It quickly developed into one of the most widely played contemporary operas.Frédéric Döhl: Movie for the stage? Zu André Previns Opern, in Archiv für Musikwissenschaft 69/1 (2012), p. 55. His second opera, Brief Encounter, based on the 1945 movie of the same name, was premiered at Houston Grand Opera on May 1, 2009.Frédéric Döhl: About the Task of Adapting a Movie Classic for the Opera Stage: On André Previn’s A Streetcar Named Desire (1998) and Brief Encounter (2009), in: Frédéric Döhl & Gregor Herzfeld (eds.): In Search of the Great American Opera: Tendenzen des amerikanischen Musiktheaters, Münster 2016, . His numerous other contemporary classical works include vocal, chamber, and orchestral music. His contemporary classical music was premiered by artists like Vladimir Ashkenazy, Janet Baker, Yuri Bashmet, Renée Fleming, Yo-Yo Ma, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Itzhak Perlman, John Williams, the Emerson String Quartet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic. The closest working relationships with regard to Previn's contemporary classical music are with violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, having premiered eight works between 2001 and 2015, and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, having premiered (as an ensemble or with smaller groups or soloists from its ranks) nine works between 1996 and 2012. == Catalog raisonné == For a full catalog raisonné containing the dates, places and participants of premieres as well as the names and sources for lost works (especially the early chamber and orchestral music), abandoned works (like the opera Silk or the film score to Goodbye, Mr. Chips), rejected works (like the film score to See No Evil) and withdrawn works (like the Cello Concerto No. 1) see Frédéric Döhl: André Previn.

The storm was first identified as a tropical low on 20 November 2013 well to the northwest of Australia. Tracking generally west to west-southwest, the small system steadily organized into a tropical cyclone by 22 November. Maintaining a small central dense overcast, Alessia brushed the Kimberley region before making landfall in the Top End region with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) on 23 and 24 November respectively. Some weakening took place as the system moved over land; however, reorganization occurred as it neared the Gulf of Carpentaria. After moving over water on 26 November, it redeveloped gale-force winds. Alessia reached its peak intensity on 27 November with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a barometric pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg) and subsequently made its final landfall near Wollogorang. Weakening ensued once more as the storm traveled over land; though, Alessia's remnants looped eastward back over water before doubling back to the west. The system was last noted moving inland again over the Northern Territory on 1 December. Throughout Alessia's existence, it caused only minimal damage. Several areas experienced gale-force winds, with gusts measured up to on Centre Island. Moderate to heavy rains accompanied the system as well, with a storm maxima of also occurring on Centre Island. ==Meteorological history== On 20 November 2013, an area of low pressure, accompanied by persistent deep convection, developed over the southern Indian Ocean, roughly 1,465 km (910 mi) north of RAAF Learmonth in Western Australia. At the mid-levels, the circulation appeared more broad in nature, with notable rainbands wrapping into the low. Environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis, with moderate wind shear, high sea surface temperatures, and prominent outflow that extended into the mid-latitude westerlies. By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) noted this system as a tropical low just outside their area of responsibility. Owing to increasing organization over the following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system late on 21 November. Subsequently, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system under the identifier Tropical Cyclone 02S on 22 November, estimating it to have attained gale-force winds. Situated along the edge of a near-equatorial ridge, the storm tracked generally east and was forecast to maintain this movement for much of its existence. Later on 21 November, the BOM classified the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and assigned it the name Alessia, at which time it was located 390 km (240 mi) north of Broome. A smaller-than-average cyclone, Alessia featured a core of deep convection but no notable banding features, making Dvorak satellite intensity estimates difficult. The storm, having a maximum diameter of no more than 335 km (210 mi) with gale-force winds covering less than half that distance, maintained a very small central dense overcast as it approached the Kimberley region. Around 0600 UTC on 23 November, the JTWC estimated Alessia to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Throughout 23 November, a slight northerly component took place in the track, with Alessia remaining offshore as it brushed the Kimberley region. However, dry air from over Australia was drawn into the system, causing a dramatic decrease in convection. At this time, Alessia became the first storm since Tropical Cyclone Anika in 2008 to affect Western Australia during November. Later that day, the storm passed over Troughton Island where gale-force winds were measured. Moving over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf at the southern end of the Timor Sea early on 24 November, a burst in convection over Alessia's center indicated it was maintaining its intensity as a minimal tropical cyclone. Continued reorganization of the cyclone's structure took place as it accelerated east toward the Top End region, with defined banding apparent on satellite imagary and a tight circulation center seen on local radar. Alessia made landfall at 0930 UTC on 24 November near the Daly River Mouth, south of Darwin, Northern Territory, before rapidly weakening to a tropical low. Alessia's movement onshore marked the first time since Cyclone Joan in 1975 that a tropical cyclone affected the Northern Territory during November. In light of the system moving overland, the JTWC issues their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving steadily eastward across Top End, Alessia remained weak but its proximity to water allowed significant bursts of convection to develop during this time. Early on 26 November, the former cyclone emerged over the Gulf of Carpentaria near Blue Mud Bay. Once offshore, a break in the upper- level ridge previously steering the storm eastward caused a southward shift in the track, bringing it directly over Groote Eylandt for several hours. Gale- force winds soon redeveloped over the southeastern quadrant of Alessia; however, it was not re-designated as a tropical cyclone until 27 November when the winds extended halfway around the circulation. As Alessia re-intensified over the southwestern Gulf, its movement became more southeasterly, taking the circulation parallel to the coast. With an anticyclone over the Northern Territory providing modest outflow for the cyclone, it continued to intensify; the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm by 0600 UTC on 27 November. Hours later, Alessia reached its peak strength with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a barometric pressure estimated at 991 mbar (hPa; 29.27 inHg). Simultaneously, it moved ashore near Wollogorang, roughly 130 km (80 mi) east of Borroloola. Increasing shear and land interaction caused the low- and mid- level circulations to separate, with the later continuing eastward over water. The storm soon weakened to a tropical low and its movement became erratic. Its remnants persisted for several days in the same general region, executing a clockwise loop before moving back over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 28 November. While environmental conditions favored redevelopment once again and deep convection had formed over the system, its low-level circulation remained poorly organized. Failing to regenerate, Alessia moved eastward before doubling back to the west, passing near the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands on 30 November. It was last noted on 1 December over the Top End region. ==Preparations and impactKimberley and Top End=== Cyclone Alessia on 25 November over the Top End region. On 21 November, a cyclone watch was raised for coastal and nearby inland areas of Western Australia between Wyndham and Beagle Bay. This watch was soon expanded to encompass areas east to the Western Australia–Northern Territory border and west to the Mitchell Plateau. Additionally, areas from Mitchell Plateau to Cockatoo Island were placed under a cyclone warning. The following day, watches extended to Cape Hotham Light in the Northern Territory, including the city of Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. As the cyclone intensified, warnings gradually spread eastward. Warnings reached as far east as Point Stuart prior to Alessia's landfall. All watches and warnings were dropped on 24 November as Alessia moved inland and degraded to a tropical low. Though impact from the storm was expected to be fairly minimal, residents were still advised to stock up on emergency supplies and be prepared. Northern Territory Police Commissioner, John McRoberts, urged residents to heed warnings despite the generally non-threatening nature of the storm, \\"complacency can often be your worst enemy in these types of events.\\" Many stores across Darwin reported a sharp increase in the sales of bottled water due to the storm. Despite the approaching storm, regional airports, schools, and businesses remained open. Ferry service to the Tiwi Islands, however, was suspended for 24 November. On 23 November, Cyclone Alessia brushed the Kimberley coastline of Western Australia as a low-end Category 1\\\\. The strongest winds were measured on Troughton Island at with gusts to . The storm's brisk forward motion limited rainfall, however, with only falling on the island. Farther west, Kalumburu received of rain. Effects across the Top End region were similar to Kimberly, some reports of gale-force winds with generally light to moderate rain, peaking at along the Upper Wickham River. Owing to previously dry conditions, the rains proved mostly beneficial to the region. Flash flooding along the Goomadeer River in Arnhem Land caught at least seven people off-guard, including one infant, as their two vehicles were overcome with water. Six people safely made it out while another was swept downstream. He was rescued two days later by local police. In Darwin, strong winds downed a few trees in the Northern Suburbs and Howard Springs while localised flooding occurred in Palmerston. Additionally, one power line was downed in the city. Local authorities reported no serious traffic accidents in relation to the storm nor injuries. In Milne, a few residents seeking shelter at a local fire station found themselves locked out despite officials advising people to seek shelter if necessary. ===Gulf of Carpentaria=== Following Alessia's reorganization over the Gulf of Carpentaria early on 27 November, a cyclone warning was raised for areas between Port Roper, Northern Territory to Karumba, Queensland, including Mornington Island. Once the storm moved onshore in the Northern Territory, all watches and warnings were dropped later that same day. On Centre Island, daily rainfall peaked at on 27 November, with an additional falling over the subsequent three days as Alessia moved erratically in the southwestern Gulf of Carpentaria. Sustained winds of and gusts to affected the island during the storm's passage. The McArthur River zinc mine received of rain on 27 November. Heavy rains extended eastward into Queensland with falling on Mornington Island over a five-day period. ==See also== *2013–14 Australian region cyclone season *Cyclone Helen (2008) ==NotesReferences== Alessia Alessia Alessia Category:2013 in Australia Alessia ","title":"Cyclone Alessia"},{"id":"42047664","text":"Saint Catharine (also Saint Catherine) is an unincorporated community in Washington County, Kentucky, United States.

Franz Körte was born in Aschersleben as the second son of an Evangelical Lutheran preacher. His mother was a niece of the poet Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim.Necrolog \\"Heinrich Friedrich Franz Körte\\" in: Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Landwirthschaft und verwandte Gegenstände, Vol. 2, 1845. p. 159 His brother was William KörteArthur Judge: Korte, William. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB). Volume 16, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1882, p 725 (1776-1846), a literary historian and executor of Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim. Körte received his education in his parental home and at the high school in his native town. Attracted to nature and its operation, he decided to devote himself to study of agricultural economics. Hereby he was influenced by the intellectual movement, which the first writings and teachings of Albrecht Thaer had initiated in the circles of the German agriculturists. In 1802 Körte had visited Thaer in Celle, where Thaer had encouraged him to aim for a scientific study, because this higher qualification would better prepare for the agricultural profession. To learn more about the agriculture practice, Körte became apprentice to a country estate in Almenhausen (now Kashtanovo) in Kaliningrad Oblast. Also briefly he was agricultural official in an estate in the village of Mennewitz near Aken (Elbe) on the Elbe, where he gained more practical experience into agricultural and management affairs.Hermann Kellenbenz, Jürgen Schneider (1978) Auf dem Weg zur Industrialisierung, p, 192 After solving some financial difficulties with the assistance of Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, he then moved to the University of Halle. From 1803 to 1804 he devoted himself to the study of natural sciences, particularly botany and chemistry, and under guidance of the botanist Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel familiarized himself with other capacities. === Early career at University of Erlangen === After he finished his studies in Halle in 1804, the circumstances led him to return in the agricultural practice and to accept a position as husbandry conductor on the estates of Baron von Dressler in Bavaria, but not for long. In 1806 he obtained the position to habilitate as docent at the University of Erlangen, where he turned his scientific research to botany and chemistry. Möglinsche Annalen der Landwirthschaft, Vol. 17, 1826 Die Strich-, Zug- oder Wander-Heuschrecke, 1828 His extensive study of the flora of southern Germany in cooperation with Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber resulted in the publication of the Flora Erlangensis in 1811. In the field of chemistry Körte investigated the sulfur springs Wipfeld in 1812,Maximilian Joseph Schleiß (1829) Das Ludwigsbad bey Wipfeld und seine Umgebungen: mit besonderem Hinblick auf Gaibachs Kunstgegenstände u. Gartenanlagen. p. 5 resulting in the publication Untersuchungen der Wippfelder Schwefelquellen (Investigations of Wippfelder sulfur wells). In the same period Theodor Konrad von Kretschmann, minister of Francis, Duke of Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld, had asked Körte to take on the organisation of an agricultural/economical teaching institute in Marloffstein in association with the local economy professor Michael Alexander Lips (1779-1838), the Adjunct Director of the Faculty of Philosophy in Erlangen.Johann Gottfried Pahl (1808) Chronik der Teutschen: eine politische Zeitung. p. 213 Under the unfavorable conditions of that time, the company was not able to gain any support and had to be abandoned due to lack of funds. Not discouraged by such failure Körte in 1811 habilitated, and in the same year was appointed lecturer at the University of Würzburg and technical assistant in currency measurements. === Professor at the Agricultural Academy Möglin === After in 1814 the professorship of Natural Sciences at the Agricultural Academy in Möglin had become vacant, by the death of Professor Georg Ernst Wilhelm Crome, Albrecht Daniel Thaer invited Korte to apply. In autumn 1814 Körte first moved to Berlin, where Thaer lectured at the University. He spend the winter semester 1814/15 giving private lecturers in natural science, and started the research that would lead to the 1818 publication Was ist Humus, wie und auf welche Weise wirkt derselbe als ernährendes Mittel für die Pflanzen? (What is humus, how and in what way does it work the same as a nurturing agent for plants?). By Easter 1815 Körte was installed at the Agricultural Academy in Möglin in Crome's position,Wilhelm Körte Albrecht Thaer: Sein Leben und Wirken, 1838, p. 254Johannes Hansen. Albrecht Thaer: Festrede zum Gedächtnis seines hundertjährigen Todestages gehalten in der Landwirtschaftlichen Hochschule Berlin. P. Parey, 1929. p. 10. awarded with the title of \\"Royal Prussian Professor\\". In the same year he married Thaer's daughter Caroline, widow of Georg Ernst Wilhelm Crome. Körte was a man of excellent educational and organizational skills. In 1818 Thaer made him the director of Mögliner teaching institution, which in 1819 was granted by the Prussian state administration the right to call themselves Königlich Preußische Akademie des Landbaus (Royal Prussian Academy of agriculture). In 1824 Körte took over as editor of the magazine Möglinsche Annalen der Landwirthschaft (Möglinsche annals of agriculture).Landwirtschaftliche Jahrbücher.

Of these at irregular intervals published yearbooks at total was published of five volumes. Korte was an honorary member of several agricultural associations. Körte was honorary member of many economic and agricultural societies wirth economic associations. The Prussian king awarded him the Order of the Red Eagle.

He then worked for four years under Holabird & Roche. He then left the firm to start his own, Dubin & Eisenberg. In 1928, Dubin left the United States to study at Bauhaus. He returned to Highland Park, Illinois after a year of study. Dubin designed a house for himself in 1929 and completed it a year later. The house kept him occupied during the first few years of the Great Depression, once commissioned ceased due to the economic times. The house was one of the first International Style buildings in the town. It was nicknamed the \\"Battledeck House\\" because the steel plate of the roof and floor resembled the construction of a ship. It was completely fireproof: the exterior was constructed of clinker brick and steel. Dubin chose this design because he anticipated a need for housing the poor following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Dubin was impressed with the ability of Pullman cars to withstand a variety of temperatures, particularly after reading an essay by Sigfried Giedion. He sought an affordable style of house that could be prefabricated and sold throughout the country. The interior featured recessed radiators, built-in furniture, and a simple dado. It was one of the first flat-roofed houses in the Chicago area.http://digital- libraries.saic.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/caohp/id/25298/rec/1 On September 29, 1982, the house was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lake County, Illinois Category:Houses completed in 1930 Category:Highland Park, Illinois Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Houses in Lake County, Illinois Category:International style architecture in Illinois ","title":"Henry Dubin House"},{"id":"42047822","text":"\\"Lies\\" is the debut solo single of Swedish singer Anette Olzon from her 2014 debut album Shine.

The squadron was established on 1 November 1970 and redesignated Fleet Logistics Support Squadron VR-64 on 18 September 2004, after 34 years of service. It was based at NAS Willow Grove, Pennsylvania during its entire life. Units of the squadron made 26 major overseas deployments. ==Operational history== P-3A at NAS North Island, November 1983 *1 Nov 1970: VP-64 was established as a reserve patrol squadron at NAS Willow Grove, under the operational control of Reserve Patrol Wings, Atlantic. VP-64 was established from previously existing reserve VPs—66W1-W3, 21W4, 26W5 and 23W6—as a result of a major reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve that took place in 1970. The 12 reserve squadrons formed were structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. The concept, known as the 12/2/1 had 12 VP squadrons under two commands, Commander Fleet Air Reserve Wings Atlantic and Commander Fleet Air Reserve Wings Pacific, both under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve. VP-64 was initially equipped with 12 Lockheed SP-2H Neptune aircraft, 60 officers and 323 enlisted personnel. *June 1973–June 1974: The squadron’s first Lockheed P-3A DIFAR Orion arrived. Transition training for aircrews was completed in June 1974. *7 February 1977: VP-64 participated in Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations with CTG 84.3 in the Mediterranean for a period of three days. The squadron was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation on 1 December 1977 for its performance. *October 1982–October 1983: Crew transition training to the P-3A TAC/NAV MOD airframe was begun and completed in October 1983. The TAC/NAV MOD version replaced the ASN-42 navigation and tactical display systems with the LTN-72 inertial and Omega navigation systems and digital computer. *January 1987: Perimeter security at NAS Willow Grove was breached by a peace activist group. Several members of the group were able to damage one of the squadron’s aircraft before base security was able to respond. *1990: VP-64 traded in their 10 P-3A Orions for eight P-3B TAC/NAV MOD aircraft. The IRDS/HACLS modifications added infrared detection. The completion of these modifications gave squadron aircraft a Harpoon launch capability. The Harpoon missile capability was originally intended specifically for the elimination of Soviet surveillance trawlers in the event of war. *April–May 1993: VP-64 deployed to Nimes, France, in support of joint French-American ASW exercises. A detachment was maintained at RNAS Souda Bay, Crete. Several crews were put on alert status at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, during the period of heightened tensions in the former Yugoslavian Republic in support of UN sanctions. *January–March 1994: VP-64 deployed several detachments to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puerto Rico, in support of Operation Uphold Democracy. The detachments assisted in supporting UN sanctions against Haiti. *April 1994: VP-64 began the transition from the P-3B to the P-3C UII. It incorporated the latest in avionics and weapons systems, including a turret-mounted infrared detection device to drop out of the nose to identify targets day or night. *July–September 1995: VP-64 deployed several detachments to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, in support of DoD counter- narcotics patrols in the Caribbean theater. During this period the Condors assisted in the tracking and seizure of narcotics shipments estimated at a street value of $2.5 billion. ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * SP-2H Neptune – November 1970 * P-3A DIFAR Orion – June 1973 * P-3A TAC/NAV MOD Orion – June 1982 * P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Orion – 1990 * P-3C UII Orion – April 1994 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-64"},{"id":"42047833","text":"Cycas zeylanica, common name (in Sri Lanka) maha-madu is a plant apparently at present endemic to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

He founded the predecessor of Schott Music, a major German music publishing company which continues to this day. ==Biography== Schott was the eldest child of Nicolaus Schott (1716–92), a baker and innkeeper who had a sideline as a ', and his wife Maria Elisabeth Bakkers. From 1762 to 1764, he served an apprenticeship in engraving and printing at Strasbourg. He subsequently travelled to the Netherlands, France and England. He studied philosophy at the University of Mainz, and was in 1769 awarded the degree of Magister artium. In 1770, he established a business in Mainz to print and sell sheet music. Around the same time, he trained as a clarinetist; perhaps under Peter Krauß, court clarinetist at Mainz. From 1771 to 1773, he played in a military band at Strasbourg. He studied further in Paris under Joseph Beer (1744–1811), one of the first clarinet virtuosi. 0n 14 June 1780, he was appointed court music printer to Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden (1728-1811), with exclusive rights; perhaps an unusual appointment, because in 1780 Mainz was the seat of the Electorate of Mainz, a state next to but distinct from the Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1785, he was awarded the privilege of Bürgerrecht by the city of Mainz, and also issued his first catalogue of music for sale. He published, among other things, first editions of piano reductions of Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1785) and Don Giovanni (1791), works by Johann Franz Xaver Sterkel and Antonio Rosetti, and salon music. During the political upheavals associated with the Napoleonic Wars, which included the overthrow of the Electorate of Mainz by the short-lived Republic of Mainz (1793), its reinstatement, its further overthrow by the Cisrhenian Republic (1797), its further reinstatement, and the abolition not only of the Electorate but of the Holy Roman Empire itself (1806), he dealt, in addition to music, in stationery, paper and wine. After his death, his sons continued the music business under the name B. Schotts Söhne, and expanded it across Europe. That firm later passed out of family hands, and eventually became the modern company Schott Music. ==See also== * Schott frères, a Belgian sheet music publishing house that began in 1823 as the Belgium branch of B.

This series is a satire of \\"Big Ag\\" and \\"Big Food\\" practices, featuring the fictional megacorporation Animoil feeding cows petropellets, which are made from petroleum directly rather than indirectly, from the corn and soybean that require so much petroleum products to grow (nitrogen fertilizer is made from the nitrogen present in the air and hydrogen present in natural gas from fracking). The series is part of an unconventional Chipotle marketing campaign to make people think about the origins of their food. Some agricultural groups have criticized the series as unrealistic.

Together they authored more than 200 papers. == Gertrude Henle == Gertrude Henle (born Szpingier, on April 3, 1912 in Mannheim, Germany; died age 94 on September 1, 2006 in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania) was an American virologist. Henle came from a Protestant family of civil servants and grew up in Mannheim. Her mother was murdered by the Nazis in 1943; her father had died in 1938. Henle studied from 1931 medicine at the University of Heidelberg, and earned her medical degree in 1936. For her doctorate, she was at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, where she met her husband Werner Henle, whom she followed to Philadelphia in 1937, in the U.S., where they married in 1937. Both worked in their careers closely related. She was from 1937 Instructor of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1941 Associate Professor of Virology (and member of the Research Department of Virology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). Later she became a professor. In 1982, she retired, the same year as her husband. Gertrude and Werner Henle are known for their work on flu vaccination and the development of a test for mumps known. They also reported the carcinogenic effects of the Epstein-Barr virus after and investigated further tumor viruses . They showed the effect of gamma with Joseph Stokes globulin against hepatitis .

It examines the total population as well as its subgroups. The survey occurs telephonically or with questionnaires given to a representative cross-section of the total population sample. The yearly use of media is queried using dated surveys and daily routine studies. Initially, only the German-speaking population of Germany was questioned, limited to those living in private households which was the main place of residence, and limited to those at least 14 years old. In 2008, the age limit was reduced to ten years old and European Union foreigners were incorporated. From 2010, “other foreigners” are also now questioned. This includes approximately 50,000 young people and adults who are chosen by random selection according to the ADM sampling system. They are subsequently questioned, some in person and some telephonically (CATI). In the process, the subgroups are described based on their demographic features such as age, sex, occupation, income, religion, and community size. The results of the media analysis are issued on behalf of AGMA by its subsidiary Media Micro Census. They have large practical relevance because they largely determine the booking behavior of the advertising industry. The MA thus indirectly determines the price a media provider can charge for advertising. It is hence regularly observed that some radio stations use a large part of their annual advertising budget during the survey period of the MA. == MA Pressemedien == In MA Pressemedien (English: MA Press Media), data is obtained on magazines, daily newspapers, supplements, city magazines, KONPRESS (denominational press; church newspapers), reading circles, and cinema. MA 2006 Pressemedien II, published on July 26, 2006, noted 170 magazines. For this study, around 39,000 interviews were collectively carried out in two waves during a year (February 27, 2005 – February 4, 2006). The MA 2007 Pressemedien I appeared in January 2007. From the Second Wave MA 2004 (September 2003 – February 2004) on, some changes in the survey method were carried out, one of which was the launch of the Title Split Method (division of the approximately 180 titles submitted into three otherwise identical questionnaire versions) as well as (first only in approximately 10% of the interviews) the CASI method. Through the introduction of the title split models, the reach of the magazines increases over the two waves by an average of 7% - though with clear deviations for individual titles up or down. A direct comparison of historical data is hence no longer justifiable because of methodological reasons. As so-called “media currency”, the readers per issue (LpA) was established in the MA Pressemedien. It shows how many readers an issue of a certain magazine or newspaper has. == MA Radio == In MA Radio, the radio consumption for individual stations is queried. The MA Radio is conducted telephonically (the so-called CATI survey model), for which 58,011 people were questioned and appeared as MA 2006 Radio I on March 8, 2006. As media currency, the so-called listeners per hour (for pre-determined hours) is reported as well as the average listeners per hour and the listeners per day. == MA Plakat == The first MA Plakat (English: MA Placard) under the AGMA roof appeared on September 22, 2004. On December 19, 2007 the MA 2007 Plakat was published. The coverage method of the MA Plakat was completely revised in 2007. The data is now based on a combined survey model, consisting of a CATI survey and a measurement method with a GPS receiver. == Online Forschung AG (AGOF) == Since 2009, the collected Internet Facts of the Online Forschung AG (AGOF) (English: Online Research AG) also fall under the methodological responsibility of the MA.Pressemitteilung der AG-MA (pdf) AGOF records internet usage behavior with the Three Pillar Model: *First Pillar: Technical measurement (computer-level, units are individual visits and page views, obtained by IP Address) *Second Pillar: On-site surveys (Population is all internet users over 14 years old, reference to users in front of the computer, online questionnaires by pop-up window, query to place of use, time of use, sociodemographic data) *Third Pillar: Phone surveys (CATI, population-level) == MA Intermedia == In the fall of each year, MA Intermedia also appears, in which information for magazines, newspapers, TV, and radio is summarized. == General queries == In addition to media use, sociodemographic characteristics, leisure time behavior, and shopping behavior are collected. The questionnaire is largely identical to all MA studies (Press Media, Radio, Daily Newspaper). == Licenses == The current data is only at the disposal of members of the Media-Analyse AG eV (publishing houses, radio stations, advertising agencies, advertisers, etc.). However, one can create a free individual query, e.g. about advertising departments of the publishing houses. == Publication == The Media-Analyse appears twice per year for Pressemedien and Radio, and once per year for Tageszeitungen (English: Daily Newspapers) and Plakat. In Nordrhein-Westfalen, the MA Radio is expanded for local radio stations through the E.M.A. NRW, while in Bavaria, it is expanded through the Radio Analysis. The first Leser-Analyse (English: Reader Analysis) appeared in 1954, and thus AGMA celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2004. == Further analysis files == A whole series of further market and media studies of different providers are based on the MA-determined reach results, among them the TdW (Typologie der Wünsche (English: Typology of Desires) by Hubert Burda Media), VA (Verbraucher-Analyse (English: Consumer Analysis) by Axel Springer Publishers and Bauer Publishers), Communication Networks (Focus Magazine Publishers), MarkenProfile (English: BrandsProfile), VuMA, etc. == References == All of the content of this article comes from the equivalent German-language Wikipedia article (see \\"Deutsch\\" link in the language list).

It was the first animated series in Latin America intended for television, and has been considered the most successful series in the history of Latin American cartoons. The series was first broadcast on August 7, 1967, on Canal 13, and was repeated throughout the day at different times and later came to the cinema in film format. The main character of the series is Hijitus, a street child who lives in the sewers of the city of Trulalá. Trulalá is ravaged by the evil actions of villains such as Professor Neurus, Pucho, Granhampa, Dedo Negro, among others. To defend Trulalá and his friends (Oaky, Pichichus, Anteojito and Larguirucho) Thanks to the magical powers of his famous hat 'sombreritus' Hijitus transforms himself into Super Hijitus, a strong superhero that is capable of flying. == Origins == Hijitus was born as a minor character in the comic strip The Adventures of Pi-Pio, published in September 1955 in Billiken magazine, a publication in which García Ferré collaborated weekly. In that version, Hijitus was presented as an \\"imported boy in observation\\", descendant of pharaohs and one of the inhabitants of the populous Villa Leoncia, imaginary city in which the adventures of Pi-Pío happened. This was the first serial comic strip conceived by García Ferré. == Plot == Hijitus is a street kid who lives in a sewer pipe in the city of Trulalá (the \\"cannitus\\"). His friends are Pichichus (his dog) and Oaky (spoiled son of the richest and most powerful man in town, Gold Silver). The city of Trulalá is ravaged by the evil Professor Neurus, against whom the law, embodied by the \\"Council of Elders\\" and the figure of the local Commissar, is manifestly impotent and can not stop him. Hijitus' \\"amiguitus\\" group is also composed of Larguirucho, a naughty and naive young man who shares his time between participating in the evil plans of Neurus, playing with Oaky and asking for help to Hijitus, without becoming aware of the distinction between good and evil. In order to fight evil and more importantly to defend his friends, Hijitus becomes Super Hijitus, an indestructible superhero with incredible abilities, thanks to the power granted by his \\"Magic Sombreritus\\". The dream of his nemesis 'Professor Neurus' is to seize the wonderful hat, and through this, to control Trulalá, and Hijitus does everything in his power to prevent this from happening. ==Main characters Protagonists === *Hijitus / Super Hijitus: Hijitus is a poor boy who lives on the street, within a sanitary sewer, with his dog Pichichus. He has a gang of friends, composed by Oaky, Pichichus and Larguirucho. He is characterized by a sense of friendship, justice and solidarity, and always wears a hat and a blue bottomless galley. Hijitus can become \\"Super Hijitus\\" by passing through the hat and saying \\"Hat, sombreritus, make me a Super Hijitus!\\". As Super Hijitus, he is indestructible and can fly, abilities he uses to face the villain of the series, Professor Neurus. His favorite expression is Ojalita, ojalata, chuculita, chuculata, fufu... and choo, choo, choo, choo. *Pichichus: Hijitus' dog and friend. He can also become Super Pichichus if he passes through Hijitus' hat. Hijitus adopted him in the adventure called \\"An UFO Trulalá\\", where he defends Hijitus from wild stray dogs, becoming Hijitus' mascot and his faithful sidekick. He doesn't talk, his dialogues consist of barking. *Oaky: The son of the richest man in Trulalá, Gold Silver. He is a baby, and is Hijitus' main friend. He wears diapers and two pistols. His favorite motto is \\"shoot, mess and cosha golda\\". He is a very spoiled and pampered child, which has led him to ally with Neurus on more than one occasion. Despite this antagonistic tendency, Oaky is a good-hearted boy, and very brave for his age. *Anteojito: A boy about 8 years old who wears big glasses (hence his name) and is cheerful and positive. He lives with his uncle Antifaz. Both Anteojito and Antifaz had a separate development within the Hijitus Universe, living in another city (Villa Trompeta), besides having their own magazine (Anteojito Magazine). However, he began to appear on Hijitus' adventures eventually. *Larguirucho: A tall, ungainly and stupid mouse who is friends with Hijitus and is part of his gang, but also occasionally participates on the side of the evil Professor Neurus without being fully aware of the evil of their deeds. Larguirucho is known for being a good friend with good feelings, but little intelligence to distinguish right from wrong. His favorite phrase when he is called is to respond to the caller with Blá má fuete, que no te ecucho (Peak mo' lodly, I can't 'ear you). He is the only character who has appeared in every Manuel García Ferré movie. === Antagonists === *Professor Neurus: The main antagonist of the series. He is an evil scientist, whose aim is to take power in Trulalá with the help of his inventions. He is aided by his henchmen Pucho and Serrucho, sometimes also adding Larguirucho to his gang. His favorite phrase is \\"Shut up, dumber!\\". Professor Neurus is also memorable for his way of distributing the spoils after a criminal act: \\"One for you, two for me, one for you, ten for me, another for you, everything for me.\\" On one occasion, Professor Neurus used a monstrous contraption called The Marañaza to steal Gold Silver's fortune, with the help of Oaky, who wanted to \\"have more money than his daddy.\\" *Pucho: A mouse henchman under the orders of Professor Neurus. He is a typical \\"inmate\\" of Buenos Aires' slums, talking in slang and constantly having a \\"fag\\" (cigarette) in the mouth, which can transform into any object. Pucho is a tango aficionado and permanently uses the words \\"This that...\\" to start a sentence. *Serrucho: The other of Professor Neurus' henchmen. He is a mouse with a similar aspect to Largirucho and Pucho, but being much shorter in height, with a hat that entirely covers his eyes, and also sporting enormous front teeth. He doesn't talk; instead, he vigorously grinds his teeth with a hand as if it was a serrucho (\\"saw\\"), hence his name. *Witch Cachavacha: She acts alone, with the help of her faithful Owl Pajarraco. She lives in the countryside, in a gaucho ranch style she calls \\"hovel\\". It seeks permanently to harm the inhabitants of Trulalá and flies in broomstick. *Pajarraco: Cachavacha pet owl, he can speak and is frequently beaten by the witch. === Secondary characters === *The Commissioner of Trulalá: It is the police authority of Trulalá, portrayed like a man of the Argentine coast, with typical correntino accent. *Gold Silver: Father of Oaky. Millionaire of English or American origin, he is the richest man in Trulalá, good-natured though naive. His favorite phrase is \\"Oaky, my son.\\" *Antifaz: Good-uncle of Anteojito, who, as his name indicates, always wears a mask on his face. Both characters belong to the magazine Anteojito, intervening only in the adventures of Hijitus. *The Director of the Museum: He is a gracious old man of vast knowledge, director of the Trulalá museum, who speaks with an English or American accent. Every time Hijitus has a question, they check his encyclopaedias. *Cape Lopecito: Assistant and executing arm of the orders of Trulalá commissioner. *The Neighbor from Across the Road: It is a little girl who lives in front of the mansion of Oaky, of whom this one is in love, without being corresponded; she is polite, well educated, plays the piano and receives serenades from Oaky on her balcony. She is in love with Hijitus. *Kechum: Cousin of Pucho who, when angry, vibrates and causes earthquakes. Is from Rosario. *Gutiérrez: The treacherous butler of Gold Silver, who sometimes tries to steal his boss's fortune. He does not hesitate, every so often, to ally himself with Professor Neurus. *Bodega and Rapiño: They are two delinquents often associated with Professor Neurus. *Raimundo: The most mischievous orphan of Trulalá's orphanage, he is a problematic and impolite child, who ends up being adopted by Larguirucho. Both characters would have their own development in the magazine (Misfortune of Larguirucho). === Episodic characters === *The Boxitracio: A strange animal believed to be extinct, similar to a kangaroo, with boxing gloves, and with a tendency to box at the slightest threat. Although it appeared in very few episodes, is one of the most popular and remembered characters of the series. His only form of expression was the onomatopoeia Tere quete tere quete ua ua ua. *Trucu: A robot created by Neurus to steal banks, knocks down walls and iron gates. *The Great Hampa: Enigmatic head of Professor Neurus (although finally it is discovered that it is none other than Serrucho). *Black Finger: Delinquent who can disguise himself from anyone, but without being able to hide his black thumb. *The Aguilotros: Enemy birds of the Boxitracians, since both thought that they had conquered first the Island of the Sun, Super Hijitus solved the problem, and managed that they were not more at war. *The Singing Dragon: It' s a dragon that when it sings expels fire of its mouth, causing chaos in Trulalá and goes for the border. *The Hippie Penguin: It is a penguin that with its melodies with the guitar caused great damages. *The Chimney Cat: He is a bad and cunning cat. It manages to take the hat from Hijitus, and become \\"Super Chimney\\". == Diffusion  TV === The Hijitus series was originally broadcast by Channel 13 of Buenos Aires, between 1967 and 1974, in the format of a microprogram of one minute of duration, between the advertising batches from Monday to Friday, and with daily repetitions. On weekends, the full weekly emission summary was broadcast on the show La Feria de la Alegría, and later on El Club de Hijitus. Precisely El Club de Hijitus was a program created in 1968, and broadcast on Sundays at 11:00 am, also by Channel 13, emerged as a result of the success of the series, and led by animators Guillermo Lázzaro and Amalia Scaliter. The program featured the full weekly summary of the series, with the presence of Hada Patricia, the clowns Firulete, Cañito and Carlitos Scazziotta, and disguised actors representing the characters of the series, such as Hijitus, Cachavacha, Larguirucho, Neurus, The Commissioner, etc. === Film adaptations === On September 12, 1973, the 82 minute long feature film The Adventures of Hijitus was made. === DVD === In December 2008 the first box set composed of 5 DVDs was released, which compiles 53 episodes of the original series, including extras such as trailers, trivia, gallery of characters, wallpapers, music clips and synopsis. Later came another series of 5 DVD that completes the series. All DVDs bring Spanish 2.0 audio and 4: 3 picture.

It occurred annually at “The Yard” of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay from 2010 to 2013. Initially, the tournament was open solely to the top 64 players from the West Coast of the United States. In 2013, however, qualifiers for the event were held in 20 U.S. cities, as well as in 23 other countries, to find the top 64 players worldwide. ==History== The firsthttp://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Red-Bull-King-of-the- Rock-2013---History/001243246480715 King of the Rock Tournament was held September 18, 2010. It was the first official sporting event ever held on Alcatraz and the first time basketball had been played there since the inmates left 50 years earlier. Players from the West Coast of the United States competed to fill the top 64 spots. In the end, Izeah “Clutch” Bowman was crowned the first ever “King of the Rock”. Starting in 2011,http://www.slamonline.com/online/other-ballers/streetball/2011/09/recap- red-bull-king-of-the-rock/ the event was opened to competitors from across the U.S. and around the globe. Washington D.C. native Hugh “Baby Shaq” Jones was crowned “King of the Rock” two times consecutively in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, 64 finalists representing 25 countries competed and eventually 36-year-old L.A. native Tarron “The Beast” Williams was crowned the fourth and final “King of the Rock” on September 28, 2013. It has been rumoredhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-beast-is-the-best-at-red- bull-king-of-the-rock-guest-hosted-by-blake-griffin-225736341.html that the event will move to Taiwan in 2014, but official word has not yet been given. The event brought 32 King of the Rock finalists from 23 countries to face off on the prison exercise yards of Samasana Island, Taiwan, and crowned the 2014 champion Kivanc Dinler from Turkey. During the first and only global one-on- one street basketball tournament ever held in Asia, the first-ever Queen of the Rock, Stanislava Fedotova from Russia, was also crowned. ==Ruleshttp://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Red-Bull-King-of-the- Rock-2013---Rules/001243246480527== The rules of the tournament are much like those of typical street ball. Both qualifying and finals rounds incorporate the normal one-on-one set-up of players going head-to-head on an outdoor court, using a single elimination tournament bracket. Shots count as 2 or 3 points and five fouls (or 1 technical foul) mark an automatic disqualification. Four half court games are played simultaneously. Each has their own referee, court manager, and scoreboard. Winners proceed immediately onto the next court to face another player. Games are five minutes each with a running clock and 15 second shot clock. The continuous nature of the competition makes the player’s stamina and physical endurance a key component of success. Participants must be 16 years or older. Those under 18 required consent of a parent or guardian. A coin toss was used to determine first possession of the ball and possession would then alternate throughout the face-off. If a player was fouled in the act of shooting a successful basket, the additional point would be granted and possession would change. It is up to the referee’s discretion whether a 2-minute time out would be granted for injury. In the event of a tie, 2 minutes of overtime would be granted with first possession decided by coin toss. ==Awards== In the qualifying round, a cash prize of $1,000 and a free trip to the finals in San Francisco was awarded to first place. A cash prize of $250 was awarded to second place. In the final round at Alcatraz, a custom trophy, cash prize of $20,000,http://givesyouwings.redbull.com/archive/en-us/journey/king-of-the- rock/ and the title “King of the Rock” was awarded to the overall winner. A $1000 cash prize was awarded to both the second-place winner, and the winner of the dunk contest. ==References== Category:International basketball competitions hosted by the United States Category:Basketball competitions in the United States Category:Red Bull sports events Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2010 Category:Streetball Category:2010 establishments in California ","title":"Red Bull King of the Rock Tournament"},{"id":"42048574","text":"Ad for film War Brides is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: War Brides 1916 American silent war drama film directed by Herbert Brenon and starring Alla Nazimova. The film marked Nazimova's debut in motion pictures.Progressive Silent Film List: War Brides at silentera.comThe AFI Catalog of Feature Films: War Brides The film's lost status makes it a sought-after title. ==Plot== The film was based on the eponymous one-act play by the poet, playwright, and suffragist Marion Craig Wentworth (1872-1942). A newlywed soldier is sent to the front and killed. When his young widow learns of his death she considers committing suicide, but decides against it because she is pregnant. The King of her country (unnamed in the original; Germany in the later version) decrees that women must bear more children to fight in future wars. Soon afterwards, as the King is passing through her village, the pregnant widow leads a procession of women to protest the war. Soldiers try to hold her back, but she manages to come face to face with the King, and kills herself in front of him.

Keith's Palace Theatre in New York City, with Alla Nazimova in the lead role, and toured the country for several months. The play was so much in demand that a second production toured the South, with Gilda Varesi in the lead. In 1916 the play was made into a silent film, also starring Nazimova in her first onscreen role. The film did very well in the United States, bringing the studios a profit of $300,000, and was widely acclaimed by critics. Because of its pacifist message, it was banned in some cities and states. For example, while it had been showing in Maryland, once the United States entered the war the film was banned as its pacifist message might affect military recruitment. The court upheld a state censor board ruling in 1917. In 1917 it was withdrawn from circulation on the grounds that \\"The philosophy of this picture is so easily misunderstood by unthinking people\\". Later that year the producer, Lewis Selznick, had the film edited to give it an anti-German slant, and re-released it to American theaters. It was not shown in any other Allied countries. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * *AllMovie.com Category:1916 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Lost American films Category:Films directed by Herbert Brenon Category:American war drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:1910s war drama films Category:Selznick Pictures films Category:1916 drama films Category:1916 lost films Category:Lost drama films ","title":"War Brides (film)"},{"id":"42048649","text":"Ford Mustang Fastback at the 2014 Mondial de l'Automobile The sixth generation Ford Mustang (S550) is the current iteration of the Mustang pony car manufactured by Ford. In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully independent rear suspension on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L EcoBoost turbocharged and direct injected four cylinder engine. The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964. The sixth generation is also the first Ford Mustang to be marketed and sold globally, and represented the first time that factory right hand drive Mustangs were produced in addition to the left hand drive models. This is part of the \\"One Ford\\" business plan, which also applies to the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion/Mondeo, Escape/Kuga, Edge, Ford Transit Connect, and Ford Transit, as well as other models. ==Background== The sixth generation of the Ford Mustang debuted on December 5, 2013 with same-day media events in Dearborn, Michigan, Los Angeles, California, New York City, New York, Barcelona, Spain, Shanghai, China, and Sydney, Australia. The 2015 Mustang marks the 50th anniversary of continuous Mustang production, which began in March 1964 in advance of the debut of the original Mustang at the 1964 New York World's Fair on April 17, 1964 in Flushing, Queens. Development of the 2015 Mustang, codenamed \\"S550\\", began in 2009 under chief engineer Dave Pericak and (from late-2009) exterior design director Joel Piaskowski, shortly after the updated 2010 model year Mustang went on sale. In December 2010, an exterior design theme proposal by Kemal Curic from Ford's Cologne, Germany design studios was selected by design management. Curic (also responsible for the 2011 Focus (2012 in the US) and the 2014 Mondeo/Fusion) relocated to Ford's design studios in Dearborn in January 2011. During mid-stage development, Curic's original exterior design proposal was eventually rejected by Ford executives, resulting in rapid design changes. After reviewing 3 different exterior theme proposals (A, B, and C) in design clinics in September 2012, the final exterior design (Theme A) was approved by Ford management, with the final design freeze occurring in December 2012, 20 months ahead of originally scheduled August 2014 production. The interior design program began in the spring of 2010, under Doyle Letson. By late 2011, a final interior proposal was settled on and was a combination of Themes A & B. In June 2012, the final interior design was frozen. The decision to utilize an independent rear suspension for this generation (which had been standard on the 99-04 SVT Cobra) was made very early on (the original intent had been to append an IRS to the existing S197 platform, which ironically enough had been tested with an IRS during its development), and its inclusion resulted in several changes to the platform, not least of which being the redesign of the front suspension (the new platform features a double-pivot MacPherson strut front suspension, similar to a design used on many BMWs); the end result, according to Chief Engineer Dave Pericak, was a brand new platform that had very little in common with its predecessor, from a structural perspective, other than the wheelbase, which carried over.https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15112444/2015-ford-mustang-in- depth-with-the-team-that-made-it-happen-feature/ 2015 Ford Mustang: In-Depth with the Team that Made It Happen The first test mules in 2010 model year bodies were spotted earlier in June 2012, and the first S550 prototypes were built five months later (exterior design freeze) in May 2013.Kemal Curic Mustang/GT350 Design Manager Ford of America, linkedin.com ==Engines== At launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L \\"Cyclone\\" V6, an optional 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged, direct-injected I4, or a 5.0 L \\"Coyote\\" V8. The 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the 2015 model year Lincoln MKC crossover. This four-cylinder includes improvements over earlier versions. The 2.3 Ecoboost engine also marks the return of a 4-cylinder engine in the Mustang, which were standard in cars produced from 1974 to 1993, as well as in the \\"SVO\\" turbocharged models from 1984 to 1986. The Cyclone V6 was discontinued after the 2017 model year, leaving only the 2.3 I4 as base engine, similar to 1987-1993 models. In 2018, the 5.0 L Coyote V8 engine was updated (2018 (Gen. 3) Updates) with a revised intake runners, larger valves and dual injection, which utilizes both direct injection and port injection, enabling it to run 87 octane (AKI) gasoline with 12:1 high cr ratio. The cylinders are now lined with a thinner coating achieved by plasma coating, instead of the thicker and heavier traditional cylinder sleeves, which results in a slight displacement increase from 4,951cc (302 cubic inches) to 5,038cc (307 cubic inches). The Shelby GT350 version uses a modified version of the Coyote engine, code-named the Voodoo, that features a displacement of 5.2 liters with flat-plane crankshaft instead of the traditional crossplane, with a naturally aspirated induction. The Shelby GT500 version is another variant of the Coyote, code-named the Predator, this time keeping the cross-plane crankshaft and adding a supercharger. Both versions (GT350 and GT500) are the two most powerful engines of this iteration and the only ones to incorporate forged aluminum pistons. export-spec models are available in EcoBoost, GT and Bullitt specifications, in slightly different engine tunes. Per Ford's UK claims, combined fuel consumption of the Fastback (manual transmission) under the Euro 6 (WLTP) emissions standard are for EcoBoost and for GT and Bullitt. {  - ! Model !! Year !!

Nevertheless, a limited number of such manual transmission models, particularly on the GT, may be offered towards the end of the year. ==BodyBodywork=== This generation of Mustang has been influenced on the front end by Ford’s Evos concept which was featured in the Frankfurt auto show in 2011. The rear famous “vertical bar” style taillight will continue, however will be lit by LED, and will illuminate sequentially when being used for turn signals.

This gives more room in the back of the vehicle for rear passengers. “The changeable ambient lighting continues, but it will spread beyond the dials, cup holders, and speakers to other points within the cabin, something also found in European luxury cars like the new S-class.” A metal tag on the dashboard bears the Ford Mustang \\"Running Horse\\" insignia. ===Technology=== Standard features for all 2015+ Ford Mustangs include: proximity key entry with door-mounted touch sensors and keyless entry, push-button start system, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, color LCD display, the Ford SYNC System with Bluetooth hands-free phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming, USB/iPod and 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jacks, a cluster- mounted central color LCD driver's information display screen, electronic traction control system (ETCS), electronic stability control system (ESCS), antilock braking system (ABS), front and side-mounted SRS airbags, automatic 9-1-1 call for airbag deployment, and a rear backup camera system.

The Convertible remains the same. The 2015 Ford Mustang is offered in several models: * The base V6 model offers standard features such as the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine from the previous-generation Mustang, cloth front bucket seats, an AM/FM radio with six speakers, Ford SYNC, USB, iPod, and auxiliary input jacks, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, keyless access with push- button start and either a six-speed manual transmission or automatic transmission. The model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles. * The sporty EcoBoost model offers the same features as the V6 model, but replaces the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine with a new 2.3 L Turbocharged I4 engine and adds power front driver's and passenger's seats. This model is only available in Fastback style. * The midrange EcoBoost Premium model adds to the EcoBoost model leather seating surfaces, MyFord Touch with Ford SYNC, and HD Radio, the SHAKER Premium Sound System, and more. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles. * The performance-oriented GT model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. This model is only available in Fastback style. * The top-of-the-line GT Premium model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. It also adds nineteen-inch alloy wheels. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles. The old Shelby GT500 models are discontinued for 2015, along with the 5.8 L V8 supercharged engine. They have since been supplanted by the GT350/350R models featuring the new 5.2 L flat plane crank V8. Export-spec variants currently consist of only the EcoBoost and GT grades, with the UK and Australia receiving both the Fastback and Convertible styles and various parts of Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) receiving the Fastback only (as of June 2016). Meanwhile, Performance Packages are standard on all Asia-bound EcoBoost and GT trims. Markets like India receive only the GT trim (mated to the automatic transmission). An EcoBoost Performance Package was added for the 2020 model year, which raised the output of the turbocharged I4 engine to , using the engine from the Focus RS, and upgraded various parts. A handling package was also available, which added active dampers (MagneRide) and wider tires. ==ModelsShelby GT350 (2015–2020)=== Front view Rear view For 2015, the GT350 debuted featuring a 5.2 L Flat Plane Crank V8 engine with and of torque. The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the Camaro Z28, Porsche GT3, and BMW M4. Notable features are track- focused chassis tuning, significant aero-dynamic changes to include lowering the hood around the engine, 2-piece, cross-drilled brake rotors paired with Brembo calipers, MagneRide damping option, lightweight Tremec TR-3160 six speed manual transmission, Recaro seats, and various lightweight components (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymer radiator support that directs cooling channels for various components).

Together with his long-time collaborator Leonard R Stephens, he established that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the main substrate of receptor-controlled Type 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), thus identifying PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as the key output signal produced by this enzyme.P.T.

The design work was completed in 1974 and the first example flown in 1977, with the plans as supplemental drawings to the Aircamper plans. The resulting aircraft features a biplane layout, two separate tandem open cockpits with individual windshields, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from a combination of wood and welded steel tubing, all covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its span wing has four ailerons and has a combined wing area of . The lower wing is removable, allowing the aircraft to fly as an Aircamper parasol monoplane. The cabin width is . The acceptable power range is and the standard engine used is the Continental O-240 powerplant. The aircraft has a typical empty weight of and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of the payload for the pilot, passenger and baggage is . The designers estimated the construction time from the supplied plans as 1200 hours.

It was finished in 1946 and, as most of Ligeti's early compositions, has followed the musical style of Béla Bartók. == Composition == Ligeti wrote this composition when he was still a student in the Franz Liszt Academy, in November 1946. Due to its shortness, it has never received a formal premiere, but it was rather broadcast in the Hungarian Radio and was performed together with other vocal pieces. However, it has been published by both Editio Musica Budapest and Schott Music and has been recorded by some relevant choirs, such as the London Sinfonietta Voices. == Analysis == Magany takes approximately two and a half minutes to perform. It consists of only one movement, even though double bars and different tempos are used. The text, as many of Ligeti's early vocal compositions, is extracted from a work by Hungarian poet Sándor Weöres, but has also been officially translated into English by Desmond Clayton. This was also the first time Ligeti took a text from Weöres. This three-part composition is scored for mixed choir, which should consist of sopranos, altos and baritones. The score is marked Molto moderato, poco rubato at the beginning, and starts with a gloomy tune, which is followed by a joyful and fast second segment, which is marked Più mosso, non rubato and Subito: ancora più mosso, con slancio later on. The final segment, marked Subito: Quasi Tempo I comes back to the general mood of the first segment.

He later undergoes further magical training under the tutelage of a wicked sorceress who seeks to tempt him away from Mystra's path. ==ReceptionReferences== Category:1998 American novels Category:1998 fantasy novels Category:Forgotten Realms novels Category:Novels by Ed Greenwood ","title":"The Temptation of Elminster"},{"id":"42048978","text":"Pachydota peruviana is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The battle causes Elminster to fall into the Underdark as a cloud of ashes, and he inhabits the body of a fallen drow to carry out Mystra's orders. Manshoon plans to conquer Cormyr and become its emperor. ==Reception== Dan Ruffalo of \\"The Ranting Dragon\\" commented that Elminster Enraged was \\"a great book, despite the fact that the rage made little more than a brief cameo. Elminster is an excellent character, and Greenwood writes him very well and very consistently (a feat, considering he first appeared in print twenty-five years ago). As a story, it was quite enjoyable. It is a little tough, as somebody who spent so much time in the main chronology of the Forgotten Realms, to keep track of everything happening now nearly 100 years later in Realms time, but it was worth it.\\" Another reviewer commented: \\"The ending is great fun, it bumped this from 4 to 5 stars. Elminster gets well.. enraged. Its a lot of fun, stick with the jumps, and you'll come to a conclusion that had me smiling as a reader, as a fan of Ed's, and definitely as a fan of the Realms\\". James Marchese of \\"The Voice\\" called the book \\"a complete disappointment\\", stating that \\"it hurts me to say that there isn't really much I can complement this book on. The only thing that really pleased me about it was the transformation that Elminster went through in the book. He turns from a happy-go-lucky mage to a spiteful old sorcerer. However, like everything else in the book it meant nothing because at the end of the book he goes back to being his normal self like nothing even happened to him.\\" ==References== Category:2012 American novels Category:2012 fantasy novels Category:Forgotten Realms novels Category:Novels by Ed Greenwood ","title":"Elminster Enraged"},{"id":"42048980","text":"Pachydota punctata is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The face value of the coins totaled $27,980, but was assessed to be worth $10 million. In total, the hoard contains $27,460 in twenty-dollar coins, $500 in ten-dollar coins, and $20 in five-dollar coins, all dating from 1847 to 1894. The collection is the largest known discovery of buried gold coins that has ever been recovered in the US. == Discovery and excavation == The Saddle Ridge Hoard was discovered in February 2013 on private property located in California Gold Country. Due to privacy concerns, the exact location of the discovery has not been disclosed, other than to confirm that the land is located in a hillside area of Gold Country, near the site of the Gold Rush of 1849. , the couple who discovered the hoard have chosen to remain anonymous. Known only as John and Mary, the couple have lived on the rural property for several years and have no idea who buried the coins. They wish to keep their identity, location, and ownership history of their home private, in order to keep treasure seekers from trespassing on their property in an effort to find more gold. The owners of the property discovered the trove while they were walking their dog on their property. Although they had reportedly hiked the trail numerous times previously, it was not until they spotted a rust- covered metal can poking out of the ground that they chose to explore further. Rusted can of gold coins as found at discovery site in February 2013 Before finding the trove, the couple had noticed some unique features of the area. They recalled seeing an old empty can hanging from an old tree. The can had evidently been there so long that the tree had literally grown around it. At the time, the couple surmised that the hanging can had possibly been used to hold flowers and mark a grave. They also noticed an oddly shaped rock on the nearby hill, which they nicknamed \\"Saddle Ridge\\". After they found the gold, they realized that the geographical features and the hanging can were probably markers to the site, placed by the original owners. The center of the treasure trove was located ten steps between the jagged rock and the direction of the North Star. After Mary noticed the can, John bent down to pick it up, but found that it was stuck in the dirt. He began to use a piece of wood to pry it from the ground. It was so heavy that they believed that the can likely held lead paint. On their walk back to their house, struggling to carry the weight of the find, the lid of the can cracked open, revealing the edge of a single gold coin. They returned to the site with some hand tools to see if they could find anything else. They found another can about a foot away from where the first can was discovered. Although it was partially decomposed due to rust, it held several more coins. They continued to return to the site to look for more coins, primarily digging in the ground and eventually using a metal detector. Their work eventually resulted in the discovery of eight cans filled with 1,427 coins. After their discovery, the couple protected their find by hiding it in an old ice chest, then burying it under a pile of wood and concealing the location. After some initial research, they contacted the numismatics firm of Kagin's in Tiburon, California, which is representing the owners. == Authentication and valuation == 1886-S $10 PCGS slab Numismatist David J. McCarthy of the California firm Kagin's completed the initial evaluation of the coins and assessed the significance of the find. Prior to the discovery of the hoard, the largest buried collection of gold found in the US was uncovered by city workers in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1985. The Jackson hoard had a face value of $4,500 and sold for about $1 million (not adjusted for inflation).Winter, Douglas (2006). Gold Coins of the New Orleans Mint: 1839-1909, Zyrus Press, page 163. The face value of the Saddle Ridge treasure is $27,980. The discovery raises interesting questions about its finders' tax liability, due to the Treasury Department regulation which states that “Treasure trove, to the extent of its value in United States currency, constitutes gross income for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.”https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.61-14; see Marc Morris, Christine Cheng, D. Larry Crumbley, The Saddle Ridge Gold Coin Discovery: How the IRS Should Tax U.S. Currency Under the Treasure Trove Regulation, 17 Hous. Bus. & Tax L.J. 120 (2017). Following the initial assessment, McCarthy and Kagin's were contracted to conserve the material. Kagin's then contacted the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) of Irvine, California for an independent authentication. PCGS reported that many of the coins were recovered in uncirculated, mint condition. It further stated that some of the pieces are so rare that they could be worth about $1 million each. The coin grading and certification revealed that over a dozen of the coins are either the finest known or tied for the finest known specimens in the PCGS Population Report. The collection includes: * 1866-S $20 Double Eagle/no motto valued at around $1 million * 1866-S $20 Double Eagle/with motto PCGS MS62+ (finest known) * 1877-S $20 Double Eagle PCGS MS65 (tied finest known) * 1888-S $20 Double Eagle (four) PCGS MS64 (tied for finest known) * 1889-S $20 Double Eagle (two) graded PCGS MS65 (tied for finest known) * 1894-S $20 Double Eagle PCGS MS65 (tied for finest known) == Disposition == According to Donald Kagin, Kagin's has an exclusive arrangement with Amazon.com to sell the coins through their collectibles store. This arrangement is the first major sale of coins made through Amazon. John and Mary have also chosen to use the funds to cover their personal debt and donate to several local charities. They have additionally chosen to retain some of the coins for family heirlooms and keepsakes. == Origination theories == Following the initial discovery of the coins, there was widespread speculation that the hoard represented the discovery of the 1901 theft of $30,000 from the San Francisco Mint by employee Walter Dimmick. The published news item was discovered in the Haithi Trust Digital Library and was provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who doubles as a historian and collector of rare coins. Jack Trout (Historian) https://blog.sfgate.com/stienstra/2014/03/03/sf-heist-in-1900-may- explain-buried-gold-treasure/ https://abcnews.go.com/US/10m-calif-gold-coin- hoard-found-yard-stolen/story?id=22764360 Kagin's and the U.S. Mint ruled out this theory, stating that the Saddle Ridge Hoard is unlikely to be part of the mint heist, due to the diversity in the face value and condition of the coins. On March 4, 2014, The U.S. Mint stated that \\"[they] do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility\\", and \\"[they've] done quite a bit of research, and we've got a crack team of lawyers, and trust me, if this was U.S. government property we'd be going after it.\\" Other disregarded theories contend that the hoard is a hidden stash of gold buried by Jesse James, or loot taken by Black Bart, who was known for robbing stagecoaches. A theory has also been advanced that the hoard was part of a treasure supposedly hidden by the Knights of the Golden Circle, to be used to fund a second Civil War. The predominant theory attributes the cache to an unknown individual who chose to bury the coins rather than trust the banks to protect his wealth. While the couple who found the coins have remained anonymous and the location of the find is undisclosed, several individuals have attempted to claim the gold coins or a share of the profits, asserting that the money belonged to one of their relatives or associates. == References  External links == * Category:Numismatics Category:Treasure troves of the United States Category:Historical currencies of the United States Category:Metal detecting finds in United States Category:California Gold Rush ","title":"Saddle Ridge Hoard"},{"id":"42049020","text":"Murry Lewis Salby is an American atmospheric scientist who focused on upper atmospheric wave propagation for most of his early career, and who more recently argued against aspects of the scientific consensus that human activity contributes to climate change. He has written two textbooks, Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics (1996),Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics.(Book Review), SciTech Book News, v.20, 1996 Nov, p.20 (). and Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate (2011). The latter textbook, building on his first book, offers an overview of the processes controlling the atmosphere of Earth, weather, energetics, and climate physics.Book review: Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate, 2nd edn., by M.L. Salby Scope: textbook. Level: undergraduate, Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate, 2nd edn., by M.L. Salby From the mid 1980s, Salby conducted research at the University of Colorado Boulder. In 2005, the National Science Foundation opened an investigation into Salby's federal funding arrangements and found that he had displayed \\"a pattern of deception [and] a lack of integrity\\" in his handling of federal grant money. He resigned at Colorado in 2008 and became professor of climate risk at Macquarie University in Macquarie Park, New South Wales. In 2013 the university dismissed him on grounds of refusal to teach and misuse of university resources. ==Education and career== Salby received his bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering in 1973 and his PhD in environmental dynamics in 1978 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Salby focused on upper atmospheric wave propagation for most of his early career. He began as an assistant professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1984. Salby then became an associate professor in 1985 and full professor in 1991, gaining tenure in 1997.Salby v. University of Colorado ==Academic research== Salby was the first to document the influence of meteorological variability on long-term stratospheric ozone changes. This role of natural variability on stratospheric ozone depletion has inspired related studies and large research projectshttp://fmiarc.fmi.fi/candidoz/ and has been recognised in several WMO Ozone Depletion Assessments.http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/ozone/2010/chapters/chapter2.pdf ==University of Colorado and National Science Foundation controversy== In 1994 Salby set up a non-profit company to receive federal award funds from the National Science Foundation and other agencies for research in parallel with his research work at the University of Colorado, and in 2003 he formed another company as a subcontractor to receive charges for his efforts. Following allegations of an overlap between funding applications, the National Science Foundation began an investigation in March 2005. It advised the University of Colorado, which sought information from Salby but he did not cooperate with this investigation. In October 2006 the university produced its investigation memo, and suspended Salby's privilege of submitting proposals from the university as well as restricting his access to university research facilities. In 2007, Salby was on sabbatical in Australia. Before the university made its final adjudication, Salby resigned from his faculty position. The National Science Foundation investigation report issued on 20 February 2009 found that Salby had overcharged his grants and violated financial conflict of interest policies, displaying \\"a pattern of deception, a lack of integrity, and a persistent and intentional disregard of NSF and University rules and policies\\" and a \\"consistent willingness to violate rules and regulations, whether federal or local, for his personal benefit.\\" It debarred Salby from receiving federal assistance and benefits until 13 August 2012. ==Macquarie University controversy and court case== After leaving Colorado, Salby joined the faculty of Macquarie University in Australia, where he was appointed Professor of Climate Risk in 2008. In May 2011, Salby's research showing that ozone levels over Antarctica had begun to recover since the Montreal Protocol banned the use of ozone-depleting substances, was published in Geophysical Research Letters. Macquarie terminated Salby's employment in 2013 after an extended period during which he repeatedly refused to fulfil his teaching responsibilities, and ultimately failed to turn up to take a scheduled class. Salby also ignored written instructions, made an unauthorised trip to Europe, and inappropriately used university resources including a corporate credit card. When this was discovered, the university cancelled his return ticket from Paris. Macquarie University stated that the dismissal was due to Salby's misconduct, and not \\"in any way related to his views on climate science\\". In Salby v Macquarie University Justice Rolf Driver of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia ruled that Salby had failed to establish any of the elements of his case against Macquarie University regarding the termination of his employment and dismissed the case.. Salby published a counterstatement.https://mlsxmq.wixsite.com/salby- macquarie/page-1f ==Bibliography== * Stratospheric Constituent Response to Vertically Propagating Equatorial Waves, Defense Technical Information Center, 1988. * Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics, Academic Press, 23 May 1996. * Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate, Cambridge University Press, 16 January 2012. ==References== Category:American atmospheric scientists Category:American climatologists Category:Ozone depletion Category:Australian textbook writers Category:Macquarie University faculty Category:Georgia Tech alumni Category:Australian people of American descent Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Murry Salby"},{"id":"42049030","text":"Padenia acutifascia is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

It is long and flows through Limestone Township in Montour County and Turbot Township and Milton in Northumberland County. The watershed has an area of . Slightly under of sediment flow through the stream annually. The stream's watershed is in the ridge and valley physiographic province. The watershed of Limestone Run is mostly agricultural. However, other land uses in the stream's watershed include forests, developed land, wetlands, and coal mines. Several mills in Milton and Turbot Township historically drew their power from Limestone Run. The Pennsylvania Canal and Limestone Run Aqueduct also crossed the stream in Milton. Major floods of the stream include one in August 1817 and one in June 1972. The stream's watershed is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. ==Course== Limestone Run looking upstream in Montour County Limestone Run begins at the Seven Springs Farm in Limestone Township, Montour County. It flows southwest for a few miles, passing the community of Limestoneville and flowing under Pennsylvania Route 254. At this point, the stream turns west, paralleling Limestone Ridge. It exits Limestone Township and enters the southern part of Turbot Township, Northumberland County. The stream continues west, parting from Limestone Ridge and crossing under Interstate 80 and then Pennsylvania Route 147 before entering the borough of Milton. It reaches its confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River on the other side of Milton, near Milton State Park. Limestone Run joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. ===Tributaries=== Limestone Run has no named tributaries. However, it has a number of unnamed tributaries. Nine of these enter the stream from the left and two of them enter it from the right. ==Hydrology and climate== Limestone Run is designated as an impaired waterbody by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The cause of the impairment is siltation and the source is agriculture. No part of Limestone Run or its tributaries attains stream standards set by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The annual load of sediment in Limestone Run is . Of this per year comes from croplands and per year comes from stream banks. Another per year comes from transitional land, comes from land used for hay or pastures, comes from low- intensity development, and comes from forests. An annual sediment load of comes from high intensity development, comes from coal mines, and no sediment is contributed by wetlands. The average annual rainfall in the Limestone Run watershed between 2005 and 2013 was . The average annual runoff in this time period was . ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Limestone Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The elevation in the Limestone Run watershed ranges from under above sea level to more than above sea level. The source is approximately higher than the mouth, making the stream move relatively slowly. The entire watershed is in the ridge and valley geographic region. The rocks in the watershed are 60% carbonate rocks and 40% shale. Limestone Run's floodplain in Milton is located between Race Street and Center Street. This area is mostly uninhabited due to flooding concerns. The historian J.J. John wrote that Limestone Run was \\"a stream of relatively greater geographical importance than its volume would indicate\\". ==Watershed== Ducks on Limestone Run The watershed of Limestone Run has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Milton. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Washingtonville. The village of California is located near the headwaters of the stream. Pennsylvania Route 254 is also in the stream's vicinity. A total of 72.7 percent of the watershed of Limestone Run is agricultural land, 13.4 percent is forest, 11.8 percent is low- intensity development, and 1.5 percent is high-intensity development. Additionally, 0.4 percent of the watershed consists of wetlands and 0.2 percent consists of coal mines. There are of streams in the watershed. In addition to croplands and pastures, feedlots, barnyards, and area of manure stacking line the banks of Limestone Run in some areas. ==History== The remains of the Pennsylvania Canal and Limestone Run Aqueduct on Limestone Run Limestone Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179364. Marcus Huling was one of the first people to settle in what is now Milton, building a house there in 1772. He also established a tavern on Limestone Run. In 1774, a person living in Buffalo Township, Union County purchased several hundred acres along the stream. In 1791, Andrew Straub built a mill on Limestone Run. It was the first manufacturing industry in Milton. It was destroyed in 1815 to make way for the Baker's Grist Mill. The Baker's Grist Mill was a gristmill on Limestone Run (and powered by the stream) at South Front Street in Milton. The latter mill was built in 1815 by George Eckert, Jr. It was destroyed when Limestone Run flooded on August 9, 1817, due to heavy rainfall at the stream's headwaters, an event known as the Great Limestone Run flood of 1817. The mill burned down on May 14, 1880 and ceased to be powered by Limestone Run upon being rebuilt. It fell into disuse in 1885 and was destroyed in 1892. A carding mill and sickle factory were built on the mouth of Limestone Run some time before 1817. This mill and factory was damaged in the 1817 flood of the stream. Additionally, Moses and Samuel Teas owned a distilling business on Limestone Run. A stone mill was built at the mouth of the stream some time before 1838. William Follmer also owned a mill in the southeastern part of Turbot Township. In the 1840s, there were several flour mills in Milton that were powered by the stream. Prior to the advent of railroads, the area along Limestone Run was mostly home to small industries. When Limestone Run flooded in 1817, at least one bridge was destroyed, in addition to the Baker's Grist Mill. After the flood, the Pennsylvania legislature contributed $5000 to the construction of a post bridge over the stream. In June 1972, the stream flooded due to Hurricane Agnes, partially contributing to a significant alteration of the appearance of Milton. The Pennsylvania Canal and Limestone Run Aqueduct, which is on Limestone Run in Milton, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1978. ==Biology== The drainage basin of Limestone Run is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. There is little or no riparian buffering along Limestone Run. The Montour County Conservation District has had plans to remedy the lack of riparian buffering with the Jeremy Erb project. A proposed greenway known as the Limestone Run Greenway was mentioned in the Northumberland County Greenways Open Space Plan. It would consist entirely of of conservation land along the stream. ==See also== *Buffalo Creek (West Branch Susquehanna River), next tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River going downriver *Muddy Run (West Branch Susquehanna River), next tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River going upriver *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Rivers of Montour County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Limestone Run (Montour and Northumberland Counties, Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"42049049","text":"Padenia duplicana is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

The squadron was established on 16 November 1970 at NAS Los Alamitos, California, and moved on 6 January 1971 to NAS Point Mugu. It was disestablished on 4 March 2006, after 35 years of service. Elements of the squadron made 22 major overseas deployments. ==Operational history== P-3C c.1995 *16 Nov 1970: VP-65 was established at NAS Los Alamitos, California, as a result of a major reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve that took place in 1970. The 12 Reserve squadrons formed were structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. The reorganization concept was known as 12/2/1. There were 12 VP squadrons under two commands, Commander Fleet Air Reserve Wings Atlantic and Commander Fleet Air Reserve Wings Pacific, under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve. VP-65 was formed from the personnel and assets of seven smaller units already in existence at NAS Los Alamitos: VP-65L1-L3, VP-22L7, VP-19L4, VP-6L5, and VP-40L6. It came under the operational and administrative control of Fleet Air Reserve Wing, Pacific. The squadron’s first assigned aircraft was the SP-2H Neptune. *18–30 May 1971: VP-65 participated in Operation Condeca Aguila II with Guatemala to evaluate the joint forces’ ability to detect, identify and thwart seaborne aggressor efforts. *1–13 June 1972: VP-65 and VP-67 participated in exercises Halcon Vista VII and Condeca Aguila III with the Nicaraguan military forces. *21 Jul–5 Aug 1973: VP-65 deployed to NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, for mining and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises. *October 1974: The squadron’s last SP-2H was officially transferred to the National Naval Aviation Museum at Pensacola, Florida. *January 1975: VP-65 received its first P-3A Orion. *August 1975: VP-65 deployed a detachment to NAS Agana, Guam, while operational training in the P-3 airframe continued for the remaining aircrews at NAS Point Mugu. *June 1978: VP-65 deployed to NAS Agana, Guam, with detachments conducting maritime air patrol flights from NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, and Kadena AFB, Okinawa. One of the Cubi detachment aircraft, flown by PPC Lieutenant Commander F. Kluessendorf, experienced an engine failure during the takeoff roll on rotation. The propeller autofeather feature of the Orion aircraft prevented any instability during the takeoff, allowing the crew to safely return to Cubi for an uneventful landing. *1980: VP-65 deployed for its active duty training to NAS Agana, Guam and the Philippines, with detachments at Okinawa and Singapore searching for Vietnamese boat people. *25 June–29 July 1982: VP-65 deployed to NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, with operations conducted from Singapore, Okinawa, Guam and Thailand. *14 May–Jun 1984: VP-65 deployed to NAF Misawa, Japan. The squadron aircrews received real-world training flying missions covering Soviet Bloc submarines transiting the WestPac theater of operations. *31 May–30 June 1985: VP-65 deployed to NAF Misawa, Japan. Upon return from deployment the squadron began the ground training necessary for the transition from the P-3A to the P-3B TAC/NAV/MOD airframe. The IRDS/HACLS modifications added infrared detection and Harpoon launch capability to the aircraft. *November 1986: VP-65 received a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for the squadron’s role in Operation Close, a coordinated operation with the U. S. Coast Guard in support of their drug interdiction efforts. *July–August 1989: VP-65 conducted active duty training at NAF Misawa, Japan. The squadron participated with fleet squadrons VPs 19 and 46 in support of TF 72. Out of 1,015 hours flown during the deployment, over 52 hours were flown while in direct contact with Soviet Bloc submarines. *June 1991: VP-65 deployed to NAF Kadena, Okinawa. Upon return from deployment the squadron began the transition from the P-3B MOD airframe to the P-3C Orion. The baseline P-3C incorporated the AN/ASQ-114 computer system for navigation and sensor functions, the first of its kind in a maritime patrol aircraft. It had an AN/AQA-7 Jezebel acoustic processing system with DIFAR and quadruple the number of directional sonobuoys, with a high capacity computer and related displays. Completion of transition training was accomplished by June 1993. *13–27 August 1993: Two VP-65 aircrews deployed to Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska, the last operational detachment to fly from the air station before it went into caretaker status. *January 1994: VP-65 began transition to the P-3C UII.5 Orion airframe. Update II.5 had improved electronics systems, new Integrated Acoustic Communication System (IACS), improved MAD, standardized wing pylons and improved wing fuel tank venting. Throughout the remainder of the year, detachments from VP-65 deployed to NAF Kadena, Japan; NAS North Island, California; and NAS Barbers Point, as part of the increased integration of reserves into active duty Navy operations and exercises under CTF-72. *1995: VP-65 detachments deployed at various times throughout the year to NAS North Island, Calif.; NAF Misawa, Japan; Biggs Army Airfield, El Paso, Texas; NAF Kadena, Okinawa; U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand; and Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * SP-2H Neptune – November 1970 * P-3A Orion – January 1975 * P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Orion – December 1985 * P-3C Orion – May 1991 * P-3C UII.5 Orion – January 1994 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-65"},{"id":"42049222","text":"Paidia elegantia is a moth of the family Erebidae.

Building on the popularity of street art as a form of political expression during the January 25 revolution, the aim of this project is to increase awareness of women's issues by introducing women into public space. This project was co-founded by Mia Gröndahl, a Swedish street art documentarian, and Angie Balata, an Egyptian artist, in December 2012 with funding from the Danish Center for Culture and Development, and was launched with a month-long event in the Spring of 2013 in Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, and Mansoura that included painting sessions, workshops, and lectures on topics ranging from art to women's issues more generally. The project held its second campaign in February 2014. == Historical background  Political graffiti and the Arab Spring === Down With The Military Rule(Graffiti) During the Arab Spring revolutions, and in the years leading up to them, graffiti was commonly used as a form of popular protest. Street art was an effective way to spread the message of political rebellion, since it is in public view. Furthermore, since authoritarian Arab leaders had poured significant resources into public beautification projects in order to demonstrate their absolute ownership of the public space, street art was a way for the people to reclaim that public space. During the Arab Spring, street art became a prominent form of protest in many Arab countries, including Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Syria. An earlier example of this reclamation of public space is graffiti painted during the Palestinian intifada during the late 1980s. While Israeli state censorship prevented the production of a lot of Palestinian protest art, Palestinians were able to paint graffiti in order to spread their message without being stopped by the state. Also, the anonymity of the art form made it a stand-in for the collective spirit of Palestinians. In Egypt, street art was not a widespread phenomenon before the January 25, 2011, but it quickly became one of the most powerful tools of the revolution. In the first days of the revolution, street art was largely used to mock then-president Hosni Mubarak. However, Egyptian graffiti quickly expanded into a number of spaces, mediums, and genres. Popular types of revolutionary graffiti include political satire, mocking political and military leaders, murals depicting pharonic and biblical themes, tags for social and political movements such as the April 6 Youth Movement and the Ultras, and martyr paintings. These various types of images are meant to critique the political order, incite anger, connect Egyptians with the past, and inspire solidarity for the revolutionary movement. === Female graffiti === In spite of the great proliferation of protest graffiti during the January 25 revolution, it remained a largely male space, with men dominating the street artist community and very few pieces depicting women. To counter this, movements such as the Graffiti Harimi project (the predecessor of Women on Walls) sought to increase the visibility of women in the public space by increasing the number of female figures in graffiti, with the intention of proving that women are worthy partners in the revolution. Female street art also serves the purpose of spreading political statements against the abuse of women. One recent denizen of the female graffiti scene supported by Women on Walls is Laila Ajjawi, who has garnered international press for her activities in the UNRWA-run Palestinian refugee camp outside of Irbid, Jordan. == The project == Anti-Sexual Harassment Graffiti in middle east === Mission === Despite the fact that women were early leaders in the January 25 Revolution, within months of the initial revolution women began to be excluded from protest spaces and political processes, and violence against women proliferated in revolutionary spaces such as Tahrir Square. This development, coupled with the already high rate of sexual assault in Egypt and prevailing stereotype that women were not as capable as men, inspired the Women on Walls project. The project seeks to educate the public on the status of women and promote women's rights through the medium of street art. From the project's Facebook page: \\"We are using art to discuss one of the most important topics in Egypt, women’s empowerment, and which involves many different issues, including the political, the social, the economic and the cultural.\\" === Directors ===  Mia Gröndahl  Mia Gröndahl is a Swedish journalist and street art documentarian who has lived in Egypt since 1996. She first became interested in graffiti when she lived in Gaza prior to moving to Egypt. After the advent of the January 25 Revolution, she spent over a year and a half documenting revolutionary street art in Egyptian cities for her book Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the New Egypt. It was through her research for this book that she was inspired to promote female graffiti; of the 17,000 pieces of street art she documented, only 253 of them included images of women. Of her motivation to start the project, she stated, ‘’I felt there’s was a need to support female artists, and there’s a very strong need to address women’s issues. Egypt is one of the worst countries when it comes to women’s rights.’’ Her published works include Revolution Graffiti, In Hope and Despair: Life in the Palestinian Refugee Camps (2003), Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics (2009), and Tahrir Square: The Heart of the Egyptian Revolution (2011).  Angie Balata  Angie Balata is the local cultural manager for the Women on Walls Project. She worked with Gröndahl on Revolution Graffiti, documenting pieces, networking with street artists, and providing translations. Upon completing the book, the two women collaborated to expand the book launch into a larger exhibition, which became WOW. === First Edition === The first Women on Walls campaign was launched in April 2013, with nearly 40 artists participating, in the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and Mansoura. Each city had a separate campaign led by well-known local graffiti artists: Mira Shahadeh and Zeft led the Cairo campaign, Ammar Abo Bakr led the Luxor campaign, Mohamed Khaled and Ghadir Wagdy led the Mansoura campaign, and Aya Tarek, Yazaan El Zo’bi, and Mohaned Nor led the Alexandria campaign. The campaigns were divided into two parts. The first part brought street artists to the town of Anafora for gender-related workshops, to learn about gender sensitive issues and work on how to discuss these issues in the street. In the second part, the artists returned to their respective cities to design pieces reflecting what they learned in the workshops. At the end, the project held a closing ceremony for final remarks and analysis of the finished work. Notable participants included: * Abo Bakr * Hanaa El Degham * Ahmed Abdallah * Ahmed Tony * Sad Panda * Mohamed El Moushir * the Mona Lisa Brigades === Second edition === The second campaign ran from February 8 to February 15, 2014, with 15 participating artists. Due to limited funds, the 2014 campaign only ran in Cairo. As with the first campaign, participants attended seminars and workshops with artists and feminist activists, including Cecilia Uddén, Carolina Falkholt, Radwa Fouda, Lamis Soleiman and Ismail Shawky, and then collaborated upon painting women into the public space. In addition, the second campaign partnered with organizations such as Egyptian feminist organization Nazra, and anti-harassment organization HarassMap in order to further educate participants on women's rights issues specific to Egypt. == References == Category:Egyptian art Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage Category:Women in Egypt ","title":"Women on Walls"},{"id":"42049418","text":"AnomalyMeow Mix 3000 is a 2013 dystopian science-fiction Christian trilogy by Krista McGee, published through Thomas Nelson. The first book in the series, Anomaly, was published on July 9, 2013. The series's second entry, Luminary, was published on January 7, 2014. A third entry, Revolution was published in July 2014. The series follows a seventeen-year-old girl living in a post- apocalyptic society that punishes the expression of emotion. While writing the series McGee was inspired by the books Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty- Four, as she wondered what the books would be like if they were written from the Christian worldview perspective. ==SummaryAnomaly=== Thalli is a young girl living in a world that was almost completely destroyed by nuclear war, forcing the survivors underground. The survivors' leaders, a group of scientists called \\"The Ten\\", decided that it would be best for human survival if future children were genetically engineered to be without emotions, as emotions were what led to the war. Thalli was born with emotions, a secret unknown to The Ten until she accidentally reveals them while listening to a piece of music. She's spared from death by scientist and childhood friend Berk, who attempts to save her by proposing that the scientists study her instead of killing her. Thalli and Berk bond even closer while she's in captivity, prompting more emotions that would be condemned if The Ten were to learn about it. While she's imprisoned Thalli hears tales of the \\"Designer\\", a being more powerful than The Ten and the science they endorse; Thalli and her emotions might be part of the Designer's plan, which is far broader than anything The Ten could conceive. ===Luminary=== Luminary picks up after the events in Anomaly. Thalli, Berk, Rhen, and John, fleeing the scientists, have escaped to the surface. As they journey the group discovers various things that the underground world had assumed destroyed or ruined forever, such as animals, books, and nature itself. They also discover other survivors in a colony called New Hope. As she and the others try to adapt to their new surroundings, Thalli finds herself skeptical of her past and everything she'd previously believed to be true. She's unwilling to trust anything, including the steadily growing feelings that she has for Berk. This helps spur Thalli into volunteering to help serve on a peace mission to Athens, a nearby settlement reported to be violent and crafty. She's warned against trusting Athens' ruler, but Thalli becomes charmed by the ruler's son Alex and is soon infatuated with him. As things continue to progress behind the scenes, Thalli finds that war between the settlements might be inevitable, making her question her newfound faith in the Designer even as her friend John's faith is unwavering. ==Publications== #Anomaly (July 9, 2013) #Luminary (January 7, 2014) #Revolutionary (July 2014) ==Reception== The critical reception for the first book, Anomaly, was mostly positive, and praise typically centered upon how McGee wrote the characters. The School Library Journal and Publishers Weekly gave positive reviews but noted that the work had some issues. The reviewer for School Library Journal felt that the \\"dialogue's formal, clipped language can be off-putting\\". Publishers Weekly commented, \\"Though Thalli’s 'conversion' after learning of the Designer is underdeveloped, McGee successfully asks readers to consider both what it means to act (or not act) on human emotions and the role such emotions play in relationships with God.\\" Reviews for Luminary were more mixed. The School Library Journal wrote that they found the religious themes \\"tepid\\" and felt that there were \\"better- written alternatives\\" out there for people interested in Christian dystopian fiction. Kirkus Reviews was similarly critical and commented that \\"This simplistic dystopia delivers formulaic romance and a large dose of religious faith.\\" Publishers Weekly was more positive: \\"McGee blends the determination of faith, the malevolence of those who extol power over decency, and the assertion of individual integrity in a humane glimpse at youthful courage.\\" ==References * Category:American Christian novels Category:Young adult novel series Category:2013 science fiction novels Category:2013 American novels Category:Dystopian novels ","title":"Anomaly (series)"},{"id":"42049433","text":"Paidia minoica is a moth of the family Erebidae.

It generally involves anagrams or other wordplay treatments such as addition, subtraction, omission, or substitution of a letter, and is sometimes arranged in the form of a verse giving hints to the word. The term logogriph is also used for the puzzle type in which a pair of anagrams must be deduced from synonyms (e.g. YELLOW FISH would lead to the answer AMBER BREAM). The following example of a logogriph created by Lord Macauley refers to the word COD: :Cut off my head, how singular I act! :Cut off my tail, and plural I appear. :Cut off my head and tail--most curious fact, :Although my middle's left, there's nothing there! :What is my head cut off?--a sounding sea! :What is my tail cut off?--a flowing river! :Amid their mingling depths I fearless play :Parent of softest sounds, though mute for ever! In explanation, cut off COD’s head and it becomes OD (i.e. odd, or singular); cut off its tail, and it becomes CO (company, plurality); cut off both to leave O (nothing, emptiness); the head of the word is the letter C, which sounds like SEA; the tail is D, which sounds like the River Dee, and COD itself may play in the depths of both. Logogriphs were among the word puzzles popularised by The Masquerade, an English puzzle publication appearing over several volumes from 1797. Here a cryptic reference to the key word would be given, followed by clues to other words comprising some of its letters. For example, one logogriph appeared in The Masquerade on the word SPEAR, which includes the letters of APE, SPAR, REAP, ASP and so forth. Logogriphs were often rather long-winded, as clues had to be given to each of the component words. Orhan Pamuk’s The Black Book refers to the use of logogriphs as a means of evading press censorship. == References == Category:Puzzles ","title":"Logogriph"},{"id":"42049570","text":"\\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is the 3rd episode of the second season of The CW television series, The Vampire Diaries and the 25th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on September 23, 2010. The episode was written by Andrew Chambliss and directed by Patrick Norris. ==Plot== Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) try to find out why the Gilbert device affected the Lockwood family as well and they ask for Alaric's (Matt Davis) help since he might know something from Isobel's research. Alaric mentions that Isobel also studied the lycanthropes but Damon says that if werewolves existed he would have met them by now. To find out more about it, Alaric, Elena and Damon leave for Duke University where Isobel's research results are while Stefan stays behind to help Caroline (Candice Accola) adjust to her new life as a vampire. Meanwhile, Tyler (Michael Trevino) follows his uncle into the abandoned dungeon because he wants to know what he is hiding but he only finds scratches on the wall. Stefan meets Bonnie (Kat Graham) to ask for her help with Caroline. He asks her to make a ring for her so she can be able to walk in the sun but Bonnie does not seem willing to do it. Stefan convinces her to do it but Bonnie promises him that if Caroline hurts anyone she will reverse the spell. They go to Caroline's and Bonnie spells a ring for her so Caroline can walk free outside during the day. Damon tries to make Elena forgive him for trying to kill her brother by telling her that he had seen Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) wearing the ring and he knew that he would be fine, but Elena does not believe him. They arrive at Isobel's office where her assistant Vanessa (Courtney Ford) is waiting for them. She acts friendly when they come and tells them about Isobel's research but when she gets out of the room she returns with a crossbow and shoots Elena. Damon jumps in front of Elena just in time and the arrow hits him while Alaric disarms Vanessa. Elena helps Damon take out the arrow. He says that he will kill Vanessa for what she did but Elena forbids him to do it. In the meantime, in the next room Vanessa tells Alaric that Katherine and Damon are dead and they cannot be standing in front of her. Stefan tries to teach Caroline how to hunt animals to feed so she will not have to feed on people but all Caroline is thinking about is Matt (Zach Roerig) and that she wants to be with him at the swimming hole party that Tyler is throwing. Stefan agrees to let her go to the party and he goes with her. As soon as she gets there, she sees Amiee (Tiya Sircar), talking and flirting with Matt and she causes a scene. She compels Amiee to go and find a single man to flirt with. Matt does not like her being rude and he leaves her while Stefan points her out that Matt was right. Meanwhile, Mason (Taylor Kinney) is back at the dungeon and tries to chain himself up since it is full moon and he will be turned into a werewolf. While he is trying to do it, Tyler arrives with Aimee and Mason runs away to his car so the two kids will not see him. He gets to his car and tries to chain himself to a tree but he cannot. A little further, Caroline and Matt make up but when Matt hurts his finger and bleeds, Caroline loses control and attacks him. In the meantime, back at Duke, the three find out about the old Aztec legend \\"The curse of the sun and the moon\\" where an Aztec shaman cursed both vampires and werewolves to be slaves of the sun and servants of the moon respectively. They also find out that a werewolves' bite is fatal to vampires. Elena calls Stefan immediately to inform him about it so he knows to be careful around Mason and Tyler. Stefan realizes that Caroline is not at the party anymore and runs to find her. He gets to her and Matt just right in time to pull her away from Matt before she kills him. Stefan tells Caroline that they have to run because there is a werewolf in the woods. They drive the werewolf away from Matt but they run into Tyler who slows them down and gives Mason the opportunity to attack Caroline. Stefan pushes him away but it is Tyler's order that makes him go away. Tyler later finds Mason's car and Mason arrives naked. Tyler tells him that it was him who attacked Caroline and Mason confirms it. Elena asks Vanessa about her resemblance to Katherine and why she looks like her but Vanessa doesn't have much info to give her about that. On their way to the car to get back home, Damon gives Elena a book he found at Isobel's office with the title \\"Petrova\\", telling that it is Katherine's real name. Elena takes the book but she is still mad at Damon and at his question if he lost her friendship forever, Elena answers him that he did. Caroline and Stefan get back to Matt and Caroline compels him to forget what happened. Stefan tells her that he will make sure to give Matt vervain jewellery to protect him and also to drink so she will not be able to bite him again. The two of them have a conversation where Stefan tells her that leaving Elena would be the right thing to protect her but he cannot. Later, when Caroline sees Amiee flirting again with Matt, she causes a scene despite the fact that she promised Matt not to do it again, forcing him to break up with her since that is the only way she can protect him. The episode ends with Katherine appearing at Caroline's bedroom and telling her that the two of them are going to have so much fun together. ==Feature music== In \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" we can hear the songs: * \\"Under My Bed\\" by Meiko * \\"Changes\\" by Stars * \\"Ashes and Wine\\" by A Fine Frenzy * \\"In Your Skin\\" by Lifehouse * \\"Fantasy Friend Forever\\" by The Asteroid Galaxy Tour * \\"Send a Little Love Token\\" by The Duke Spirit * \\"Breath Again\\" by Sara Bareilles ==ReceptionRatings=== In its original American broadcast, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" was watched by 3.57 million; up by 0.52 from the previous episode. ===Reviews=== \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" received good reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.4/5. \\"Overall, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" was an action-packed episode that shed light on the Lockwoods and werewolves in general. I'd have been content with it even before Katherine showed up and told Caroline they were gonna have \\"so much fun together.\\"\\" The TV Chick gave the episode a B+ rate. \\"I liked it very much, but I wasn’t edge of my seat or anything. But, I’m glad we learned a little bit more about the werewolf lore as every writer has a different story for their supernatural beings. I’m also loving the development of Caroline’s character. She’s getting really awesome. I am most interested to see what the deal with the doppelganger situation is though. There are so many interesting places that they could take this storyline.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the episode was full of great scenes and great lines while Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated it with only 2/4 saying that the episode failed to deliver engrossing drama. \\"This episode is not horribly flawed. It’s just mediocre, and we’ve come to expect better than that from the series. The biggest problem with the episode is the large amount of exposition it must convey. Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 7.5/10 saying that the werewolves are finally here. \\"The \\"revelation\\" may not be surprising to the audience, but it's a relief that it is finally out there; hopefully this plotline will move forward a bit quicker now. The fact that werewolf bites are deadly to vampires adds some danger for our town vampires, turning the tables on them as they become the prey.\\" Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode stating: \\"All in all I think that this episode really showed us that The Vampire Diaries has hit its stride. Now it’s time for them to keep the flame alive, which they should be able to do, given that they have a talented cast, great writers and an interested audience. Not to mention the reappearance of Katherine, which I know has me begging next Thursday night to come a little bit faster!\\" ==References== Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"Bad Moon Rising (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42049586","text":"Loveday Carlyon is a Cornish nationalist politician.

In the first running of NASCAR's new-for-2014 knockout qualifying system, Brad Keselowski won the pole with a new track record time of 25.828 and a speed of . Keselowski was intrigued as to how the qualifying session looked to the general public, stating \\"I'm more curious the feedback we get from our fans\\" and that \\"at the end of the day it's not about whether I like it, it's about whether they liked it\\". Kevin Harvick, who missed out on the top 12 placings by 0.001 seconds in the first part of the session, complained about the cooling of the cars, defining it as \\"dumb\\", while also praising the qualifying concept as \\"really cool, but they need to let you cool the cars down. One of these times somebody is going to get clobbered in the back\\". NASCAR did not allow teams to use cool-down units and teams were forced to run cool down laps on the track while other drivers were making qualifying laps. Defending champion Jimmie Johnson opined that everyone understood \\"what NASCAR is trying to do, and I'm confident that if there is a problem they'll make some changes\\". NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated that the organization would \\"continue to talk to the drivers and teams and solicit feedback and how, if anything, we can improve\\". Justin Allgaier crashed his car during the opening session, switched to a backup car and started last as a result. ===Qualifying results=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! Pos ! ! Driver ! Team !

Logano led the race for the entire first stint, ahead of a competition caution on lap 36, due to overnight downpours. Keselowski won the race off pit road to assume the lead, for the restart on lap 41. Just as it was at the first start, Logano assumed the lead on the first lap following the restart, and he held the lead until Kevin Harvick moved ahead on lap 74. Harvick held the lead until a scheduled pit stop on lap 111; Keselowski reassumed the lead before a pit stop of his own on lap 113, and Harvick returned to the head of the race for the next stint. The second caution of the race flew on lap 162, caused by debris on the frontstretch. Brian Vickers' car cut down a right-front tire and hit the wall in turn 3 under that caution. ===Second half=== Halfway Kevin Harvick won the race. The race restarted on lap 170, but was almost immediately back under yellow flag conditions, after a multi-car incident which brought out the third caution. Danica Patrick made contact with Justin Allgaier going into turn 1 and both spun out. Travis Kvapil made contact with Patrick trying to avoid her. Allgaier and Patrick discussed the incident post-race, with Allgaier telling the media that Patrick \\"was just upset because she got involved in the crash that we had\\", and that \\"she's been through this and that she felt like I needed to settle down at that point\\". The race restarted on lap 176, with Harvick maintaining the lead. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 187 after Patrick went high into the groove in turn 1, cut the left-rear tire and spun through 180 degrees before coming to a stop. The race restarted on lap 192, with Harvick leading once again for the next stint, leading all the way to his next pit stop, with 76 laps to go and Carl Edwards assumed the lead position. Jeff Gordon and Ryan Newman also had stints at the head of the race, with Newman leading the race at the time of the fifth caution of the race, caused by debris on the backstretch, with 66 laps to go. Newman swapped positions with Clint Bowyer on pit road and the lead cycled back to Harvick, for the restart with 61 laps to go. The sixth caution of the race flew with 35 laps to go for debris in turn 1, with the restart coming with 30 laps to go. With 27 laps to go, David Gilliland's left-rear tire delaminated in turn 1, and in the circuit's dogleg, he over-corrected the car and spun around bringing out the seventh caution of the race. The race restarted with 21 laps to go, before the eighth caution of the race flew with 16 laps to go, after Kurt Busch's engine failed. Finish The race restarted with nine laps to go and Harvick held off Dale Earnhardt, Jr. to score the victory. Harvick praised his Stewart-Haas Racing team for the efforts in the early part of the season, since his move from Richard Childress Racing, stating \\"to add an extra team, bring in a bunch of new guys, new driver, Rodney Childers has just done a phenomenal job of putting this team together. These guys all want to win that is why they came here\\". He added that he was \\"really happy\\" with the engine that had been provided by Hendrick Motorsports. Earnhardt, Jr. was disappointed to miss out on the victory, stating that he \\"would have loved to have won the race, am a little disappointed to have come that close\\", but like Harvick, praised his team for their performances, adding that they have \\"a lot of great chemistry and good communication going back and forth. Everybody's confidence is very high. Everybody's mood and morale is really high\\". ===Race results=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Team ! Manufacturer ! !

The squadron was established on 1 November 1970 at NAS Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, where it was based for the rest of its life. It was disestablished on 31 March 2006, after 25 years of service. The squadron's nicknames were the Flying Sixes from 1971-1974, the Dicemen from 1975-1980, and the Liberty Bells from 1981 onward. Elements of the squadron made 19 major overseas deployments. ==Operational history== P-3B in 1990 VP-66 P-3C at RAF Fairford in July 2002 *1 November 1970: VP-66 was established at NAS Willow Grove, as a naval reserve patrol squadron flying the SP-2H Neptune. The squadron was formed from VP-62R1-R3, VP-18R4, VP-44R5 and VP-16R6 after the closure of the facility at NARTC New York, N.Y. The new squadron came under the operational and administrative control of Commander, Naval Air Reserve Forces, Atlantic and Commander, Fleet Air Reserve Wings, Atlantic. VP-66 was established as a result of a major reorganization of Naval Air Reserve that took place in 1970. Twelve reserve squadrons were formed and structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. The reorganization concept was known as 12/2/1. The 12 VP squadrons were under two commands, COMFAIRESWINGLANT and COMFAIRESWINGPAC, and they were under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve. *January 1971: VP-66 split into two sections, port and starboard, to facilitate crew training and aircraft maintenance with drills twice a month. *January–May 1978: A new facility, Hangar 175, was completed at NAS Willow Grove for VP-66. The squadron completed final movement into the new hangar with official acceptance ceremonies on 21 May 1978. *June 1980: VP-66 was called upon to provide support to the fleet during the Mariel Boatlift operations. Personnel deployed in the operation were given the Humanitarian Service Medal. *23 January–22 February 1982: VP-66 conducted its annual active duty training at NAS Bermuda. Upon return, the squadron began transition to the P-3A TAC/NAV MOD airframe. The TAC/NAV MOD version in 1975 replaced the ASN-42 inertial navigation system and tactical display systems with an LTN-72 inertial and Omega navigation system and digital computer. The IRDS/HACLS modifications added infrared detection and Harpoon launch capability to the aircraft. *May 1983: VP-66 received a Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation for its performance in tracking Soviet submarines during the 1982 active duty training at NAS Bermuda. *1–30 March 1984: VP-66 became the first reserve P-3A TAC/NAV MOD squadron to deploy in the Atlantic, operating from Lajes Field, Azores, with detachments at NAS Bermuda and NAS Keflavik, Iceland. *9–17 November 1985: A detachment from VP-66 participated in Operation Hat Trick II, operating out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. It was a coordinated operation with the U.S. Coast Guard in the war against illegal drug traffic, involving general area surveillance and location of suspect vessels. *February–March 1987: VP-66 deployed to Naval Station Rota, Spain, the first Reserve squadron to deploy to this site in over six years. Detachments were maintained during the active duty training at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, and NAF Lajes, Azores. *20 April 1990: VP-66 began transition from the P-3A TAC/NAV MOD airframe to the P-3B TAC/NAV MOD. The P-3B had more powerful engines and improved avionics. *20 February–6 April 1991: VP-66 deployed to NAS Bermuda, with remote site operations conducted at Goose Bay, Newfoundland, and Thule, Greenland, as part of Operation Icex-92. One highly unusual aspect of the deployment was the coordinated rescue effort of a French seaman by a VP-66 aircrew and the crew of a Commonwealth of Independent States Kilo-class submarine. The French sailboat Vibel had an injured crewman aboard. The VP-66 aircraft guided the former Soviet vessel to the French sailboat where medical treatment was given to the injured crewman. *1993: With the disestablishment of VAQ-33, VP-66 inherited two EP-3J aircraft, a formidable electronic warfare platform. The addition of these aircraft to the squadron resulted in a concomitant increase in manning levels to support the new mission being acquired. *1993: VP-66 deployed to NS Rota, with a detachment at NAF Sigonella. The Sigonella detachment was heavily involved in support of the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. *1994: VP-66 deployed to NS Roosevelt Roads, to provide support of UN forces during the embargo of Haiti. ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * SP-2H Neptune – November 1970 * P-3A Orion – March 1973 * P-3A TAC/NAV MOD Orion – March 1982 * P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Orion – April 1980 * EP-3J Orion – 1993 * P-3C Orion – 31 May 1994 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References Category:Attack squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-66"},{"id":"42049681","text":"Bin Furuya at a convention in 2018 , whose real name is Satoshi Furuya is a Japanese suit actor born best known for his uncredited portrayal of the title character in the 1966 series Ultraman.

She had a brief, unremarkable career while under contract to the Navy. She then carried troops for the unsuccessful second British invasion of the River Plate. Pretty Lass was sunk in 1807 at the River Plate. ==Career== Pretty Lass first appears in the Register of Shipping in 1804. (She does not appear in Lloyd's Register. The Register shows that she was built in France in 1796, and that she had received new sides of pine in 1802. Her master and owner is given as T. Lockyer.Register of Shipping (1804), Seq. №484. She is not described as a prize, and so was probably a vessel that Lockyer purchased during the Peace of Amiens. ===Letter of marque=== On 22 October 1803, T. Lockyer, Esq., announced he was the sole owner of two of the \\"most beautiful letters of marque that will sent from any port in the United Imperial Kingdoms of England and Ireland.\\" Both were coppered. One was Pretty Lass, under the command of Alexander Ferguson. The other was the Lady Charlotte. It was Lockyer's intent that the two would sail together.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.257. The extent of Pretty Lasss armament, the size of her crew, and the fact that she was to sail in company with Lady Charlotte are consistent with her being a privateer. On 22 December Lockyer stated that Pretty Lass was almost ready for sea. She was under the command of Alexander Ferguson. Ferguson received a letter of marque on 15 August 1803.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793–1815\\". — accessed 11 June 2011. ===Hired armed ship=== Pretty Lass was one of four vessels that Mr. T. Lockyer, of Plymouth, owned that the government hired at the same time. In reporting the transaction, the Naval Chronicle described Pretty Lass as a ship under the command of Captain Tippet.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 11, p.447. Tippet was Commander James Tippett. The Sporting Magazine reported on Tippett's appointment to command Pretty Lass, stating that \\"It is no wonder that a Pretty Lass should have a Tippet.\\"Sporting Magazine, Vol. 24, p.50. Tippett was still in command on 6 August when Pretty Lass sailed from Plymouth with dispatches for the fleet at Brest.'\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.354. He left Pretty Lass to take command of , and was lost when Hawk disappeared, presumed foundered, in December. Tippett's successor was Commander Thomas Smith (or Smyth). Under Smyth's command, Pretty Lass served on convoy duty in the Channel. The last mention in Lloyd's List of a Pretty Lass, armed ship, is that she returned to Plymouth from a cruise on 22 May.Lloyd's List,. ===Subsequent career=== The next mention in Lloyd's List of a Pretty Lass is that Pretty Lass, Cumming, master, sailed from Portsmouth on 4 October 1805 as part of a convoy for Gibraltar.Lloyd's List,. She returned from Gibraltar on 21 December.Lloyd's List,. ==Fate== On 29 August 1806 Pretty Lass sailed from Simon's Bay. She was one of several transports, under escort by , that were carrying troops for the British invasion of the River Plate.

As with most Florida counties, numbers are assigned in a statewide grid. Many roads are former state roads that have been truncated or eliminated. ==County Road 78== County Road 78 exists in two sections that were both formerly State Road 78.General Highway Map, Lee County, January 1976, reprinted January 1980 The western section runs along Pine Island Road from SR 78 / CR 765 / CR 884 in Cape Coral to CR 767 in Pine Island Center, and the eastern section runs along North River Road from SR 31 in North Fort Myers to the Hendry County line in Alva, continuing east as County Road 78. The entire route was once formerly SR 78\\\\. ==County Road 78A== County Road 78A is Pondella Road from SR 78 in Cape Coral to U.S. Route 41 Business in North Fort Myers. It provides a quicker way for motorists traveling east on SR 78 to access Downtown Fort Myers. The road was known as SR 78A before 1980. ==County Road 765== County Road 765 is Burnt Store Road from SR 78 / CR 78 / CR 884 in Cape Coral to the Charlotte County line in Burnt Store Marina. The road continues north into Charlotte County and serves as a direct connection between Cape Coral and Punta Gorda. The road was formerly known as SR 765. The road is named after the community of Burnt Store Marina, whose name refers to a general store and trading post operated by early settlers that once stood in the general vicinity. The trading post was burned down by a small group of Seminole Indians led by Chief Billy Bowlegs in protest of settlers taking their land. ;Major intersections ==County Road 767== County Road 767 is Stringfellow Road (also known as Pine Island Boulevard) from York Street in St. James City to Main Street in Bokeelia. The entire route is on Pine Island. The road was formerly known as SR 767. The road is named for Harry Stringfellow, a Lee County commissioner from Pine Island who served from 1926 to 1953. He played a major role in the construction of the road and the Matlacha Bridge. ;Major intersections ==County Road 771== Unsigned CR 771, formerly part of SR 771, is Gasparilla RoadFDOT right of way map, section 12660-2601 extending north from Boca Grande to the Charlotte County line on Gasparilla Island. ==County Road 810== County Road 810 exists along Luckett Road from CR 865 (Ortiz Avenue) in Fort Myers to Country Lakes Drive west of Buckingham. The road is maintained by the Lee County DOT, except for the interchange with I-75, which is maintained by Florida DOT. ;Major intersections ==County Road 840== County Road 840 is Alico Road from US 41 (Tamiami Trail) just west of San Carlos Park to CR 850 (Corkscrew Road) east of Estero. It mostly runs in an east-west trajectory just north of San Carlos Park and Three Oaks, providing access to Florida Gulf Coast University, Gulf Coast Town Center, and Southwest Florida International Airport. The road is maintained by the Lee County DOT, except for the I-75 interchange, which is maintained by Florida DOT. ;History It originally was a two-lane rural road connecting the Tamiami Trail to agricultural and industrial land owned by the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company (later known as Alico, Inc., the road's namesake) in east Lee County. In 1973, a railroad spur was built along Alico Road to serve mines on Alico's land, although the easternmost 3.5 miles of it were removed in 1994. Alico Road has since become a major commuter thoroughfare. In the mid- to late 2000s it was widened to six lanes, and the interchange with I-75 was rebuilt as a partial cloverleaf interchange (it was originally a folded diamond due to the railroad). In 2007, the west end and the terminus at US 41 was realigned slightly north in preparation for the construction of the SR 739 extension and interchange (which was built in 2012). ;Major intersections ==County Road 850== County Road 850 is Corkscrew Road from US 41 (Tamiami Trail) in Estero to the Collier County line near Immokalee, where it continues east into Collier County towards Immokalee. East of Estero, it runs just to the north of Corkscrew Swamp. The route was first commissioned as a state road in 1935 with the designation State Road 276. It became SR 850 ten years later during the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering.FDOT right of way map, section 12640-2601 It was then transferred to Lee County control in the 1980s. All of CR 850 is maintained by Lee County DOT, except for the interchange with I-75, which is maintained by Florida DOT. ;Major intersections ==County Road 863== County Road 863 is the county-controlled segment of Fowler Street south of Metro Parkway within the city limits of Fort Myers. North of here, Fowler is designated State Road 739, which continues south along Metro Parkway. The unsigned designation follows Fowler Street from Metro Parkway south and intersects State Road 884 (Colonial Boulevard). It then turns southwest and winds around one of the runways at Page Field before terminating at US 41. Fowler Street previously terminated at North Airport Road at the entrance to the former passenger terminal at Page Field (which ceased operations in 1983 when commercial air service was relocated to Southwest Florida International Airport). In the mid-1990s, Fowler Street was realigned around Page Field's Runway 13 and extended to connect directly to US 41 at Boy Scout Drive (which continues a short distance to Summerlin Road (CR 869)). Prior to the fall of 2015, CR 863's designation ended at Hanson Street (which previously carried the SR 739 designation to Metro Parkway's former alignment). ;Major intersections The entire route is in Fort Myers. ==County Road 865== County Road 865 exists in three sections. The southernmost section begins in Bonita Springs where it is known as Bonita Beach Road, the main east-west route through Bonita Springs. When it reaches the Gulf of Mexico near Barefoot Beach, it turns north along Hickory Boulevard. It becomes Estero Boulevard as it crosses the Bonita Beach Causeway onto Fort Myers Beach. This section ends at the north end of Fort Myers Beach at SR 865 just south of the Matanzas Pass Bridge. The central section travels along Gladiolus Drive through Iona, Harlem Heights, and Biggar and passes Lakes Regional Park before ending at US 41 (Tamiami Trail). The northern section runs along Ben C. Pratt Six Mile Cypress Parkway and Ortiz Avenue from SR 739 to SR 80 in Tice. The segments were once part of a continuous SR 865 and Ortiz Avenue was part of SR 80B. ==County Road 867== County Road 867 is McGregor Boulevard from the Sanibel Causeway in Punta Rassa to SR 867 in Iona. The road was formerly known as SR 867,FDOT right of way map, section 12040-2501 a designation which still exists on a section of McGregor Boulevard from Iona to McGregor. ==County Road 867A== County Road 867A is the main north-south route through Cape Coral, connecting it with North Fort Myers and South Fort Myers. It begins just south of Fort Myers at US 41 near Villas. From here, it is known as College Parkway, named for its proximity to Florida SouthWestern State College (originally Edison Community College). After an interchange with McGregor Boulevard (SR 867), CR 867A crosses the Cape Coral Bridge, CR 867A continues as Cape Coral Parkway for . Up to this point, it is unsigned, though a part of College Parkway near Summerlin Road is signed as CR 882. At Cape Coral Parkway's interchange with Del Prado Boulevard, the route turns north along the street, and is first signed as CR 867A here. The route continues north through much of Cape Coral. Veterans Parkway is one of Cape Coral's major east-west routes, and it travels into Fort Myers via the Midpoint Memorial Bridge. Del Prado Boulevard continues northward to Pine Island Road (SR 78). North of Pine Island Road, addresses on Del Prado Boulevard have the attached \\"North\\" suffix to the name of the road; south of Pine Island Road uses \\"South.\\" After Pine Island Road, Del Prado Boulevard continues north as a city street, though the city of Cape Coral maintains the CR 867A designation. It intersects Diplomat Parkway and the Kismet Parkway, before intersecting with US 41 (Tamiami Trail) at the northern Cape Coral city limits. The extension into North Fort Myers was built in the 1990s. From US 41, Del Prado Boulevard once again becomes a county road and continues east along the northern edge of North Fort Myers. Just past the Prairie Pines Preserve, it briefly becomes Mellow Drive before it terminates at Slater Road. Future plans call for Del Prado Boulevard to be extended north from Mellow Drive in North Fort Myers around the Prairie Pines Preserve to Interstate 75 with a new interchange near the Lee-Charlotte County border. Formerly State Road 867A between McGregor Boulevard and Pine Island Road, it became a major route when the Cape Coral Bridge opened in 1964. ==County Road 869== County Road 869 is the designation for Summerlin Road which runs from CR 867 (McGregor Boulevard) in Iona east and north to CR 884 (Colonial Boulevard) in Fort Myers. It is the main route connecting Fort Myers with the islands of Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel and Captiva. The road is named for Jacob Summerlin, a prominent Punta Rassa cattleman. Built in the early 1980s, Summerlin Road was planned to be part of State Road 869 (a designation which has since been reused for the Sawgrass Expressway near Fort Lauderdale), but the road was never added to the state highway system since it turned over to Lee County before it opened. It was originally intended to be an alternative to McGregor Boulevard (SR 867) as a limited-access road, but development along the route has since hindered that intent. To better handle increasing traffic, the intersection with San Carlos Bouelvard (SR 865) was upgraded to an interchange in 2007 along with being widened to six lanes. Elevated interchange ramps were also added at the Gladiolus Drive (CR 865) intersection at the same time. The College Parkway (CR 867A) intersection was upgraded to an interchange in 2011 along with further widening. South of Fort Myers, Summerlin Road roughly follows the route of the abandoned Punta Rassa branch of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which was removed in 1952. It runs along the former railroad corridor from just north of Gladiolus Drive to Bass Road. ;Major intersections ==County Road 876== County Road 876 serves as a major east-west thoroughfare through Lee County just south of Fort Myers city limits before becoming a north-south route through Lehigh Acres and Buckingham. Beginning at SR 867 in McGregor, CR 876 travels east along Cypress Lake Drive through Cypress Lake to U.S. Route 41 (Tamiami Trail). It continues east of US 41 as Daniels Parkway towards Interstate 75 and Southwest Florida International Airport. East of Gateway, CR 876 intersects State Road 82, where it turns north and continues as Gunnery Road through Lehigh Acres before merging with Buckingham Road. Buckingham Road carries CR 876 north through Buckingham to its terminus with SR 80 in Fort Myers Shores. ==County Road 881== County Road 881 exists just west of Interstate 75 from the Collier County line in Bonita Springs to CR 840 (Alico Road) in Three Oaks. Locally, it is known as Three Oaks Parkway north of Coconut Road in Estero, and Imperial Parkway south of this point. The road continues past its southern terminus into Collier County as County Road 881, which is known as Livingston Road. The entire route is controlled by Lee County, except for the short segment between Bonita Beach Road and East Terry Street which is controlled by the city of Bonita Springs (though the city maintains the CR 881 designation). The corridor of CR 881 in Lee County was completed in early 2008 with the opening of Imperial Parkway between Coconut Road in Estero and East Terry Street in Bonita Springs. This made CR 881 a third major thoroughfare connecting Lee and Collier Counties along with U.S. Route 41 and Interstate 75. Lee County plans to eventually extend Three Oaks Parkway north of its current terminus to Daniels Parkway (CR 876). A short segment of the extension was built by a private developer in the early 2010s. The rest of the extension, which would parallel Interstate 75 and connect to Daniels Parkway via Fiddlesticks Boulevard, is set to be completed around 2020. ;Major intersections ==County Road 884== County Road 884 exists in two sections. The western section runs through Cape Coral along the Veterans Parkway and the Midpoint Bridge from SR 78 / CR 78 (Pine Island Road) / CR 765 (Burnt Store Road) in Cape Coral to SR 884 / US 41 (Cleveland Avenue) in Fort Myers. The eastern section travels through Lehigh Acres along Colonial, Lee, Leeland Heights, and Joel Boulevards from SR 884 / Dynasty Drive in Fort Myers to SR 80 in Alva. The eastern segment came into existence in the early 1980s when Colonial Boulevard (SR 884) was extended from I-75 to connect with State Road 82 at Lee Boulevard. Lee Boulevard was previously State Road 82B while Leeland Heights and Joel Boulevards were part of State Road 873 (a designation which also continued south down Alabama Road). The western segment, which previously ended at State Road 867 (McGregor Boulevard), was extended into Cape Coral in 1997 upon the completion of the Midpoint Memorial Bridge and Veterans Parkway. ==County Road 885== County Road 885 lies just east of Interstate 75 from CR 850 (Corkscrew Road) in Estero to CR 884 (Colonial Boulevard) in Fort Myers. As a major north-south corridor, it provides access to Florida Gulf Coast University, Gulf Coast Town Center, and Southwest Florida International Airport. It is known as Treeline Avenue north of the entrance to Southwest Florida International Airport, and Ben Hill Griffin Parkway south of it. ;History The first major segment of CR 885 to be completed was Ben Hill Griffin Parkway between Alico and Corkscrew Roads. It was named for Ben Hill Griffin, Jr., former chairman of Alico Inc., whose land was partially donated by Griffin's son Ben Hill Griffin III to the state for the construction of Florida Gulf Coast University. Ben Hill Griffin Parkway was completed by 1997 in conjunction with the opening of the university, as it was the main access road. Treeline Avenue, which originally was a short local road off Daniels Parkway, was extended south and connected to Ben Hill Griffin Parkway in early 2005 in conjunction with the opening of the current terminal at Southwest Florida International Airport. Treeline Avenue was later extended to Colonial Boulevard in 2006. ;Major intersections ==County Road 887== County Road 887 is the unsigned designation for Old 41 Road from the Collier County line north through Bonita Springs to US 41\\\\. The road was originally a routing of Tamiami Trail (US 41) through Downtown Bonita Springs. It became SR 887 when US 41 was moved to its present alignment in 1976. It was turned over to Lee County in the early 1980s. Bonita Springs was incorporated in 1999, and CR 887 has since come under city control. The SR 887 designation has since been reused for the Port Miami Tunnel since its opening on August 3, 2014. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Bonita Springs. ==County Road 901== County Road 901 (CR 901) is the unsigned designation for Vanderbilt Drive from the Collier County line north, along the Collier–Lee county line for its entire length, into Bonita Springs to CR 865\\\\. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Bonita Springs, on the Collier–Lee county line. ==See also== * Former state roads in Florida ==References== Lee ","title":"List of county roads in Lee County, Florida"},{"id":"42049902","text":"Bertha Wegmann (1847–1926) was a Danish portrait painter of German ancestry.Dansk Biografisk Lexikon She was the first woman to hold a chair at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. ==Life== At the age of five, her family moved to Copenhagen, where her father became a merchant.

In 2009, WikEM was launched as a free wiki-based website and phone application that was universally available to all residency programs and global practitioners. As of October 2019, WikiEM has about 4,050 content pages.

WikEM has been listed as a key reference for emergency medicine physicians, residents, medical students, nurses, and paramedics. ==Reliability== Although the use of wiki-type software has become common for a variety of purposes, several sources have questioned whether the wiki-based format of WikEM is reliable enough to use as a source for medical information, with arguments similar to questions about the reliability of Wikipedia plus the additional concerns of patient safety. ==Free open access meducation== Free open access meducation (FOAM) has been described as “medical education for anyone, anywhere, anytime” and WikEM has been described as a key resource in the FOAM movement. WikEM's free, openly accessible content has been specifically noted as an important growing resource for clinicians in the developing world, where access to up to date medical references is more difficult.

In 2005 Gaches was asked to join the group The Imperials. Members Terry Blackwood, Joe Moscheo, and Sherman Andrus needed someone to sing tenor with them for select dates involving Elvis Presley Enterprises. They traveled internationally performing 25-30 shows a year called \\"The Gospel Side of Elvis\\". In 2006 The Lefevre Quartet asked Gaches to join and travel with them when he wasn't on the road with The Imperials. In 2009 Scott Fowler from Legacy Five contacted Gaches about filling in for their current tenor singer, Frank Seamans, whose son was ill at the time. Gaches also made sure Fowler knew that if Frank decided to leave, he would be honoured to be considered for the position. Scott soon offered him the position and Gaches became the new tenor singer for the group. On August 26, 2015, Gus Gaches announced his departure from Legacy Five due to several allergies and vocal fatigue. In January 2019, Gaches joined Tribute Quartet ==Personal life== Gaches married his wife, Tamara, in April 1989.

It is located in the village of Årdalstangen, at the end of the Årdalsfjorden. It is the church for the Nedre Årdal parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The red, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1867 using designs by the architect Christian Christie. The church seats about 400 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new that year. The first church was likely a stave church that was constructed between 1150 and 1200. Over the centuries the church was renovated and expanded as well as the addition of a tower on the west end. In the 1800s, the nave measured with a narrower choir measuring . In 1860s, the church was deemed to be too small for the parish and in need of repair, so a new church was built several meters to the east of the old church and then the old church was torn down. During the demolition of the old church, workers found medieval coins under the church which have helped to date the original construction of the church. The new building was consecrated on 19 December 1867 by the local parish priest Lauritz Andreas Hald. ==Media gallery== FV303 Tangevegen I.jpg Årdal kyrkje i Sogn.jpg ÅRDAL STAVKIRKE - an10071208211012.jpgSketch of the old stave church Aardal portal.jpgEntrance to the old church Aardal grunnriss.jpgFloorplan of the old church ==See also== *List of churches in Bjørgvin ==References== Category:Årdal Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1867 Category:12th-century establishments in Norway ","title":"Årdal Church (Vestland)"},{"id":"42050161","text":"Årdal Church may refer to: *Årdal Church (Agder), a church in Bygland municipality in Agder county, Norway *Årdal Church (Rogaland), a church in Hjelmeland municipality, Rogaland county, Norway *Old Årdal Church, a church in Hjelmeland municipality, Rogaland county, Norway *Årdal Church (Vestland), a church in Årdal municipality, Vestland county, Norway ==See also== *Årdal (disambiguation) *Ardal (disambiguation) ","title":"Årdal Church"},{"id":"42050164","text":"Farnes Church () is a parish church in Årdal Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

In 2009, he was called up to a training camp hosted by the Nigeria under-17 national team, but he was later dropped and didn't make the final squad that went on to tour Qatar. ===Bylis Ballsh=== In January 2012, James joined Albanian Superliga side Bylis Ballsh, where other Nigerian players were already part of the squad, and he initially joined the club's youth team before being promoted to the first team ahead of the 2012–13 campaign. He made his professional debut on 23 September 2012 in an Albanian Superliga tie against FK Kukësi, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Shkëlzen Kelmendi in the 1–0 loss. Just a few days later on 26 September, James made his first professional start in an Albanian Cup tie against Tërbuni Pukë, where he also scored his first professional goal in the 2–0 win. Loan to Tomori Berat In January 2013, James was sent on loan to fellow top flight side Tomori Berat for the second part of 2012–13 season. After being initially used as a right-back, James impressed with his attack play and incursions forward and was given a more attacking role. He played his first game for his new side on 10 February, starting and playing full-90 minutes in a 1–0 away loss to Tirana. His first score-sheet contributions for the team came later in his fourth appearance, netting the opener inside four minutes in an eventual 1–2 home loss to Kastrioti Krujë. James played 12 matches during his short-spell term at the club, all of them as starter, collecting 1062 minutes as the team was relegated to Albanian First Division after two seasons. Following the end of the season, the team was scattered and James remained without money, after not being paid most of the time by the club, living along with the other foreigner players in the mini hotel near the stadium. ===Laçi=== 2014–15 season On his European debut in the first qualifying round of the Europa League on 3 July 2014, James scored his first European goal against Slovenian side Rudar Velenje away from home. His goal came in the 89th minute of the game which equalised the score at 1–1. He also scored during the return leg, opening the score only to have a last gasp equaliser take the game to extra time and then penalties, where Laçi won 3–2 in the shootout and where Adeniyi scored the winning penalty. After Laçi were eliminated from Europa League, James played his first league match on 24 August 2014, assisting Elton Doku in a 1–1 home draw against Partizani Tirana. On 20 September, in the matchday 5 against Tirana, James set-up his second assist of the season in a 2–0 home over the capital club. He scored his first goal of the season on 27 September in a 1–1 away draw against Flamurtari Vlorë, scoring the goal in 31st minute with a great chip from outside the zone. In first leg of first round of 2014–15 Albanian Cup against Naftëtari Kuçovë, he scored the opener in 6th minute, helping the team to get a comfortable 2–0 away win. 2015–16 season On 12 August 2015, in the 2015 Albanian Supercup match held at Qemal Stafa Stadium, James scored twice for the team in an eventual 2–2 draw; he also scored his penalty shootout attempt helping Laçi to win the match 8–7 by penalty shootouts. That was the club's first Albanian Supercup in history. ===Skënderbeu Korçë=== On 1 February 2016, in the last day of the winter transfer window, James left Laçi to join Skënderbeu Korçë, where he signed a three-year contract. He debuted with the club six days later in the match against Kukësi, where James first assisted the first goal of Salihi and later scored for himself in an eventual 3–1 home win, placing Skënderbeu two points clear at the top. On 4 May, in the matchday 33 of the league against Laçi, James was the main protagonist by providing three assists and netting twice for himself as Skënderbeu Korçë scored six goals in the first half in an eventual 6–1. In the final matchday of Albanian Superliga against Flamurtari Vlorë, James provided the assist of the team's second goal in an eventual 2–0 away success, helping the club to win its sixth consecutive league title and seventh overall. He finished the season by scoring 23 goals in all competitions with Laçi and Skënderbeu, including 15 in league, setting a new personal best. 2016–17 season James started the new season on 24 August by playing the last 10 minutes of the 2016 Albanian Supercup, where Skënderbeu was defeated 3–1 by Kukësi at the Selman Stërmasi Stadium. He started the league season by making another appearance as a substitute as the team won 2–1 against Flamurtari Vlorë at home. On 24 September, in the matchday 4, in his first match as a starter, James scored the lone goal against Luftëtari Gjirokastër as Skënderbeu grabbed the fourth consecutive win. He made his 100th Albanian Superliga appearance on 25 April 2016 in the matchday 31 against Tirana. In 2016–17 season, James made 32 league appearances and scored 8 goals as Skënderbeu failed to win the title for the first time in six years. He also contributed with 6 matches and 3 goals in Albanian Cup as Skënderbeu lost the final to Tirana. 2017–18 season On 23 November 2017, in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League Group B match against Dynamo Kyiv, James scored the second goal of his team in an eventual 3–1 home win, their second ever group stage victory. Although Skënderbeu was eliminated with one match in hand, he was named Man of the Match by UEFA. On 27 May 2018, in the 2018 Albanian Cup Final, James won a penalty that was scored by Sabien Lilaj for the only goal of the match versus Laçi, meaning Skënderbeu has won the Albanian Cup for the first time. He also contributed with 10 goals and 32 appearances in championship which ended in conquest, meaning that the club has completed the domestic double for the first time in history. ===Gabala=== On 26 June 2018, James moved to Gabala FK of Azerbaijan Premier League by penning a three-year contract, rejoining his former teammate Sabien Lilaj. Skënderbeu reportedly earned €200,000 from the transfer and also retained 25% part ownership. He was presented on the same day, stating: “I’m happy to join up with Gabala. I’m a footballer with great targets and want to hit them in this club. I came to Gabala to reach to new successes. I know Gabala made some progresses in the UEFA Europa League last seasons. But this time I want to be a part of the more successes and go more ahead in the continental championship.” ===Ironi Kiryat Shmona=== On 9 July 2019 signed to Ironi Kiryat Shmona. ==Personal life== James is a practicing Muslim. He is eligible to play for Nigeria, Togo and Albania, and has expressed his desire to play for Albania should the opportunity present itself.Isreali-based striker Adeniyi ready to dump Nigeria for Albania ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" + Club statistics - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"1\\"Bylis Ballsh 2012–13 rowspan=\\"1\\"Albanian Superliga 6021colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—81 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Tomori Berat (loan) 2012–13 rowspan=\\"1\\"Albanian Superliga 122colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—122 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Bylis Ballsh 2013–14 rowspan=\\"1\\"Albanian Superliga 16111colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—172 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Laçi 2013–14 rowspan=\\"3\\"Albanian Superliga 11410colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—124 - 2014–15 271165colspan=\\"2\\"—4All appearance(s) in UEFA Europa League2colspan=\\"2\\"—3718 - 2015–16 17935colspan=\\"2\\"—201Appearance in Albanian Supercup22316 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !55!!24!!10!!10!!-!!-!!6!!2!!1!!2!!71!!38 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Skënderbeu Korçë 2015–16 rowspan=\\"3\\"Albanian Superliga 17621colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—197 - 2016–17 32863colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—1Appearance in Albanian Supercup03911 - 2017–18 321053colspan=\\"2\\"—122colspan=\\"2\\"—4915 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !81!!24!!13!!7!!-!!-!!12!!2!!1!!0!!107!!33 - rowspan=\\"4\\" valign=\\"center\\"Gabala 2018–19 rowspan=\\"3\\"Premier League 251042colspan=\\"2\\"—20colspan=\\"2\\"–3112 - 2019–20 0000colspan=\\"2\\"—00colspan=\\"2\\"–00 - 2020–21 1000colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–10 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !26!!10!!4!!2!!-!!-!!2!!0!!-!!-!!32!!12 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Ironi Kiryat Shmona (loan) 2019–20 rowspan=\\"1\\"Israeli Premier League 1931152colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—256 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !215!!64!!31!!22!!5!!2!!20!!4!!2!!2!!273!!94 } ==Honours== ;Laçi * Albanian Cup: 2014–15 * Albanian Supercup: 2015 ;Skënderbeu Korçë * Albanian Superliga: 2015–16, 2017–18 * Albanian Cup: 2017–18 ;Gabala *Azerbaijan Cup: 2018–19 ==ReferencesCategory:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Yoruba sportspeople Category:Nigerian footballers Category:Nigerian expatriate footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:KF Bylis Ballsh players Category:KF Laçi players Category:KF Skënderbeu Korçë players Category:Gabala FC players Category:Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona F.C. players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Azerbaijan Premier League players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Albania Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Azerbaijan Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Israel Category:Expatriate footballers in Albania Category:Expatriate footballers in Azerbaijan Category:Expatriate footballers in Israel ","title":"James Adeniyi"},{"id":"42050197","text":"The Multicultural Progress Party is a defunct minor political party in South AustraliaRegistered political parties: ECSA led by Lam Duc Vu and Trish Nguyen from IFIG Australia (Melbourne).

It was financed by a £7,000 bequest from Mary Anne Alliott who was the aunt of the founder of the friary, Fr Arthur Wells. On 18 June 1892 the friary and church was dedicated and consecrated by the Bishop of Southwark. The friary was built to serve as a novitiate for the Franciscans in Britain.Chilworth News from Order of Friars Minor retrieved 25 February 2014 ===Developments=== In 1915, an organ, built by Lewis & Co was installed. It was paid for by John Courage of Derryswood, Wonersh (owner of both Lewis & Co and Courage Brewery) and was done with permission from the architect. The same year, Albert Ketèlbey wrote his light classical music piece, In a Monastery Garden, having visited the friary. ===Parish=== In 1945, the parish of Holy Ghost Church was entrusted to the friary. It expanded and the friary also served a Mass centre in Gomshall, Our Lady of the Angels. St Augustine's Abbey, Chilworth is not a parish church and concentrates on being a Benedictine monastery rather than running a parish. Having said this, the abbey church is actively open to the public to attend services every day of the year, along with other regular events. ==Abbey== In 2011, it was announced that the friars would leave Chilworth. The friars were distributed amongst the other Franciscan houses in Britain and the parish church of the Holy Ghost was closed. That year, St Augustine's Abbey in Ramsgate also closed and the Benedictine monks from the Order of St Benedict, of the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation, looked for a smaller property to move into. When Chilworth Friary became available, they agreed to move to the area and it became St Augustine's Abbey.History from Chilworth Benedictines retrieved 25 February 2014 The monastic community follows the Rule of St Benedict under the guidance of an Abbot, centred on the Divine Office and Mass prayed daily in the Abbey Church, often in a mix of Latin and English including Gregorian Chant. The community currently numbers eight monks. There are a number of lay oblates. The monks run a guest house and offer a programme of retreats, monastic vocation visits, study days, meditation sessions and healing days. They also make and sell skin creams and furniture polish made from bees wax.

DeMarco (born February 14, 1921 in Podargoni, Italy) was an educator and administrator who had a central role in the founding of the University of Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Beginning in 1946, he was the first in that city's history to teach courses in Science and Applied Science in post- secondary degree programs. DeMarco has the distinction of being the first and only one to hold the highest post of Principal of Essex College, which was Windsor's first public institution to receive provincial funding for university education. DeMarco's name figures prominently in the University's history, associated with his four plus decades devoted to higher education in Windsor, as a professor, athletic director, administrator, executive, and Professor Emeritus. Several Commonwealth and national-level awards and honours have given recognition to DeMarco's distinguished career over the many years in which he served and shaped Windsor's institution of higher learning. The University of Windsor came into existence in 1963, after evolving from Essex College where DeMarco was Principal, as well as Dean of Applied Science, from 1959 to 1963. Earlier, in the early 1950s, DeMarco had championed the establishment of a separate, but affiliated Essex College to complement the role of Windsor's Assumption College, a long established Catholic liberal arts college under the Congregation of St. Basil. In particular, Windsor's first university degree programs specializing in science and engineering were initiated in the newly created Essex College in the 1950s by DeMarco, a chemical engineer by background. Under his leadership, Essex College further expanded to offer degrees in business and in nursing. When that institution became part of the University of Windsor in 1963, DeMarco became the inaugural Vice-President, with Father E.C. LeBel, C.S.B. from Assumption as the first President. \\"The development of a non-denominational provincial university out of an historic Roman Catholic university was unprecedented.\\" Begun under their watch, we now see the present full-fledged non-denominational university with nine faculties that is the University of Windsor today. ==Early life and education== Frank Anthony DeMarco was born February 14, 1921 in Podargoni, Italy. His family was re-united in Canada when he was a young boy, and he received his primary and secondary school education in North Bay, Ontario. He attended the University of Toronto where he earned a B.A.Sc. in 1942, M.A.Sc.in 1943, and PhD in 1951, all in chemical engineering. DeMarco was witness to the stark incongruities during the World War II years that were the reality for Italian-Canadians at that time. Although he had four older brothers in uniform, including one who lost his life serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), DeMarco also had three uncles who were among the over 600 Italian Canadians taken from their families and imprisoned during the war. DeMarco at this time was involved in vital work in support of the war effort that was taking place in leading laboratories like the University of Toronto and elsewhere. His main research dealt with adhesives, including those used in the construction materials in the de Havilland Mosquito combat aircraft. His PhD thesis focused on properties of adhesives used in plywood construction and his research findings were published in the Analytical Chemistry Journal. == Academic career == DeMarco was an instructor in chemical engineering at the University of Toronto from 1943 to 1946. He came to Windsor in 1946 after he was recruited by the Basilian Fathers, who were endeavouring to meet the demand for higher education that was being created by returning World War II veterans, and the growth of the City of Windsor. He joined the staff of Assumption College with a mandate to offer science instruction and to create the original science laboratories in the landmark War Memorial Hall. Beginning in 1953, Assumption College received its own charter to become an independent degree-granting institution and thereby ended its affiliation with the University of Western Ontario. Serving Assumption College, from 1946 to 1956, in several capacities, DeMarco was Assistant Professor, then Professor, and first Head of the Department of Chemistry. He was the first to teach pre- engineering courses, such as descriptive geometry, surveying, and mechanical drawing in the regular day program. Concurrently, from 1949 to 1956, DeMarco served as Assumption's Director of Athletics and coached their intercollegiate football team, and later their basketball team. He also initiated and promoted an intramural sports program. DeMarco was the first to propose that growth and long-term financial viability could only be achieved through the creation of a non-denominational college, which would receive Provincial grants. His conception started down the path toward implementation with the creation and incorporation of Essex College in 1954. The eventual task of spinning off an autonomous non-denominational affiliate from a Catholic university was a very complex undertaking, and was the culmination of over two years of negotiations. DeMarco, along with the two Basilian Fathers, Reverend E.C.LeBel, and Reverend Norbert J. Ruth are considered the three central figures in the founding of Essex College. In 1956, Assumption College became Assumption University, and in the academic year 1956-57 Essex College began accepting students and offering courses. From the beginning, Dr. DeMarco promoted his vision for the development of a complete academic experience of degree programs, graduate work, and research at the young Essex College. Originally offering degrees in Mathematics and sciences, Essex College later on added Engineering, Nursing and Business. DeMarco was the inaugural Principal of Essex College from 1959 to 1963. Concurrently, DeMarco was also Acting Head of the Engineering Department after being appointed the first Dean of Applied Science in 1959. He held both positions until the young university took another step forward in 1963. As head of Essex College, DeMarco was able to considerably expand the resources available, and oversaw a very ambitious building and hiring program. The first building created with Essex College funds was the library, now known as the West Wing of the expanded university library. During this period DeMarco also identified the need for a \\"state-of- the-art\\" engineering building, and under his leadership, funding was secured amounting to $5,000,000 ( equaling approximately $40,000,000 in 2013 dollars) . The spacious new Essex Hall building, over 600 feet long, opened in 1962, and turned out classes of science and engineering graduates for the next five decades or more. ==University of Windsor Years== In 1963, Assumption University and Essex College together formed a new public institution, the University of Windsor, with Reverend E.C. LeBel, President of Assumption University at its helm. DeMarco became the inaugural Vice-President of the University of Windsor, a post which he held until 1979. Under three different presidents in all, DeMarco had full responsibility during most of this period for a very broad range of both administrative and academic matters. He was the sole Vice-President in the organization for many of those years. During his administrative career, DeMarco maintained his interest in scientific research, particularly as it applied to society's well-being. A good illustration of this emphasis on social responsibility was his ground- breaking report for the Ontario Ministry of Health in 1974, titled \\"Report of the Committee to Inquire into the Effect on Human Health of Lead in the Environment\\". DeMarco was also instrumental in establishing collaborative dialogue between the community's business/industry and the academia of the City of Windsor. He was an innovator in the establishment of advisory boards and forums that gave guidance and feedback to University leaders and policy makers in whether curriculum content was evolving in concert with industry and society's needs, To round out his academic career, which had begun in the classroom decades before, DeMarco decided in 1980 to return to the classroom and research, as a Professor of Engineering. At the same time, he was also appointed to the Board of Governors of the International Development Research Centre, a Canadian government- sponsored think tank to support ideas and research for the application of science and technology to solving problems of the developing regions of the world. In 1984 he was appointed by Premier William Davis as a member of the Ontario Council of University Affairs. During his long career, DeMarco also made a significant imprint on many other aspects of education in the Windsor community: as founding chair of the Board of Governors of St Clair College of Applied Arts and Technology (1967–68), elected member of the Essex County School Board, President of the Greater Windsor Foundation (1976–77), member of a number of industry- based scholarship selection committees and other community initiatives. DeMarco retired from the University of Windsor in 1986 after a forty year career. That same year he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Education and was also appointed Professor Emeritus, Faculty of Engineering. == Athletic career == Frank DeMarco was an outstanding athlete and received the \\"University of Toronto Most Versatile Athlete Award.\\" He played in what was the highest level of Canadian football in his day, known as the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU), a league that competed for the Grey Cup, and which later evolved into the CFL in the late fifties. DeMarco played for the Toronto Balmy Beach Beachers, in the position of end, for three seasons 1943, 1944 and 1945. When he moved to Windsor in 1946 he played quarterback in the same league for the Windsor Rockets. In hockey, he played three seasons as a defenceman (1943–45) for the Toronto Staffords, in the Ontario Hockey Association. In 1943 he pitched for Coppercliff Redmen in the Nickel Belt Baseball League when they won Northern Ontario Sr.\\"A\\" Championship. In later life he excelled in curling and in golf. In 1987, DeMarco was inducted into the University of Windsor Alumni Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contribution to sports as an intercollegiate coach at the University. In 1996 he was named to the Windsor/Essex County Sports Hall of Fame as a founder. == Honours == F. A. DeMarco was the recipient of many Commonwealth and Government of Canada awards and other honours: * Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, 1953 * Canadian Centennial Medal, 1967 * Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, 1977 * Italian of the Year Award, 1987 * 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal, 1992 * University of Windsor Clark Award, 2009 == Personal life == Frank DeMarco married Mary Valenti in 1948. They settled in Windsor, Ontario originally, and then from 1961 on, in nearby LaSalle. They raised twelve children together. Mary was a prolific artist, well known in the Windsor- Essex County area, particularly as a water-colourist. Among DeMarco's many grandchildren who followed in his tradition as exemplars of combined academic and athletic excellence are the three Moore brothers, Mark Moore, Steve Moore and Dominic Moore. The brothers all attended Harvard University, and were all three drafted in the National Hockey League entry draft. Frank and Mary DeMarco are patrons of the University of Windsor DeMarco Trophy ( annual scholarship awarded to athlete-scholar), and of the DeMarco Environmental Engineering Award, and of the Mary DeMarco Fine Arts Scholarship. == Further reading == *Christina DeMarco, 2015 Frank DeMarco and the Founding of the University of Windsor, Blurb.ca, Canada *Kathleen McCrone, General Editor, 2013 Back in the Day 1963 to 2013:The University of Windsor as we Knew It; Black Moss Press,Canada *Madelyn Della Valle, Caterina Lopez, 2009 Impronte: Italian Imprints in Windsor Walkerville Publishing Company, , 9780978129088 *George McMahon, 2013 Father Lebel and the Creation of the University of Windsor; J.M.

The demand for pay-pension equity, which underlies the OROP concept, was provoked by the exparte decision by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government, in 1973, two years after the historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, and shortly after Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw retired, to decrease armed forces pensions by 20–40 percent, and increase civilian pensions by 20 percent, without consulting armed forces headquarters. In 1986, the sense of unease and distrust prompted by the Third Central Pay Commission (CPC) was exacerbated by the Rajiv Gandhi led Indian National Congress (I) Government's decision to implement Rank Pay, which reduced basic pay of captain, majors, lt-colonel, colonels, and brigadiers, and their equivalent in the air-force, and the navy, relative to basic pay scales of civilian and police officers. The decision to reduce the basic pay of these ranks, implemented without consulting the armed forces, created radically asymmetries between police-military ranks, affected the pay, and pension of tens of thousands of officers and veterans, spawned two decades of contentious litigation by veterans. It became a lingering cause of distrust between the armed forces veterans and the MOD, which the government did little to ameliorate. In 2008, the Manmohan Singh led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government in the wake of the Sixth Central Pay Commission (6CPC), discarded the concept of rank-pay. Instead it introduced Grade pay, and Pay bands, which instead of addressing the rank, pay, and pension asymmetries caused by 'rank pay' dispensation, reinforced existing asymmetries. The debasing of armed forces ranks was accompanied by decision in 2008 to create hundreds of new posts of secretaries, special Secretaries, director general of police (DGP) at the apex grade pay level to ensure that all civilian and police officers, including defence civilian officers, retire at the highest pay grade with the apex pay grade pensions with One Rank One Pay (OROP). == Background == Between 2008–14, during the tenure of the UPA Government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, myriad Armed Forces grievances prompted by perceived inequities subsumed with OROP issue to make OROP a potent rallying call that resonated with veterans of all ranks. Against the background of perceived discrimination, and slights, and dismissive response of the Government, armed forces veterans, in the later half 2008, started a campaign, of nationwide public protests, which included hunger strikes. In response to the OROP protests, which underscored the growing pay- pension-status asymmetries, the UPA Government, in 2011, appointed a parliamentary committee which found merit in the veterans demands for OROP. ==Issues== The causes that inform the OROP protest movement are not pension alone, as armed forces veterans have often tried to make clear, and the parliamentary committee recorded. The issues, veterans emphasize, are of justice, equity, honor, and national security. The failure to address issue of pay-pension equity, and the underlying issue of honor, is not only an important cause for the OROP protest movement, but its escalation. The causes and grievances that inform OROP protesters and their high ranking supporters, in addition to failure of the government to implement OROP, are a string of contentious decision taken by UPA Government, in 2008–9, in the wake of Sixth Central Pay Commission (6 CPC), that sharply degraded Armed Forces pay grades and ranks. Decisions, that have had a radical impact on the armed forces sense of self-esteem, honor, and their trust in the government and security bureaucracy, some of which come to dominate policy under the UPA government, and remain unaddressed by the BJP Government, are outlined in the succeeding paragraphs ===Reduction of armed forces pensions=== In 1973, the Indira Gandhi led Congress (I) terminated ‘One Rank One Pension’ the basis for deciding pension of Indian Armed Forces Personnel ‘which had been in vogue for 26 years since independence’ through an ex parte administrative order. In addition, the Government, on the basis of the report of third Pay commission, from which Armed Forces representation was excluded, and which was dominated by bureaucrats, increased the pension of civilians, who retired at 58, from 30 to 50 percent, a net increase of 20 percent; and reduced the pension of soldier, Non Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Junior commissioned Officers (JCOs), by 20 percent, from 70 to 50 percent of basic pay, with the caveat that for full pension the minimum service was 33 years. But as soldiers in 1973 retired after 15 years service, at the age of 33–36, they got less than 30 percent of the pay as pension. Soldiers pension was thus decreased not by 20 percent but 40 percent from 70 to 30 percent. In addition to down grading military pensions, the government, without assigning reason, down graded the status of soldier by equating \\"infantry soldier with less than three years' service\\" with a \\"semi-skilled/unskilled labour\\". These decisions were all the more galling for the armed forces as these were based on the recommendation, and endorsement of Defence Secretary K B Lall, ICS, whose job it was to ensure the well being of the armed forces. The decision was announced two months after Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, who led the army in the victorious 1971 war, retired from service. The reason for depressing the armed Forces pensions, which continues to rankle veterans and servings personnel, given by the Congress I government was that it wanted to ensure ‘equivalence’ of Armed Forces pensions with civilians. ===Rank Pay=== The concept of rank-pay introduced in 1986, affected tens of thousand of serving and retired officers of the three armed forces. It started the process of undermining military ranks and making them subordinate to the police. Its discriminatory provisions reinforced the growing sense of distrust between the MOD and the veterans. It debased the military ranks of captain, majors, lt-colonel, colonels, and brigadiers, and their equivalent in the air-force and the Indian Navy. The legacy of rank-pay, and 4CPC, found echo in the 6CPC, and the 7CPC and continues to be a cause of distrust, false parities and anomalous pay scales. The implementation of BJP Government in 2016 of separate pay matrix for the police, and the armed forces, accentuated the anomalies in time scale pay grades between armed forces officers and the IPS, which had remain unresolved since 1986, when the congress government had reduced the basic pay of armed forces officers relative to police officers, by deducting 'rank-pay' from the basic-pay. The 7CPC decision on pay grades for the armed forces were called blatantly 'discriminatory' by former Chief of Indian Army General Ved P Malik, who said the intent was to degrade armed forces ranks in comparison with police time scale ranks. ===OROP-2008 for Civil-Police Officers=== Even though OROP was not a transparently stated civil service or police officers demand, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rewarded senior civil servant and IPS officers with OROP at the apex scale, the highest pay grade in the government. The decision to grant ' OROP' to the senior most government servants was taken, not by parliament, or ministerial committee, but by bureaucrats in Department of Pensions and Pensioners' Welfare (DOP&PW;), and the Prime Minister's Office. According to Avay Shukla, a former officer of the Indian Administrative Service, ( 1975 batch, Himachal Pradesh cadre), who retired at the apex grade, and is recipient of Apex Grade OROP-2008 linked pension, the decision to grant OROP-2008 to the civil and police services was implemented not by public notification, but a cunningly worded internal memorandum issued by Department of Pensions and Pensioners' Welfare, a department under the Prime Minister's office. Avay Shukla, in 2015, at the height of the OPOP protests, in a newspaper article revealed that apex OROP for the civil services was done slyly. As 'Apex-OROP' was done secretly it has neither been discussed or scrutinized by the media, or the Ministry of Finance, and for this reason remained little known, and only gained salience after the veterans started their protests. 'Apex-OROP-2008', is not as selective as it appears. Apex grade pay OROP pension covers thousands of retired, serving, and future Civil Service officers, including 4802 Indian Administrative Service officers, 600 Indian Foreign Service officers, and 4720 the IPS officers majority of whom because of their cadre structures( proliferation of apex ranks) are guaranteed that they will retire at the apex scale, not with standing what their responsibilities or duties entail. Most senior police and civil service officer are shy to acknowledge that they had been granted Apex OROP. Prasad, IAS, former defence secretary, who retired on 30 June 2004, on 22 August 2015, in a debate on national TV denied that he was getting Apex-OROP. J.K. Khanna, an IPS officer, who retired as DGP, in 2011, and Avay Shukla, IAS, who retired in 2010, confirmed in 2015 that they like other IAS and IPS officers are getting Apex OROP. In contrast to almost hundred percent Apex-OROP coverage to past and future retiree from the civil services, including majority of defence civilian officers in Ministry of Defence responsible for providing secretarial, logistic, and rear area services to the Armed Forces, like accounts and audit, land, only one tenth of one percent of the armed forces officers, as 'stratagem' and hedge against their opposition to the scheme, were also included in the apex OROP scheme. Those covered include the three heads of the Defence Forces, Army Commanders, and few other Lt Generals, and their equivalents in the Navy, and Air Force. The attempt to buy the silence of the Chiefs of the armed Forces on an issue that affects the entire officers corps, not unexpectedly, has not gone down well with veterans. Those excluded included Lt Generals, Major Generals, Vice Admirals, and Rear Admirals, and Air Marshals, the commanders of the Armed Forces largest formations: its Corps, Divisions, air commands, bases, fleets and training establishments. Sanction of Apex-OROP to thousands of officials, among other factors, has contributed to wide support that OROP protest enjoys; it has become an additional \\"causus belli\\" for the veterans protest over OROP. It is also the probable cause for the unprecedented letter by former Chiefs of Defence Forces of India to the Government declaring their support for OROP for the Armed Forces. ===Non Functional Upgradation (NFU) for police officers and others=== Sanction of OROP at apex scale to all civil services and Police officers was accompanied by grant of \\"Non Functional Upgrade\\" (NFU) also called \\"non- functional financial up-gradation\\" (NFFU) to all civil services including the Indian Police Service by the Congress(I) led United Progressive Alliance(UPA) Government, in 2008, to reward civil servants of 49 'Organized Central Group A Services', with automatic time bound pay promotions till the Higher Administrative Grade(HAG), a grade equated by Government with Lt Generals, Vice Admirals, and Air Marshals of Armed Forces. The unexplained exclusion of Armed Forces officers corps from the NFU, despite representation by the Chief of Staff, has wide-ranging implications : it impacts adversely the pay and pension structures, of colonels, brigadier and generals, and their equivalents in the navy and the air-force; it like OROP, become an emotive 'honor' issue; and, according to former senior military commanders, has had a corrosive impact on the Armed Forces morale, status, cohesion, and national security, Despite the serious long term implications of NFU, the issue was ignored by the UPA government, and even the BJP Government has chosen not to dwell on it. ===Up Graduation of heads of Central and State Police Forces=== In addition to NFU, Apex OROP for police and civil servants, the UPA Government, in 2008, in recognition of the growing influence of Indian Police service in Ministry of Home (MHA), India's Interior Ministry, promoted the heads of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), and even of the smaller MHA Forces, like the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), The Railway Police, an IG level post, to the highest grade pay, or the apex scale, with pay scale of Rs.80,000 (fixed). In addition, the Government upgraded heads of Police in all states, small or large, to Director General level to the highest grade pay, or the apex scale of Rs 80,000(fixed). This increased the number of IPS officers with several dozen, and made the Director Generals(DG) of these Central and state Forces at par in rank, pay, and status with Armed Forces senior most Lieutenant Generals, Air Marshals and Vice Admirals. The only MHA Armed Forces left out from up gradation to the higher grades was the Assam rifles, which is headed by an army Lt General, and the National Security Guard (NSG), which has a sizable army component. The implication of these up gradations are many: the immediate effect was that scores of IPS officers not withstanding their responsibilities were immediately made senior in pay grade, and status to Armed forces formation and fleet commanders, who were denied proportionate upgrades despite representation by the COSC committee; mass up-gradation and creation of new posts of secretaries and special secretaries, and DGs with apex grade pay level, also affected relative pensions. 'Non-functional financial up- gradation'(NFU) was not extended to Armed Forces. ===Asymmetries in time scale pay, pension, and allowances=== The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government headed by Manmohan Singh, following the recommendations of the sixth pay commission, mandated with effect from 01.09.2008, six time scale pay grade promotions on completion of 4, 9, 13, 14, 16/18 years of service for all officers in civil services including defense civilian officers in the MOD responsible for providing secretarial, and logistic support to the armed forces, and police officers including custom, revenue, railway, and industrial police. In comparison with six time-scale pay upgrades-promotions for the police, and defence civilian officers, the government approved three time scale pay upgrade-promotions for armed forces officers on completion of 2, 6, and 13 years of service, and at a far lower scale. The decision by UPA government to introduce and aggravate asymmetries in the pay and pension and allowances between the different police organizations and armed forces even in the time scale pay grades, which the government did not explain, was cause of widespread disappointment amongst veterans and serving officers, and is a cause of orop protests movement and the continued support that it receives, and is likely to continue to get. The time scale promotions and related increases in pay, and allowances for government officers, including the police, are not contingent on vacancies or change in responsibilities. But are accompanied by increase pay, allowances and significant perks, difficult to accurately monetize, such as entitlements for hotel accommodation, class of air and rail travel, type of passport, use of staff car, size of office, increase in dedicated personal staff, etc. Civil -Police- Military Officers Timescale promotions-pay grades (2008–16) Asymmetries in time scale pay-grades for civil-police-and the armed forces officers as result of government decision in 2008 are tabulated below: {  - !

The armed forces however remained disappointed with the grudging concession because it came with demeaning caveats. -  14  8900 8900  8000 900 -  16  10000  -  8000 2000 -  18  -  10000  8000 2000 -  21  10000  10000  87001300 } ===Ministry of Defence (MOD)=== The higher bureaucracy in Indian Ministry of Defence (MOD), unlike defence ministries in other countries, is staffed entirely by civil service officers on deputation, who have never served in the armed forces or are familiar with its working or ethos. The MOD bureaucracy is drawn from the IAS and from other civil services, including from civilian services responsible for providing support services to the Armed Forces such as from the Indian Defence Estates Service(IDES), the Indian Defence Accounts Service (IDAS), and Indian Ordnance Factories Service. The entire MOD bureaucracy is covered by Apex OROP. MOD higher bureaucracy, despite being granted apex-OROP coverage, and NFU has opposed to OROP and NFU for the Armed Forces, for no clear reasons. In 2011, during the tenure AK Antony, as Defence Minister, Neelam Nath, Secretary of Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare (Poorva Senani Kalyan Vibhag) from 1 June 2009 to 30 September 2011, on instructions of Shashi Kant Sharma, Defence Secretary, opposed OROP for the Armed Force, in her deposition to the Parliamentary Panel. The Koshyari Committee however, disagreed with submissions by the Ministry of Defence and found \\"merit in the demand for One Rank One Pension by Armed Forces Personnel\\", and urged the Government to implement OROP at the earliest. The MOD is considered by most ex-servicemen, including former head of the Armed Forces, as permanent impediment to OROP, and welfare of ESM. Four former heads of the Armed Forces in August 2015, in an open letter addressed to the President of India flagged \\"The hostile approach of MoD bureaucracy\\" and its \\"antagonistic handling of problems related to pensions and allowances of aging veterans, war widows and battle- casualties\\". ==Koshyari Committee, 2011== In response to the growing unease in the Armed Forces, and escalating protest by veterans, the Government set up of a ten-member all-party Parliamentary Panel, known as the Koshyari Committee after its chairman, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, a veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP), to examine the OROP issue. The Koshyari Committee after considering the evidence, and hearing oral depositions for eight months, submitted it report in December 2011. The committee unanimously found merit in OROP and strongly recommended its implementation. The Koshyari Committee (Petitions Committee of the Rajya Sabha), after examining the evidence, and taking into account the written and oral submissions by top officials from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Finance, veterans, and senior serving armed forces officers, over a six-month period (May–December 2011), defined the concept of OROP as follows: > OROP \\"implies that uniform pension be paid to the Armed Forces Personnel > retiring in the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of > their date of retirement and any future enhancement in the rates of pension > to be automatically passed on to the past pensioners.\\" The Koshyari Committee definition of OROP was accepted by the Government, endorsed by Parliament, and by ex-servicemen and ex-servicemen organizations. It has since become basis for the ex-servicemen's demand for implementation of OROP. It is in sync with the ex-servicemen definition of OROP, according to which OROP \\"implies the grant of equal pension to soldiers of a particular rank, who have rendered the same length of service, irrespective of the date of their retirement\\". On 27 February 2014, the MOD, in a meeting to discuss implementation of OROP attended by AK Antony, Defence Minister, Jitendra Singh, Minister of State, RK Mathur, Defence Secretary, Sangita Gairola, Secretary Department of Ex-Servicemen's Welfare, Arunava Dutt, Secretary Defence Finance, Vice Chiefs of the three Service, and Adjutant General of the Army, endorsed the Koshyari Committee's definition of OROP . Despite the Koshyari Committee report, public commitments, including in the parliament, and visible disaffection among armed force veterans, the UPA Government was slow to reach out to the veterans and implement OROP. == BJP Government's Response (2014-2016) == In May 2014, the UPA Government was replaced by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which like the Congress Party, had included implementation of OROP in its election manifesto. ===Narendra Modi=== The BJP Prime Ministerial candidate, at a large election rally, in Rewari, Haryana, with General VK Singh, formerChief of Army Staff standing by his side, in the presence of tens of thousands Ex-Servicemen, declared that he will implement OROP, if elected. After Narendra Modi became Prime Minister there were more promises and public affirmations by him, and Manohar Parrikar, the Defence Minister, on the merits of OROP, and their intent to implement OROP. Most memorably on Diwali, at Siachen Glacier, in 2014, he told soldiers \\"It was in my destiny that One rank One pension has been fulfilled\\". On 30 May 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after more than a year of pledges and promises to implement OROP, controversially declared that the term OROP still needed to be defined. Modi's musings on the need for a new more acceptable OROP definition prompted widespread dismay, disappointment, and outrage among Armed Forces pensioners. On 31 May 2015, Modi in Mann Ki Baat asked Ex-Servicemen to remain patient, as he gets rid of the bureaucratic hassles. Modi's statement was widely perceived as a disingenuous attempt to delay, dilute, and deny OROP. ===Arun Jaitley=== Arun Jaitley, the former Finance Minister and former Defence Minister, widely believed to the obstacle to early implementation of OROP, opposed Koshyari Committee definition of OROP. On 31 August 2015 Arun Jaitley, without defining OROP, says, \\"I have my own formula on what OROP means. Somebody else may have their own formula on OROP but it has to be within reasonable and rational criteria. You can't have an OROP where pensions are revised every month or every year\\". Responding to Jaitley, the UPSEM alleges that Arun Jaitley, is manipulating the media, specifically, the Times of India, and India TV channel, to misinform the public, and exacerbate difference between the Officers and soldiers, on the OROP issue. ==Protests by Veterans== On 15 June, ex-servicemen despairing of BJP promises, commenced nationwide protests, and hunger strikes. Even some protestors, who are Ex-Servicemen, threatened to resort to Rail Roko (Stop Trains) agitation. ===Support=== Four former chiefs of the Armed Forces of India, namely General S F Rodrigues, former COAS, and Admirals L Ramdas, Arun Prakash and Sureesh Mehta, former Chiefs of Naval Staff, in an open letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, on 13 August 2015, warned that the denigration and humiliation of veterans, and the Government handling of veterans and armed Forces issues, pose grave \\"implication for national security\\" ===Police Assault in Delhi, 2015=== On the morning of 14 August 2015, the eve India's 68 Independence day, and the day after General Ved P Mulik, former Army Chief, the government designated interlocutor informed Nripendra Misra in the Prime Minister Office (PMO) that the government offer on OROP for Ex-Servicemen was unacceptable, a contingent of Police, drawn from the Delhi Police force, and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), a paramilitary force for Internal security and Counter insurgency, under Ministry of Home Affairs, on orders from Rajnath Singh, the Home Minister of India, and under the command of BS Bassi, Director General of Delhi Police, assaulted a peaceful gathering of Armed Forces veterans, families, and war widows, at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. The Police, not properly led, in their attempt to evict and frighten the gathered veterans, manhandled, 'pushed around', lathi charged, dragged, misbehaved, humiliated, menaced, and tore medals off the shirt of old veterans, including some in their eighties. Senior Delhi Police officers sought to justifying their heavy handed actions by claiming that they acted \\"following a request by civic agency New Delhi Municipal Council\\". Senior officer of Delhi police also said that the veterans were viewed as security risk and security threat. The orders to the Delhi Police to evict the veterans, which had their origins in the MHA and the PMO, was revoked on 14 August afternoon, following public outrage, by Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Home, who said, \\"I have asked the Commissioner of Police not to remove the ex-servicemen from Jantar Mantar and let them continue the protest\\". Former Chiefs of the Armed Forces protest attack on veterans On 17 August, 10 former Chiefs of the Armed Forces of India in an unprecedented joint open letter addressed to Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister, condemned the police action, and urged the PM to order an inquiry into the action by the Delhi Police. The Signatories to the letter included retired Generals Vishwa Nath Sharma, Shankar Roy Choudhary, Sundararajan Padmanabhan, Joginder Jaswant Singh, Deepak Kapoor and Bikram Singh; retired Air Chief Marshals Nirmal Chandra Suri and Shashindra Pal Tyagi, and retired Admiral Madhvendera Singh. Rajnath Singh, Home Minister, instead of ordering inquiry into the police excesses as demanded by the former Chiefs of Staff, asks Bhim Sain Bassi, DG Delhi Police, to send an officer to meet veterans and apologize for police action on 14 August. MK Meena, Delhi Police officer mets veterans and makes public apology. But the letter seeking an inquiry into the assault by the Chiefs of staff is ignored. No inquiry is held into circumstances prompting the police assault and excesses committed against the veterans. Ex- Serviceman commits suicide over OROP An Ex-Serviceman Ram Kishan Grewalhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-army-jawan-commits-suicide- allegedly-over-orop/article9294455.ece committed suicide over delay in One Rank One Pension issue on 1 November 2016 consuming poison at Jantar-Mantar in New Delhi. Grewal has reportedly left a suicide note, stating that he was taking this extreme step for soldiers. Veterans response to police attack Ex-servicemen outraged by police assertion that they were considered a risk, and security threat, to the Independence day celebrations, retorted angrily \\"We served the country in protecting it and now we have become security threat.\\" Two days after the police assault, Colonel (Retd) Pushpender Singh (Ex-3 Grenadiers) and Havaldar (Retd) Major Singh (Ex-3 Sikh Light Infantry), same Regiment as Retired General Ved Malik, begin hunger strike-unto-death at Jantar Mantar, to protest police brutality, and delay in government implementation of OROP. A day later on 18 August 2015 Havildar Ashok Chauhan, Corps of signals, joins in the hunger strike. ==OROP Scheme== The Government in the face of mounting protest and resentment among veterans announced, in September 2015, that it would implement the new pension scheme, commonly referred to as One rank One Pension or OROP. Five months later in February 2016, it issued orders to implement the scheme. The scheme announced by the Government failed to satisfy the leaders of the protest movement, who vowed to take the government to court. ==Potential beneficiaries of OROP== Potential beneficiaries of OROP is about 2.6 million ex-servicemen, and 60,000 widows, including war widows, i.e., a combined total of 3.2 million, of whom about 86 percent are widows, JCOs, NCOs, and other ranks, about 14 percent are officers. Out of the estimated outlay on OROP of Rs 8400 crores about Rs 6200 Crores will be on account of Widows, JCOs, NCOs, and other ranks, and about 2200 for Officers. Subhash Bhamre, Minister of State for Defence, in November 2016, informed the Rajya Sabha that there are 20,63,529 pensioner beneficiaries of OROP, of whom 1429 have submitted complaints regarding OROP benefits. ==Defence pensions== Expenditure on Defense pensions, especially expenditure on pensions for the armed forces, as a result of the protracted OROP protest, gained salience. The government in order to counter the demands for OROP often cited increasing expenditure on armed forces pensions. In India defence pensions, i.e., pensions paid from defence services estimate, also includes pension bill for about 400,000 defence civilians, and Ministry of Finance personnel attached to MOD. The 7CPC which looked long and hard at the armed forces pension bill, did not pay similar attention to the expenditure on account of the growing pension bill for defence civilians and the police security apparatus. There was also no mention or acknowledgment of the growing expenditure on account on the grant of OROP, and NFU to the senior most officers, including those paid from the defense services estimate. In 2015–16 Defence pension bill was 54,500 crores of which about 36 percent was on account of defence civilians. According to Brig Deepak Sinha, a respected commentator on military affairs, \\"civilian pensions, despite catering to one- fifth the number of military pensioners, utilizes approximately 36 percent of defence pensions, and given our difficulties in ensuring employment, even populism suggests it is better to reduce civilians who cost five times more than to reduce the military\\". ==Chronology2014=== 17 February 2014 Finance Minister in the interim budget speech on 17 Feb 14 announces that Government has accepted the 'principle' of OROP for Defense Forces. The demand note was however never raised by the Ministry Of Defence. 26 February 14 Government issue Order to Implementation OROP. 27 February 2014 A K Antony, Defence Minister says that UPA will implement OROP by 1 April 2014. 24 April 2014 A K Antony constitutes a Joint Working Group (JWG), with CGDA, as chairperson (later promoted to Secretary & Financial Adviser in the MoD). Members include representatives from Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare, Defence/Finance, and Service HQ (Chairmen of the Army, Navy and Air Force Pay Commission Cells and a few officers). The first meeting of the JWG was convened on 2 May 2014 in the office of the CGDA. 9 June 2014 The President in a Statement to the joint session of parliament says Government has drafted National Commission for Ex-Servicemen Bill, 2015 in order to set up the National Commission for Ex-Servicemen. However, no funds have been allocated for setting up of the commission during the year 2014–15. 10 July 2014 Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister and Defence Minister, in his maiden Budget Speech in the parliament, says, \\"We reaffirm our commitment to our brave soldiers. A policy of 'One Rank One Pension' has been adopted by the Government to address the pension disparities. We propose to set aside a further sum of 1,000 crore to meet this year's requirement\\" 14 August 2014 Maj Gen (Retd) Satbir Singh, SM, Chairman IESM, writes to Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, in response to his statement in Leh on 12 Aug 2014 stating that budget caters for the demand of OROP. The letter says the statement is \\"erroneous\\", and not in sync with Draft Govt Letter (DGL) prepared by Service HQs in the meetings in Feb and March, 2014, in which the forecast for OROP was 5000 crore, and not 1500 crore earmarked in the budget. The letter recalls that in a meeting chaired by Mr. AK Antony, former Defence Minister on 26 Feb 2014, OROP definition was approved and OROP was to be implemented with effect from 1 Apr 2014. The letter reminds the PM that \\"It has been six months since the OROP was approved\\". 20 August 2014 Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Admiral Robin Dhowan and General Dalbir Singh Suhag, briefed A K Mathur, Justice (retd), the chairman 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC), on the pay and pension \\"anomalies\\" caused by the 6 CPC. 23 October 2014 Narendra Modi, on Diwali Day, during a well publicized visit to army formation in Siachen Glacier, told soldiers \\"It was in my destiny that One rank One pension has been fulfilled\\".

The OROP order excludes all future Armed Forces retirees who take premature retirement from OROP entitlement. 9 November 2015 The ex servicemen announce that they will start returning their medals on 10–11 November, across the country, to District Magistrates, who have been informed to collect the medals, Group Captain VK Gandhi (retd), the general secretary of Indian Ex-servicemen Movement (IESM), said. In Delhi, the medals will be returned outside Terminal 1 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). The protesting ex-servicemen also met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to brief him about the government notification on OROP. Kejriwal informed Group Captain VK Gandhi (retd). 10 November 2015 Manohar Parrikar, denounces Ex-servicemen decision to return medals; and calls protesting ex- servicemen emotional, and disgruntled. 11 November 2015 Military veterans, on Diwali, which the veterans call a ‘Black Diwali’, took out a protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan, to meet with the President. The marchers were intercepted by Delhi Police near Rail Bhavan. 13 November 2015 Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Chief Minister, visited ex-servicemen protesting at Jantar Mantar. He urged the government \\"to immediately accept the demands of the veterans\\". 16 November 2015 Brig Harwant Singh (retd), representative of United Front of Ex- servicemen, says the OROP movement is not about money, but about self-respect and izzat. 19 November 2015 7th Pay Commission, headed by Justice A K Mathur, in its 900-page report, recommends OROP, without calling it one-rank-one- pension (OROP), for all central government employees, including para-military personnel as well defence civilians who have retired before 1 January 2016. The recommendations affect 47 lakh central government employees and 52 lakh pensioners:increase in pay will be 16 per cent, allowances 63 per cent and pension 24 per cent. Seventh Central Pay Commission (7CPC), in its consideration of one rank one pay, notes that France, China, and Germany have pension schemes for the armed forces, much like India. The US and UK, with a small variation, have a similar scheme, called a \\"defined benefit scheme\\". On the contentious issue of Non - Functional Upgradation, there was disagreement between the chairman of 7CPC and the members of the commission. Chairman \\"felt that NFU should be allowed to continue since it has existed for the last 10 years and is being availed by all the Organised Group ‘A’ Services\\", and that it \\"should be extended to the officers of the Defence forces and CAPFs\\". Vivek Rae, IAS, and Dr. Rathin Roy, Members, Seventh CPC, disagreed. They felt that NFU till SAG and HAG level, granted to Organised Group ‘A’ Services, should be withdrawn, and did not support extension of \\"NFU to Defence Forces and CAPFs, including ICG\\". 2 December 2015 General (Retd) VK Singh, former Chief of army Staff and Union Minister, who has been involved in Government's 'back-channel' overtures with veterans, according to Ex-servicemen sources, who had met Manohar Parrikar, Defence Minister, on 2 December, will mediate between government and protesting ex-servicemen, on 'One Rank One Pension' scheme. In the meanwhile the veterans continue to examine the option of seeking legal redress in the supreme court, and prepare for the rally scheduled for on 13 December. 4 December 2015 Rao Inderjit Singh, by Minister of State for Defence, confirmed that Government will appoint a \\"Judicial Committee to look into anomalies\\" including issues concerning \\"methodology for fixation of pension, periodicity of its revision, coverage of future PMR cases\\" raised by veterans. Deepender Hooda, Congress MP, criticizing BJP Government failure to implement full OROP, says, Congress supports the demands of the veterans, including annual review of OROP instead of 5 year review as notified by the BJP Government; and OROP for those who take premature retirement. The Congress Party, he said, will take the OROP issue forward in parliament by seeking funds for the implementation of OROP. 7 December 2015 United Front of Ex- Servicemen (UFESM), suggests Justice R M Lodha name for chair of the one-man judicial commission to look into the concerns of the veterans. 14 December 2015 Department of Ex Servicemen issues notification on appointment of Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, as the one- man judicial commission to look into the implementation of the one rank one pension scheme. The terms of reference for the committee include measures for the removal of anomalies that may arise in the implementation of the OROP as notified by the government on 7 November 2015; measures for the removal of anomalies that may arise out of inter-services issues of the three forces due to its implementation; and implications on service matters. 16 December 2015 UFESM, to mark victory on the Indian Armed Forces in the 1971 war, and pay Homage to 'Martyrs of Independent India', held a flag raising ceremony at India Gate. The event was attended by large number of veterans. Wreaths were laid by several veterans, at Amar Jawan Jyoti, including Lt Col Inderjit Singh, Chairman All India Ex-Services Welfare Association, Maj Gen Satbir Singh, SM, Vice Chairman IESM, and Col Anil Kaul VrC . After the event UFESM issued a press release in which it deplored the delay in establishing a war memorial, the failure of the government to commemorate the victory in the 1971 War, and that of all the civilians gathered at India gate none new of the historic significance of 16 December or the 1971 war. To commemorate the historic victory, and the martyrs who scarified their lives, UFESM urged the government to declare 16 December a national holiday. 23 December 2015 General Dalbir Suhag, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS); Admiral Robin Dhowan, Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS); and Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), in a joint memorandum to the Manohar Parrikar, defence minister, have urged the defence Minister to appoint an expert committee, with members from the armed forces, to examine and reconcile the pay, pension, allowances, and status anomalies exacerbated by 7CPC report, which had no representation from the armed Forces. The Pay Commission report after it is submitted to the Government is processed by a group of bureaucrats, called a 'Committee of secretaries', which routinely endorses the report, as it did after 3, 4, 5 and 6 CPC. This process has not worked well in the past, primarily because of the conflict of interest, as the \\" Committee of secretaries\\" are direct beneficiaries from their examination and recommendation on the implementation of the pay commission reports. For instance, after the 6CPC, the 'committee of secretaries' endorsed and recommended OROP for themselves, and reward all civil servants with of Non Functional Upgrade (NFU), but strongly objected to these benefits being extended to the armed Forces. Similarly the reduction in Pensions of the Armed Forces, after the 3CPC, and imposition of 'rank pay', after 4 CPC, according armed forces generals, depressed military pay, pension, and status, especially so relative to the Indian Police Service. The memorandum by the three service chiefs seeking military representation in the review committee when viewed against this background is not as provocative as the Indian express has sought to make it out. ===2016=== 15 January 2016 Veterans participating in an Army Day event in Dehradun reiterated their demands for implementation of full and agreed to \\"one rank, one post\\" (OROP). \\"It is sad for everyone that even now when Parliament has approved OROP, some unnecessary spokes have been put in its implementation,\\" said Brig (retd) K G Behl, president of Dehradun Ex-servicemen League. 17 January 2016 About 200 veterans including Major General Satbir Singh, protested outside 2, Krishna Menon, Marg, New Delhi, the official residence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The protesters highlight Jaitley's failure to take heed of their concerns, and breaking his promise given to them on 3 January that he would speak with Manohar Parrikar, Defence Minister, and 'get back' within a week on status of OROP issues that need to be resolved. Group Captain (retd) VK Gandhi. The protest ended late in the evening, after a meeting with Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Finance. Disappointed veterans returned to Jantar Mantar, where they have been protesting since 14 June 2015. 18 January 2016 Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Finance, met veterans briefly. Sinha, according to Col. Anil Kaul (retd), a spokesperson for the Indian Ex- Servicemen's Movement, will meet with Ex servicemen again on 20 January. 21 January 2016 As follow up on the meeting with Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Finance, on 16 January, and on his prompting, Lt Gen Balbir Singh, President IESL, Lt Col Inderjit Singh, Chairman AIEWA and Maj Gen Satbir Singh, Chairman IESM & Adviser UFESM (JM), send a joint letter, to ' people who matter' urging them to address the anomalies in 7 November 15 notification on implementation of OROP. The letter titled 'Urgent Need to Rectify Anomalies in OROP in Govt notification dated 7 Nov 15\\", which has the 'approval of 200 veteran organization', is addressed to Manohar Parrikar, Raksha Mantri, Mr Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister, Jayant Sinha, Minister of State, Finance, General Dalbir Singh, Chief of Army Staff, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Chief of the Air Staff & Chairman Chiefs of Staffs Committee (CoSC), and Admiral RK Dhowan, Chief of Naval Staff. 26 January 2016 This year in the Republic Day March Past in Delhi, in a break from a venerable tradition, the Ministry of Defence, the organizers of the event, decided to exclude the veterans contingent from the march past. The decision to exclude the veterans from the march past and replace it with a tacky tableau advertising implementation of OROP was, it would appear, made by Manohar Parrikar, the Defense Minister, and Defence Ministry Officials including the G.Mohan Kumar, Defence secretary, and Prabhu Dayal Meena, Secretary Department of Ex-Serviceman Welfare(DESW). 3 February 2016 A Ministry of Defence press release claimed that it has fulfilled OROP, a 'demand of the Defence Forces personnel' that had been pending for '42 years'. The detailed letter on the implementation of OROP, including table for calculation of pension was issued by Department of Ex Servicemen. 4 February 2016 Colonel Anil Kaul (Retd), spokesperson for the Indian Ex servicemen, denounced the BJP Governments claims on OROP implementation, saying \\"OROP tables short-change widows, reservists, battle casualties, havildars, subedars and subedar majors. The Jantar Mantar protest will continue and legal options will be exercised\\". Former Army Chief General Ved Prakash Malik, and Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Ajay Prasad, in a panel discussion on TV, argued in favor of OROP even for those who opt to take that 'pre-mature retirement (PMR) for what ever reason, to keep the armed forces young. Thapar, Karan. http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/has-the-government- delivered-orop-as-it-was-promised/1/589023.html 2 March 2016 Expenditure on pay and allowances for 3.5 million central government employees in the budget estimates of 2016-17 has increased by 23.5 percent. The details are tabulated below. The increase is attributed to large increase in allowances because of 7CPC recommendations, including in housing allowance, which is now 24 percent of the basic pay. {  - ! Year !! Allocation for pay in crores of Rs!! Allocation for allowances in crores of Rs !! total in crores of Rs !! comments -  2015-16  62,230 29,300  1,18,248  -  2016-17  90,598  88,932  1,83,935  pay bill increased by Rs 28,300 crore(16%), and allowances bill by Rs 37,000 crore (63%) } 10 March On 10 March, late in the evening, a squad of five plain-clothes men from the Haryana Police, led by thick set man who posed as flower delivery man, forced their way into the house of Wing Commander Sharma,75, former IAF officer and fighter pilot, and veteran of 1965 war and 1971 War, and arrested him. The Wing Commander, a prominent leader of the OROP movement, was arrested in front of his wife and family. The plainclothesmen, according to the officer's wife offered no explanation, or reason. The BJP Government in Haryana, or YP Singhal, Director General of Haryana Police, under whose orders the police action was conducted, did not explain the reason for deploying plainclothesmen in the raid against the officer or conducting it late in the evening, under false pretense, in a menacing manner. The raid and the arrest was made following an old complaint alleging financial wrongdoing by IESM leadership by Lt Gen Raj Kadyan, formerly Rajputana Rifles, former Chairman of the IESM, considered close to the present government. The complaint also named Maj General Satbir Singh, the present head of the IESM, and Group Captain VK Gandhi, both of who secured anticipatory bail from the Chandigarh high court. 25 March Maj Gen Satbir Singh,(Retd), Chairman Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement (IESM), writes to L.Narasimha Reddy, Retired Chief Justice of Patna High Court and head of the commission on OROP scheme, and the Defence Minister, on \\"Urgent Need to Rectify Anomalies in OROP\\". The letter draws attention to Government's executive order dated 26 Feb 14 for the implementation of OROP, and the notification issued on 7 November 2015. The letter examines five salient anomalies in the OROP scheme 2015 as follows: (1) Fixation of pension as per calendar year 2013 would result in past retirees getting less pension of one increment than the soldier retiring today. This will completely destroy definition of OROP approved by two Parliaments and will also result in loss of one increment across the board for past pensioners in perpetuity. (2) Fixing pension as mean of Min and Max pension of 2013 would result in more anomalies wherein same ranks with same length of service will draw two or more different pensions thus violating the very principle of OROP. (3) OROP has been approved in budget of 2014-15 by two parliaments. As per norms of Government, all proposals approved in budget are applicable from 1st April of that FY. In the case of OROP, the Govt had issued specific orders to its applicability wef 1st April 14. Hence implementation date for OROP from 1st July will be against the Parliament approval. Changing the date would result in loss of 3 months emoluments for OROP across the board. However, if OROP implementation date is to be kept as 1st July, then the base pension should also be accepted as per the PPOs of July 2014. (4) Pension equalisation every five year will result in a senior rank soldier drawing lesser pension than a junior rank soldier for five years thus OROP definition will be violated for five years. This will also result in permanent violation of definition as fresh cases will come up every year. (5) There are numerous errors in the constitution of Tables. How this Table have been made is not known. The fact is that no senior rank defence personnel should ever draw less pension their junior persons. There are numerous instances in the Tables where in the senior rank and senior in service have been shown to draw less pension then his junior. The tables need to be worked out afresh after all anomalies have been removed. The most appropriate method to construct Tables would be to base these tables on live data. The PPOs of defence personnel who retired in 2013 would removal that a Sepoy with 15 years of service should get pension of approx Rs 7200 per month where as in the Tables, pension has been mentioned as Rs 6665/-. This does not satisfy the approved OROP definition. There are minimum such examples. Nb Subedar of ‘Y’ group has been shown to get less than X Gp Havildar this making a senior rank defence, personal gets less than junior rank. Nb Sub TA is shown getting more pension then Regular Nb Sub. The three Service HQs pay cells must be involved in making this Table afresh. These anomalies will result in lesser pensions to widows, soldiers, NCOs and JCOs than what will be due to them on approval of OROP. This will result in veterans not getting OROP as per approved definition and will create much discontent across all ranks. There is a need to have a relook at the pensions of Hon Nb Subedars, Majors and Lt Cols. a) Some Havildars are granted rank of Hon Naib Subedar in view of their exemplary service. These soldiers are not granted pension of Naib Subedar thus making the Hon rank just ceremonial. Hon Naib Subedars should get pension of a Naib Subedar rather than that of a Havildar. Similarly, this must be accepted as a principle and it should be applicable to all Hon ranks in case of NCOs and JCOs. b) Moreover no officer is retiring in Major rank now. In the past, officers were promoted to Major rank after completing 13 yrs of service whereas present officers are getting promotion of Lt Col in 13 yrs. It will be justified to grant all pensioners of the rank of Major, minimum pension of Lt Col as they cannot be compared to present retirees as officers are not retiring as Majors any more. Number of such affected officers is not more than 800 and will not cause heavy burden to Govt. c) Similarly, all pre-2004 retiree Lt Cols should get the minimum pension of full Col. Presently all officers retire in the rank of Colonel hence all Lt Col equivalents should be granted min pension of Colonels. The above anomalies/discrepancies are being brought before you for resolution please. Finance Minister in the interim budget speech on 17 Feb 14 announces that Government has accepted the 'principle' of OROP for Defence forces. This was followed by issue of Implementation order on 26 Feb 14. The demand note was however never raised by the Ministry Of Defence. 28 March A delegation of Civil Service officers representing the \\"Confederation of Civil Service Associations\\" submitted a memorandum on \\"their long standing grievance of discrimination vis-a-vis certain other All-India Services\\" to Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State MoS, in Prime Ministers Office (PMO), and minister in-charge of Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions. The \\"Confederation of Civil Service Associations\\" in their memorandum, claiming \\"that the majority view in the 7th CPC was in favour of changing the status-quo on the issue of pay disparity\\" demanded \\"parity\\" with \\"other services\\". The memorandum noted that the \\"main cause of resentment among the non-IAS Civil Service Officers was that all the senior level posts covering majority of Departments, be it technical or administrative, are today manned by IAS Officers. The Civil service Association which includes Defence Civilian services, demanded : [a] \\"equitable treatment ...so that the gap between the IAS and other Services does not widen and lead to.. chaotic situation; [b] Pay- disparity be removed altogether; and [c] the \\"Committee of Secretaries\\" to examine the report of the 7th CPC, be reconstituted to \\"represent all different sections of stakeholders\\" so that it may function with \\"neutrality\\" 29 March Parrikar, tells India Today, that \\"The Seventh Pay Commission are in the form of recommendations. I do not think they (recommendations) will remain. I do not consider them as finalities. I have flagged them and will flag them properly at the right level\\". 3 April At Jantar Mantar, on 3 April, at a well attended gathering veterans protested against government failure to implement OROP, and address other izzat issues, including long pending anomalies in pay and pension of armed forces. Many veterans urged veterans to contest elections to have their voice properly heard. Group Captain V.K. Gandhi (retd), general secretary of the Indian Ex Servicemen Movement said, \\"We have given a call to ex-servicemen to contest elections to State Assemblies, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. We are a six-crore vote bank and we should have our own representatives to achieve our demands\\". He added that if the veterans remained united, they \\"would be able to fill at least 25 per cent seats in each Assembly and about 30 MPs in the Lok Sabha.\\" While denying that United Front of Ex-Servicemen Movement (UFESM) was thinking of contesting polls, he said, \\"If someone comes to us and if they have good credentials we will support them.\\" 6 April The Cabinet gave its ex-post facto approval for implementation order dated OROP order of 7 November 2015 on One Rank One Pension (OROP). The cabinet decision reiterates that \\"Personnel who opt to get discharged henceforth on their own request under Rule 13(3) 1(i)(b), 13(3) 1(iv) or Rule 16B of the Army Rule. 1954 or equivalent Navy or Air Force Rules will not be entitled to the benefits of OROP. \\", and that \\"In future, the pension would be re-fixed every 5 year\\". \\"Financial implications on account of grant of OROP including Pre- Matured Retirees (PMR) cases\\" according to press Information note \\" would be Rs. 10925.11 crore for payment of arrears and the recurring annual financial implication would be Rs. 7488.7 crore. Till 31st March, 2015. 91 lakh pensioners have been given the first instalment of OROP, which amounts to Rs. 2,861 crore. Information is being gathered for processing on priority basis, the cases of 1.15 lakh pensioners after filling in the gaps of information such as the length of service being assessed, etc.\\" 21 April 2016 Sashi Tharoor, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, and former minister in UPA Government, in an article in The quint, commenting on the policy of the government on the declining pay, pensions, and protocol status, of the armed forces, affirmed that the dignity of the Indian armed forces has been eroded by \\"Petty slights, ranging from deliberately downgrading the military in protocol terms, to persistent actions to lower the status and compensation of our military personnel\\", and that the consequences of this policy of demeaning the armed forces \\" will inevitably be suffered by all\\". Blaming the Pay Commission and Government for being \\"blind\\" to the \\"enduring sacrifice\\" of the Armed Forces, he concludes that \\"We have short-changed the remuneration of our armed servicemen\\". He found it hard to understand the reason for the Government and pay commission to equate police officers[ and defence civilians] with 12 years of service, designated as deputy inspector general (DIG) of the police, with Brigadiers, for pay and protocol. He wonders, in disbelief, \\"What could possibly justify such a disparity?\\" Commenting on disability pensions recommended by the 7 Pay Commission, he notes that whereas a JCO and their equivalents in the air-force and the navy, will be given Rs 12,000 as pension, while his civilian counterpart, for the same level of disability, will receive a pension twice that amount (Rs 27,690). 28 April 2016 Ram Jethmalani, Senior Supreme Court lawyer, while addressing armed forces veterans, on 320th day of their protest at Jantar Mantar, said, \\"he will lead their legal battle in the apex court\\" on a Pro bono basis. Major General (retd) Satbir Singh, who was present on the occasion said, \\"case will be filed in Supreme Court in the next 3-4 days\\". He added that four more cases have been filed in the armed forces tribunal, on \\" rulings for Jawans, war widows, arrears since 2006, payments for honorary ranks, rounding off of disability pension, and payments of reservists\\". 15 June 2016 The six-month tenure of the one man judicial commission on One Rank One Pension (OROP) which ended on 15 June, was given an extension of six months, by the Government. In the wake of the extension to the commission headed Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, former Chief Justice of Patna High Court, veterans Maj Gen Satbir Singh, Chairman of the Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement, Hon Lt K Pande Member and Wing Commander CK Sharma, met Manohar Parrikar, Defence Minister, to urge him to ensure that the 'four deviations in the implementation order' on OROP are addressed. Mr Parrikar, according to media reports, assured the veteran delegation that their concerns will be addressed; and that the recommendations of seventh pay commission would be applicable to all ex-servicemen 3 August 2016 Maj. Gen. Satbir Singh (retd), Chairman of the Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement, on 3 August, wrote to Mr. Parrikar and Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, and head of the one-man judicial commission of constituted in December last year, conveying the \\"anguish and concern\\" of exservicemen on the \\"neglect of defence personnel\\" and \\"betrayal\\" by the government. He told the Hindu newspaper that the Defence Ministry did not forward representation by exservicemen to the one-man Committee despite \\"assurances given by Mr. Parrikar on March 14, 2016 during a meeting of representatives of ex-servicemen\\". Maj. Gen. Satbir Singh in the letter to the Defence Minister noted that \\"The mandate given to One-Man Committee is to consider those questions/issues which have been referred to it by the Defence Ministry. This is a serious breach of trust reposed in the system\\". The letter is in the wake of uncertainty caused by Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister, statement in Parliament that there was no \\"standardised definition\\" of OROP. 7 August 2016 General VP Malik, Former Chief of Army Staff, in a panel discussion on the 7th Pay Commission(7CPC) confirmed that 18 former heads of the Armed Forces, including himself, had written to Narendra Modi the Prime Minister, conveying their disquiet on the impact of the recommendations of the 7CPC on the Indian armed forces. Modi, Malik confirmed, ignored the letter by the 18 former heads of Armed Forces. Malik said that the PM has not replied to the letter by the Chiefs of staff and that the PM has taken the retired chiefs for granted. General Malik said that the recommendation of 7 CPC, which amounted to 'blatant discrimination' had caused a strong sense of 'despondency' and feeling of 'resignation' in the armed forces. The decision by the Government to create two pay and promotion 'matrixes, in the wake of the 7 CPC, one for the armed forces and another, far more indulgent one, for the civil services, Police, and security bureaucracy, he said, will have several negative outcomes: it will give the civil services including the police services officers six increments in their first 13 years of service, in comparison to just one to the armed forces; the asymmetrical pay, promotion, and status 'matrix' will, he argued, aggravate the existing 'equations' and adversely impact the already fraught civil-military relations. He said he was not convinced with the reasons given by the pay commission, that the armed forces task were any less complex than that of the police or the forest department which have been favored by the BJP Government with an indulgent pay and promotion package. 12 August 2016 A committee of Jammu and Kashmir Ex Services League (JKESL) presided over by Maj Gen Goverdhan Singh Jamwal, ex-MLC, decides, in Jammu, on submitting a memorandum to Justice Reddy Commission on 19 Aug 2016 stating that OROP should be implemented without dilution, i.e., \\"All retirees in the same rank and with same length of service should get the same pension irrespective of the date of retirement; and the benefits of future increases should automatically pass on to all such retirees\\". Other who participated in the committee's deliberations were: Brig Harcharan Singh, Director Rajya Sainik Board ; Brig RL Sharma former Station Commander Jammu; Brig Anil Gupta Former Director J&K; NCC; Col K S Jamwal, Jt Chairman JKESL; Col Virendra K Sahi, VrC Director War Decorated India for J&K;, Col Rajinder Singh, Gen Secy; Lt Col DS Salaria Treasurer JKESL, Lt Col KS Samyal OIC Pension Cell, Lt Col MS Jamwal and Maj JS Baloria Finance Secretary JKESL. 26 October 2016 Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, retired Chief Justice of Patna High Court, submits his report on the anomalies in the implementation of OROP to the MOD. 11 November 2016 Subhash Bhamre, Minister of State for Defence, in a written reply to question by Alok Sanjar informed Lokha Sabha that Financial year 2016–17, a sum of Rs. 12456 crore has been provided for expected expenditure on account of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and that out 20,63,529 pensioner beneficiaries, 1,27,561 Defence Pensioners/Family Pensioners are yet to get the benefits of OROP. 19 November 2016 Maj Gen (retd) Satbir Singh, while attending a workshop organised by the Uttarakhand Ex-Servicemen League in Dehradun says that BJP Government has dishonored ex servicemen by denying them OROP. He called the OROP implemented by the BJP Government \\"disabled OROP\\". Maj Gen Satbir called on ex-servicemen to participate in the elections in Uttarkhand and Punjab and \\" tilt the scale\\". Group Captain PK Gandhi (retd), another OROP leader, said \\"ex- servicemen were instrumental in the BJP coming to power at the Centre and they also have the power to dislodge it\\". Ex-servicemen rallies are planned in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab to appeal to ex servicemen to \\"vote for candidates who work in their favour\\". The workshop was attended among others by Lt Gen GS Negi (retd) and Lt Col SC Sharma (retd). 22 November 2016 Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha stated that Rs. 82,332.66 crore was provided in BE 2016-17 towards payment of Defence Pensions. This included an amount of Rs. 12,456 crore towards implementation of One Rank One Pension Scheme, which takes effect from 1 July 2014. Subhash Bhamre, Minister of State for Defence, in response to question by PL Punia and Pramod Tiwari informed the Rajya Sabha that Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, retired Chief Justice of Patna High Court, who was to look into anomalies in the implementation of OROP submitted his report on 26 October 2016. This report is under examination.

Details of the allocation and utilization of funds under OROP are as under: {  Financial Year Allocation under OROP Utilization on account of arrears of OROP - 2015-16 No separate allocation made under OROP Rs.3000 crores (approx.) - 2016-17 Rs.12456 crores Rs.3020.97 crores (as on 12.11.2016) } Referring to Subedar Ram Kishan Grewal, retired, who committed suicide at Delhi on 1 November 2016, over the delay in getting his pension dues, the minister informed that he was drawing pension of Rs.22,608 per month. He was however entitled to revised pension under OROP of Rs.25,634 per month. The arrears amounting to Rs.53,978, he confirmed, was credited to Bank Account- Subedar Ram Kishan Grewal on 8 November 2016. 29 November 2016 Subhash Bhamre, Minister of State for Defence, in a written reply to D Raja informed the Rajya Sabha that the \\"United Front Movement of Ex-Servicemen is continuing their 'protest action' since 14th June 2015 for their demands on OROP.\\" The reply says that Government has accepted the demands of Ex- Servicemen associations to implement OROP, and pay arrears starting form 1 July 2014, and provide coverage to Premature Retirees (PMR) cases up to 7 November 2015.

Users create guides on the site, where community members can comment on, rate, and share guides. It was created by Daniel Raffel and Steve Krulewitz, launching in March 2011. Snapguide is committed to helping people easily share knowledge, tips and tricks, and DIY projects with people who share similar interests. ==History== In 2010, while following the Tartine Country Loaf bread recipe, Raffel realized there wasn't an app that let users create step-by-step how to guides in realtime from their mobile devices. After working together at Songbird, Raffel & Krulewitz decided to work on the idea together. They released the first version of their iOS app in March 2011. Snapguide employs a full-time staff of designers and engineers. They received $10 million in funding as of 2014, from Atlas Venture, Index Ventures, SV Angel, Crunch Fund and Slow Ventures among others. The original content focused mostly on sharing food recipes. The content has expanded to include a larger array of categories including Tech, Lifestyle, Beauty, Arts & Crafts, and Life Hacks. In June 2015, Lifestyle website Brit + Co acquired Snapguide to bolster DIY empire. While the website, Facebook and Twitter pages are still running, there is no staff interacting with users. The site will probably remain on autopilot until May 30, 2021 when the registry expires. ==Community== Once signed in, users can follow each other, comment on, like, publish, share and request guides. they can also send personal messages to each other. ==Users== Many of Snapguide's users are individuals, ages 18–34, and are interested in DIY and maker content. Brands also use Snapguide, both as a marketing channel to get in front of their audience, and as a platform to help share unique features of their products with their users. ==In the Press== Snapguide has been featured on CNN, Mashable, Techcrunch, The Washington Post, VentureBeat, Lifehacker, CNET, The New York Times, Wired, USA Today, Uncrate, AdWeek, GigaOm, All Things Digital, and Digital Trends among others. ==Features== As of February 2014, the iOS app has a number of key features. A user can view guides made by other users in a step-by-step manner. \\"Profile\\" is where they can create and see guides they've already published. Snapguide Editors showcase the top and trending content in \\"Explore.\\" Users can also browse guides in categories in \\"Topics.\\" Users can ask the community to create guides on particular topics in \\"Requests\\" and browse other popular requests. Once requests are fulfilled, anyone who likes that request is notified. Users monitor the activity of their guides and of users they follow in \\"Activity.\\" When creating a guide, users select a title, and then use a combination of photos, videos, and text to help explain how to do what they're teaching, in a clear and understandable step-by-step format. Users can easily upload photos they've taken with their iPhones (or with DSLRs if they use the web editor from a desktop computer). The web editor went live in November 2013, to allow users to create a guide on the web. They launched a contest feature in December 2013. Each contest is on a particular theme, and users submit relevant guides to win a variety of prizes. At the end of the contest timeline, judges select winners. Contests are normally sponsored by a partner who promotes the creation of UGC. Fully functioning embeds launched in February 2014. Users can customize color, shape, and size of the iframe, giving embedded guides a native viewing experience from within 3rd party websites. ==References * Category:How-to websites Category:American social networking websites ","title":"Snapguide"},{"id":"42050635","text":"Stardust Planet (Formerly known as 3B junior) is a department of the third section of the Japanese entertainment company Stardust Promotion specialising in idols.

She lost consciousness and fell into a coma ( which was a result of the air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain), which was a result of inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference in order to announce that the member had been taken to hospital and, though she had not yet recovered consciousness, was showing signs of rehabilitation such as eye movement and mobility of her limbs. Following this, police launched an investigation into the neglected safety measures. The girl has since returned to school, although no statement has been made as to whether after-effects remain. == References  External links == * * Category:Stardust Promotion artists Category:Japanese girl groups Category:Japanese idol groups ","title":"Stardust Planet"},{"id":"42050656","text":"Versar, Inc. is a project management company providing technical and management support to government and companies in the world.

The squadron was established on 1 November 1970 at NAS Memphis, Tennessee, where it was based for its entire life. It was disestablished on 30 September 1994, after 24 years of service. The squadron's nickname was the Golden Hawks, also unofficially called the Thunder Chickens. Elements of the squadron made 23 major overseas deployments. ==Operational history== P-3A in November 1982 *1 Nov 1970: VP-67 was established at NAS Memphis, as a land-based patrol squadron flying the SP-2H Neptune. The squadron was formed in 1970 from the assets of VP-17M1, VP-60M2, and VP- 68M3, which had been based at NAS Olathe, Kansas, and NAS Memphis. The new squadron came under the operational and administrative control of the Commander, Naval Air Reserve Forces, Pacific and Commander, Fleet Air Reserve Wings, Pacific. VP-66 was established as a result of a major reorganization of Naval Air Reserves that took place in 1970. Under the Reserve Force Squadron concept 12 land-based Naval Reserve patrol squadrons were formed and structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. The reorganization plan was known as the 12/2/1 concept. There were 12 VP squadrons assigned to two major commands, COMFAIRESWINGLANT and COMFAIRESWINGPAC. These two major commands came under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve. *August 1973: VP-67 deployed to NAS Barber's Point, Hawaii for two weeks operational training. *July 1974: VP-67 deployed to Naval Air Reserve Unit (NARU), Point Mugu, California, for two weeks of intensive ground and air training in SP-2H operation and maintenance. *September 1975: The squadron sent a detachment of three SP-2H aircraft to Venezuela to participate in operation HALCON VISTA with elements of the Venezuela Armed Forces. *20 Oct - 2 Nov 1975: The squadron deployed to NAS Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico for active duty operational training. *1976: Active duty training was performed by the squadron at NARU Memphis, Tenn., with detachments at NAS Bermuda and NAS Key West, Florida. *July 1977: The squadron’s SP-2H aircraft were turned in for new P-3A Orion replacements. While transition training on the P-3A was taking place, VP-67 was tasked with providing transition training to Argentine Navy pilots whose squadrons were receiving the SP-2H. Transition training for all of the squadron’s aircrews was completed by July 1979. *16 July–15 August 1979: Upon completion of transition to the P-3A, VP-67 deployed for its ADT to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington; NAS Moffett Field, California; and NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii. *May 1980: VP-67 deployed for the first time in the P-3A Orion to Kadena AFB, Okinawa. Numerous Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises were conducted in conjunction with elements of the 7th Fleet, regular Navy patrol squadrons, and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. On 15 May 1980, the squadron completed 25,000 accident-free flight hours. *6 Jun - 5 Jul 1981: VP-67 deployed in the P-3A Orion to NAS Cubi Point, PI and integrated into Task Force 72 in support of CTF 72 operational commitments. The squadron smoothly executed a demanding schedule of operational missions, augmentation flights, refugee operations, CAST and ready alert duties. Its outstanding performance resulted in highly complementary \\"WELL DONES\\" from CTF 72, ComPatWingsPAC and ComResPatWingsPAC. qa *29 May - 27 Jun 1982: The squadron deployed from NAS Memphis to NAS Cubi Point, PI. Numerous ASM exercises were conducted in conjunction with elements of the 7th Fleet, active duty Navy patrol squadrons and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. *22 January 1990: The squadron’s official complement of aircraft was changed from nine P-3B MOD aircraft to eight aircraft. *1992: VP-67 conducted split deployments during 1992, with a three crew detachment to Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska, 26 February to 26 March; a two crew detachment to Goose Bay, Newfoundland, 13 to 21 August; and a three crew detachment to NAS Adak, Alaska, 24 April to 26 May. Despite the difficulties in conducting deployments at such a variety of sites, the squadron never missed a sortie due to maintenance or bad weather. *30 September 1994: VP-67 was disestablished at NAS Memphis. ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * SP-2H Neptune – November 1970 * P-3A Orion – July 1977 * P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Orion – March 1985 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-67"},{"id":"42050750","text":"FleetCor Technologies, Inc. or FLEETCOR provides fuel cards and workforce payment products and services.

Hampton and William S. Godbe in 1853. The pair operated a ferry until 1859 when they built a bridge, replacing it in 1866. At about the same time they built a house, which also served as a hotel, and a barn. The bridge was again replaced in 1892, and superseded by a bridge on Utah State Route 30. With The main building is a two-story red-tinted limestone structure. The hotel originally boasted ten rooms and an indoor privy. There were eight rooms on the ground floor, including a living area, dining room, kitchen and bedrooms. The large existing porch was added in 1918. The house is unusual as one of only four known historic Saltbox-style buildings in Utah. The other three are the Lauritz Smith House (NRHP-listed) in Draper, the William D. Skeen House (NRHP-listed) in Plain City, and the Joseph Beesley House in Provo (which has been significantly modified).See sourcing in linked other three articles As can be seen in photos accompanying the NRHP nomination, the house's rear is extended out under a long shed roof.

He played in leagues in the United States, Cyprus, Argentina, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Romania. Blackshear is best known for his collegiate career in the United States, however, where he was a standout player for Marshall University in 2001–02 and 2002–03. He then declared for the 2003 NBA draft as an early entry candidate upon the conclusion of his junior season, but after going undrafted he began his international career. ==College career== Blackshear did not graduate high school until age 20. He had committed to play basketball for Clemson University, but since he did not meet NCAA eligibility requirements, he spent one additional prep year at Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia. After eight games playing for the Academy, Blackshear was kicked off due to repeatedly violating team rules. He returned home, but after more complications with Clemson, Blackshear instead enrolled at Temple University to play for John Chaney. Chaney and Blackshear did not get along, and after playing in just 10 games, he left the school. Two months later he found himself enrolled at Marshall University. Blackshear matured at Marshall and played successfully for the Thundering Herd during his sophomore and junior seasons. In just two years at the school he scored exactly 1,000 points, with season averages of 19.6 and 20.3 points per game, respectively. Known as an accurate and prolific shooter, Blackshear made 189 three-point field goals, good for fourth most in Marshall history at the time of his graduation. He once tied an NCAA record by making 11 consecutive three-point attempts in a game and finished with the second-most made of all-time (14). Both feats occurred in a game against Akron on March 1, 2002. ==Professional career== For a time during Blackshear's junior year in college he was projected to be a first round draft pick in the 2003 NBA draft, but this ultimately turned out to be a false project since he did not get chosen at all that year. His professional career began in the summer of 2004 in Venezuela. He then played in Argentina for Estudiantes Olavarria, then finished the rest of the 2004–05 season with the Huntsville Flight in the NBA Development League. Blackshear split the 2005–06 season between EKA AEL Limassol in Cyprus and the D-League's Tulsa 66ers. After summer 2006 in which he played for Marineros de Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, Blackshear headed to Romania for the 2006–07 with CSU Atlassib Sibiu. His final two seasons of professional basketball included another stint in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Mexico before last playing in 2009. ==See also== *List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 12 or more 3-point field goals in a game ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Argentina Category:American expatriate basketball people in Cyprus Category:American expatriate basketball people in the Dominican Republic Category:American expatriate basketball people in Mexico Category:American expatriate basketball people in Romania Category:American expatriate basketball people in Venezuela Category:Basketball players from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Fuerza Regia players Category:Huntsville Flight players Category:Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball players Category:People from Camilla, Georgia Category:Shooting guards Category:Temple Owls men's basketball players Category:Tulsa 66ers players Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Ronald Blackshear"},{"id":"42050917","text":"Paranerita metaxantha is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

Through this program, proposed premium increases in the small group and individual markets that are above a threshold amount (ten percent or more, as of February 2014) are reviewed by states or the federal government to determine whether the increases are reasonable. == Background == Health insurance premiums have risen steadily from 2000 to 2009 and have outpaced general inflation and wages.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”. Retrieved 2014-02-23. A number of factors have contributed to rising premiums including increases in spending on hospital and physician services, changes in the benefits covered by health insurance policies, and changes in the demographics of insured individuals.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”. Retrieved 2014-02-23. Even before the passage of the ACA, many states already had existing health insurance rate review programs to review proposed increases in insurance premiums. However, there was marked variation between the states' programs. Namely, there was variation in the review processes as well as the market segments (i.e. individual, small group) for which the review processes were applied.“Quantifying the Effects of Health Insurance Rate Review”. Kaiser Family Foundation (2012-10). Retrieved 2014-02-23.

Furthermore, there were differences in regards to the threshold amount that triggered a review.“Quantifying the Effects of Health Insurance Rate Review”. Kaiser Family Foundation (2012-10).

Retrieved 2014-02-23. It was also necessary to define an \\"unreasonable\\" rate increase and the initial 10 percent threshold was intended to be transitional, until state-specific thresholds are put in place.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”. Retrieved 2014-02-23. The 10 percent transitional threshold also balances the need to provide more disclosure to consumers while avoiding undue administrative burdens on other stakeholders. Health insurers are required to submit justifications for \\"unreasonable\\" premium increases to the Secretary of the DHHS and the state before the implementation of the increase.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”. Retrieved 2014-02-23. If the insurer does not comply, DHHS could seek a court order to force compliance. If the justifications submitted by the insurer remain unreasonable, then some states have the power to deny the proposed increase in premium. These provisions apply to coverage sold to both individuals and small employers. The rule, however, does not apply to grandfathered health plan coverages, or plans that were purchased before July 2011.“Rate Increase Disclosure and Review: Final Rule” .Department of Health and Human Services (2011-06-23).

In the small group market, rates that went into effect were 0.8 percentage points lower, which equated to over $600 million in savings. The DHHS noted in 2013 a decline in the proportion of rate filings in which the requested increase was at or above the premium increase threshold of 10 percent when compared to 2010.“Health Care Law Saves Consumers $1.2 Billion Nationwide”.

Retrieved 2014-02-23. According to state regulators, Oregon-based insurers were sending customers correspondence suggesting that their entire rate increase was attributable to the ACA's early market reforms. Using rate review, regulators were able to ascertain that the early market reforms had a negligible impact on premiums and began requiring carriers to submit their draft correspondence with enrollees, to be checked for accuracy.Corlette, Sabrina; Lucia, Kevin; Keith, Katie (2012). “Cross-Cutting Issues: Monitoring State Implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 10 States: Rate Review\\".

Retrieved 2014-02-23. In terms of efficacy of the rate review program, those in the insurance industry argue that rate increases are the result, not the driver, of rising healthcare costs, and that insurance companies' administrative costs and profits equal just 4 percent of national health expenditures. Rather than having regulators focus on restricting insurance rate increases, they say, government and others should make greater efforts to control underlying health spending, such as the outlays for hospital and physician services.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”. Retrieved 2014-02-23. Furthermore, insurers have raised the possibility that, if they are forced to accept rate increases that do not keep up with cost trends, pricing will be unsustainable in the long run. This could lead to insurers being driven out of business or forced to abandon particular markets or states.Cassidy, Amanda (2011-03-11). “‘Unreasonable’ Insurance Rate Increases”.

He is active on social media as Dr. Miami, has been on reality TV, has recorded a song, and written a children's book. He runs a plastic surgery practice in Bal Harbour, Florida. ==Early life and education== At the outbreak of World War I, Salzhauer's grandfather's family fled the Ukraine and pogroms there; his great-grandfather was clubbed to death by a Cossack as the family left. The rest of the family moved first to Vienna and then Berlin. When the Nazis came to power, his grandfather moved to Israel, and Salzhauer's father was born in Tel Aviv. His father moved to New York City in 1958, where Salzhauer was born in 1972, and grew up. While the rest of his family had attended Jewish schools, Salzhauer wanted to go to public high school to compete on the swim team. He was teased over the shape of his nose, and he left and went to a Jewish high school. He then attended Rockland Community College from 1989 to 1990 then transferred into Brooklyn College's BA/MD program. He met his wife, Eva, there. After two years he transferred to Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. After graduating he did his residency at first at Mount Sinai in Miami in general surgery, then at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami for plastic surgery, then did further training in plastic surgery at Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida. The other residents gave him a gift of a rhinoplasty for his own nose, at the completion of his residency. They also gave him a chin implant and liposuction. ==Career== In 2003, he opened his own practice in Bal Harbour, Florida, and six years later moved to a new five story building there. He told a reporter for Miami New Times in 2012, that \\"Marketing makes the world go 'round\\" and that he had courted the publicity of controversy. Salzhauer authored a children's book in 2008, titled My Beautiful Mommy which focused on a young girl whose mother undergoes a tummy tuck, a nose job, and breast augmentation. It was illustrated by Victor Guiza. Salzhauer and the book were criticized for promoting elective cosmetic surgery and for a line that suggests that mommy's new nose will \\"be prettier.\\" Child psychologist Elizabeth Berger has noted that while an explanatory book will be helpful for children, it \\"can be difficult for small kids to understand\\". Salzhauer defended the book, saying that he wrote it to help parents explain such surgeries to their children. In 2009, Salzhauer published a virtual plastic surgery iPhone application that allowed users to tweak photographs of themselves to simulate operations. The New York Times commented that the results were \\"worthy of a fun-house mirror\\". In 2012, he caused controversy within the Orthodox Jewish community after producing a video titled \\"Jewcan Sam\\" with the Jewish punk band The Groggers. The video features a young Jewish man who undergoes rhinoplasty at the request of his girlfriend. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons initiated an ethics investigation as a result, and both Salzhauer and the band were accused of playing into Jewish stereotypes. Salzhauer is also active on social media posting under his nickname \\"Dr. Miami.\\" Apart from using Instagram and Twitter, the surgeon is also active on Snapchat’s story mode, where he posts videos of cosmetic surgeries. As of 2016, he had around a million followers on Snapchat. In January 2016, Salzhauer was nominated for the eighth annual Shorty Award in the Snapchatter of the year category. He came in second place, losing to DJ Khaled. In July 2016, WE tv announced a reality television series, Dr. Miami, starring Salzhauer. The series premiered on March 31, 2017 and ran for 6 episodes on WE tv. In 2017, Salzhauer and recording artist Adam Barta released a song called \\"Flawless\\". The song reached #24 on the Billboard dance/electronic digital chart, #9 on iTunes dance singles chart, and #32 on the Billboard hot club dance chart/ ==Celebrity Patients== Beginning in 2012, Dr. Miami began making news headlines for working with several reality television stars. He has been known for performing several plastic surgery procedures on cast members of shows such as Teen Mom, Teen Mom 2, Love & Hip Hop: New York, Black Ink Crew, and Bad Girls Club.

He taught most recently at the Ruprecht- Karls-University in Heidelberg. During the Nazi era he promoted racist and nationalist ideologyThe Shaping of German Identity: Authority and Crisis, 1245-1414 Len Scales, page 29 After the war he led the so-called Maschke Committee which claimed German prisoners-of-war during World War II were mistreated by Allies.Erich Maschke, Zur Geschichte der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen des Zweiten Weltkrieges Bielefeld, E. und W. Gieseking, 1962-1974 Vol 15 P 185-230. ==Biography== Born in Berlin on 2 March 1900, Maschke was the son of an ophthalmologist. After graduating from Askanische high school in 1919 he studied medicine in Berlin, Innsbruck and Freiburg. He was involved in the Bündische Jugend, a German Youth Movement. He was an editor with the magazine Der weiße Ritter (The white knight). These experiences led him to change career. He went to Berlin in 1923 and Königsberg in 1925 where he studied history and geography, among other things, under Erich Caspar. In 1927, he completed his doctorate with a thesis on the Teutonic Knights and his habilitation in 1929 with his habilitation thesis on Peter's Pence in Poland and eastern Germany. His research was also focused on the history and historiography of Prussia and the European Late Middle Ages. Throughout his research on Eastern Europe he expressed racist formulations The Heidelberg Myth: The Nazification and Denazification of a German University Steven P. Remy, page 229 ===1933–1945=== After completing his habilitation in 1929, Maschke was appointed lecturer and in 1935 non-tenured associate professor of East and West Slavic history in Konigsberg. He became a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA) in 1933 and also joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) in 1937. That same year he was appointed Chair of Medieval and Modern History at the University of Jena. He became a propagandist for German aggression in Eastern Europe and celebrated what he described as \\"German right to the East\\". His research was riddled with racism and claims that German conquests are needed to allow \\"Growth of the German national body\\".War Stories: The Search for a Usable Past in the Federal Republic of Germany, Robert G. Moeller, page 177 For a publication accompanying an exhibition to the Nazi Party in 1938 under the title \\"Europas Schicksal im Osten\\" (Europe's fate in the East), Maschke posed the question of \\"east colonization\\", explaining that this is historically seen as the \\"ethnic history of the German return-migration in the once-Germanic East\\". He coined the phrase Dreieinheit von Rasse, Volk und Raum (trinity of race, ethnicity and space). During the Second World War he was in charge of training the Wehrmacht General Staff in Poznań. In his journalistic contributions in 1940 and 1941, he welcomed the military change as a prerequisite to the establishment of a German domination in Europe. In 1942 he was called to the University of Leipzig, where he researched mainly on the Middle Ages, especially the study of the Staufers.In 1942 he praised in internal pamphlet Germany's aggression in Europe stating that \\"the Germans alone had 'drawn the eastern territory to Europe, organically, without breaks, without symptoms of poisoning\\".Germany: The Long Road West: Volume 2: 1933-1990 Heinrich August Winkler, Alexander Sager - 2007 In a 1942 pamphlet intended only for internal use, Erich Maschke, an expert on the history of the Teutonic Order, wrote that the Germans alone had 'drawn the eastern territory to Europe, organically, without breaks, without symptoms of poisoning From 1943 to 1945, Maschke lectured on the German American Bund. He also worked as a research consultant with the Amt Rosenberg, participating in the development of curricula for Nazi Ordensburg and worked as an editor for Alfred Rosenberg's Literature Office as well as for the Party Censorship Commission for the Protection of National Socialist Literature (PPK). In 1943 he published the results of his research into the imperial history of the house of Hohenstaufen. ===Post-1945=== In 1953, after eight years of being a Soviet prisoner of war, he returned to his family, then living in Speyer. Pursuant to an agreement with the city, he published various works on Speyer's history for several years beginning in 1954. In the same year he received, through Fritz Ernst, a teaching position at the Ruprecht-Karls-University of Heidelberg. He taught the trade and economic history of the Middle Ages. In 1956 he became head of the Department of Economic and Social History. From 1959 until his retirement in 1968, he led, together with Werner Conze, the newly founded Institute for Social and Economic History. In the 1960s he published several works on 15th Century German cartels and the history of Gutehoffnungshütte. Through connections in France, including to Fernand Braudel in Toulouse, leader of the Annales School, in 1963 Maschke received one of the first invitations to a German after the Second World War as a visiting professor at the École pratique des hautes études in Sorbonne. In 1958 he was appointed to the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. From 1968 he was a member of the Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities and was also instrumental in the preparation for the Staufer exhibition in Stuttgart which took place in 1975. From 1962 to 1974 he was the editor of a 22-volume series, Zur Geschichte der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen des Zweiten Weltkrieges (The History of German prisoners of war of in the Second World War). This series was the report compiled by the Scientific Commission for the History of the German Prisoners of War, set up to investigate the killing of Germans captured as prisoners of war. The commission was headed by Maschke and was more popularly known as the Maschke Commission or Maschke Committee. Maschke's commission report accused Allies of atrocities against Nazi Germany's soldiers taken prisoner. Today Maschke's views in particular towards Eastern Europe and alleged German identity are discredited by modern historians in Germany The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 Karin Friedrich, page 13 ===Personal life=== Maschke married Elsbeth Horn whom he met in 1931 while she was a student in Ziegelhausen, Heidelberg. Their marriage produced two sons. Maschke died on 11 February 1982 just days after the death of his wife, who had often accompanied him on meetings, conferences and lecture tours in his later years due to his visual impairment. Maschke's estate is located in the Central State Archive Stuttgart, parts of his documents were also at the Bundesarchiv-military archive in Freiburg im Breisgau issued. ==Bibliography== * Friedrich Facius, Jürgen Sydow (Editors.): Inhalt Aus Stadt- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte Südwestdeutschlands.

One is the inclusion of the Cambridge International Technical in ICT, adapted to the local context, in place of an A Level. Another is replacement of the AS General Paper with a mandatory alternative, the AS Global Perspectives, which is designed to develop communication, analytical and research skills. Another is the Work Placement Component (WPC), a structured and supervised placement that provides practical work experience in the industry. The structure for the qualification includes: *2 or 3 A Levels, including the Cambridge International Technical in ICT *2 or 3 AS Levels, including the AS Alternative to the General Paper *The Work Placement Component (WPC) The alternative qualification is recognised by local and overseas universities, enabling students who successfully complete the qualification to seek admission in universities.

In pre-modern eras, upper-class men in ancient China, Korea and Japan often had more than one spouse to ensure the birth of a male heir to their assets and titles. In China, a priority system was created to rank the offsprings' entitlement to this inheritance. Under this system, a man was allowed one official wife, called a zhengshi (正室, pronounced seishitsu in Japanese, lit. \\"formal household\\") or Di wife (嫡妻), and her son was called the Di son (嫡子). A woman would have to go through a formal wedding to become the Di wife, otherwise she would be considered a concubine of her husband. A man could only have one Di wife unless he had already divorced another. In the Tang dynasty, any man who had more than one Di wife would be considered to be bigamous and would be liable to one year of penal labor. The woman involved would also receive a slightly less severe punishment unless she could prove she had been cheated into the marriage. In either case, the marriage would be annulled.《Tang Code》：“諸有妻更娶妻者，徒一年；女家減一等。若欺妄而娶者，徒一年半；女家不坐。各離之。” A secondary spouse was called a ceshi (側室, lit. \\"side household\\") or Shu wife (庶妻). A man might participate in a small ritual, or no ceremony, to take on a shu wife. Several Shu wives were allowed for one man at the same time according to the law. A shu wife‘s son was called the Shu son (庶子). Shu sons had to regard the Di wife of their father as their mother and respect her. Their birth mother would be called yiniang (姨娘, lit. \\"aunt\\"). Based on social standards, it was required that the Di wife's major responsibilities were managing all Shu wives and taking care of them like her younger sisters. However, if Shu wives did not show respect to the Di wife, then the Di wife had the right to punish them. Di sons, regardless of their age, held much higher social status than the Shu sons, and the eldest Di son (嫡長子) held the paramount position over all other children of the house. An illegitimate son, born out of wedlock, was generally categorized as a Shu son, though he would have much lower status than those born to legitimate Shu wives. Tang dynasty law prescribed that if a Di son died, his eldest Di son (Di grandson) should be the successor, taking precedence over all other members of the family; if a Di grandson could not be found, the Di son's next full-brother (born of the same zhengshi mother) should be the successor. If no Di offspring were available, a Shu son could be considered.《Tang Code》：“无嫡子及有罪疾，立嫡孙； 无嫡孙，以次立嫡子同母弟；无母弟，立庶子；无庶子，立嫡孙同母弟；无母弟，立庶孙。曾、玄以下准此。 ” During most of the history of imperial China, a man could not divorce or demote a zhengshi wife (以妻為妾) unless she had committed one of \\"seven misconducts for divorce\\" (七出). #Unfilial conducts (不順父母) — considered a sin as it was \\"immoral\\" (逆德) #Incapable of bearing sons (無子) — considered a sin as it \\"threatened bloodlines\\" (絕世) #Promiscuity (淫) — considered a sin as it \\"disrupted clan\\" (亂族) #Jealousy (妒) — considered a sin as it \\"disrupted family\\" (亂家) #Having severe illness (有惡疾) — considered a sin as it \\"hindered family rituals\\" (不可共粢盛) #Excessive gossiping (口多言) — considered a sin as it \\"instigated discord among relatives\\" (離親) #Theft (竊盜) — considered a sin as it was \\"against common good\\" (反義) However, there were three conditions, known as \\"three exceptions\\" (三不去), that forbade a man from ever divorcing his wife even if she commits the above seven sins. #The wife has no parental family to return to after divorce (有所娶無所歸) #The wife has served three years of filial mourning for deceased parent(s)-in-law (與更三年喪) #The husband was poor upon marriage but now wealthy (前貧賤後富貴) Tang law prescribed that a man caught demoting his zhengshi wife to ceshi without good cause would be sentenced to two years of penal labor, and the zhengshi wife's status would be restored.《Tang Code》：“诸以妻为妾，徒二年。各还正之。” Any man who divorced his wife without legitimate reasons (the above-mentioned \\"seven misconducts\\") would be subjected to eighteen months of penal labor, and a further 100 strokes of the cane if he violated the wife's protection under the \\"three exceptions\\".《Tang Code》：“諸妻無七出及義絕之狀，而出之者，徒一年半；雖犯七出，有三不去，而出之者，杖一百。追還合。若犯惡疾及奸者，不用此律。” After the Song dynasty, the difference between social status of Di and Shu wives/sons decreased. ==References== Category:Polygamy law Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in China Category:Sexuality and society Category:Social history of Japan Category:Social history of China Category:Polygyny Category:Chinese law Category:Legal history Category:Inheritance ","title":"Dishu system"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},F={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",F,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(B,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/47.md","filePath":"people/47.md"}'),H={name:"people/47.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
