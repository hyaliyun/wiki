The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to hypermarkets. A shop fitter executes planning, designs shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting firm typically incorporates professional expertise in interior design, manufacturing of bespoke furniture, signage and fittings (with own or outsourced facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment. A shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke furniture, delivers and physically installs them‚Äîuntil the shop is ready for daily operation. There are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. Fashion shop design requires up-to-the- minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in. ==Systems== 'Shopfitting system' refers to a product range made to satisfy the needs of shopfitters and ultimately retailers for display and merchandising goods. A shopfitting system can be adapted from combinations of standardized components for a particular retail application. A manufacturer would normally launch new shopfitting systems on a 2-year basis. Leading manufacturers would offer design oriented systems, followers would reinterpret them making the display solution achievable with as many as existing items as possible, hoping that retailers will choose their product because of the cheap price. Shopfitting systems are usually connected to a \\"modular\\" concept, meaning that each item has more than one use. This economically goes into the rules of \\"network\\", where one element has the value of three, if added to another element, because 1x1=1 but 2x2=4: an extra item designed and compatible with others, has very high value. == Shop fitting profession == Shop fitting is a profession that involves the fit-out of retail outlets like corner shops, department stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets with equipment, fixtures and fittings. It‚Äôs carried out by a shop fitter who executes all planning, design, layout and installation of equipment and services. A shop fitter brings interior design expertise and assists in the design of bespoke furniture, fittings and signage and also with the buying of retail equipment. The process begins with a survey of the retail premises and measurement of available space. The next stage is the preparation of design, which is then submitted to the client for review and approval. Some clients provide their own design drawings that are prepared by another interior designer. Finally, the shop fitter arranges for the purchase of standard equipment and the production of the bespoke furniture, which is delivered and installed ‚Äì ready for the shop operation. Shop fitting is a precision orientated profession that requires intricacy and exceptional attention to detail in order to meet client requirements. Visual elements heavily impact customer behaviour hence why shop fitting is now at the forefront of attracting new customers to stores across the globe. ==References== Category:Retail store elements Category:Design Category:Promotion and marketing communications ","title":"Shop fitting"},{"id":"19328013","text":"The Captain's Houses are a row of four nearly identical houses built along Corsica Creek in Centreville, Maryland after the Civil War.

It has a total area of . The sanctuary harbours a great diversity of wildlife habitats, with a vast plateau, multiple valleys, gorges and magnificent waterfalls. The sanctuary forms the catchment area of the Jonk River, over which a dam has been constructed to facilitate irrigation. The Indra nullah and Udanti River lies to the south of the sanctuary. The important vegetation of the site comprises dry deciduous tropical forest. ==Wildlife== A beautiful watering hole in the sanctuary Crested Serpent Eagle at Cherchuan entry point Typical central Indian wild mammals such as tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (P. pardus), Indian Gaur (Bos gaurus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are found, although depleted by poaching. Among the non-human primates, common langur (Semnopithecus entellus) and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) are very common. (Kotwal 1997). Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary has certainly seen better days. It had swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli branderi) and Wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). Forests around Sunabeda used to have good numbers of Wild Buffalos till 1960s. Hunting, cattle borne disease and habitat destruction led to extinction of Wild Buffalo in the region. Unconfirmed and occasional movement of individuals are reported sometime near Sitanadi but that‚Äôs just a speculation. With the efforts of Chhattisgarh government, there is some chance that we could get back wild buffaloes in forests of Indravati and Sitanadi-Udanti but situation continues to be precarious. Same is the case of hardground Barasingha which were once seen on the plateaus till 1950s and they just vanished, wild buffaloes way. Today they are extinct and there is no chance of revival. Sunabeda is perhaps the only place left in Odisha which is now reporting Nilgai. They were in plenty earlier in the Sunabeda plateau but poaching has taken a toll over the years. Today they have also gone nocturnal. These all factors have resulted in dwindling big cat population. Due to scarcity of prey, cattle kills will go up in coming days and subsequently complete eradication of the big cats. ==Avifauna== Around 200 species of birds have been reported from this area (H.K. Bisht in litt. 2002). BirdLife International (undated) has listed 59 species in biome-11 (Indo-Malayan tropical dry zone), of which 18 have been seen till now, but more are likely to occur. Except for the two Gyps vultures, which are now included in the critically endangered category by BirdLife International (2001) due to their steep decline during the last 10 years, none of the other species is threatened with extinction. Biome-11 includes a wide range of habitats, including forests and open country. Many of the species listed have adapted to man-modified habitats. Some species have deviated so far from their earlier distribution that they may not be useful in identifying IBAs for the protection of this biome (BirdLife International, undated). Forest Owlet: In February 1877, Valentine Ball had collected the specimen of Forest Owlet (Athene blewitti) on the banks of River Udanti towards the southern boundary of Sunabeda sanctuary. This fact should have been a great motivator for the foresters and officers in the region to look out for this species which till recently was thought to be extinct from India until its reappearance in Satpuda region in 1997. Search for this specie continues and avifauna lovers are much hopeful that one day, the elusive Forest Owlet reappears in the last remaining Teak patches in the forests of Khariar. Teak patches are favored by the Forest owlet. If that happens, that would be the biggest boost for the region including the cause of tiger. About other important species: The region also is one of the best places in Odisha to see Red collared Doves, Bonellis Eagle, and Common Babblers which is not very common in Odisha barring few records. We also have recorded a plethora of species that supports the fact that Sunabeda forests are an abode to a wide range of avifauna diversity. Some of the species that has been documented include Indian Pitta, Banded bay Cuckoo, Indian Paradise Flycatchers, Jungle Owlet, Tickell‚Äôs Flycatcher, Sulphur bellied warbler etc. Based on historical records, the search for Chestnut bellied Sandgrouse and Indian Courser continues which are no more found in Odisha ==Tiger reserve status== Sunabeda has received 'in-principle- approval' of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, proposals for its notification as per NTCA-guidelines is under preparation. The proposed tiger reserve extends over 956.17 km2 (longitude - 82¬∞20'0\\" to 82¬∞34'48\\" east and latitude 20¬∞06'0\\" to 20¬∞44'0\\" north), in Nuapada district bordering the state of Chhattisgarh to the west of Odisha, and encompasses the Sunabeda Sanctuary (591.75 km2) and the Patdhara forest block to its south (364.42 km2). ==Sunabeda campaigns== Awareness Program by The Corridor Foundation The Corridor Foundation, a volunteering organisation has been working since 2017 on creating awareness for wildlife conservation. Local volunteers from villages like Cherchuan, Jamgaon, Sunabeda, Kholibhitar have joined hands to protect the forests. Apart from awareness programs, multiple events have been organised involving school children. Also the organisation has been continuously influencing National Tiger Conservation Authority and Odisha State Forest Department to declare the wildlife sanctuary as Tiger Reserve, a much awaited step in conserving this last habitat of Tigers in Western Odisha. Also programs like Sapling distribution, plantation and biodiversity documentation has been carried out by the organisation.https://sanctuarynaturefoundation.org/article/sunabeda---once-a- bastion-for-wildlife Wild Orissa‚Äôs Sunabeda Tiger Conservation Programme is going on since 1997. As part of this programme special emphasis has been laid upon tiger conservation in the forests of Sunabeda-Khariar in the Nuapara district of Orissa constitute a vital tiger habitat. The last census in 2002 put the tiger population in the 600 km2. Sunabeda Sanctuary itself at about 24 individuals. In addition, the neighbouring Khariar forests, measuring about 450 km2., also support a few tigers. Together, these forests harbour a reasonably large tiger gene pool, with long term conservation potential. A compact patch of about 1,000 km2. could be earmarked for the Sunabeda Tiger Reserve. Also of interest is the movement of the extremely rare wild buffalo, (Bubalus arnee) in the area. These wild bovines enter Orissa from the Udanti and Sitanadi forests in Chhattisgarh. Given that this species is on the verge of extinction in central India, protecting Sunabeda is of vital national importance. The forests of the Sunabeda Sanctuary are sparsely populated. The region has thus far escaped the attentions of Orissa‚Äôs timber mafia. Three rivers and 11 major streams provide plentiful water sources. Sunabeda assumes even more importance when one considers that it is contiguous with the Udanti and Sitanadi forests in Chhattisgarh state to the west. If Sunabeda and Khariar are also given Project Tiger status, a large and extremely viable tiger habitat would be safeguarded.http://www.wildorissa.org/sunabeda.htmhttp://www.sanctuaryasia.com/component/content/article/119-campaigns- archive/645-sunabeda-khariar-tigers-need-protection.html ==Threats and conservation issues== Crumbled forest beat houses *Human pressure *Livestock grazing *Encroachment of forestland *Forest fire *Unsustainable exploitation of the forest resources *Illegal felling *Defunct Forest infrastructure on non existent monitoring/patrolling by Forest Department *Presence of Naxals According to Kotwal (1997), the highly endangered wild buffalo used to occur here nearly 70 years ago. At present, they are found in Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh, about 20 km away but there is a Patdhara Reserve Forest corridor. Efforts should be made to improve the habitat so that the wild buffalo can come back to Sunabeda using this corridor. This would give a boost to the protection of this sanctuary, which is important for birds also. About 64 villages, with a human population of 20,000, fragment this sanctuary and there is a large population of cattle. The villagers subsist on forest products to a great extent, as they have land holdings with poor yield. Grazing and encroachment of forest land for cultivation of Cannabis sativa are major threats to the sanctuary. Graziers from other states including Rajasthan arrive here with their camels and goats, which compete with local herbivores for the grass. Though there is a proposal for a tiger reserve, there are extensive encroachments inside the sanctuary. It is doubtful if these people could be shifted. The core area of Sunabeda could be increased southwards across the Indra nullah (stream), to add 30,000 ha of forest without human habitation (Kotwal 1997). Following are the recommendations by NGO, The Corridor Foundation made to NTCA and State Government based on detailed study in the area between 2018-20. # Immediately Notify Sunabeda as a Tiger Reserve, which has been pending since long after in- principle approval has been communicated by the NTCA. # Take up the matter with Home Department to sanitise the area from Naxalites. # Create an enabling environment for forest staff to return to their positions for any meaningful work. # Ground massive awareness campaign in enclosed and fringe villages and towns of Khariar and Nuapada with people as stakeholders. # Forest and wildlife staff needs to be provided with required amenities including free ration, prophylactic/ preventive medicines, support auxiliary staff and a vehicle in each Range. # Monitoring wild animals should start earnestly after staff positioning so that it becomes ingrained in routine work. # Implement the management plan in a participatory mode with the EDC/ VSS. # Work out, initiate and implement a model voluntary relocation plan in a way that, it shall have a spread effect. # Issue a direction to prevent migratory livestock entering the area. # Wildlife wing in collaboration with District Collector to facilitate income generating activities for villagers to create conducive wildlife- people interface. ==Gallery== Kapatdhar at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg KHOLIGAON in Sunabeda.jpg Indian Pitta at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Indian Paradise flycatcher at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Valley at Jamgaon at Sunabeda wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Black naped Monarch at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Banded bay Cuckoo at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Indian Paradise Flycatcher at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg River Jonk at Beniadhus in Sunabeda.jpg Steep cliffs are a common sight in Sunabeda wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Tickell's blue flycatcher at Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary.jpg Dense forests still exist in pockets in Sunabeda.jpg Beniadhus waterfalls.jpg ==References * Category:Northern dry deciduous forests Category:Tiger reserves of India Category:Wildlife sanctuaries in Odisha ","title":"Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary"},{"id":"19328050","text":"Sahyadri Tiger Reserve is a reserve in the state of Maharashtra.

It can cause an angry, or resentful emotional response, which can be used against certain people, or ideas.Reber, A.S., & Reber, E. (2002). The Penguin dictionary of psychology. New York: Penguin Books. Hatred is often associated with feelings of anger, disgust and a disposition towards the source of hostility. == As emotion == As an emotion, hatred can be short- lived or long-lasting.Y Ito ed., Encyclopedia of Emotion (2010) p. 302 It can be of low intensity - 'I hate broccoli' - or high intensity: 'I hate the whole world'.S Kucuk, Brand Hate (2016) p. 12-3 Robert Sternberg saw three main elements in hatred: # a negation of intimacy, by creating distance when closeness had become threatening; # an infusion of passion, such as fear or anger; # a decision to devalue a previously valued object.Y Ito ed., Encyclopedia of Emotion (2010) p. 302 The important self-protective function, to be found in hatred,I Craib, Psychoanalysis (Cambridge 2001) p. 208 can be illustrated by Steinberg's analysis of 'mutinous' hatred, whereby a dependent relationship is repudiated in a quest for autonomy.Y Ito ed., Encyclopedia of Emotion (2010) p. 303 == Psychoanalytic views == Sigmund Freud defined hate as an ego state that wishes to destroy the source of its unhappiness, stressing that it was linked to the question of self-preservation.S Freud, 'The instincts and their vicissitudes' (1915) in On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 135-5. Donald Winnicott highlighted the developmental step involved in hatred, with its recognition of an outside object: \\"As compared to magical destruction, aggressive ideas and behaviour take on a positive value, and hate becomes a sign of civilization\\".D W Winnicott, The Child, the Family, and the Outside World (Penguin 1973) p. 239 In his wake, Object relations theory has emphasised the importance of recognising hate in the analytic setting: the analyst acknowledges his own hate (as revealed in the strict time-limits and the fee charged),J Malcolm, Psychoanalysis (London 1988) p. 143 which in turn may make it possible for the patient to acknowledge and contain their previously concealed hate for the analyst.I Craib, Psychoanalysis (Cambridge 2001) p. 208 Adam Phillips went so far as to suggest that true kindness is impossible in a relationship without hating and being hated, so that an unsentimental acknowledgement of interpersonal frustrations and their associated hostilities can allow real fellow-feeling to emerge.A Phillips/B Taylor, On Kindness (London 2004) p. 93-4 ==Legal issues== In the English language, a hate crime (also known as a \\"bias-motivated crime\\") generally refers to criminal acts which are seen to have been motivated by hate. Those who commit hate crimes target victims because of their perceived membership in a certain social group, usually defined by race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, mental disorder, disability, class, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender identity, or political affiliation.Stotzer, R.: Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups, Williams Institute, 2007‚Äì06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09. Incidents may involve physical assault, destruction of property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).Hate crime , Home Office Hate speech is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group, such as race, sex, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental disorder, disability, language ability, ideology, social class, occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin color, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviors in a public setting. It is also sometimes called antilocution and is the first point on Allport's scale which measures prejudice in a society. In many countries, deliberate use of hate speech is a criminal offence prohibited under incitement to hatred legislation. It is often alleged that the criminalization of hate speech is sometimes used to discourage legitimate discussion of negative aspects of voluntary behavior (such as political persuasion, religious adherence and philosophical allegiance). There is also some question as to whether or not hate speech falls under the protection of freedom of speech in some countries. Both of these classifications have sparked debate, with counter-arguments such as, but not limited to, a difficulty in distinguishing motive and intent for crimes, as well as philosophical debate on the validity of valuing targeted hatred as a greater crime than general misanthropy and contempt for humanity being a potentially equal crime in and of itself. == Neurological research == The neural correlates of hate have been investigated with an fMRI procedure. In this experiment, people had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of people they hated. The results showed increased activity in the middle frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in the premotor cortex, in the frontal pole, and bilaterally in the medial insular cortex of the human brain. ==Ethnolinguistics== Hate, like love, takes different shapes and forms in different languages.James W. Underhill, Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate & war, (2012) p. 160 While it may be fair to say that one single emotion exists in English, French (haine), and German (Hass), hate is historically situated and culturally constructed: it varies in the forms in which it is manifested. Thus a certain relationless hatred is expressed in the French expression J'ai la haine, which has no precise equivalent in English; while for English-speakers, loving and hating invariably involve an object, or a person, and therefore, a relationship with something or someone, J'ai la haine (literally, I have hate) precludes the idea of an emotion directed at a person.James W. Underhill, Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate & war, (2012) p. 161-2 This is a form of frustration, apathy and animosity which churns within the subject but establishes no relationship with the world, other than an aimless desire for destruction. French forms of anti-Americanism have been seen as a specific form of cultural resentment, registering joy-in-hate.James W. Underhill, Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate & war, (2012) p. 173-181 ==Religious perspectives== A United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom and religion cited the concept of collective hatred based on religion, which he described as a man-made phenomenon caused by deliberate actions and omissions of hate-mongers. Hatred can also be sanctioned by religion. The Hebrew word describing David's \\"perfect hatred\\" (KJV) means that it \\"brings a process to completion\\". There also sources that explain how Islam developed around hatred for unbelief since it is considered the source of evil and that adherents endeavor to spread the Qur'anic faith as the vehicle for its eradication. A specific example is hate speech. It is explained that religion aims to convert new adherents and that extreme speech made against other religion or its adherents is considered a tool so that changing other's beliefs is effective. == Philosophical views == Philosophers from the ancient time sought to describe hatred and today, there are different definitions available. Aristotle, for instance, viewed it as distinct from anger and rage, describing hate as a desire to annihilate an object and is incurable by time. David Hume also offered his own conceptualization, maintaining that hatred is an irreducible feeling that is not definable at all. ==Literary explications== *W B Yeats had his (imaginary) hermit Ribh proclaim: > I study hatred with great diligence, For that's a passion in my own control, > A sort of besom that can clear the soul Of everything that is not mind or > sense.\\"W. B. Yeats, The Poems (London 1983) p. 286 *Doris Lessing considered there was a hate-region of the mind that could be tapped rather like a radio: \\"you discover hatred is a kind of wavelength you can tune into...plugged into Hater.\\"D Lessing, The Four-Gated City (London 1993) p. 69 and p. 564 == See also ReferencesFurther reading== *The Psychology of Hate by Robert Sternberg (Ed.) *Hatred: The Psychological Descent into Violence by Willard Gaylin *Why We Hate by Jack Levin *The Psychology of Good and Evil: Why Children, Adults, and Groups Help and Harm Others by Ervin Staub *Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility, and Violence by Aaron T.

It has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1976. As of March 2013, in principle approval by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has been granted for upgrading it to a status of tiger reserve. It will become a tiger reserve by the notification of the Government of Madhya Pradesh.http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=92889 Its close proximity to the capital and its relatively untouched forests makes it a promising attraction for tourists and the Madhya Pradesh tourism board plans to make it a wildlife destination in the near future. The reserve is rich in flora and fauna and a wide variety of birds and mammals call it their home. The total forest area is around 823.84 sq. km. and The landscape is undulating, with hills, plateaux, valleys and plains. A number of seasonal streams irrigate the site in the monsoon, and water is retained in some pools along these streams even in the summer. Two large reservoirs, namely Barna Reservoir and Ratapani Dam (Barrusot lake) are among the major waterbodies adjacent to or inside the sanctuary. The forest of Ratapani is dry deciduous and moist deciduous type, with teak (Tectona grandis) as the main tree species. About 55% of the area is covered by teak. The remaining mixed forests consist of various dry deciduous species. Bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) overlaps the two aforementioned forest types and covers about one quarter of the forest area. Bhimbetka rock shelters, are located within this tiger reserve. These rock shelters were inhabited by man hundreds of thousand years ago and some of the rock paintings of the Stone Age are more than 30,000 years old. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The tourist places include Bhimbetka, Delawari, Ginnorhgarh Fort, Ratapani Dam, KairiMahadeo and Kherbana Mandir. ==Tiger reserve status== As per the government, in-principle approval has been accorded by the National Tiger Conservation Authority for creation of two new tiger reserves, and the sites are: Ratapani (Madhya Pradesh) and Sunabeda (Odisha). Final approval has been accorded to Kudremukh (Karnataka) and Rajaji (Uttarakhand) for declaring as a tiger reserve. The state governments have been advised to send proposals for declaring the following areas as tiger reserves: (i) Suhelwa Wildlife Sanctuary (Uttar Pradesh), (ii) Guru Ghasidas National Park (Chhattisgarh), (iii) Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary (Goa), (iv) Srivilliputhur Grizzled Giant Squirrel / Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuaries / Varushanadu Valley (Tamil Nadu) and (v) Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh). ==Wildlife== A large variety of wildlife is found in the wildlife sanctuary. Some precipitous hills have cliffs; have large rock blocks and talus at the base. This unique feature provides shelter to various animals like vultures, reptiles and small mammals. Carnivores are the tiger, leopard, dhole, hyena, jackal and fox, and the herbivores include chital, sambar, nilgai, four-horned antelope, langur and wild boar, and primates: langur and rhesus macaque. The omnivorous sloth bear is also seen often. Smaller animals, like squirrels, mongooses, gerbils, porcupines, hares, etc. are of common occurrence. Among reptiles, important species include different kinds of lizards, chameleon, snakes, etc. Among snakes, cobra, python, viper, krait, etc. are common. More than 150 species of birds are seen here. A few to mention are the common babbler, crimson-breasted barbet, bulbul, bee-eater, baya, cuckoo, kingfisher, kite, lark, Bengal vulture, sunbird, white wagtail, crow pheasant, jungle crow, egrets, myna, jungle fowl, parakeets, partridges, hoopoe, quails, woodpeckers, blue jay, dove, black drongo, flycatcher, flower pecker and rock pigeon. In February 2019, a tiger found in the area of Lunavada in Mahisagar district of Gujarat State, before being spotted dead, was said to have come from this sanctuary. Avifauna The Ratapani WLS is rich in the typical wildlife of central India. Not much work has been done on the birds of Ratapani, although frequent visits by birdwatchers to the site provide baseline information on the species seen in and around the site. More than 150 species of birds are reported from Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary(K. Sharma pers. comm. 2003). Oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis), long-billed vulture (Gyps indicus) and red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) are often found perched on a cluster of trees or soaring at great heights in search of food (K. Sharma pers. comm. 2002). The Ratapani dam at the periphery of the sanctuary invites thousands of migratory birds in winter. There are many smaller reservoirs dotted all over the sanctuary. The total waterfowl populations in all these smaller reservoirs and Ratapani reservoir would easily exceed 20,000 (A4iii criteria). Moreover, these waterbodies also attract large wading birds such as the sarus crane (Grus antigone), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) and white-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus) (K. Sharma pers. comm. 2002). The rich diversity in terrestrial species throughout the sanctuary calls for a proper bird survey of the area. Ratapani retains some of the finest representative forest cover of the Indo-Malayan Tropical Dry Zone (Biome-11). Of the 59 bird species identified by BirdLife International (undated) in this biome, 33 are found in Ratapani, further proving the importance of this site for the protection of biome species. Detailed studies could reveal more bird species.http://ibcn.in/wp- content/uploads/2011/12/28-657_690-Madhya-Pradesh.pdf ==Threats And Conservation Issues== * Poaching * Encroachment and forest fires * Illicit felling * Livestock grazing * Man-animal conflict This large sanctuary faces pressures from all directions. Illicit felling, grazing by cattle, poaching and encroachment are the major concerns for the management.

After finishing ƒ∞stanbul Highschool, he took physics and chemistry classes at ƒ∞stanbul University. While he started to work at a high school as a principal, there was a growing interest in cinema among the Ottomans. Uzkƒ±nay started to give lessons at his school in order to make his students familiar with cinema. Despite the fact that numerous cinemas existed in ƒ∞stanbul, Uzkƒ±nay campaigned for the building of a Turkish-owned cinema, which opened on 19 March 1914. The name, \\"The National Cinema\\", would change later to \\"Ali Efendi sinemasƒ±\\". Meanwhile, he learned to use the projector from Sigmund Weinberg, who was the first man to introduce the cinema to the Ottomans. While in the army, on 14 November 1914 he made the documentary film \\"Ayastefanos'taki Rus Abidesinin Yƒ±kƒ±lƒ±≈üƒ±\\", depicting the destruction of the Russian Monument at Ayastefanos. This 150mt. film is known as the first documentary film of the Turkish Cinema. One year later, he founded, on the order of General Enver Pa≈üa, the \\"Central Army Cinema Department\\". Sigmund Weinberg was the Chairman of the department and Uzkƒ±nay was his assistant. One year later, Uzkƒ±nay succeeded Weinberg in that position. He received education in Germany on film production. He completed his first movie \\"Himmet Aƒüa'nƒ±n ƒ∞zdivacƒ±\\" in 1918, despite many difficulties he encountered.

The tour, which spanned the UK, Europe, North America, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America, included 85 shows over a period of several months in 1997 and 1998. The tour started on 14 June 1997 in support of U2 at the KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, United States, and ended on 25 March 1998 at the Sports Palace in Mexico City, Mexico. With most shows being played during the autumn and winter months, a majority of the concerts were staged at indoor arenas and halls, in contrast to the larger outdoor venues typically featured on Oasis' summer tours. Many performances were audio recorded by either broadcast media or concert attendees and have since been made available on various file-sharing outlets and fan web sites. A handful of performances were also carried by various television outlets throughout the world, including the 14 December concert at the G-Mex in Manchester, England. Fueled partly by worldwide stardom and drug use, the tour and corresponding album became \\"infamous\\" for the amount of excess and spectacle they provided. Accordingly, they marked the end of the cocaine era for Noel Gallagher.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/06/noel-gallagher-oasis He would later say about the craziness and wild year on tour: \\"I kid you not, there was a sound guy who quit because there was too much 'food'...and I thought 'sure it's not the fucking coke you've been taking'\\". As the tour came to an end, the album's reception had changed from rave and outstandingly positive to less-than satisfied and below average reviews with many critics restating that it was weak in comparison to the group's first two records. They did, however, manage to maintain a large cult following in many countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Russia, Italy, Spain, South Korea and Japan where their public persona would strengthen even more over the subsequent decade. ==Stage setup== Oasis had a unique album-themed stage set up for the tour, featuring props and set pieces for the first time in their career. At various points on the tour, stage items included a Rolls Royce rigged with stage lights, an oversized telephone box, and other items from the Be Here Now album cover. At the start of many performances, a man outfitted with a tailor suit and top hat would appear onstage to excite the crowd, beckoning them to scream and clap, while the opening piano loop for the song \\"Be Here Now\\" began playing over the concert PA. The band then entered onto the stage through a large door in the prop telephone box, which doubled as an entryway to backstage. As the tour progressed, different shows featured varying types and numbers of set pieces, though the \\"Be Here Now\\" introduction remained a constant through the duration of performances. ==Set list== The band's typical set list was: #\\"Be Here Now\\" #\\"Stay Young\\" #\\"Stand by Me\\" #\\"Supersonic\\" #\\"Some Might Say\\" #\\"Roll with It\\" #\\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" #\\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" #\\"Don't Go Away #\\"Wonderwall\\" #\\"Live Forever\\" #\\"It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)\\" #\\"All Around The World\\" #\\"Fade In-Out\\" #\\"Champagne Supernova\\" #\\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\" #\\"Acquiesce\\" The band would occasionally feature \\"Whatever\\" and \\"My Big Mouth\\". They would also sometimes break while Noel performed a selection of songs acoustically, like \\"Help!\\" in Nippon Budokan; \\"Talk Tonight\\"; and a song that he collaborated on with The Chemical Brothers called \\"Setting Sun\\". This would normally lead straight into an acoustic version of \\"Fade In-Out\\". The band also performed \\"Magic Pie\\", this coming to an end before the G-Mex shows. The band once performed \\"The Girl in the Dirty Shirt\\" with Noel on vocals in Dublin. For the U2 support slots, Oasis played between 7 and 12 songs, generally from the same setlist as the main tour, but Noel acoustically performed \\"Cast No Shadow\\". ==Tour dates== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:175px;\\" Date ! style=\\"width:175px;\\" City ! style=\\"width:175px;\\" Country ! style=\\"width:215px;\\" Venue - ! colspan=\\"4\\" United Kingdom - 17 May 1997 London England Brixton Academy - ! colspan=\\"4\\"  United States - 14 June 1997 Irvine  rowspan=\\"3\\"United States Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre - 18 June 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Oakland  rowspan=\\"2\\"Oakland Coliseum - 19 June 1997 - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Europe - 8 September 1997 Oslo Norway Spektrum - 9 September 1997 Stockholm Sweden Ericsson Globe - 10 September 1997 Copenhagen Denmark Forum Copenhagen - 13 September 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Exeter  rowspan=\\"4\\"England  rowspan=\\"2\\"Westpoint Arena - 14 September 1997 - 16 September 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Newcastle  rowspan=\\"2\\"Metro Radio Arena - 17 September 1997 - 19 September 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Aberdeen  rowspan=\\"2\\"Scotland  rowspan=\\"2\\"Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre - 20 September 1997 - 22 September 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Sheffield  rowspan=\\"7\\"England  rowspan=\\"2\\"Hallam FM Arena - 23 September 1997 - 25 September 1997  rowspan=\\"3\\"London  rowspan=\\"3\\"Earls Court Exhibition Centre - 26 September 1997 - 27 September 1997 - 29 September 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Birmingham  rowspan=\\"2\\"National Indoor Arena - 30 September 1997 - ! colspan=\\"4\\" North America - 4 October 1997  rowspan=\\"3\\" New York City  rowspan=\\"3\\" United States Saturday Night Live - 7 October 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\" Hammerstein Ballroom - 8 October 1997 - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Europe - 3 November 1997 Lille France Z√©nith de Lille - 8 November 1997 Zaragoza  rowspan=\\"3\\"Spain Pabellon Principe Felipe - 10 November 1997 Madrid Palacio de Deportes de La Comunidad - 11 November 1997 Barcelona Palau dels Esports - 13 November 1997 Geneva Switzerland SEG Geneva Arena - 15 November 1997 Casalecchio di Reno - Bologna  rowspan=\\"3\\"Italy Palasport - 16 November 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Assago  rowspan=\\"2\\"Forum di Assago - 17 November 1997 - 19 November 1997 Munich Germany Olympiahalle - 21 November 1997 Prague Czech Republic Sportovn√≠ hala - 22 November 1997 Berlin  rowspan=\\"3\\"Germany Deutschlandhalle - 24 November 1997 Hanover Messehalle - 25 November 1997 Frankfurt Festhalle - 27 November 1997 Hertogenbosch Netherlands Brabanthallen - 28 November 1997 Oberhausen Germany K√∂nig Pilsener Arena - 3 December 1997  rowspan=\\"3\\"Dublin  rowspan=\\"3\\"Ireland  rowspan=\\"3\\"The Point Depot - 4 December 1997 Without Liam Gallagher - 5 December 1997 Without Liam Gallagher - 7 December 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Glasgow  rowspan=\\"2\\"Scotland  rowspan=\\"2\\"Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre - 8 December 1997 - 10 December 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Cardiff  rowspan=\\"2\\"Wales  rowspan=\\"2\\"Cardiff International Arena - 11 December 1997 - 13 December 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Manchester  rowspan=\\"5\\"England  rowspan=\\"2\\"GMEX Arena - 14 December 1997 - 16 December 1997  rowspan=\\"3\\"London The Water Rats - 17 December 1997  rowspan=\\"2\\"Wembley Arena - 18 December 1997 - ! colspan=\\"4\\" North America - 8 January 1998 Philadelphia  rowspan=\\"4\\"United States Sony E-Center - 9 January 1998 Fairfax Patriot Center - 10 January 1998 Pittsburgh A.J.

His father had once been 'arif in Tangier, that is to say he was employed as head of the guard responsible for keeping watch in the town at night. From this circumstance came his surname Ibn al-Arif. His father came from Tangier and his family belonged to the Berber tribe of the Sanhaja. Almeria was a center of Sufism at that time. He and Ibn Barrajan, another Andalusian Sufi based in Seville, gathered around themselves a large number of followers, which attracted the attention of the Almoravid authorities. In 1141 both men were called to Marrakesh by the sultan Ali ibn Yusuf, where they were accused of \\"professing heterodox doctrines.\\"Miguel As√≠n Palacios, The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and His Followers, trans. Elmer H. Douglas and Howard W. Yoder (Leiden: E.J. Brill 1978), p. 122 Ibn al-Arif defended himself and was released, but died shortly after. According to Ibn al-Abbar, either \\"the sultan was convinced of Ibn al-Arif's excellence and piety and ordered him to be released and escorted to Ceuta\\" where he died of an illness, or \\"Ibn al- Arif was poisoned on his return journey, while making the sea crossing.\\"Claude Addas, Quest for the Red Sulphur, trans.

Web. 11 December 2016 ==Life== Pieter van Avont was baptized on 14 January 1600 in MechelenPieter van Avont at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His father was the sculptor Hans van Avont.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 891‚Äì894 Holy Family in a Flower and Fruit Garland, with Jan Brueghel the Elder It is not known with which master he studied but it is believed he received his first training from his father. He was accepted as a master of the guild of Mechelen in 1620. He moved to Antwerp two years later. Around 1622/3, he was accepted as master of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp and he became a citizen of that city in 1631. On 2 August 1622 he married Catherine van Hertsen in Antwerp cathedral, although they lived in the parish of St. James Church. Pieter van Avont likely received commissions from Archduke Leopold William, Governor of the Southern Netherlands, as the Archduke is known to have owned a landscape with the Virgin and Child with Angels by van Avont. Even so, Pieter van Avont was not able to live off his art and operated a side business as a dealer in paintings and prints. He was appointed captain of the local schutterij (militia) in 1633 but he resigned from the position in 1639 giving as a reason the need for him to paint in order to sustain his family. His first wife died on 3 September 1643. On 7 February 1644 van Avont married again. His second wife was Catharina 't Kint and they had five children. Pieter van Avont by Wenceslaus Hollar From the baptisms of his children and of his friends' children it is possible to understand the circle of artistic friends of van Avont. The godfathers and godmothers to his children included the painters Melchior Teniers and Frans Wouters. Catharina 't Kint was the godmother of Marie-Anne Hollar, the daughter of the printmaker Wenceslas Hollar en Margaretha Straci. Wenceslas Hollar is known to have made a portrait of his friend van Avont. His financial position deteriorated after his second marriage and he had to sell the seven houses he owned and mortgage his residence. His children were sickly and seven of them died before the artist. He spent a lot of money on medical bills. He moved to rural Deurne near Antwerp in order to provide for a healthier environment for his children. He died in 1652 soon after moving his family there and was buried on 1 November 1652. Peeter van den Cruys was a pupil of van Avont in 1625-'26. Frans Wouters was apprenticed to Pieter van Avont in 1629 but Wouters broke his contract to move to the workshop of Rubens in 1634.BALIS, A., ‚ÄòRubens and his Studio: Defining the Problem‚Äô, in: Rubens. A Genius at Work. Lannoo Publishers (Acc) (March 14, 2008), (p. 32), retrieved on 25 October 2013 Frans Wouters' brother Pieter was van Avont's pupil in 1631‚Äì32. ==Work== Madonna and Child, St John the Baptist as a Boy and Angels in a Woodland Landscape Pieter van Avont is mainly known for his religious and mythological scenes and cabinet paintings. A motif appearing in many of van Avont's works is a group of naked children and putti. In his many renderings of the Holy Family, they appear in a variety of roles such as the Infant Christ, John the Baptist and angels. They often pay tribute to the Virgin and Child. The arrangement of the figures in the grouping is identical in several of his paintings. Figures of naked children also appear in his bacchanals and in allegorical scenes such as the Four Elements and War and Peace. His style in these works is characterized by a soft modelling of the figures using sfumato and warm colours. The scenes with children are often set in a landscape. Although van Avont signed several of these compositions, he did not always paint the landscapes himself. As was common in Antwerp artistic practice in the 17th century, van Avont collaborated with many leading painters in Antwerp including Jan Brueghel the Elder and Younger, David Vinckboons, Lucas van Uden, Jacques d'Arthois, Lucas Achtschellinck, Lodewijk de Vadder, Izaak van Oosten and Jan Wildens. Putti Dancing in a Landscape He collaborated with Jan Brueghel the Elder on a garland painting. Garland paintings typically show a flower or fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. Jan Brueghel the Elder played a key role in the invention and development of the genre of garland paintings.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth- Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 The genre of garland paintings was inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter van Avont painted around 1623 The Holy Family in a flower and fruit garland. Pieter van Avont painted the figures.Jan Bruegel the Elder und Pieter van Avont, Heilige Familie in einem Blumen- und Fr√ºchtekranz at the Pinakotheken He painted landscapes himself. Evidence for this is that a pair of landscapes by van Avont was listed in an Antwerp estate in 1676. While the work Flora in a Garden with Flowers and Trees (Kunsthistorisches Museum) was referred to in the 19th century as co-signed by van Avont and Jan Brueghel the Younger, it is now believed that van Avont also painted the landscape which had been attributed to Brueghel. An Allegory of Air and Fire Van Avont was also a printmaker and etched several plates with scenes of angels and putti. ==Selected works== *Flora in a Garden with Flowers and Trees, with Jan Brueghel the Elder, oil on copper, 70 √ó 47 cm, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Gem√§ldegalerie, Vienna, Austria *Holy Family in a Flower and Fruit Garland with Jan Brueghel the Elder, c. 1623, oil on panel, 93,5 √ó 72 cm, Alte Pinakothek, Munich, Germany *Deposition from the Cross after Rubens 1641, Sint-Gertrudiskerk Vorst-Laakdal, oil on canvas, 177 x 144 cm. *The Assumption of Mary 1642, Sint-Gertrudiskerk Vorst-Laakdal, oil on canvas, 174 x 133 cm. == References  * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:People from Antwerp Category:People from Mechelen Category:Flemish printmakers Category:1600s births Category:1652 deaths Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Pieter van Avont"},{"id":"19328308","text":"Mas≈Ç√≥w (officially Mas≈Ç√≥w Pierwszy, Mas≈Ç√≥w I) is a village in Kielce County, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland.

Marketed by Abbott Laboratories under the trade name Zemplar) is a drug used for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone) associated with chronic kidney failure. It is an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol, the active form of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). It was patented in 1989 and approved for medical use in 1998. ==Medical uses== Its primary use in medicine is in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic kidney disease. However current evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate an advantage of paricalcitol over non-selective vitamin D derivatives for this indication. ==Adverse effects== Adverse effects by frequency: Very common (>10% frequency): * Nausea Common (1-10% frequency): * Diarrhoea‚Ä† * Oedema * Allergic reaction * Arthritis * Dizziness‚Ä† * Stomach discomfort‚Ä° * Gastroesophageal reflux disease‚Ä† * Acne‚Ä† * Hypercalcaemia‚Ä† * Hypocalcaemia‚Ä† * Hyperphosphataemia * Decreased appetite‚Ä† * Headache * Breast tenderness‚Ä† * Taste changes * Hypoparathyroidism * Vertigo * Rash‚Ä° Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency): * Abnormal hepatic enzymes‚Ä° * Constipation‚Ä° * Dry mouth‚Ä° * Itchiness‚Ä° * Hives * Hypersensitivity‚Ä° * Muscle spasms‚Ä° * Bleeding time prolonged * Aspartate aminotransferase increased * Laboratory test abnormal * Weight loss * Elevated blood creatinine * Cardiac arrest * Arrhythmia * Atrial flutter * Anaemia * Leucopenia * Lymphadenopathy * Coma * Stroke * Transient ischemic attack * Fainting * Myoclonus * Hypoaesthesia * Paraesthesia * Glaucoma * Conjunctivitis * Ear disorder * Pulmonary oedema * Asthma * Shortness of breath * Nose bleed * Cough * Rectal haemhorrhage * Colitis * Gastritis * Indigestion * Difficulty swallowing * Gastrointestinal disorder * Gastrointestinal haemorrhage * Bullous dermatitis * Hair loss * Hirsutism * Hyperhidrosis * Joint pain * Joint stiffness * Back pain * Muscle twitching * Muscle aches * Hyperparathyroidism * Hyperkalaemia * Hypocalcemia * Breast cancer * Sepsis * Pneumonia * Infection * Pharyngitis * Vaginal infection * Influenza * High blood pressure * Hypotension * Gait disturbance * Injection site pain * Fever * Chest pain * Condition aggravated * Muscle weakness * Malaise * Thirst * Breast pain * Impotence * Confusional state * Delirium * Depersonalization * Agitation * Insomnia * Nervousness ‚Ä° These are adverse effects only seen in patients with grade 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease. ‚Ä† These are adverse effects only seen in patients with grade 5 chronic kidney disease. ==Contraindications== Contraindications include: * Vitamin D intoxication * Hypercalcaemia * Hypersensitivity to paricalcitol or any of its excipients whereas cautions include: * Impaired liver function * It is also advised that physicians regularly monitor their patients' calcium and phosphorus levels. ==Interactions== Drugs that may interact with paricalcitol include: * Ketoconazole, as it may interfere with paricalcitol's metabolism in the liver. * Digitoxin, hypercalcaemia due to any cause can exacerbate the toxicity of digitoxin. * Thiazide diuretics or calcium supplements as hypercalcaemia may be induced by this combination * Magnesium-containing products such as antacids may increase the risk of hypermagnesemia. * Aluminium-containing products such as antacids may increase the risk of aluminium toxicity. * Drugs that interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. ==Overdose== Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia) are common overdose symptoms. Treatment is mostly supportive, with particular attention being paid to correcting electrolyte anomalies and reducing intake of calcium in both the form of supplementation and diet. As it is so heavily bound to plasma proteins haemodialysis is unlikely to be helpful in cases of overdose. Early symptoms of overdose can include: * Weakness * Headache * Somnolence * Nausea * Vomiting * Dry mouth * Constipation * Muscle pain * Bone pain * Metallic taste in the mouth. It is worth noting, however, that may of these symptoms are also indicative of kidney failure and hence may be masked by the patient's condition. Late symptoms of overdose include: * Loss of appetite * Weight loss * Conjunctivitis (calcific) * Pancreatitis * Photophobia * Rhinorrhoea * Pruritus * Hyperthermia * Decreased libido * Elevated BUN * Hypercholesterolaemia * Elevated AST and ALT * Ectopic calcification * Hypertension * Cardiac arrhythmias * Somnolence * Death * Psychosis (rare) ==Mechanism of action== 3D structure of paricalcitol Like 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol, paricalcitol acts as an agonist at the vitamin D receptor and thereby lowers parathyroid hormone levels in the blood. ==Pharmacokinetics== The plasma concentration of paricalcitol decreases rapidly and log-linearly within two hours after initial intravenous administration. Therefore, it is not expected to accumulate with multiple dosing, since paricalcitol is usually given no more frequently than every other day (3 times per week).Rxlist: Zemplar == References == Category:Secosteroids Category:Vitamin D Category:AbbVie brands ","title":"Paricalcitol"},{"id":"19328417","text":"Charles Windeyer (1 July 1780 ‚Äì 30 January 1855) was an Australian magistrate who held a variety of public positions and was later appointed by Governor George Gipps as the first Mayor of Sydney.

It is measured in the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire as well as the later version Temperament and Character Inventory and is considered one of the temperament dimensions of personality. Like the other temperament dimensions, it has been found to be highly heritable. High NS has been suggested to be related to low dopaminergic activity. In the revised version of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) novelty seeking consists of the following four subscales: # Exploratory excitability (NS1) # Impulsiveness (NS2) # Extravagance (NS3) # Disorderliness (NS4) ==Relationship to other personality traits== A research study found that Novelty seeking had inverse relationships with other Temperament and Character Inventory dimensions, particularly harm avoidance and to a more moderate extent self-directedness and self-transcendence. Novelty seeking is positively associated with the five factor model trait of extraversion and to a lesser extent openness to experience and is inversely associated with conscientiousness. Novelty seeking is positively related to Impulsive sensation seeking from Zuckerman's Alternative five model of personality and with psychoticism in Eysenck's model. When novelty seeking is defined as a decision process (i.e. in terms of the tradeoff between foregoing a familiar choice option in favor of deciding to explore a novel choice option), dopamine is directly shown to increase novelty seeking behavior. Specifically, blockade of the dopamine transporter, causing a rise in extracelluar dopamine levels, increases the propensity of monkeys to select novel over familiar choice options. ==Causes== Genetics Although the exact causes for novelty seeking behaviors is unknown, there may be a link to genetics. Studies have found an area on the Dopamine receptor D4 gene on chromosome 11 that is characterized by several repeats in a particular base sequence. Multiple studies have identified a link to genetics, in particular one conducted by Dr. Benjamin and colleagues, where individuals who had longer alleles of this gene had higher novelty-seeking scores than individuals with the shorter allele. In another study relating to the gene and financial risk, Dr. Dreber and colleagues found a correlation between increased risk-taking and the DRD4 gene in young males. Although there are studies that support the link between NS and dopaminergic activity via DRD4, there are also studies that do not exhibit a strong correlation. The importance of DRD4 in novelty seeking is yet to be confirmed conclusively. Dopamine In addition to potential heredity, novelty seeking behaviors are seen with the modulation of dopamine. The overall effect of dopamine when exposed to a novel stimuli is a mass release of the neurotransmitter in reward systems of the brain including the mesolimbic pathway. The mesolimbic pathway is active in every type of addiction and is involved with reinforcement. Because of this activation in the brain, NS has been linked to personality disorders as well as substance abuse and other addictive behaviors. DRD4 receptors are highly expressed in areas of the limbic system associated with emotion and cognition. SNPs such as rs4680 have also been examined within this realm of study. Age It is important to note the individual's age with novelty seeking. This behavior will decrease with time, especially as the brains of adolescents and young adults finalize in development. Possible factors of variation include gender, ethnicity, temperament and environment. ==See also== * Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder * Low arousal theory * Neophilia * Openness to experience * Sensation Seeking Scale ==References== Category:Personality traits ","title":"Novelty seeking"},{"id":"19328456","text":"Michael Kraft (born 23 April 1966 in Dernbach) is a former German professional football goalkeeper.

Commander Philip Wodehouse had taken command of Peterel by December 1796, when Peterel landed a small party under Lieutenant Thomas Staines on the coast of Corsica. The landing party attacked a Martello tower, which they captured, and threw its gun, a long 32-pounder, over the cliff.The Gentleman's magazine, (September 1830), pp.277-80. Peterels next captain was Commander William Proby, Lord Proby, who took over in March 1797. In June 1797, Wodehouse authorised Staines to take 20 men in two of the ship's boats to cut out a French privateer that had been preying on merchant vessels off the coast of Tuscany. After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels. In September 1798, Commander Henry Digby sailed Peterel from Gibraltar to Faro, Portugal, to deliver despatches from Earl St. Vincent for the Lisbon packet. Staines took the six men in Peterels jolly boat to deliver the despatches to the packet when the jolly boat overturned in heavy seas. Four men drowned, and Staines and the sixth man were only rescued after four hours. Peterel participated in the Capture of Menorca (1798) by the British expedition under Commodore John Duckworth. On 12 November 1798 the Spanish 40-gun frigate Flora, in company with the 40-gun Proserpina and the 34-gun ships Pomona and Casilda, captured Peterel whilst she was operating off Menorca. One of the Spanish ships fired a broadside after she surrendered.Marshall p.81. After removing the prisoners from the ship, the Spanish plundered their clothes and possessions, murdering a seaman who attempted to defend his property. Duckworth detached to pursue the sloop and on 13 November she retook Peterel and her 72-man Spanish prize crew, which was under the command of Don Antonio Franco Gandrada, Second Captain of Flora. Captain James Bowen of Argo put his own prize crew of 46 officers seamen and marines aboard Peterel. Duckworth later appointed his first lieutenant, George Jones, to command Peterel. Most of the clothes belonging to Captain Long and his officers, including Staines, were subsequently recovered.James/Chamier p.197 This charge of ill-usage was officially contradicted in the Madrid Gazette of 12 April, but was, nevertheless, essentially true.James (1837), p.197. The Spanish squadron, already being chased the next day by several British ships, completely outsailed their pursuers and returned to Cartagena with the prisoners.Cust p.154 After a detention of 14 days at Cartagena, Lieutenant Staines and his fellow prisoners were embarked in a merchant brig bound to M√°laga; but they did not arrive there until 24 December, a westerly wind having obliged the vessel to anchor off Almeria, where she was detained upwards of three weeks, and her passengers confined on shore during that period.Marshall p.82. From M√°laga, the British were marched to Gibraltar, under a strong escort of soldiers, who treated both officers and men with great brutality, but particularly Lieutenant Staines, who had received a sabre wound in the wrist whilst parrying a blow which one of those soldiers had aimed at his head. On their arrival at the rock, a court-martial was assembled to investigate the circumstances attending their capture by the Spanish squadron; and as no blame could be attached to any individual, the whole of them were sent back to the Peterel immediately after their acquittal. Captain George Long fell at Elba and on 3 February 1799 Francis Austen, the brother of author Jane Austen and future admiral of the fleet, took command of Peterel. Peterel and Austen shared in the proceeds of the capture on 18 June 1799 of the French frigates Courageuse, Alceste, and Junon, and the brigs Alerte and Salamine. Thereafter, Peterel captured or cut out from ports an armed galley, a transport brig carrying cannons and ammunition, and some twenty merchant vessels. Staines frequently commanded the cutting out expeditions. ==Napoleonic Wars== In May 1802 Staines assumed command of in the Mediterranean. He sailed her back to Britain where she was paid off in September 1805. From March 1807 through November 1809, Staines was captain of HMS Cyane. It was his service on Cyane, particularly at Naples between 25 and 27 June 1809, which cost him his arm, that led to his knighthood and the Order of Saint Ferdinand. On 17 September 1814 HMS Briton under his command, along with HMS Tagus, were the first British ships to visit the Pitcairn Islands after the Bounty and discover the fate of the mutineers - this was six and half years after the American ship Topaz rediscovered Pitcairn. However, Staines was unaware of that discovery.The Annual Biography and Obituary for the Year ..., Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1831, Volume 15 \\"Chapter X Sir Thomas Staines\\" pp. 348-374 The Gentleman's Magazine s.n., 1830.

Jim is also a four time Australian Champion having won the title in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as a five time NSW State Champion and one time Queensland and Victorian State Champion.. ==Career summary== Australia Jim Airey started racing Speedway in the early-1960s, quickly establishing himself as a star rider and won his first NSW Solo Championship at the Sydney Showground in 1966, before going on to win the Australian Championship in 1968, also held at the Showground which was his home track. Airey became known as the \\"King of the Royale\\" as he was near unbeatable on the Sydney Showground track (the Showground was known as the \\"Royale\\"). At one stage during the late 1960s Airey won a record 33 consecutive scratch races at the Showground. He wasn't totally invincible at the Showground though and regularly faced stiff competition from the likes of Bob Sharp, Gordon Guasco (who lost his life at Sydney's other speedway, Liverpool in 1970), interstate visitors such as Adelaide's John Boulger, and visiting English brothers Nigel and Eric Boocock. He followed up his 1968 Australian Championship by winning both the 1969 and 1970 championships, all held at the Sydney Showground. He won his fourth and last title in 1972 at the Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide where he defeated the reigning World Champion Ole Olsen and local hotshot, defending Australian champion John Boulger. Injury restricted him to just fourth place during the 1973 Australian Championship at the Sydney Showground which was won by Boulger. During this time Airey also won the NSW championship in 1969, 1970, 1971 before winning his last championship in 1974. Three of his five NSW titles were won at the Showground, while his 1970 and 1971 wins were at Liverpool in the days when the bikes still used the main track. He would never place second or third in the Australian Championship, only ever stepping onto the podium as the winner. Airey would also win the Queensland Championship in 1970, winning at both the Brisbane Exhibition Ground (Ekka) and the 3-lap title in Ipswich. He also won the Victorian title in 1971. Airey's NSW state title wins at Liverpool, his Qld and Victorian titles, and his national title win at Rowley Park proved to his critics that he wasn't just a one track rider. Jim Airey was one of the few speedway riders who didn't have a major crash in his career. His secret was known to be that he never rode faster than he needed to, giving himself margin for error. He chose to retire after winning his last NSW Championship in 1974 aged just thirty-three. He later went on to manage the Australian team in the late 1970s. Airey was in attendance at the Sydney Showground's final race meeting in 1996, riding a slow lap of the speedway while receiving a standing ovation from the capacity crowd. On 1 May 1999, along with 15 time World Champion Ivan Mauger, he would officially open the new Sydney Showground Speedway at the Olympic Park in Homebush. Unlike the Showground at Moore Park which ran speedway from 1926 until its closure in 1996, the new speedway would have a short life span with speedway only lasting until around 2010 when the speedway track was removed to allow for re-development into an Australian rules football/cricket stadium in 2011-12. England Airey rode successfully in the National League for the Sunderland Saints for eight meetings in 1964 before moving to the Wolverhampton Wolves for the remainder of 1964 and 1965. After not competing in England during the 1966 season, Airey returned to Wolverhampton for 1967 and 1968. He then signed with the Sheffield Tigers for 1969 and remained with the team until 1971 before retiring from the British Leagues and returning full-time to Australia. International Jim Airey rode in numerous Test Matches for Australia during his career, often captaining the team in matches held in Australia against visiting national teams. Yet his greatest international success came as a member of the Great Britain speedway team at the Olympic Stadium in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. Great Britain, containing Jim Airey from Australia, triple Speedway World Champion Ivan Mauger, four time World Champion Barry Briggs, dual World Champ Ronnie Moore (all from New Zealand), and team captain Ray Wilson, the only English rider on the team, easily won the 1971 Speedway World Team Cup scoring 37 points to defeat the Soviet Union on 22, host nation Poland on 19 and last placed Sweden on 18. Airey also qualified for his only World Championship Final in 1971 held at the Ullevi Stadium in G√∂teborg, Sweden where he finished 8th on 8 points after a win, two 2nd places and a 3rd place. To get to the World Final he had finished 11th in the British Championship Final in Coventry (the top 12 riders went through to the British-Nordic Final in Glasgow, Scotland). He then finished in an impressive 5th in the British-Nordic Final to qualify for the European Championship Final at London's Wembley Stadium where he finished 6th to qualify for what would be his only World Final appearance. Airey also represented Australia in the Speedway World Pairs Championship in 1969 (5th in the Western Zone Semi-final with Adelaide's Charlie Monk), 1970 (4th in Semi- final #1 with Monk), and lastly in 1971 where he finished 5th in the Second Semi-final with John Boulger. ==World Final Appearances== Individual World Championship * 1971 ‚Äì G√∂teborg, Ullevi ‚Äì 7th ‚Äì 8ptsBamford, R. & Shailes, G.

Before starting, the other ghosts receive 'graduation presents': they are reunited with lost loved ones or dead celebrity idols, and receive spacious apartments. However, Charlotte does not meet her dead parents and must live in a cramped dormitory, and at work she is the only ghost not to receive calls. Feeling left out, she begins to ignore her old friends and spends all her time with Maddy, her dormitory roommate and new co-worker, oblivious to the fact that Maddy is sabotaging her attempts to succeed. Meanwhile, Scarlet is feeling insecure about her long-distance relationship with Damen just as Petula, who is repeating her senior year, goes into a coma after contracting staph from a pedicure. Feeling guilty, and jealous of Damen's sudden arrival to see Petula, Scarlet uses the possession ritual Charlotte taught her to send herself into a coma and seek out Charlotte's help to find Petula's soul. Instead, Scarlet joins the new Dead Ed class, who help her to move on using \\"Early Decision\\", a risky shortcut. Meanwhile, Petula finds herself in a waiting room, accompanied by another coma patient, Virginia Johnson, a young beauty pageant contestant who is disdainful of Petula's fashion obsession, and wants to grow old normally. Gradually, the two begin to bond. Scarlet arrives at Charlotte's dormitory, much to her delight, and they sneak out to find Petula, accompanied by Maddy. However, after a disagreement at a fork in the road, Charlotte and Maddy leave Scarlet on her own. However, Pam and Prue have come after Charlotte, and they meet up with Scarlet and help her to find Petula's soul by getting directions from Green Gary to the hospital intake office. Meanwhile, Damen is desperately trying to revive Scarlet, and he decides to take Petula to Homecoming in the hope of reanimating her, and therefore ending Scarlet's quest. Maddy and Charlotte follow as Maddy tries to convince Charlotte to possess Petula. Just as Charlotte is about to complete the possession ritual, Scarlet, Pam and Prue arrive to stop her, and explain that Maddy is a murderous soul from hell attempting to turn Charlotte astray so she can \\"graduate\\" her own way. Charlotte explains that she had suspected Maddy the whole time, and had intentionally made Pam and Prue suspicious so that they could help her and Charlotte. Charlotte defeats Maddy, and reassures Scarlet that Damen is only helping Petula for Scarlet's sake. The group find Petula's soul, just as Virginia dies, and Charlotte accompanies her to Dead Ed. Petula awakes at Homecoming, and Damen quickly leaves to find Scarlet at the hospital, where they reconcile. Charlotte returns to her job at the phone bank, and is finally accepted and reunited with her parents. ==ghostgirl: Lovesick== Charlotte has finally settled into the afterlife and has a dead boyfriend - Eric. As the class are expecting to move on, they receive one more task: to help a 15-year-old in Hawthorne through their troubles in time for Prom. Pam and Prue are assigned to the Wendys, Coco to Petula, Charlotte to Damen and Eric to Scarlet. Scarlet feels out of place as she is leaving her goth fashions behind for a new, more mature look. While this is her choice, she feels Damen pushed her into it, and that he does not accept her for who she is. When Damen arrives in town for a job at the local radio station and enters one of Scarlet's songs, she feels that he is pressuring her and getting to be mad and furious. When she meets Eric, not realising he is dead, she is attracted to him, and feels he allows her to be her true self. Meanwhile, Petula's coma has left her feeling uncharacteristically philanthropic, and she has begun to donate her old clothes to the homeless, confusing the Wendys. A new girl called Darcy begins to steal her status, holding a mock trial which ends in Petula being made an outcast. She continues with her charity, hoping that her makeovers will improve the lives of those she helps and wishing for more contact from Virginia. This leads her to ask a homeless boy to attend Prom with her. When Scarlet's song is disqualified because of Damen's involvement in the entry, the pair began be disagreement and break up. Charlotte also having a disagreement with Eric over his relationship with Scarlet. Irritated, Charlotte attempts to return to the afterlife through the Dead Ed classroom, and discovers Darcy's ghost is in the new Dead Ed class after having a seizure brought on by a camera flash, and that the Darcy in the school is being possessed by someone else. With Pam and Prue, Charlotte plans to evict the evil spirit at Prom. Meanwhile, Darcy asks Damen to Prom, and Scarlet and Eric spend more time together. After they re-record Scarlet's song for the radio competition, Scarlet learns that Eric is dead, and that he never had the chance to play on stage when he was alive. Scarlet wins the radio competition and chooses as her prize to perform her song at Prom, which she redecorates as a Fantasy Funeral for Charlotte. As Damen and Darcy have their picture taken, Charlotte sabotages the camera to give Darcy another seizure, which evicts Maddy's spirit and reanimates the real Darcy. Because Maddy technically died from the seizure, she must now attend Dead Ed, while Darcy awakens confused and with no memory of the Wendys or anything else about Hawthorne High. Petula arrives at Prom with her homeless boyfriend, who turns out to be a billionaire in disguise, and the pair are crowned Prom King and Queen. Coco's work completed, Petula receives a new guardian angel - Virginia. Meanwhile, Eric and Scarlet perform onstage together before Damen and Scarlet reunite, and Eric and Charlotte dance together. After the Prom, Charlotte and Scarlet say goodbye in the graveyard, and Charlotte returns to the afterlife, where she introduces Eric to her parents. The Dead Ed class all move on except for Charlotte, who is given Mr Brain's job as the new Dead Ed teacher. ==Themes== The main themes explored in ghostgirl are popularity, obsession, love and death. The author has said that, although the book contains some elements of horror, she would describe it as a romance. ==Critical reception== The book received starred reviews from such literary publications as VOYA (Voice of Youth Advocates), Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews and School Library Journal. It received generally favourable reviews, although some sites raised concerns over the use of language. The book also reached tenth on the New York Times Best Seller list. ==Character development== ghostgirl began as a character on the website ghostgirl.com, and then was developed into a novel in March 2008. She is based on the author's experience of working with teenage celebrities and her observations on fame and popularity. ==Structure== The cover art shows the silhouette of a girl ‚Äì used throughout the book's illustrations to represent Charlotte ‚Äì in a coffin with a banner saying \\"Rest in Popularity\\". The title \\"ghostgirl\\" is the name used to refer to Charlotte after her death. The book is unusual in that the pages' proportion of height to width is much larger than usual, making it taller and thinner than most novels. Inside the book, each chapter begins with a full page illustration, including a quotation and a border of black and pink roses. The illustration usually shows Charlotte's silhouette, as shown on the cover, and forms a chain of actions as the reader progresses through the book. The page afterwards includes a short summary paragraph of a lesson Charlotte learns in the chapter, written in reverse color. The book's pages are edged with a black and pink floral border, which changes from chapter to chapter, and all illustrations within the book are in these two colours. ghostgirl: Homecoming's is similarly laid out, but with slightly different floral borders, and purple replacing pink in the color scheme. The pages are also edged in purple. Also, the illustrations do not include a quotation and do not form a chain ‚Äì each is separate. The cover displays Charlotte's face in a mirror, and is highly stylised. ghostgirl: Lovesick is similar to both books. The difference is the color of the front is red. Its front cover is a heart shaped locket with Charlotte blowing a kiss and a heart on her hand. The illustrations include a quotation and before the beginning of each chapter, it speaks of the lesson learned in each chapter. ==References *ghostgirl.com *ghostgirl.cat Category:2008 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:2008 debut novels ","title":"Ghostgirl"},{"id":"19328582","text":"Harta is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Dyn√≥w, within Rzesz√≥w County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland.

A folding propeller is a type of propeller whose blades automatically fold out when the engine is turning, and then fold back (or \\"feather\\") when the engine stops. Folding propellers are found on sailing yachts, on model airplanes, and increasingly on self- launching gliders and small motor gliders, such as the A√©riane Swift PAS. Their purpose of folding propellers is to reduce drag when sailing or soaring, respectively. Folding propeller of a motor glider Folding propellers are spun outwards by centrifugal force when the engine is turning, but when the engine stops, the pressure of airflow or waterflow forces the blades back. Typically, the blades are geared together so that they open and close in unison. Folding propellers used mainly to be two-bladed, but 3-bladed and 4-bladed versions are now available.http://www.flexofold.com/3-blade-folding- propellerhttp://www.gori-propeller.com/index.asp?ID=88 A self-feathering propeller is not more efficient than a fixed bladed prop, as neither type can adopt an optimal blade angle. Exceptions are the Brunton Autoprop and Darglow FeatherStream, which are not a typical folding propeller, but self-actuating variable-pitch propeller. On a boat, most propellers are much less effective in astern, and this is particularly true of folding propellers; whereas the Brunton AutoProp and Darglow FeatherStream are as effective astern as ahead.http://www.bruntons- propellers.comhttps://www.darglow.co.uk/featherstream/ The arguments for and against folding propellers are: {  border=\\"1\\" width=\\"50%\\" - ! Pros ! Cons -  Folding propellers reduce drag while not in use, thereby allowing for more speed or reduced fuel consumption.  Folding propellers have poor performance in astern. -  Less noise and vibration than fixed blades when not in use, since fluid flow will not cause the propeller to rotate.  They cost more than fixed propellers. -   For marine propellers, plant growth and crustaceans can hamper the propeller's operation, but this becomes a problem only if the boat is unused for lengthy periods. } ==References *Flexofold *Martec *Gori *Darglow Category:Propellers ","title":"Folding propeller"},{"id":"19328599","text":"Solar Energy is a peer-reviewed scientific journal and the official journal of the International Solar Energy Society (ISES).

Chinese Temple Incense Burner Chinese temple architecture refer to a type of structures used as place of worship of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism or Chinese folk religion, where people revere ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors. They can be classified as: * mi√†o ( ) or di√†n (), simply means \\"temple\\" and mostly enshrines gods of the Chinese pantheon, such as the Dragon King, Tudigong or Matsu; or mythical or historical figures, such as Guandi or Shennong. * c√≠ (), c√≠t√°ng (), z≈çngc√≠ () or z«îmi√†o ( ), referring to ancestral temples, mostly enshrining the ancestral gods of a family or clan. * Taoist temples and monasteries: gu√†n or d√†ogu√†n; and * Chinese Buddhist temples and monasteries: s√¨ or s√¨yu√†n * Temple of Confucius which usually functions as both temple and town school: w√©nmi√†o or k≈èngmi√†o. * Temples of City God (), which worships the patron God of a village, town or a city. * Smaller household shrines or votive niche, such as the worship of Zaoshen and Caishen.

They don't have professional priests, although Taoist priests, fashi, Confucian lisheng, and also wu and tongji shamans, may perform services within the temples. Shenist temples are usually small and decorated with traditional figures on their roofs (dragons and deities), although some evolve into significant structures. Chinese temples can be found throughout Mainland China and Taiwan, and also where Chinese expatriate communities have settled. An old name in English for Chinese traditional temples is \\"joss house\\". \\"Joss\\" is an Anglicized spelling of deus, the Portuguese word for \\"god\\". The term \\"joss house\\" was in common use in English in the nineteenth century, for example in North America during frontier times, when joss houses were a common feature of Chinatowns. The name \\"joss house\\" describes the environment of worship.

His habit of wearing his socks knee high earned him his nickname. Cooper, originally from the Albany district, started his career in the West Australian Football League. Playing mostly as a rover or centreman, he spent three seasons with Claremont-Cottesloe and won their 1931 'Best and fairest' award as well as finishing second in the Sandover Medal count to Lin Richards. After 49 games, he sought and received a clearance to Carlton and had a good debut season. He broke into the strong Carlton side in round five and was part of nine successive wins as the club made it all the way to the Grand Final. Cooper played in a forward pocket in the Grand Final loss to Richmond and despite appearing in further finals in subsequent years he never made another decider. The closest he came was when Carlton won the premiership in 1938 but he missed the Grand Final through suspension, having been charged with striking St Kilda's Doug Rayment in the final home and away fixture. Despite missing the finals series it was his most prolific season in front of goals, with 30 majors.

He wrote more than 130 research papers that helped advance the study of plant‚Äìinsect interactions, interspecific competition, predator prey interactions and food web dynamics (Eubanks et al. 2011). He studied the ecology of sap-feeding insects, both in natural and cultivated settings. His study of wing polymorphism expanded into the fields of life history evolution (e.g., Denno and Dingle 1981), plant and herbivore interactions (e.g., Denno and McClure 1983), community ecology (e.g., Denno et al. 1996), and many aspects of predator ecology, reviewed recently in Denno et al. (2005). His personal worldwide collection of butterflies numbered over 36,000 specimens. His butterfly collection was donated, at least in part, to the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity. He was Assistant Professor at Rutgers University from 1974 to 1976, moving to the University of Maryland in 1976, advancing to Associate Professor in 1979 and Professor in 1985 in the Entomology Department. == Publications == * Denno R.

Mayfield Victory departed San Francisco 11 February for the Caroline Islands, via Eniwetok, the Marshall Islands, arriving Ulithi 3 March. She remained there until 13 April when she continued on to the Ryukyu Islands for the Okinawa campaign 1 April to 21 June, the second American objective in the ‚Äúhop, skip, and jump‚Äù to the Empire of Japan warned against by Japanese Admiral Ito. The cargo ship spent 4 weeks in the area, operating with Task Group 50.8 until 23 April when she anchored in Kerama Retto. During the latter period Mayfield Victory continually issued ammunition, often under direct enemy air attack. On 14 May Mayfield Victory steamed for Ulithi, arriving the 21st. Four days later she continued on to the Philippine Islands for a 30-day stopover at Leyte. The ship then returned to Kerama Retto 1 July. On 8 July she moved to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she remained on supply duty until late October. On 25 October Mayfield Victory got underway for home, stopping at Seattle, Washington, in December before arriving San Francisco 9 February 1946. ==Post-war decommissioning== She decommissioned 5 April 1946 and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for U.S. Maritime Commission service into 1969 as a freighter operated by American Mail Line, Ltd., Seattle, Washington. ==References== * * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AK-232 Mayfield Victory Category:Boulder Victory-class cargo ships Category:Ships built in Richmond, California Category:1944 ships Category:Ammunition ships of the United States Navy Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Kentucky-related ships Category:Wilmington Reserve Fleet Category:Olympia Reserve Fleet Category:Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet ","title":"USS Mayfield Victory (AK-232)"},{"id":"19328945","text":"In statistics, Fisher consistency, named after Ronald Fisher, is a desirable property of an estimator asserting that if the estimator were calculated using the entire population rather than a sample, the true value of the estimated parameter would be obtained. == Definition == Suppose we have a statistical sample X1, ..., Xn where each Xi follows a cumulative distribution FŒ∏ which depends on an unknown parameter Œ∏. If an estimator of Œ∏ based on the sample can be represented as a functional of the empirical distribution function FÃÇn: :\\\\hat{ \\\\theta } =T(\\\\hat F_n) \\\\,, the estimator is said to be Fisher consistent if: :T(F_\\\\theta) = \\\\theta \\\\, . Cox, D.R., Hinkley D.V. (1974) Theoretical Statistics, Chapman and Hall, . (defined on p287) As long as the Xi are exchangeable, an estimator T defined in terms of the Xi can be converted into an estimator T‚Ä≤ that can be defined in terms of FÃÇn by averaging T over all permutations of the data. The resulting estimator will have the same expected value as T and its variance will be no larger than that of T. If the strong law of large numbers can be applied, the empirical distribution functions FÃÇn converge pointwise to FŒ∏, allowing us to express Fisher consistency as a limit -- the estimator is Fisher consistent if : T \\\\left( \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\hat F_n \\\\right) = \\\\theta. \\\\, ==Finite population example== Suppose our sample is obtained from a finite population Z1, ..., Zm. We can represent our sample of size n in terms of the proportion of the sample ni / n taking on each value in the population. Writing our estimator of Œ∏ as T(n1 / n, ..., nm / n), the population analogue of the estimator is T(p1, ..., pm), where pi = P(X = Zi). Thus we have Fisher consistency if T(p1, ..., pm) = Œ∏. Suppose the parameter of interest is the expected value Œº and the estimator is the sample mean, which can be written : n^{-1}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^mI(X_i=Z_j)Z_j, where I is the indicator function. The population analogue of this expression is : n^{-1}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^mp_jZ_j = n^{-1}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\mu = \\\\mu, so we have Fisher consistency. == Role in maximum likelihood estimation == Maximising the likelihood function L gives an estimate that is Fisher consistent for a parameter b if : E\\\\left[ \\\\frac{d\\\\ln L}{db} \\\\right] = 0\\\\text{ at }b=b_0, \\\\, where b0 represents the true value of b.http://economics.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-fisher-consistency.htm ==Relationship to asymptotic consistency and unbiasedness== The term consistency in statistics usually refers to an estimator that is asymptotically consistent. Fisher consistency and asymptotic consistency are distinct concepts, although both aim to define a desirable property of an estimator. While many estimators are consistent in both senses, neither definition encompasses the other. For example, suppose we take an estimator Tn that is both Fisher consistent and asymptotically consistent, and then form Tn + En, where En is a deterministic sequence of nonzero numbers converging to zero. This estimator is asymptotically consistent, but not Fisher consistent for any n. Alternatively, take a sequence of Fisher consistent estimators Sn, then define Tn = Sn for n < n0, and Tn = Sn0 for all n ‚â•n0. This estimator is Fisher consistent for all n, but not asymptotically consistent. A concrete example of this construction would be estimating the population mean as X1 regardless of the sample size. The sample mean is a Fisher consistent and unbiased estimate of the population mean, but not all Fisher consistent estimates are unbiased. Suppose we observe a sample from a uniform distribution on (0,Œ∏) and we wish to estimate Œ∏. The sample maximum is Fisher consistent, but downwardly biased. Conversely, the sample variance is an unbiased estimate of the population variance, but is not Fisher consistent. ==Role in decision theory== A loss function is Fisher consistent if the population minimizer of the risk leads to the Bayes optimal decision rule.http://www.stat.osu.edu/~yklee/881/consistency.pdf ==References== Category:Estimation theory ","title":"Fisher consistency"},{"id":"19328947","text":"Jason Drysdale (born 17 November 1970 in Bristol) is an English former footballer.

This instrument is a multi-channel imaging radiometer with the principal objective of providing data concerning global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to the high levels of accuracy and stability required for monitoring and carrying out research into the behaviour of the Earth‚Äôs climate. AATSR can measure Earth's surface temperature to a precision of , for climate research. Among the secondary objectives of AATSR is the observation of environmental parameters such as aerosols, clouds, fires, gas flares, water content, biomass, and vegetal health and growth. AATSR is the successor of ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, payloads of ERS-1 and ERS-2. ==Details==  Accuracy  The required accuracies are better than 0.3 ¬∞C with a stability approaching 0.1 ¬∞C /decade. Because of its wide angle lens it is possible to make very precise measurements of atmospheric effects on how emissions from the Earth's surface propagate. In order to achieve this accuracy while viewing the Earth's surface through the atmosphere, AATSR views the surface at two angles, one close to the nadir (immediately below the satellite) and the other along the satellite track at close to 55¬∞ from the nadir, thereby providing two views of each point on the Earth's surface, each with a different effective atmospheric thickness. This dual-view system enables a particularly accurate estimate to be made of the signal degradation due to atmospheric absorption and scattering.  Calibration  AATSR also embodies an exceptionally precise and stable on-board calibration system, comprising two reference targets specially designed for high uniformity and stability. These two targets, known as 'black bodies' are maintained at temperatures near to the extremes of the Earth temperatures as measured by AATSR and they are both viewed during each scan cycle of the instrument. This calibration system ensures that measurements of thermal radiation from the Earth‚Äôs surface are properly calibrated and do not rely on ground-based measurements, although such measurements are continually used to evaluate AATSR‚Äôs performance.  Channels  AATSR has three channels at thermal infrared wavelengths, from which surface temperatures are derived over both sea and land surfaces. In addition, AATSR has four visible and near-infrared wavelength channels which are used to identify cloudy areas and to measure solar radiation that is scattered and reflected from the Earth‚Äôs surface and atmosphere. These channels provide measurements from which land-cover properties, for example, NDVI, as well as clouds and atmospheric particulate matter (or aerosols) can be studied. The dual-view measurements provided by the along-track scanning technique is also a key feature of AATSR when used for atmospheric or vegetation measurements. As with the SST measurements, the two measurements of each point on the surface through different atmospheric path lengths greatly simplifies the task of separating the surface and atmospheric contributions to the measured signal. Thus the effects of atmospheric aerosols can be removed from surface products (such as surface reflectance or NDVI). Conversely, a similar approach can be used to account for the surface reflectance in determining aerosol or cloud properties. Additionally, the parallax between the two views can be used to determine cloud top and aerosol plume heights using geometric means.  Importance  One of the most important aspects of the ATSR series of space instruments is that it has, over a period of just over 15 years, undergone the transition from experimental sensor on the ERS satellites, developing the technique and demonstrating the accuracy that can be achieved with along-track scanning, to that of an operational system, within Europe‚Äôs Envisat and future GMES Programmes. == Funding and Origin == The AATSR is a nationally provided instrument, funded by the UK‚Äôs Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in order to support their programme of climate prediction and research. It was developed and is operated in collaboration with ESA. There is also a significant Australian contribution to the AATSR programme, now managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The predecessor instruments, ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, were funded by the UK's Science and Engineering Research Council. This funding responsibility was transferred to the UK's Natural Environment Research Council in 1993. == Predecessors == AATSR is the third in a series of instruments started by ATSR-1, which was launched in 1991 on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite, ERS-1. This was followed by ATSR-2 on ERS-2 in 1995 and by AATSR on the Envisat satellite in 2002. The original ATSR-1 instrument lacked the three shortest wavelength channels provided by AATSR, whereas ATSR-2 was functionally identical. This has led to a near-continuous SST dataset extending from 1991 to the present day. Looking to the future, a successor instrument is being developed to fly on ESA‚Äôs Sentinel 3 satellite, which is part of the space segment of the European Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme. This will ensure the continuity of AATSR-standard SST data into the foreseeable future. ==Successor== The Sentinel 3 Earth observational satellite will house many earth observational instruments including SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) which is the successor to AATSR. == See also  References == *Mutlow, C.T., Zavody, A.M., Barton, I.J. and Llewellyn-Jones, D.T.; Sea-surface temperature-measurements by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer on the ERS-1 Satellite - early results.

It is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) with a half life of 2‚Äì15 years. Concerns were raised about its use in the 1940s but the publication of Rachael Carson's book Silent Spring was the catalyst leading to DDT being banned. DDT was first banned in Hungary in 1968 then in Norway and Sweden in 1970, the US in 1972 and the United Kingdom in 1984. ==Usage== DDT was used extensively for agricultural use in the 1950s and 1960s to control grass grub and porina moth. It was also used on lawns and for market gardens. Some 500 tons was being applied annually by 1959. By the 1970s its use was restricted and it was finally banned in 1989. ==Residues== There was increasing evidence, especially in the 1970s, that there were DDT residues in aquatic organisms including trout and eels. Being bioaccumulative DDT passes up the food chain and organisms at higher trophic levels end up with high concentrations of the pesticide. Some Canterbury and Southland farms have elevated levels of DDT and a programme run by the Ministry of Agriculture ensures that exported meat and dairy produce have low levels of these residues. During dry periods animals ingest soil since grass is shorter and sparser and the DDT residue on the soil is retained by the animal. In the 1980s 40% of the lambs in Canterbury, a region with low rainfall and occasional droughts, had DDT levels that were above the European Union's permitted limit but still acceptable under safe tolerance limits for New Zealand. Mapua was one of the most contaminated sites in New Zealand due to pesticide residues in the soils from a now defunct factory. In the 1940s organomercury and organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, DDD, dieldrin, 2,4-D and paraquat, were produced. The factory closed in 1988 and the site was subjected to a major cleanup operation in the 2000s. DDT has also been found in the endangered Hectors dolphin which inhabits the coastal regions on New Zealand. ==Stockholm Convention== The New Zealand government has signed and ratified the Stockholm Convention which controls the production and use of persistent organic pesticides, and therefore includes DDT. It came into law on 23 December 2004. Article 3.1(b) of the Convention restricts the production and use of DDT but since there is no intention to use DDT in New Zealand there is no action required under the Convention. ==See also== *Pesticides in New Zealand *Environmental effects of pesticides ==References== New Zealand Category:Pesticides in New Zealand ","title":"DDT in New Zealand"},{"id":"19329005","text":"The Dornoch Firth Bridge is a road bridge over the Dornoch Firth, carrying traffic between Tain and Dornoch. ==History== It was built for the Scottish Office.

The Dornoch Bridge was to be the final link in the chain. Tenders were open to bid from 1986. 40 companies showed an interest in the contract. Ove Arup and Crouch Hogg Waterman of Glasgow produced a set of initial design parameters for companies to build. The joint-venture chosen to build the bridge put in a quote for ¬£9.5 million, and won the contract in early 1988. There were proposals that the bridge should be constructed so as to allow the Far North railway line to also benefit from the shorter route, with the potential for up to 45 minutes to be saved on the journey between Inverness and Thurso/Wick. However this part of the scheme failed to secure government funding, and so only a road bridge was built.

Eventually, he becomes one of her closest confidants. Makiko finally reveals her true nature to her husband, Naoki, who decides to get a divorce. Meanwhile, a close friend of Riku's, Chika, tells Yoko that he is about to move away. Her friends attempt to get Yoko to confess through a live T.V. program but her sister storms in and starts yelling at her, just before Yoko is about to confess. Makiko is hauled away by security.

Venkatesh is an Indian film director and actor working in Tamil cinema. Beginning his career as an assistant, he directed his first film Mahaprabhu (1996). ==Career== Initially, he worked as an assistant to director K. Rajeshwar on Nyaya Tharasu (1989) and Idhaya Thamarai (1990). He assisted Pavithran on Vasanthakala Paravai (1991) and Suriyan (1992), then he was an associate director to director Shankar on Gentleman (1993) and Kadhalan (1994). During the shooting of the film Kadhalan, producer G. K. Reddy approached him to direct a film. In 1996, he made his directional debut through Mahaprabhu starring R. Sarathkumar, Sukanya and Vineetha. He has directed Vijay's movies including action film Selva (1996) and romance film Nilaave Vaa (1998). In 1999, he directed a drama film Pooparika Varugirom starring Sivaji Ganesan, Vikram Krishna and Malavika. Following the death of director Thirupathisamy in 2001, Venkatesh was briefly announced as the new director of the film Velan featuring Vijay and Priyanka Chopra, but the project was later shelved. He started directing action movies with Prashanth's Chocolate (2001), Vijay's Bhagavathi (2002), and Silambarasan's Dum (2003) and Kuthu (2004). These were followed by Sarathkumar's Aai (2004), Chanakya (2005) and Arjun's Vathiyar (2006). He is known for directing films in short spans of time. During 2008, Venkatesh worked simultaneously on six productions, which were at different stages of completion. The Arjun-starrer Durai (2008) and Arun Vijay's Malai Malai (2009) were released first, while Sundar C's Vaadaa (2010) and Bharath's Killadi (2015) had delayed releases. Two further films, Prashanth's Petrol and Sarathkumar's Imaya Malai, were subsequently shelved mid-production. He has also acted in various Tamil movies, notably Angadi Theru (2010). Venkatesh returned after a two-and-a-half year break with Nethra (2019). The filmmaker says the delay is because he had to fulfil commitments as an actor before he could get back to direction. The film is a psycho- thriller based on a true event which he was witness to at an airport in Canada.http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2019/feb/07/chocolate- director-venkatesh-returns-with-nethraa-1935393.html ==Filmography== As Director {  - ccc; text- align:center;\\" !

Architectural objects have a relationship to one another and interact with each other intelligently. For example, a window has a relationship to the wall that contains it. If you move or delete the wall, the window reacts accordingly. Objects can be represented in both 2D and 3D. In addition, intelligent architectural objects maintain dynamic links with construction documents and specifications, resulting in more accurate project deliverables. When someone deletes or modifies a door, for example, the door schedule can be automatically updated. Spaces and areas update automatically when certain elements are changed, calculations such as square footage are always up to date. AutoCAD vs AutoCAD Architecture AutoCAD Architecture uses the DWG file format but an object enabler is needed to access, display, and manipulate object data in applications different from AutoCAD Architecture. AutoCAD Architecture was formerly known as AutoCAD Architectural Desktop (often abbreviated ADT) but Autodesk changed its name for the 2008 edition. The change was made to better match the names of Autodesk's other discipline- specific packages, such as AutoCAD Electrical and AutoCAD Mechanical. As of AutoCAD 2019 all discipline-specific packages are included as Industry- Specific Toolsets with AutoCAD subscription but still as individual installers. == Version history == {  - !

As an artist she had a special interest in Pacific Island peoples and their environments. In high school she held the Amateur Rocketry Association‚Äôs High Altitude Record. After growing up in Denver and earning an art degree, she served with the Peace Corps on remote atolls in Micronesia and traveled interisland on traditional sailing canoes. She found that her oil paints were too dull to capture the vivid colors of the reefs and lagoons, so she began ‚Äúpainting with words‚Äù by keeping a detailed journal of people and cultural events. She later assisted with anthropological field work in Micronesia, and went on to earn an M.A. in Journalism at the University of South Carolina. She was a news editor and feature writer and did many feature stories for the Hawaii Tribune Herald. She graduated from the 1984 Clarion West Science Fiction Writer‚Äôs Workshop. Carol wrote short stories, a prize-winning play and published four novels. Reefsong won the 1992 Compton Crook Award for the Best First Novel in the Field. The Island Warrior Series; Demon Drums, Storm Caller, and Sorcerous Sea are based partly on Pacific Island folklore, environments, and the conflict between good and evil. All her novels are available through Open Road Media. Severance was born in Ohio and grew up in Denver, Colorado. She served with the Peace Corps from 1966-1968 Everyone Everywhere Has Tales to Tell (biographical story published on the Peace Corps web site.

Volumnius and Brutus had been students of philosophy together. Volumnius accompanied Brutus on his fateful campaign to the East, which culminated in Brutus' suicide after his defeat by the Triumvirs in the Second Battle of Philippi (October 23, 42 BC). The historian Plutarch, in his Life of Brutus, uses Volumnius' recollections as a source for an account of the prodigies which supposedly preceded the death of Brutus. Volumnius' writings were also drawn upon by Plutarch for first-hand information on the last hours of Brutus in the aftermath of the battle.Plutarch, Life of Brutus, chapter 48 Volumnius was asked by Brutus to assist him in his suicide, but Volumnius refused the request. The well-known quote by Brutus calling down a curse upon Mark Antony was also taken from the memoirs of Volumnius: Forget not, Zeus, the author of these crimes (in the Dryden translation this passage is given as Punish, great Jove, the illustrator of these ills).Plutarch, Life of Brutus, chapter 48 Plutarch wrote that, according to Volumnius, Brutus repeated two verses, but Volumnius was only able to recall the one quoted.

At Southampton, alongside his brother Matthew, he progressed through the academy and reserve sides before being promoted to the first team ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his Southampton first team debut as substitute in a League Cup match against Birmingham City on 26 August 2008. He made his league debut at home against Barnsley on 20 September 2008.

Westman conducted his own architectural firm in Malm√∂ in 1936‚Äì38 and then in Lund. In Westmans villa, built in 1939-1940, Westman combines modernism of the time with his own, new thoughts. In addition to housing for his family, it was also furnished to the architect's own office. His works united regional cultural tradition with functionalism, attempting to create a new, Westmannian regional architecture instead of recreating old models. At the same time, Westman resented functionalists' neglect of the human factor that manifested itself in large scale buildings with routinely applied monotonous patterns. Westman's critique became a driving motive for a humanistic development in architecture of Lund.Tomas Tagil. Arkitekten Hans Westman, funktionalismen och den regionala s√§rarten.

He also represented Dunfermline Athletic in the Scottish Premier League and Edmonton Brickmen in the Canadian Soccer League. He made more than 200 appearances for nearly 20 clubs during his career. He later coached non-League Romulus. ==Playing career== Born in Birmingham, Barnett began his youth career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was released without making an appearance. He then joined non-league sides Boldmere St. Michaels and then Alvechurch before being picked up by Windsor & Eton. From here, he was signed by Colchester United manager Roger Brown on 27 August 1988. He was sent off on his professional debut in the opening-day fixture of the 1988‚Äì89 season, becoming only the second U's player after Nigel Crouch to be dismissed on their maiden appearance for the club. After serving his suspension, Barnett was again sent off in only his seventh league game during a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Scunthorpe United on 8 October 1988. His disciplinary record earned him the nickname \\"Psycho\\" with the Colchester fans, but his time at the club came to an abrupt end on 24 February 1989 when manager Jock Wallace watched him commit an off- the-ball indiscretion during a reserve game. After his Colchester exit, Barnett moved to Canada to play for Canadian Soccer League club Edmonton Brickmen where he played alongside Justin Fashanu. Barnett returned to England in October 1989 to sign for West Bromwich Albion on a non-contract basis, though he failed to make a first-team appearance for the Baggies. He then moved to Walsall for the early part of the 1990‚Äì91 season before returning to non-league football with Kidderminster Harriers. Here, he made 39 Conference appearances and helped the club to Wembley for the 1991 FA Trophy final, in which they finished runners-up to Wycombe Wanderers. Barnett was signed by Barry Fry at Barnet for a ¬£17,000 fee in February 1992 and aided the club to promotion from the Third Division in 1992‚Äì93. As the Bee's struggled in the higher tier, Barnett was loaned to his hometown club Birmingham City in December 1993 where he played twice, before returning to Barnet who were subsequently relegated. While at Underhill, Barnett made 59 league appearances and scored three goals. Birmingham City eventually signed Barnett on a permanent basis in February 1994, once again teaming up with Barry Fry who had been appointed manager at St Andrew's. Signing for ¬£150,000, the club were relegated to the Second Division in 1994 but Barnett helped the club gain immediate promotion back to the First Division as a virtual ever-present feature of the first-team. He also made another Wembley appearance, this time in the 1995 Football League Trophy Final, which City won 1‚Äì0 over Carlisle United with a golden goal from Paul Tait. However, he did not feature in the 1995‚Äì96 season and played just six games in 1996‚Äì97 under new manager Trevor Francis, and so left for Dunfermline Athletic in July 1997. Barnett featured 21 times for Dunfermline in the Scottish Premier Division during the 1997‚Äì98 season, scoring once to help Bert Paton's side retain their top-flight status. However, before the season was up, Barnett made a deadline day loan move to Port Vale, where he made nine appearances and scored one goal. During the close season, the move back to England was made permanent as he made 27 further appearances for Vale. His final professional transfer came following a successful trial spell at Lincoln City in the summer of 1999, where he made 22 league appearances and netted three times. While with Lincoln, Barnett had a three-game loan spell in the Conference with Forest Green Rovers. Notified by Lincoln that he would be given a free transfer at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Barnett ended up with an injury prior to his release and in turn announced his retirement. ==International career== In 2000, Barnett was due to play international football for the Cayman Islands, but a Football Association veto blocked the efforts of nations such as the Cayman Islands acquiring English players. ==Coaching career== After finishing his professional playing career, Barnett joined the Birmingham City Academy as a part-time coach, before joining Halesowen Town as first-team coach in March 2001. He then took up his Academy role at Birmingham in a full-time capacity. Barnett would later turn out for Moor Green, where he made five appearances in 2002. Following his return from the United States in the summer of 2009, Barnett signed for Romulus in August and was subsequently appointed first-team coach at the club in February 2010 after initially refusing to be involved in coaching at the club having obtained a UEFA 'A' Licence. He agreed to continue his role at the club for the 2010‚Äì11 season, however, his disciplinary issues continued after being given a six-match suspension and a ¬£100 fine by the FA following four breaches of FA Rule E3 - language and/or behaviour amounting to improper conduct - following a match with Belper Town in November 2012. He stepped down as manager in January after deciding to concentrate on activities outside football. ==Statistics== Source: {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Colchester United 1988‚Äì89 Fourth Division 2004050290 - West Bromwich Albion 1989‚Äì90 Second Division 00000000 - Walsall 1990‚Äì91 Fourth Division 50002070 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Barnet 1991‚Äì92 Fourth Division 40001050 - 1992‚Äì93 Third Division 3621040412 - 1993‚Äì94 Second Division 1512060231 - 1994‚Äì95 Second Division 40000040 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !59!!3!!3!!0!!11!!0!!73!!3 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Birmingham City 1993‚Äì94 First Division 90000090 - 1994‚Äì95 Second Division 3105090450 - 1995‚Äì96 First Division 00000000 - 1996‚Äì97 First Division 60000060 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !46!!0!!5!!0!!9!!0!!60!!0 - Dunfermline Athletic 1997‚Äì98 Scottish Premier Division 2112030261 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Port Vale 1997‚Äì98 First Division 91000091 - 1998‚Äì99 First Division 2701000280 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !36!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!37!!1 - Lincoln City 1999‚Äì2000 Third Division 2233120274 - Forest Green Rovers (loan) 1999‚Äì2000 Conference 30000030 } ==Honours== ;Kidderminster Harriers *FA Trophy runner-up: 1991 ;Birmingham City *Football League Second Division winner: 1994‚Äì95 *Football League Trophy winner: 1995 :All honours referenced by: ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in Canada Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Boldmere St. Michaels F.C. players Category:Alvechurch F.C. players Category:Windsor & Eton F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Edmonton Brickmen players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Category:Barnet F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Dunfermline Athletic F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Forest Green Rovers F.C. players Category:Halesowen Town F.C. players Category:Moor Green F.C. players Category:Romulus F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Canadian Soccer League (1987‚Äì1992) players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Northern Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Romulus F.C. managers Category:Association football coaches Category:Birmingham City F.C. non- playing staff ","title":"Dave Barnett (footballer)"},{"id":"19329551","text":"Arkhawang is a village and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

According to it, vowels in Latin lengthen before Proto-Indo-European voiced stops which are followed by another (unvoiced) stop. Compare: * PIE * 'led' > ƒÅctus (cf. short vowel in Ancient Greek √°g≈ç) * PIE * 'fortified' > pƒÅctus (cf. short vowel in Sanskrit pajr√°s) * PIE *tegtos 'covered' > tƒìctus (cf. short vowel in Ancient Greek st√©g≈ç) According to Lachmann's law is an example of sound law that affects deep phonological structure, not the surface result of phonological rules. In Proto-Indo-European, a voiced stop was already pronounced as voiceless before voiceless stops, as the assimilation by voicedness must have been operational in PIE ( ‚Üí 'forced, made'). Lachmann's law, however, did not act upon the result of the assimilation, but on the deep structure > *agtos > ƒÅctus. Indo- Europeanists reject this explanation, generally believing that the voiced finals were analogically restored in the appropriate forms before being deleted again. For example, defends the Neogrammarian analysis of Lachmann's law as analogy followed by sound change (*aktos ‚áí *agtos > *ƒÅgtos > ƒÅctus). Although this formulation ultimately derives from de Sausurre (1885: 256), Jasanoff's formulation also explains problems such as: *magismÃ•os > *magsomos > mƒÅximus /mƒÅksimus/ *aksƒ´- ‚áí *agsƒ´- > ƒÅxƒ´- /ƒÅksƒ´-/ *p≈çds > *p≈çs(s) ‚áí *ped-s > *pƒìts > pƒìs(s) The law also does not operate before PIE voiced aspirate stops. Based on this, the glottalic theory reinterprets the law not to reflect lengthening before voiced stops, but before glottalized stops. In that case the assumption that we are dealing with an example of sound law that affects deep phonological structure is not required. ==See also== * Winter's law, a similar law operating in Balto-Slavic ==References== * .

It was most active from 2003 through 2012, when most of its editing community left and brought their contributions to the nonprofit Wikivoyage guide. The site was launched by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins in 2003 as a multilingual effort aiming to cover all of the globe's destinations. In 2006, Internet Brands bought the trademark and servers and later introduced advertising to the website. This move met opposition from users, with many German and Italian editors leaving in December 2006 for a newly established wiki, Wikivoyage. In 2006, Wikitravel launched a free media repository known as Wikitravel Shared, and in 2007, it received a Webby Award for Best Travel Website. The same year, Wikitravel's founders began Wikitravel Press, a now-defunct project that published printed travel guides based on the website's content. The first print guides were released on February 1, 2008. In 2012, in response to sustained dissatisfaction with Internet Brands' commercialization and technical support, a large portion of the editing community, including the founders, left and transferred their contributions to the Wikivoyage travel guide, which was relaunched as a Wikimedia Foundation‚Äìhosted project in January 2013. Since then, Wikivoyage has surpassed Wikitravel in edit count, page count, and global viewership. ==History== Annotated map of the 1st arrondissement of Paris generated for a guide to travel of Wikitravel from OpenStreetMap data Wikitravel was started in July 2003 by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins, partly inspired by Wikipedia. To allow individuals, tourism agencies, and others to make free reprints of individual pages more easily than permitted by the GNU Free Documentation License (used by Wikipedia at that time) it used the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license. Since Wikipedia and Wikitravel are licensed under the Attribution ShareAlike license, appropriate content can be shared between the two so long as licensing requirements are met. Wikitravel does not have a neutral-point-of-view requirement, as it is written from the point of view of a traveler and, instead, encourages editors to \\"be fair\\". Wikitravel encourages original research in its content, and therefore does not generally require citation, but it does require contributions to comply with its Manual of Style, to provide an easily recognised and consistent layout and appearance, and to avoid touting. On April 20, 2006, Wikitravel announced that it and ‚Äîanother open-content wiki travel guide founded in 1999‚Äîhad been acquired by Internet Brands, a publicly traded corporation. The new owner hired Prodromou and Jenkins to continue managing Wikitravel as a consensus-based project. They explained that Internet Brands' long-term plan was for Wikitravel to continue to focus on collaborative, objective guides, while World66 would focus more on personal experiences and reviews. In response, many authors of the German language community chose to fork the German Wikitravel, which was released on December 10, 2006, as Wikivoyage. The German language Wikitravel remains active. On April 1, 2008, Internet Brands added Google advertising to Wikitravel, with an opt-out procedure for registered users. On May 1, 2007, Wikitravel received the Webby Award for Best Travel Website. On June 16, 2008, Wikitravel was named one of the \\"50 Best Websites of 2008\\" by Time magazine. On August 3, 2007, Prodromou, Jenkins, and long-time contributor Jani Patokallio started Wikitravel Press, a company that produces and sells print guidebooks based on material contributed to Wikitravel. The first Wikitravel Press guides, Chicago and Singapore, were launched on February 1, 2008. Content in these guidebooks was available under the same Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license under which Wikitravel material is licensed. The Wikitravel trademarks were licensed to Wikitravel Press, but there was otherwise no connection to Internet Brands. Wikitravel Press ceased to operate in 2011. On January 1, 2010, the content of Wikitravel was migrated to the updated Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 license. In mid-2012, a proposal was floated by members of the editing community to fork their work at Wikitravel (forking in this context means to move editing activities and current content to a new host, in accordance with the site license) and re-merge with the travel website Wikivoyage‚Äîwhich had been a fork of German and Italian language Wikitravel some years before‚Äîand to then seek hosting of the merged sites by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.The Case of Wikitravel and Wikivoyage Governance Across Borders, July 2012 Internet Brands opposed this move and sued one Wikitravel contributor and one Wikipedia contributor, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and civil conspiracy. This move was opposed by individuals and by the Wikimedia Foundation as being an example of a SLAPP lawsuit‚Äîone undertaken without plausible legal grounds with a primary intent being to deter, overwhelm, or frustrate persons engaged in fully lawful actions. Community fork in 2012 In 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction with Wikitravel's host and owner Internet Brands, it was proposed that the community at Wikitravel fork (split off) their work and editing activities from Wikitravel and Wikitravel Shared and‚Äîwith the existing sites at Wikivoyage‚Äîmerge to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the owner of Wikipedia and a large range of other non-profit reference sites based upon wiki communities., Travel Guide proposal on Wikimedia meta-wiki(Revision as of 20:12, 24 August 2012), Wikivoyage Migration FAQ (Revision as of 23:15, 26 August 2012) The dissatisfaction related to long-standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive monetization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.Migration FAQ at Wikivoyage, 25 Oct 2012 After lengthy discussion by users of the three communities and comments by their respective hosts, and confirmation by the Wikimedia Foundation that it would host a travel project if users wished, the majority of administrators and bureaucrats at Wikitravel decided to fork their existing work to Wikivoyage., Discussions (towards the bottom) on Wikitravel's Travellers' Pub regarding the migration to Wikimedia/Wikivoyage (Revision as of 01:16, 26 August 2012)Part of the discussion at Wikivoyage, of move to WMF 25 Oct 2012Analysis of the situation, findings, discussions, and resolutions by the Wikimedia Foundation and its user community: comprehensive resources at Wikimedia.org, as at 25 October 2012 The contents of Wikitravel and its related 'Commons' (images, video and other media files) in all languages and of Wikitravel Commons were downloaded as a 'database dump' in preparation for such a migration on August 2, 2012 and as the starting point for the existing wiki. Forking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is permitted by the Creative Commons license in use on sites such as Wikitravel; the wiki software used for Wikitravel included that facility, although Internet Brands disabled the function shortly after this date to forestall the attempt at data migration or forking.

In September 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation filed a complaint in San Francisco County Superior Court on behalf of Holliday and Heilman asking the court to declare that \\"forking has and remains a legal activity.\\" In February 2013 the parties settled their litigation.

He was the founding director of the Canberra School of Music and is commemorated by Llewellyn Hall, the concert venue at the School. ==Early career== Ernest Llewellyn was born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales in 1915. He was educated at Kurri Kurri State School, Maitland High School, and, for six months, at the NSW Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. In 1933 the 17-year-old Llewellyn gave a ‚Äògrand farewell violin recital‚Äô at the West Maitland Town Hall. It was later decided that the money raised by the concert and by public appeal should be given to those suffering in the Great Depression. In 1934 he commenced studies with Jascha Gopinko. From 1934 to 1937 he was the violist in the Sydney String Quartet and the leader of the viola section of the ABC Sydney Orchestra. In 1936 he appeared as a solo violinist under the baton of Sir Malcolm Sargent. He was offered the position of deputy leader of the Scottish Orchestra, but turned it down. That year he married Ruth Smith, daughter of the violin and viola maker A.E. Smith, whose wedding gift was a violin of his own making. In 1940 he moved to Melbourne to become Deputy Leader of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. He also taught at the University of Melbourne, and was the leader of the Melbourne University String Quartet. He served his country between 1942 and 1944 in the Royal Australian Air Force. From 1944 to 1948 he was leader of the Queensland State String Quartet (QSSQ), taking them on a tour of New Zealand in 1948 at the invitation of the Wellington Chamber Music Society. Reviews of the tour led to the establishment of the New Zealand Federation of Chamber Music Clubs. In 1947, Isaac Stern visited Australia for the first time. He attended a performance by the QSSQ and was impressed by the tonal qualities of the violin being played by Llewellyn. Stern went backstage to meet Llewellyn and learned about A.E. Smith for the first time. The next morning they swapped instruments and played together; the two became lifelong friends.W. L. Hoffmann, \\"Lest we forget Isaac Stern\\", Canberra Times, 24 October 2001 In 1949 Ernest Llewellyn and Hephzibah Menuhin (then married to an Australian and living in western Victoria) presented the complete violin sonatas of Beethoven in a series of recitals in the eastern states of Australia. ==Sydney Symphony Orchestra== Llewellyn was appointed Concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1949, and Assistant Conductor in 1959. From 1949 to 1955 he was the leader of the ABC String Quartet. In 1952 he again toured New Zealand, this time as part of the Llewellyn-Kennedy Piano Trio (with John Kennedy, cello, and Scylla Kennedy, piano; they were the parents of Nigel Kennedy, although they never married). When Isaac Stern toured Australia again in 1954, he and Llewellyn played Bach's Double Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The pianist William Kapell had recently been killed in a plane crash while returning from his Australian tour, and Stern set up the William Kapell Memorial Fund to bring notable musicians to the US for wider experience. Stern gave a concert in Sydney in July 1954 for the William Kapell Memorial Fund, and ensured that Ernest Llewellyn was the inaugural recipient. At the same time he was awarded a Fulbright grant to study teaching methods in the US, the UK and Europe for 15 months. He spent most of his time studying with Isaac Stern at the Juilliard School in New York. In the 1950s Ernest Llewellyn inaugurated and directed music camps and festivals for the National Music Camp Association and for Musica Viva Australia at Mittagong. He also directed workshops through Musica Viva and the Musica Viva Younger Group. ==Canberra School of Music== Llewellyn resigned from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1964 to devote his time to full-time teaching. He intended to teach privately in Wollongong, Goulburn, Mittagong and Canberra, and to establish regional orchestras. A year later, in September 1965, at the invitation of the Department of the Interior, he became founding director of the Canberra School of Music, immediately appointing some of the finest performers in the country to the staff, including Larry Sitsky (keyboard), Vincent Edwards (strings) and Murray Khouri (woodwind). During his time as Director he continued to perform, taking part in many of the School's faculty concerts, leading the Canberra String Quartet, and in 1966 becoming musical director and conductor of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, a semi- professional full symphony orchestra that was formed out of the amateur Canberra Orchestral Society by joining its forces with staff and students from the School of Music. Between 1969 and 1979, the Canberra Symphony's annual program under Llewellyn featured masterworks of the choral repertoire (including Orff's Carmina Burana, Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, Beethoven's Choral Symphony and the Verdi Requiem) performed with a combined choir known as the Singers of Canberra, made up of the leading choral organisations in the city: the Canberra Choral Society, ANU Choral Society, Canberra Philharmonic and Canberra Society of Singers.Peter Campbell, \\"Canberra Choral Society: A Capital Choir for a Capital City\\" (Canberra: PC Publishing, 2002), 64-5. The Canberra School of Music operated until 1976 in temporary premises that were previously the Manuka Mothercraft Centre. In 1976 he was given approval to proceed with his plans for a permanent School of Music in Canberra. He based his conception of the School as a centre of excellence on the Juilliard School, and he regarded Isaac Stern as the \\"father\\" of the school. He envisioned one that would not only be a centre of creativity and performance but also be the home of a world-class concert venue. Stern inspected the school in its early stages while on his last concert tour of Australia in the early 1970s. Llewellyn had insisted from the outset that the building should be located on a site that was both central to the Australian National University and the city centre, easily accessible for both students and patrons. Together with the Melbourne architect Daryl Jackson, Llewellyn produced a final plan that was architecturally innovative and original, and which ensured that the building would continue to be recognised historically as a unique piece of architecture. The concert hall has indeed become world- class, and was named Llewellyn Hall in 1980 on his retirement as Director of the School of Music. Llewellyn was invited to attend the fifth International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow as an ‚Äòhonoured guest‚Äô in 1974, and in 1978 he became the first Australian to serve on a jury in the Tchaikovsky competition. In 1979 and 1980 he visited China to advise on teaching methods. The 1979 visit was at the invitation of the String Department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to advise on teaching methods and give master classes in Beijing and Shanghai. The second visit was arranged under the Cultural Relations program. ==Retirement== Llewellyn retired as Director of the Canberra School of Music and as conductor of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra in 1980. In 1981-82 he established the Wollongong Branch of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Plans were in hand for a third visit to China and an exchange visit to Ottawa to conduct the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and to advise on the establishment of a Conservatorium there, but he died on 12 July 1982, in Sydney. He is survived by his wife Ruth Llewellyn and his sons Dafydd and Richard. Later that month the retiring Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen announced that the proceeds of his farewell concert would be devoted to the Ernest Llewellyn Memorial Scholarship, to help young musicians and the advancement of string playing in Australia. In 1985, Isaac Stern made a special trip to Australia to give a benefit concert at the Sydney Opera House in tribute to Llewellyn, with the proceeds (nearly $80,000) going to the Llewellyn Scholarship. This put the scholarship on a firm financial footing, and the first awards were made in 1987. Llewellyn was a member of the Board of Governors of the Frensham School in Mittagong. He was involved with the ABC for much of his working life, leading the ABC String Quartet (1949‚Äì52), appearing as soloist or concertmaster in many ABC concerts and broadcasts, conducting the ABC School Orchestral concerts, as an adjudicator for the ABC Concerto and Vocal Competitions and as a member of the Canberra Advisory Committee of the ABC. ==Honours and commemorations== Llewellyn was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1968 for services to music as Director of the Canberra School of Music. In 1970 he was raised to Commander level (CBE) within the same order. Llewellyn is commemorated in: *the Ernest Llewellyn Memorial Scholarship, *the Llewellyn Hall at the Canberra School of Music, and *the Llewellyn Choir in Canberra. Ernest Llewellyn was inducted into the Cessnock Hall of Fame on 6 December 2006. ==References * ANU Heritage: Canberra School of Music * The Llewellyn Choir * Music Austra;ia: Papers of Ernest Llewellyn * Llewellyn Hall Resurgent Category:Australian classical violinists Category:Male classical violinists Category:Australian classical violists Category:Australian conductors (music) Category:Sydney Conservatorium of Music alumni Category:1915 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Australian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian music educators Category:Violin pedagogues Category:Concertmasters Category:20th- century conductors (music) Category:20th-century classical violinists Category:20th-century Australian musicians Category:20th-century Australian male musicians ","title":"Ernest Llewellyn"},{"id":"19329692","text":"Bami is a town and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

The studio was a pioneer of gonzo pornography, and is considered one of the most successful gonzo producers. They have since gone out of business. ==History== Anabolic was founded in 1991 by UCLA graduate and current Anabolic president Christopher Alexander (also known as performer Biff Malibu). Alexander claims to be \\"probably the second guy to get into gonzo, with the numbered series of movies under the same title\\". Anabolic and its former sister company Diabolic Video were originally headquartered in Venice, California for 10 years. The company soon became one of the pioneers in the field of gonzo pornography, along with other producers like Ed Powers, Rodney Moore and John Stagliano's Evil Angel Video. Gregg Alan ran the company's sales department for 15 years, starting in 1992. In the mid-1990s, the company grew to incorporate Diabolic Video, owned by Gregg Alan. At the company's peak in the late 1990s/early 2000s, directors like Vince Vouyer, Erik Everhard, John Strong, Jon Dough and Lexington Steele created some of the most critically acclaimed gonzo on the market. Diabolic was created as a separate label in 1998. In 2001 Anabolic and Diabolic moved their headquarters to Chatsworth. Vouyer's exit to work for Red Light District Video in 2002 eventually led to the mass exodus of 2004, which saw Everhard, Steele and Mike John leave for Red Light, and Dough leave for Devil's Film, where the directors were able to own their own movies. By 2006 the company had produced more than 300 films. In May 2007 Anabolic and Diabolic announced they were ending their partnership, and would operate as separate companies. Diabolic would be run and owned by Gregg Alan and Greg Alves. In 2013 they went out of business. ==Film series== The company's most successful series include Anabolic Penetration, Balls Deep, Sweet Cheeks, Nasty Nymphos, The Gangbang Girl, Bring'um Young, Initiations and World Sex Tour. ==Actresses== In 1999 Vivian Valentine received a black eye after being hit by Jon Dough during the filming of Rough Sex, but she has said \\"I have no regrets or bad feelings about it\\". In June 2004 Alexis Amore signed an acting and directing deal under which she would direct eight to 10 movies and star in six films a year. This made her Anabolic's first \\"contract girl\\". ==Directors== All directors at Anabolic are under exclusive contract. Current and former Anabolic directors include former Diabolic employee Ricky D, Ken Dark, Ivan, Robby Digital, Tony T. and Sal Genoa. ==Distribution deals== In June 2006 gamelink.com added the complete Anabolic back-catalogue to its video-on-demand library. The same month it made its content available on AEBN's VOD service. In March 2007 SugarVOD also began adding the complete Anabolic library to its video-on- demand service. In November 2007 Anabolic signed a deal to distribute 65 Paradise Visuals films. Paradise has an extensive library of productions from the Golden Age of Porn, including Christy Canyon‚Äôs first feature film Ginger Lynn The Movie, and John Holmes‚Äô last film, The Devil In Mr. Holmes. ==Lawsuits== In 2002 Anabolic and Diabolic filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against several video distributors, alleging illegal copying and distribution of DVDs. The defendants were VIP Services Inc., Lynton Appelson Inc., Aware Distributors Inc. and others. The suit sought to recover illegal profits made from the sale of the fake DVDs, punitive damages and fees for copyright infringement. At least 25 of the two companies' titles had been pirated and supplied to retailers. In late 1997 Harley-Davidson launched a lawsuit against the company in a federal court in Milwaukee. It objected to scenes in The Gang Bang Girl 20 featuring its motorbikes and memorabilia. The company claimed the film tarnished its image, and could give the impression that Harley-Davidson approved the film. ==Criticism== Regan Starr appeared in Rough Sex 2. According to her, \\"I got the shit kicked out of me.\\" \\"I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly, mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they're hurting so bad\\" \\"I couldn't breathe\\". \\"I was being hit and choked\\". \\"I was really upset, and they didn't stop\\". \\"They kept filming\\". \\"You can hear me say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going\\". Director of the Rough Sex series Khan Tusion has commented that Starr \\"categorically misstates what occurred.\\" Professor Robert Jensen of the School of Journalism at the University of Texas has commented on the Anabolic production A Cum Sucking Whore Named Kimberly. He alleges the film portrays Kimberly as merely \\"three holes and two hands\\", and that it is an example of \\"pornography that is rooted in the pain and humiliation of women\\". Anabolic's President and Founder Christopher Alexander states \\"At Anabolic we have the utmost respect for all of our talent, we allow them the artistic freedom to deliver scenes that are as wild as they wish them to be (with a few limits). We encourage the talent to be passionate, exciting, and to deliver the best scenes that they have ever done.\\" ==Awards== The following is a selection of some of the major awards Anabolic films have won. *1993 AVN Award for 'Best Pro-Am Release' for Biff Malibu's Totally Nasty Home Videos 6 *1995 AVN Award for 'Best Anal-Themed Release' for Butt Banged Bicycle Babes *1996 AVN Award for 'Best Group Sex Scene - Video' for World Sex Tour 1 *1997 AVN Award for 'Best Gangbang Tape' for Gangbang Girl 17 *1998 AVN Award for 'Best Gangbang Tape' for Gangbang Girl 19 *1998 AVN Award for 'Best Anal Sex Scene - Video' for Butt Banged Naughty Nurses *2000 AVN Award for 'Best Specialty Release - BDSM' for Rough Sex 1 *2003 AVN Award for 'Best All-Sex Release' for Bring 'Um Young 9 *2008 AVN Award for 'Best Ethnic-Themed Release, Asian' for Anabolic Asians 5 *2009 AVN Award for 'Best Internal Series' for Ass Cream Pies ==References * (archived) * * Category:American pornographic film studios Category:Gonzo pornography Category:Film production companies of the United States Category:Pornography in Los Angeles Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Chatsworth, Los Angeles Category:Entertainment companies established in 1991 Category:Mass media companies established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in California ","title":"Anabolic Video"},{"id":"19329718","text":"Bhanbhane is a town and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

It is a top-down shoot 'em up video game. The aim of the game is to kill all the Muslims that appear on the screen ‚Äì in the words of its creator, \\"take control of the American hero and wipe out the Muslim race with an arsenal of the world's most destructive weapons.\\" ==Overview== Muslim Massacre was created by Something Awful forums poster Eric \\"Sigvatr\\" Vaughn. In describing the game, Vaughn explained the game as \\"something along the lines of metaphorically destroying the stereotypical depiction of a Muslim.\\" The game had a promotional ad on its front page reading \\"Don't be a liberal...! Download the game now\\". Muslim Massacre's gameplay has been likened to Robotron: 2084 and Berzerk as the game's directional controls are operated separately to the direction of fire, allowing the player to move in one direction and fire in another, making techniques such as circle strafing possible. Players control an American soldier armed with a pistol who has been parachuted into the Middle East. The player can also pick up special weapons such as a shotgun, a machinegun, hand grenades and a rocket launcher, supplied by an overflying plane. To progress to the game's bosses, the player must kill all the Muslims who appear on- screen during each stage, each of which lasts between sixty and ninety seconds. Some Muslims are dressed as civilians while others are depicted as stereotypical terrorists wearing a suicide vest. ==Reception and controversy== Critical reaction PC Worlds Matt Peckham compared it to the Atari video game Berzerk, commenting that without any meaning to it, it is a parody that feels \\"utterly devoid of anything remotely Swiftian, and which viewed at the mechanical level is pretty weak, monotonous sauce.\\" He noted that as opposed to banning it, people who do not like it should boycott it, while parents should supervise what their children play. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor called it a straightforward shooter, calling its \\"visual style and retro 8-bit musical nods\\" well crafted. He felt that it alluded to shooting games such as Contra and Ikari Warriors, ultimately stating that \\"it doesn't play particularly well, nor is it a bad game.\\" GameSetWatch's Simon Carless gave it a \\"resounding 'eh. The game has been downloaded over 100,000 times as of April 11, 2008. Controversy The game, while being released for some time beforehand, gained controversy around the seventh anniversary of the 2001 September 11 attacks. TechRadar's Adam Hartley said that the game was \\"vile, childish, tedious and desperate to drum-up-controversy\\". The chief executive of the Muslim youth organization, The Ramadhan Foundation Mohammed Shafiq commented that \\"encouraging children and young people in a game to kill Muslims is unacceptable, tasteless and deeply offensive\\". He also stated that it \\"incites violence toward Muslims and is trying to justify the killing of innocent Muslims\\", urging both the British government and Internet providers to shut the web site down. Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain said that Vaughn and the ISPs who host the game should be ashamed, stating that \\"anti-Muslim prejudice is already on the increase and needs to be challenged and not reinforced through tasteless and offensive stunts like this.\\" Similarly, the president of the Islamic Council of Queensland Suliman Sabdia urged for the web site to be shut down by Police Minister Judy Spence, commenting that \\"this is the sort of game which creates hysteria.\\" Spence was concerned with the game, commenting that the web site has been \\"brought to the attention of police, who are making an assessment as to whether it breaches any legislation.\\" A Queensland Police spokesman announced that the game was examined, where \\"no offence was detected\\". They referred the matter to Canadian authorities. Viewer comments on the web site of the Arabic television channel Al Arabiya were mixed; some condemned it, while others viewed it as a reaction to Islamist extremists. The website was blocked in some Arab states. Gulf News Nicholas Coates erroneously suggested that the game was intentionally released to coincide with both the Islamic month of Ramadan and the attacks of September 11, 2001; in fact, it was released in January earlier that year, and gained increased attention around September. He criticized Vaughn for exacerbating poor Muslim relations, referencing the controversy over the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and how Vaughn was making the situation worse. He also bemoaned how ratings boards such as the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) had no oversight of Internet games. Arab News Aijaz Afaqui referenced violence in American-made video games and the use of Muslim terrorists as enemies in them, citing this game as an example. In the book Halos and Avatars: Playing Video Games with God, author Craig Detweiler discussed the Under Siege series of video games, which he claims that it is both \\"anti-Semitic and a promotion of Muslims\\". He makes reference to Muslim Massacre, saying that games such as it seemed to validate the creation of games like this, suggesting that it was a role reversal in response to anti-Muslim sentiment in video games. Keyser Trad of the Islamic Friendship Association wrote to Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland expressing outrage, stating that it \\"teaches young people to 'further hate Muslims' and encourages them to carry out 'acts of discrimination, vilification or outright violence against Australian Muslims'.\\" He added that it violated sedition provisions of counter terrorism laws, as well as other laws that \\"prevent the incitement of violence against sections of Australian society.\\" The AG responded by saying that it was up to the Australian Federal Police to investigate whether it did so. After contacting them, Trad was told that it was up to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), though the Sydney Morning Herald noted that there was not much they could do since it is not hosted on Australian servers. Trad also mentioned other groups he had been \\"palmed off\\" to, such as the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which he found to take years to investigate claims. He added that he had no faith in the ACMA, citing a case where a radio station had to undergo cultural training, which he found to be ineffectual. Creator's reaction In response to Mohammed Shafiq's assertion that, \\"When kids spend six hours a day on violent games they are more likely to go outside and commit violence\\", Eric Vaughn told Sky News: \\"To Mr. Mohammed Shafiq I would like to say that if a kid spends six hours a day on violent games, I think that they aren't likely to go outside at all, so he should not be worried.\\" Regarding the game itself, Eric Vaughn called it \\"fun and funny\\" and that some players have called it a \\"critical commentary of U.S. foreign policy.\\" However, he noted that, as quoted by Murad Ahmed of The Times, \\"I think it's pretending to be legitimate commentary and I'm sure there will be lots of people who defend it on those grounds, but ultimately it's just a game where you blow the gently caress (Something Awful's forum word filter for \\"fuck\\") out of Arabs.\\" After the controversy, Vaughn took down the game, leaving an apology and a retrospective on his actions on the web site.Maggie Greene (9/14/08). \\"'Muslim Massacre' Creator Tucks Tail, Apologizes\\" .

However, in response to developer of Super Columbine Massacre RPG! developer Danny Ledonne's comments on the matter, he said that his apology was fake, commenting that he was just \\"fucking with everyone the entire time and have had great success.\\" Ledonne responded by hoping that he was not doing it for \\"the lulz\\" like V-Tech Rampage developer Ryan Lambourn, adding that he would define a success as \\"the opportunity to think more critically about the elements your game addresses.\\" Vaughn claimed that the message was that Muslims needed to \\"suck it down and stop getting offended by everything\\", adding that \\"if they learnt to just ignore people, things would be better.\\" He also noted that it was not just to Muslims, but all people, stating that \\"there are people all around the world who will do things that make you mad.\\" Vaughn commented that the game's depictions of Muslims was no more negative than television news, adding that he did not feel that children would be affected, and that parents were responsible for instilling positive attitudes in their children. ==See also== *Ethnic Cleansing *Islamic Fun! *Under Ash *Under Siege *Persecution of Muslims * 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict in video games ==References== Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:2008 video games Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Obscenity controversies in video games Category:Islam-related controversies in North America Category:Islamophobia in the United States Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Muslim Massacre (video game)"},{"id":"19329834","text":"Dhamir (often called Ghamir) is a village in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of Western Nepal.

When harm to self and others is summed, alcohol was the most harmful of all drugs considered, scoring 72%. The short-term effects of alcohol (more specifically ethanol) consumption ‚Äì due to drinking beer, wine, distilled spirits or other alcoholic beverages ‚Äì range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and euphoria at lower doses to intoxication (drunkenness), stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory \\"blackouts\\"), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body. The concentration of alcohol in blood is measured via blood alcohol content (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large role in determining the extent of intoxication; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly. The amount of alcohol consumed largely determines the extent of hangovers, although hydration also plays a role. After excessive drinking, stupor and unconsciousness both can occur. Extreme levels of consumption can cause alcohol poisoning and death; in fact, a concentration in the blood stream of 0.36% will kill half of those affected.Jones, A. W. et al. Comparison of Blood-Ethanol Concentration in Deaths Attributed to Acute Alcohol Poisoning and Chronic Alcoholism. Journal of Forensic Sciences 48(4):874-9 ¬∑ July 2003Alcohol Awareness PageCarleton College: Wellness Center: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by asphyxiation from vomiting. Alcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During abstinence, residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns are the greatest predictors of relapse. ==Effects by dosage== The definition of a unit of alcohol ranges between 8 and 14 grams of pure alcohol/ethanol depending on the country. There is no agreement on definitions of a low, moderate or high dose of alcohol either. The U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines a moderate dose as alcohol intake up to two standard drinks or 28 grams for men and one standard drink or 14 grams for women. The immediate effect of alcohol depends on the drinker's blood alcohol concentration (BAC). BAC can be different for each person depending on their age, sex, pre-existing health condition, even if they drink the same amount of alcohol. Different BACs have different effects. The following lists describe the common effects of alcohol on the body depending on the BAC. However, tolerance varies considerably between individuals, as does individual response to a given dosage; the effects of alcohol differ widely between people. Hence in this context, BAC percentages are just estimates used for illustrative purposes. Grand Rapids Dip Studies suggest that a BAC of 0.01‚Äì0.04% slightly lowers risk of being in an vehicle accident when compared to a BAC of 0.00%, referred to as the Grand Rapids Effect or Grand Rapids Dip.Grand Rapids Effects Revisited: Accidents, Alcohol and Risk, H.-P. Kr√ºger, J. Kazenwadel and M. Vollrath, Center for Traffic Sciences, University of Wuerzburg, R√∂ntgenring 11, D-97070 W√ºrzburg, GermanyNTSB (US) report on Grand Rapids EffectRobert F. Borkenstein papers, 1928‚Äì2002, Indiana U. The role of the drinking driver in traffic accidents (Researchgate link) Some literature has attributed the Grand Rapids Effect to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution at low BAC levels or due to \\"experience\\" in drinking. Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol excitotoxicity and the effect of alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders, but this remains speculative. Moderate doses Ethanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Stimulated areas include the cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, which are all responsible for both thinking and pleasure seeking. Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, which is possibly caused by neurons transmitting electrical signals in an alpha waves-pattern; such waves are actually observed (with the aid of EEGs) whenever the body is relaxed. Short-term effects of alcohol include the risk of injuries, violence, and fetal damage. Alcohol has also been linked with lowered inhibitions, although it is unclear as to what degree this is chemical or psychological as studies with placebos can often duplicate the social effects of alcohol at either low or moderate doses. Some studies have suggested that intoxicated people have much greater control over their behavior than is generally recognized, though they have a reduced ability to evaluate the consequences of their behavior. Behavioral changes associated with drunkenness are, to some degree, contextual. Areas of the brain that are responsible for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, which is caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is caused by increased metabolism in areas of the brain associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner. Alcohol has been known to mitigate the production of antidiuretic hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favor water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of antidiuretic hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, therefore creating excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration. Excessive doses Acute alcohol intoxication through excessive doses in general causes short- or long-term health effects. NMDA receptors become unresponsive, slowing areas of the brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain. GABA could also be responsible for causing the memory impairment that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with both the registration and the consolidation stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible. Anterograde amnesia, colloquially referred to as \\"blacking out\\", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This is the loss of memory during and after an episode of drinking. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts failing usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but it can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers. Another classic finding of alcohol intoxication is ataxia, in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, as if each muscle were working independently from the others. Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning. Ataxia causes the observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down. It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the cerebellum. Mellanby effect The Mellanby effect is the phenomenon that the behavioral impairment due to alcohol is less, at the same BAC, when the BAC is decreasing than when it is increasing. In other words, at a given point on the upward slope of BAC (while drinking), impairment is greater than at a given point on the downward slope (after drinking), even though the BAC is the same at the two points. This effect was confirmed in a 2017 meta-analysis. ==Effect on different population==  Based on sex  Alcohol affects male and female differently because of difference in body fat percentage and water content. On average, for equal body weight, women have a higher body fat percentage than men. Since alcohol is absorbed into body water content and men have more water in their bodies than women, for women there will be a higher blood alcohol concentration from same amount of alcohol consumption. Women are also thought to have less alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme which is required to break down alcohol. That is why the drinking guidelines are different for men and women.  Based on genetic variation Alcohol metabolism depends on the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Genetic variants of the genes coding for these enzymes can affect the rate of alcohol metabolism. Some ADH gene variants lead to higher metabolic activity, resulting in the accumulation of acetaldehyde, whereas, a null allele in ALDH2 causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde by preventing its catabolism to acetate. The genetic variants of these enzymes can explain the differences in the alcohol metabolism in different races. The different isoforms of ADH showed protection against alcoholic disorders in Han Chinese and Japanese (due to presence of ADH1B*2 ) and in African (due to presence of ADH1B*3). On the other hand, presence of ALDH2*2 in East Asians (a variant of the ALDH gene), can cause blood acetaldehyde levels of 30 to 75 ŒºM or higher, which is more than 10 times the normal level. The excess amount of blood aldehyde produce facial flushing, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and other adverse effects. Presence of these alleles causes rapid conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde which can be toxic in large amount. So, the East Asians and Africans feel the adverse effects of alcohol early and stop drinking. For Caucasians, ADH1B*1 allele is the most prevalent allele which causes slower conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde and it makes them more vulnerable to alcohol use disorders. ==Allergic reaction-like symptoms== Humans metabolize ethanol primarily through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) to acetaldehyde and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid.Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8‚Äì16 Eastern Asians reportedly have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations. The issue has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese where persons with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant allele of the ALDH2 gene were found; the variant allele, encodes lysine (lys) instead of glutamic acid (glu) at amino acid 487; this renders the enzyme essentially inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. The variant allele is variously termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, and ALDH2*504lys. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys. Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive (i.e. the variant allele behaves as a dominant negative), homozygote individuals for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity. In consequence, Japanese individuals homozygous or, to only a slightly lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are susceptible to a set of adverse responses to the ingestion of, and sometimes even the fumes from, ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages; these responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing (i.e. the \\"oriental flushing syndrome\\" or Alcohol flush reaction), urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. rhinitis and, primarily in patients with a history of asthma, mild to moderately bronchoconstriction exacerbations of their asthmatic disease. These allergic reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30‚Äì60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical IgE- or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissues to release histamine, the probable evoker of these symptoms. The percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous genotypes are about 35% in native Caboclo of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in Thai people, 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos; percentages are essentially 0 in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos. The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in 0 or low levels of glu487lys genotypes commonly ranges above 5%. These \\"ethanol reactors\\" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol-containing beverages. For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol- induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about 16% in individuals homozygous for the \\"normal\\" ADH1B gene but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His SNP variant; in vitro, this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and in humans, it is proposed, may form acetaldehyde at levels that exceed the capacity of ALDH2 to metabolize. Notwithstanding such considerations, experts suggest that the large proportion of alcoholic beverage-induced allergic-like symptoms in populations with a low incidence of the glu487lys genotype reflect true allergic reactions to the natural and/or contaminating allergens particularly those in wines and to a lesser extent beers. ==Pathophysiology== Epidemiology: Disability-adjusted life year for alcohol use disorders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. At low or moderate doses, alcohol acts primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA. Alcohol binds to several different subtypes of GABAA, but not to others. The main subtypes responsible for the subjective effects of alcohol are the Œ±1Œ≤3Œ≥2, Œ±5Œ≤3Œ≥2, Œ±4Œ≤3Œ¥ and Œ±6Œ≤3Œ¥ subtypes, although other subtypes such as Œ±2Œ≤3Œ≥2 and Œ±3Œ≤3Œ≥2 are also affected. Activation of these receptors causes most of the effects of alcohol such as relaxation and relief from anxiety, sedation, ataxia and increase in appetite and lowering of inhibitions that can cause a tendency toward violence in some people. Alcohol has a powerful effect on glutamate as well. Alcohol decreases glutamate's ability to bind with NMDA and acts as an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, which plays a critical role in LTP by allowing Ca2+ to enter the cell. These inhibitory effects are thought to be responsible for the \\"memory blanks\\" that can occur at levels as low as 0.03% blood level. In addition, reduced glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus has been linked to spatial memory loss. Chronic alcohol users experience an upregulation of NMDA receptors because the brain is attempting to reestablish homeostasis. When a chronic alcohol user stops drinking for more than 10 hours, apoptosis can occur due to excitotoxicity. The seizures experienced during alcohol abstinence are thought to be a result of this NMDA upregulation. Alteration of NMDA receptor numbers in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for some of the symptoms seen in delirium tremens during severe alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium and hallucinations. Other targets such as sodium channels can also be affected by high doses of alcohol, and alteration in the numbers of these channels in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for as well as other effects such as cardiac arrhythmia. Other targets that are affected by alcohol include cannabinoid, opioid and dopamine receptors, although it is unclear whether alcohol affects these directly or if they are affected by downstream consequences of the GABA/NMDA effects. People with a family history of alcoholism may exhibit genetic differences in the response of their NMDA glutamate receptors as well as the ratios of GABAA subtypes in their brain.Shimizu, A. Matsubara, K. Uezono, T. Kimura, K. Shiono, H. \\"Reduced dorsal hippocampal glutamate release significantly correlates with the spatial memory deficits produced by benzodiazepines and ethanol\\". Neuroscience. P 701-706 Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body co-ordination. Contrary to popular belief, research suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not neurotoxic in adults and actually prevents NMDA antagonist-induced neurotoxicity. ==Alcohol and sleep== Low doses of alcohol (one beer) appear to increase total sleep time and reduce awakening during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol dissipate at moderate and higher doses of alcohol. Previous experience with alcohol also influences the extent to which alcohol positively or negatively affects sleep. Under free- choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption. In insomniacs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance. Moderate alcohol consumption 30‚Äì60 minutes before sleep, although decreasing, disrupts sleep architecture. Rebound effects occur once the alcohol has been largely metabolized, causing late night disruptions in sleep maintenance. Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06‚Äì0.08 percent and decrease 0.01‚Äì0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4‚Äì5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8-hour sleep episode. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate \\"rebounds\\" in rapid eye movement (REM) following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also very quickly increase slow wave sleep (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in glutamatergic activity by adenosine in the central nervous system. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime. ==Alcohol consumption and balance== Alcohol can affect balance by altering the viscosity of the endolymph within the otolithic membrane, the fluid inside the semicircular canals inside the ear. The endolymph surrounds the ampullary cupula which contains hair cells within the semicircular canals. When the head is tilted, the endolymph flows and moves the cupula. The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating the direction in which the head is tilted. By changing the viscosity of the endolymph to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body. This can also result in vertigo, or \\"the spins.\\", Why does my head spin when I'm drunk? Rachel Nuwer, 8 Feb 2011, Scienceline. ==Alcohol and postprandial triglycerides== Alcohol taken with a meal increases and prolongs postprandial triglyceridemia. This is true despite the observation that the relationship between alcohol consumption and triglyceridemia is \\"J-shaped,\\" meaning that fasting triglycerides concentration is lower in people who drink 10‚Äì20 g/alcohol a day compared to people who either abstain from alcohol or who drink more per day. ==Alcohol and blood pressure== A systematic review reported that alcohol has bi-phasic effect on blood pressure. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell when they were measured couple of hours after alcohol consumption. However, the longer term measurement (20 hours average) showed a modest but statistically significant increase in blood pressure: a 2.7 mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure and 1.4 mmHg rise in diastolic blood pressure. A Cochrane systematic review based on only randomized controlled trials which investigates the acute effect of alcohol consumption in healthy and hypertensive adults is in progress. == See also == * Alcohol and health * Long-term effects of alcohol consumption ==References * Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004 by the World Health Organization. * Category:Drinking culture Short ","title":"Short-term effects of alcohol consumption"},{"id":"19329868","text":"Dhurkot Bhanbhane is a town and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

In 1984 she was hired by the Melbourne Herald. She moved to London in 1990 and presented and reported for World Business Report on BBC World. She returned to Australia in 1993 but moved to New Zealand soon after, where she was soon employed by TVNZ. Her first television appearance was on the business-related current affairs show Made in New Zealand. Mau would later present late-night current affairs programming including Eyewitness and Newsnight, the latter of which she presented alongside Marcus Lush and her future husband Simon Dallow. After a period reporting for ONE News, Mau began presenting the Breakfast programme with Mike Hosking. She returned to ONE News after the birth of her second child and, from 1999 to 2003, presented the weekend news alongside husband Simon Dallow. She returned to Breakfast in 2004 but left at the end of the year to join rival network Prime Television, where she worked with former TVNZ presenter Paul Holmes. She was made redundant from Prime when the station was taken over by Sky in early 2006 and returned to TVNZ in 2008. Upon her return to TVNZ, Mau worked as a back-up host for Breakfast and also appeared in other news, non-news, and current affairs shows including the home and lifestyle show Home Front, which she presented alongside future Dunedin mayor Dave Cull. In 2010, she became co-host of weekly consumer affairs programme Fair Go. In 2013, she moved to co-host the nightly current affairs programme Seven Sharp; in an interview given shortly after she left that programme, Mau stated that when she was recruited for Seven Sharp, the programme pitched to her was quite different from the one that eventuated. She also said that had she known what the show would be like, she \\"never would have left the job at Fair Go\\". In 2014, Mau commenced a radio talkback host career at RadioLIVE. She began the four-year gig at talkback station RadioLIVE, initially in an early afternoon co-host slot with Willie Jackson. She then moved to host the daily RadioLive Drive radio show. During her time with RadioLIVE, Mau also contributed as a fill-in host on 2014's The Paul Henry Show on TV3, which was simulcast on RadioLIVE and across multi- media platforms.https://www.nzonscreen.com/person/alison-mau/biography In December 2017, Mau announced her departure from her daily RadioLIVE Drive radio show in February 2018. Mau said she had been \\"incredibly fortunate\\" to spend four years at the station learning the radio business. \\"Having spent my early career in print journalism ‚Äì then more than 20 years in television ‚Äì radio was a new frontier for me. I leave with a store of cross-platform skills I could only have dreamed of back then,\\" Mau said. She would not be drawn on her plans for 2018, saying \\"it's a bit too early to make those details public\\". Mau is currently an Op-ed columnist at The Sunday Star-Times weekend newspaper, and she is contributor on the Stuff.co.nz news portal website, published by Fairfax Digital, a division of Fairfax New Zealand Ltd. Mau currently leads a team of journalists at Stuff investigating sexual harassment in New Zealand. Mau launched the 2018 national #metoonz investigation into sexual harassment, supported by Stuff.

Primarily a staff officer and operations planner until the latter stages of the war, he commanded an infantry brigade in the Western Theater in 1864 and 1865. In 1862, he organized in South Carolina what became one of the first black regiments in the Federal army. He was a member of the powerful Fessenden family, which was prominent in national politics during the mid-19th century. ==Early life and career== James D. Fessenden was born in Westbrook, Maine, in the early autumn of 1833. He was the son of U.S. Senator William P. Fessenden and a brother of Francis Fessenden, who would also serve as a general in the Union army. Another brother, Samuel, would be killed at the Second Battle of Bull Run during the war. Two uncles, Samuel C. Fessenden and T. A. D. Fessenden were U.S. Congressmen. He was educated in the local schools and then graduated from Bowdoin College in 1852. He studied law, passed his bar exam, and joined his father's law firm. ==Civil War== After the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Fessenden spent the summer recruiting and organizing a company of skilled riflemen and marksmen that became a company in the United States Sharpshooters. In November of that year, he received a commission as a captain in the sharpshooter company and served in the defenses of Washington, D.C. Through the influences of his powerful father, he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel and a new position as a staff officer and aide-de-camp to Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter. He held that position from March 1862 until January 1863, serving primarily in the Department of the South and the X Corps. During that period, he was promoted to colonel in July 1862. He was involved in planning the Union operations against the Confederate defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, but missed participating in the major attacks while recovering in Washington, D.C., from a riding accident suffered in the field. During his recuperation, he frequently used his oratory and organizational skills to recruit new volunteers for military service. In November 1863, Fessenden became an aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, who had been sent to Tennessee with two corps of the Army of the Potomac to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland. Hooker commended him for his bravery at the Battle of Missionary Ridge and recommended his promotion to brigadier general. He was commended three times for his actions during the Atlanta Campaign and again recommended for higher rank by Hooker. In August 1864, he finally received his long desired promotion to brigadier general, but did not get a field command initially as his sponsor Hooker had since left the army. He was assigned to command a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia, an assignment initially meant for his brother, who lost a leg in the Red River Campaign that precluded his taking the assignment. James Fessenden arrived in Virginia and assumed command of a brigade in the XIX Corps under Maj. Gen. William H. Emory. He participated in the Battle of Cedar Creek in October, engaged in scouting duty, and then was assigned command of the Union garrison in the defenses of Winchester, Virginia, in January 1865. In May 1865, he led his brigade in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., following the surrender of the two leading Confederate armies in the Eastern Theater. He subsequently commanded troops under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock and an occupation garrison in South Carolina before mustering out of the army on January 15, 1866. He received a brevet promotion to major general before leaving the service. ==Postbellum career== Fessenden returned to Maine, where he resumed his law career in partnership with his surviving brother Francis. He entered local and state politics, and was elected to serve three terms in the Maine State Legislature. He also served the Federal government as the Register of Bankruptcy for his district. Late in his life, he edited his brother's book, Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden, which was published posthumously in 1907. He was a member of the Maine Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society for officers who has served in the Union during the Civil War. James D. Fessenden died in Portland, Maine, where he is buried in Evergreen Cemetery. ==Family treeSee also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * * * U.S. War Department, The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1880-1901\\\\.

They were intended for suburban and commuter trains serving German cities, where they were to replace Classes 78 and 93.5. As a result, they were allocated to the locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke or BW) at Darmstadt, D√ºsseldorf and Letmathe. Between D√ºsseldorf and Essen they were even used on early S-Bahn services. And between Limburg/Lahn and Wiesbaden and in the area of Darmstadt they also hauled goods trains. The firm of Krauss-Maffei initially delivered 13 engines in 1951 and a further 5 from 1955 to 1956. The first engine, with operating number 65 001, was retired as early as 1966. All the vehicles were given a welded, high-performance boiler. Operating numbers 65 001 - 65 013 were equipped with a surface economizer. Numbers 65 014 - 65 018 were given a mixer preheater. Numbers 65 012 - 65 018 were equipped for push-pull services. So there were three different variants of these two- cylinder, superheated steam engines in service with the Bundesbahn. DB Neubaulok 065 005-1 ready for scrapping, Frankfurt-am-Main, 1970 Class 65 locomotives proved to be exceptionally reliable engines, but they could not be used universally, because their coal bunkers and water tanks were small. As a result, they could only be used for short-range goods traffic. Locomotive 65 018 was given a special lightweight drive, which was later used on all the engines. This locomotive is the only representative of its class to have survived in working order and is owned by the Stoom Stichting Nederland society in the Netherlands, having been donated by a German railway museum in 1981. It was retired from Bw Aschaffenburg in 1972, the last one of these attractive locomotives to be paid off. == See also == * Neubaulok * DR Class 65.10 65 Category:2-8-4T locomotives 065 Category:Krauss-Maffei locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1951 Category:Passenger locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany Category:1‚Ä≤D2‚Ä≤ h2t locomotives ","title":"DB Class 65"},{"id":"19329925","text":"Dohali is a town and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. __TOC__ ==History== Before the present building, the site was used by Bell Telephone Laboratories for research. Karl Guthe Jansky invented radio astronomy there, and a monument was placed at the former location of the antenna almost seventy years later in 1998. The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky's antenna was at 7:10 p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.Karl Jansky Radio Astronomy Monument In 1957, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) began to plan a research laboratory in Holmdel Township in Central New Jersey. Constructed between 1959 and 1962, this complex was one of the final projects of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen before his death in 1961. Used as a research and development complex, it served the needs of the Bell Laboratories division of AT&T;, later part of Lucent, and Alcatel-Lucent. Basic research, applied hardware development, and software development occurred in the building. The building's distinctive features, including its mirror-like appearance, led to recognition as the Laboratory of the Year by R&D; in 1967. The building was expanded in 1966 and 1982 to its final size of two million square feet of office and laboratory space. Despite these expansions, the original curtain wall design remained intact, as did the unique layout of the site, which included a large elliptical master plan and country-road like approach. Over its active life-span, the facility and its layout were studied in universities as models of modernist architecture. Internally, the building is divided into four pavilions of labs and offices, each separated from the others by a cross-shaped atrium. The internal pavilions are linked via sky-bridges and perimeter walkway. Also of note is the water tower on the complex, which was designed to look like the then-new transistor and is still in usable condition more than 40 years after its construction. In 2006, Alcatel-Lucent contracted to sell the facility to Preferred Real Estate Investments in the process of restructuring the company's research efforts. Despite initial plans to maintain the original buildings and keep the complex as a corporate office park, economic developments later resulted in Preferred seeking to re-zone as residential property. As a result, the complex was added to The Cultural Landscape Foundation's list of 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey in May 2007. Additionally action led to the creation of a citizen's group, Preserving Holmdel, by former Bell employees, to lobby for keeping the complex as it was when in use as a laboratory. Working with the community, ideas for changes such as a university center or recreational complex, in portions of the former facility are under consideration. The Preferred transaction did not close and on May 17, 2012 Holmdel Township declared the site as an \\"Area in Need of Redevelopment\\" and adopted a Redevelopment Plan for the property that included various adaptive reuses of the main building and the construction of up to 40 single family homes and 185 age-restricted townhouses outside the main ring road surrounding the building. The Redevelopment Plan is available on the Township's website. The complex is currently under contract to Somerset Development LLC. Somerset has provided concept plans for the redevelopment of the complex in accordance with the Redevelopment Plan and is in discussions with Township officials concerning the details of those plans. Somerset's Redevelopment Concepts are available online and on the Township's website. In September 2013, it was announced that the property was purchased by Somerset Development Corp for $27 million for a redevelopment project planned to include a health and wellness center, skilled nursing facility and assisted living center, a hotel, restaurants and shopping, spa, office spaces and a 20,000-square-foot public library. Recreational space and luxury homes were planned for the surrounding land. Toll Brothers was slated to be the residential developer the project. Several office tenants have moved into the Bell Works building, and there is a cafe now open in the main lobby. In November 2016, Nokia completed its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. Architect Alexander Gorlin designed the 2018-2019 renovation which includes opening up the laboratory spaces to the atrium light by replacing Saarinen's metal panels with glass. He also redesigned the two mammoth 1,000 x 100 ft atria floors. Skylights were replaced with transparent photovoltaic panels, and a hotel is planned for the roof. In July 2016 iCIMS announced plans to move their headquarters to the facility to become the anchor tenant. They moved in on November 27, 2017. In April 2017 Guardian Life Insurance Company announced plans to move several hundred employees to the facility. ==Gallery== File:Bell Labs NJ1.jpgMain building in 2016 File:Bell Labs water tower NJ1.jpg\\"Transistor\\" water tower in 2016 File:AT&T; Holmdel-wide- cropped.jpgAerial view of AT&T; Holmdel site File:Bell Labs Holmdel, NJ.jpgBell Labs Holmdel, NJ April 2010 Lawrence Aberle File:Bell Labs Holmdel, NJ2.jpgBell Labs Holmdel, NJ2 April 2010 Lawrence Aberle ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Bell Labs Category:Commercial buildings in New Jersey Category:Modernist architecture in New Jersey Category:International style architecture in New Jersey Category:Eero Saarinen structures Category:Physics institutes Category:AT&T; buildings Category:Holmdel Township, New Jersey Category:Alcatel-Lucent Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places ","title":"Bell Labs Holmdel Complex"},{"id":"19329955","text":"Phoksing is a Village Development Committee in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

The Gdium product is distinguished by its unique Loongson MIPS processor and the use of a USB key as a primary storage device. The Gdium netbook is marketed as an interface device to the Gdium \\"learning community\\"‚Äîa website that provides hardware support, MIPS builds of open-source software, Linux computing tips, and educational resources targeted towards teachers and students within the K-12 demographic. ==Technical overview== The EMTEC Gdium Liberty 1000 is built on an STMicroelectronics Loongson 2F MIPS microprocessor and uses a proprietary form-factored USB key, called the G-Key, as its primary storage medium. The G-Key, which fits in a specially designed USB slot recessed within the unit, is available in 8GB and 16GB capacities. The key generates no noise, and is less susceptible to mechanical shock damage than hard drives. It also includes an SD card reader, which provides support for MMC, SD and SDHC cards as supplemental storage. The Gdium uses Mandriva as its sole operating system and boots in approximately 30 seconds. The desktop uses the Metacity window manager with a lxplanel and idesk-based interface. Like most modern Linux distributions, open-source software applications such as OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and The GIMP are included in the default installation. There are no compilations of Microsoft Windows, OS X, or Ubuntu available for the MIPS architecture, but e.g. Debian offers packages compiled for MIPS.

J. M. Smith in 1957) is a type of predictive controller designed to control systems with a significant feedback time delay. The idea can be illustrated as follows. Suppose the plant consists of G(z) followed by a pure time delay z^{-k}. z refers to the Z-transform of the transfer function relating the inputs and outputs of the plant G. As a first step, suppose we only consider G(z) (the plant without a delay) and design a controller C(z) with a closed-loop transfer function H(z)=\\\\frac{C(z) G(z)}{1+C(z)G(z)} that we consider satisfactory. Next, our objective is to design a controller \\\\bar{C}(z) for the plant G(z) z^{-k} so that the closed loop transfer function \\\\bar{H}(z) equals H(z) z^{-k}. Solving \\\\frac{\\\\bar{C} G z^{-k}}{1+\\\\bar{C}G z^{-k}} = z^{-k} \\\\frac{C G }{1 + C G}, we obtain \\\\bar{C} = \\\\frac{C}{1+CG(1-z^{-k})}. The controller is implemented as shown in the following figure, where G(z) has been changed to \\\\hat{G}(z) to indicate that it is a model used by the controller. 640 px Note that there are two feedback loops. The outer control loop feeds the output back to the input, as usual. However, this loop alone would not provide satisfactory control, because of the delay; this loop is feeding back outdated information. Intuitively, for the k sample intervals during which no fresh information is available, the system is controlled by the inner loop which contains a predictor of what the (unobservable) output of the plant G currently is. To check that this works, a re-arrangement can be made as follows: 640 px Here we can see that if the model used in the controller, \\\\hat{G}(z)z^{-k}, matches the plant G(z) z^{-k} perfectly, then the outer and middle feedback loops cancel each other, and the controller generates the \\"correct\\" control action. In reality, however, it is impossible for the model to perfectly match the plant. ==References== * K. Warwick and D.

He was educated at Emanuel School and graduated in Mathematics from Imperial College in 1945 and returned there in 1947 as Assistant Lecturer. His first computer project was the construction of a fast multiplier unit from electro- mechanical relays. This was taken over by Sid Michaelson http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/icce and K. D. Tocher and incorporated into ICCE, the Imperial College Computing Engine based on the same technology. By then (1949) Tony had moved to the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to work for Maurice Wilkes on software development for EDSAC. In October 1951 Tony joined the Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University, where he took over from Alan Turing the task of writing programming manuals and running a user service on the Ferranti Mark 1 computer. It was his experience with the rather tedious Manchester machine-coding conventions that led him to devise what was probably the world's first publicly available High-Level Language. This was the Mark 1 Autocode available from March 1954 and therefore about two years ahead of the first Fortran compiler. Throughout the 1950s Tony led a group at Manchester working on the theoretical underpinnings of compilers. This culminated in the compiler-compiler, a seminal idea first presented at a British Computer Society Conference in July 1960 by Brooker and Derrick Morris. This was subsequently implemented on the Ferranti ATLAS and used for high-level language development. The ATLAS was regarded as the world's most powerful computer when it was brought into service in December 1962. In the mid-1960s Tony helped to inaugurate the UK's first Computer Science degree course at Manchester. He moved to Essex University in 1967 to take up the University's founding Chair of Computer Science. The first Essex Computer Science graduates obtained their degrees in the summer of 1970. He retired in 1988 and died on 20 November 2019 in Hexham. == Further reading == * ==References * https://web.archive.org/web/20080816195357/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showperson.prx?PeopleID=115 * http://www.computer50.org/mark1/gac1.html#brooker * https://web.archive.org/web/20041031031946/http://www.computer50.org/mark1/gethomas/manchester_autocodes.html * Listen to an oral history interview with Tony Brooker - a life story interview recorded for An Oral History of British Science at the British Library Category:1925 births Category:2019 deaths Category:British computer scientists Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:People from Fulham ","title":"Tony Brooker"},{"id":"19330012","text":"Hadahade is a Village Development Committee Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of western tregion Nepal.

Currently, all three programs air at any time throughout the year, and on nearly half the Sundays, two episodes from two different miniseries will air on the same night. This lists the titles of the individual miniseries. Some ran for only one episode, many ran for two or more installments. The following lists them according to original season, and then in alphabetical order. The number of the season continues in the sequence set by the predecessor series, Masterpiece Theatre, which ended with Season 37. This is in spite of the fact that the other predecessor series, Mystery!, ended with Season 27. All episodes that air in one calendar year are considered to be in the same season.\\"Masterpiece Broadcast History.\\" For lists of episodes of the other two series, see List of Masterpiece Mystery! episodes, and List of Masterpiece Contemporary episodes. For older episodes of Masterpiece Theatre, see List of Masterpiece Theatre episodes. This list does not include any rebroadcasts of series, including those previously shown on Masterpiece Theatre or Mystery! As of the start of broadcasting Victoria Series One in January 2017, Masterpiece Classic was no longer branded as such, but simply Masterpiece (on screen, PBS Masterpiece online and social media), and it no longer had an on-screen host.

McPherson 4m focal length high resolution spectrometer shown over example of false color Xenon spectrum. McPherson is a custom manufacturer of precision optical instruments and systems for measuring and characterizing spectra. McPherson instruments measure intensity vs. frequency in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. McPherson‚Äôs spectral test instruments are based on the dispersing properties of a diffraction grating and/or refractive prism. McPherson specializes in vacuum fabrication, ultraviolet optical systems, spectroscopic technique, and high resolution spectral test and measurement instrumentation. End-user and OEM applications include research, metrology, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, aerospace and defense. ==History== McPherson began manufacturing spectral test instrumentation in 19521. The company's first spectral test instruments were rocket born spectrometers used outside the earth‚Äôs atmosphere to study the vacuum ultraviolet portion of the solar spectrum. Today, McPherson instruments are employed in laboratory environments around the world, for spectroscopic analysis in the infrared, visible, vacuum ultraviolet, and soft x-ray regions. Company ownership The Company was founded as McPherson Instrument Corporation by Paul McPherson (1920 - 1972) and operated as a sole proprietorship2 until 1967 when it was sold to now defunct GCA Corporation. It was operated as GCA/McPherson, a division of GCA Corporation, until 1981 when it was sold to D. M. Schoeffel. It has operated under various names: McPherson - Division of SI Corporation, McPherson Instruments, SI/McPherson and McPherson, Inc.

He originally joined as a centre-forward but was converted to a centre-back, as he became a first choice player in the seasons preceding World War II. He appeared in the 1939 FA Cup Final for the club, where they lost to Portsmouth in the Wembley showpiece. He also narrowly missed out on glory in the league championship as the club finished runners-up for two successive seasons in the late 1930s. He remained with the club while the Football League was suspended during wartime, turning out in regional action. He announced his playing retirement in May 1944 but remained on the coaching staff. He was the club's main trainer in the Stan Cullis era as the club became one of the great sides of Europe, winning three league titles and two FA Cups. When Cullis became manager of neighbours Birmingham City in 1965, Gardiner joined him again. He returned to Wolves in 1969 as a scout, and helped discover the likes of John Richards.

Initially, Masterpiece Classic aired in the winter and early spring, Masterpiece Mystery! in the late spring and summer, and Masterpiece Contemporary in the fall. In later seasons, particularly after an increase in funding for WGBH and Masterpiece,‚ÄúMASTERPIECE Announces Major New Funding‚Äù the scheduling became more random.

The following lists them according to original season, and then in alphabetical order. Also included are the original UK series and episode numbers for each program, when they differ from the US numbers. The number of the season continues in the sequence set by the predecessor series, Masterpiece Theatre, which ended with Season 37.

Hay. It was the second book by the author, after Heal your Body which she wrote at age 60. After Hay appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Donahue in the same week in March 1988, the book appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list, and by 2008 over 35 million copies worldwide had been sold in over 30 languages, becoming the best-selling non-fiction book of all time. The book was also instrumental in the success of her publishing company, Hay House Inc. Today, due to the book she is \\"one of the best-selling authors in history\\", and one of largest selling women authors, after J. K. Rowling, Danielle Steel and Barbara Cartland.The Queen of the New Age, Mark Oppenheimer, New York Times magazine, May 4, 2008. Accessed March 9, 2013. ==Premise== The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body somehow have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself with eliminating symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve what she perceives as the mental root causes of disease. Hay believes that the causes of \\"dis-ease\\" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, and postulates that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as \\"mirror work\\" and affirmations. At the end of the book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and various emotional thought patterns that Hay believes causes them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, Heal Your Body, which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979.50 Self-Help Classics :Tom Butler-Bowdon. ==The film== In 2007, the book was adapted into a documentary film of the same name, with screenplay written by Gay Hendricks and directed by Michael A. Goorjian.Official Movie website == Controversy == The theories described in this book have been criticized as groundless by proponents of evidence based medicine. Specific passages within Hay's book appear to violate established medical fact. For example, the below quotation appears to falsely claim that migraine headaches are purely psychosomatic: ‚ÄúHeadaches come from invalidating the self . . . Forgive yourself, let it go, and the headache will dissolve back into the nothingness from where it came . . . Migraine headaches are created by people who want to be perfect and who create a lot of pressure on themselves. A lot of suppressed anger is involved‚Ä¶‚Äù Hay has also been criticized for 'blaming the victim' by suggesting that AIDS sufferers are causing their own illness due to poor mental attitude. Kyra Speaks points out that despite claiming for decades that positive attitude can defeat AIDS Hay has not been able to demonstrate any examples of this happening. Hay also cited eye problems, some socially and occupationally devastating, as the inability to face the truth; earning her place as the D.W. Griffith of metaphysics. == References  * Louise Hay, website * Summaries of the book You Can Heal Your Life Category:Self-help books Category:1984 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about spirituality Category:Books adapted into films ","title":"You Can Heal Your Life"},{"id":"19330481","text":"Yrj√∂ Nurmio in 1967.

A \\"vowt\\", passing under two rivers, is said to link the castle with Kilwinning Abbey.Service, John (Editor) (1887). The Life & Recollections of Doctor Duguid of Kilwinning. Pub. Young J. Pentland. P. 48. Mysterious tunnels or \\"secret passages\\" are a common element of the local folklore tradition in Europe. In Norwegian a secret tunnel-like passage is called a l√∏nngang (l√∏nn means \\"hidden\\" or \\"secret\\", and gang means \\"passage\\") and in Swedish a l√∂nng√•ng. Such tunnels are said to physically link prominent places such as country houses, castles, churches, ancient monuments and other, often medieval, buildings. Legends about the existence of secret tunnels usually involve improbably long subterranean passages, sometimes running under major obstacles such as rivers and lakes to reach their destinations. Religious buildings, monks and the landed gentry are particularly common elements in many tunnel stories. It is unlikely that many of the recorded tunnels exist physically, for this is a characteristic of their very nature; their significance lies in the number of similar legends of tunnels that have arisen and in connection with the more esoteric notions of channels or paths of earth energy, and such. == The origins of secret passage myths == One of the entrances to the Cleeves Cove cave system in Scotland, known as the Elfhame Inside the main chamber of Halliggye Fogou, Trelowarren, Cornwall Underground structures have a fascination due to their being hidden from view and their contents, purpose, extent and destinations remaining unknown. Over the centuries many underground structures have been discovered by chance, ranging from Cornish Fogous, souterrains that are possibly Pictish, Roman and medieval sewers to smuggling tunnels, escape tunnels, siege tunnels, and the like. On occasion, possible tunnels prove to be of purely natural origin, such as at Cleeves Cove cave in Scotland, or Kents Cavern in England. The site at Cleeves Cove cave was previously known as the 'Elfhouse' or 'Elfhame',Paterson, James (1863-66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. - III - Cunninghame. J. Stillie. Edinburgh. p. 140. the locals at that time believing that elves had made it their abode.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont 1604‚Äì1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow. P. 125.Ness, J. A. (1969 - 70). Landmarks of Kilwynnyng. Privately printed. p. 31. Mammoth Cave, the world's longest cave Rarely, natural caves or tunnel systems can be of great extent; the cave system with the greatest total length of passage is Mammoth Cave (Kentucky, USA) at in length, whilst the next most extensive known cave is Jewel Cave near Custer, South Dakota, USA, at . Some castles really did have escape tunnels, such as possibly the short passage located at Loudoun Castle in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which leads from the old kitchens to a 'tunnel- like' bridge over the Hag Burn; this may however have been a drain of some kind. Others examples were longer: the young king Edward III was imprisoned by Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March at Nottingham Castle, and in 1330 a small group of armed supporters of Edward III made use of a long, winding secret passage which led directly into the castle, allowing them to surprise and capture Mortimer. The ice house entrance, Eglinton Country Park Other tunnels are products of an excessive desire for personal privacy, such as at Welbeck Abbey and Brownlow Castle. Another tunnel allowed for the supposed free and secret movement of monks, abbots and other ecclesiastics who may have had cause to keep a low profile for fear of attack or abusive treatment during periods of unrest or persecution. Smugglers at times avoided the excise man by making use of drains, sewers or water supply conduits, although in a few cases they seem to have constructed tunnels for the purpose of smuggling. Bruce Walker, an expert on Scottish vernacular architecture, has suggested that the relatively numerous and usually long-ruined ice houses on country estates may have led to Scotland's many tunnel legends. The appearance of ice house entrance could have prompted the uninitiated to make such deductions since ice houses are often inconspicuously located in such places as ha-ha walls, house and stable basements, woodland banks, and open fields.Walker, Bruce (1978). Keeping it cool. Scottish Vernacular buildings Working Group. Edinburgh & Dundee. Pages 564-565 Many legends are associated with the actual and supposed activities of the Knights Templar and they are rich in stories about tunnels connecting the various properties that the order possessed up to the 12th century, when it was suppressed. Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung and others had various psychological interpretations of the symbolic meanings of tunnels and these may have a part to play in the origins of tunnel myths. ==Examples== Denmark Aalborghus castle In the city of Aalborg a tunnel is said to have run from the convent under the fjord to another convent near Sundby. This tunnel had branches which ran to an old bridge, two churches and to the castle of Aalborghus. A student once tried to explore the tunnels with a long cord, a sword and a light. The broken cord was retrieved, but the student was never seen again. England At Furness Abbey a tunnel has been said to run underneath the Abbey to both Piel Castle and Dalton Castle. This was said to be how the monks travelled to and from each monument to receive foodstuffs and keep watch upon the towns. It has also been rumoured that the Holy Grail and King John‚Äôs missing jewels, are actually hidden somewhere inside. Richmond Castle Richmond Castle in North Yorkshire stands in an impressive cliff-top position overlooking the River Swale. A potter named Thompson is said to have discovered a tunnel entrance at the bottom of this cliff. Following it deep into the hillside, he came to a large cavern where slept King Arthur and his knights around the famous Round Table. On the table lay an ancient horn and a mighty sword. Thompson reached out and picked up the horn, but the sleepers began to awake and, fearing for his life, the potter fled. As he raced down the tunnel back to daylight and safety, he heard a voice behind him declare: ::\\"Potter Thompson, Potter Thompson! ::If thou hadst drawn the sword or blown the horn, ::Thou hadst been the luckiest man e'er was born.\\" The tunnel appears to have been well known, though the cave remains hidden. A second story tells how this subterranean passage is supposed to run from the Castle to nearby Easby Abbey. Some soldiers once sent a drummer-boy along it to test the theory and followed the sound of his drum almost halfway to the Abbey. Then the drumming stopped and the boy was never seen alive again, but his ghost is said to haunt the tunnel, from where a slow drumbeat is still sometimes heard. A memorial stone marks the spot at which the drum beat was last heard. It is believed that the legendary tunnel was constructed in medieval times as an escape route to the castle for the abbot and canons of the abbey in case of an attack from the Scots, who were continually making raids into the northern counties of England. Hertford Castle A smugglers' tunnel is said to run from Smugglers' Farm in Herstmonceux, Sussex to the Pevensey Marshes, a good distance away. A whole network of secret Knights Templar tunnels is said to run beneath Hertford Castle, running to Dinsley and other local places. A 'secret tunnel' exists at Pevensey Castle in East Sussex, although not open for public access. It links the keep with the former market square and is thought to be Norman in origin; it was reused during the Second World War. Glastonbury Tor A series of tunnels are said to lie beneath Glastonbury Tor. The most famous tale is about a tunnel from Glastonbury Abbey to the Tor. At one time some thirty monks were rumoured to have entered the Tor via this tunnel, but only three came out again, and two of them were insane and one was struck dumb. Another widely believed legend is that of a long-distance tunnel leading from the crypt of the Lady (or Galilee) Chapel, under the River Brue to a distant point, possibly to the village of Street, where a passage exists from an outlying building in the grounds of the old manor house. A dog is said to have been put into the tunnel at Street and found his way out at the Glastonbury end. A tunnel is said to run from King's College Chapel to Granchester Manor, Cambridge, passing under the river Cam. A tunnel is said to run from Newbury Town Hall to St Nicolas Church. This belief may have started because there are east-west flowing brick Victorian service tunnels running from roughly the Newbury arcade towards this church; these were exposed to the public's gaze during construction work. A tunnel is also said to run from Newbury Castle (400 ft above sea level) and Shaw House (260 ft, thus 140 ft below it). The point of entry is said to be a hollow space (now blocked) in the south-east angle of the enclosure. In 1930 workmen investigated the legend by excavating the entrance, but found nothing. At Necton in East Anglia a tunnel is said to run from the restored 14th-century church of All Saints to Necton Hall, in possession of the Mason family since the time of Henry VII. Gisborough Priory The first of a number of legendary tunnels under Norwich leads from the Castle (TM232085) to the Guildhall (TM231085) near the market-place, erected 1407-13 on the site of the old tollhouse. It still has a 14th-century vault below it that was the crypt (and prison) of the former building. A second tunnel (in which a pig was once lost) heads from the Castle for Carrow Priory (TM242073 area), a Benedictine nunnery whose scant 12th century remains on the outskirts of Norwich are incorporated into a residence of the Colman family, near the junction of King Street and Bracondale. The third tunnel from the Castle ran to the Norman cathedral to the north-east (TM235089), begun in 1096 by Bishop Herbert de Losinga and finally consecrated in 1101-2. Yet another subterranean way links the Castle with the Crown Derby near the Guildhall. The interior of Norwich Cathedral - the Nave At Norwich Cathedral another tunnel begins, running for about nine miles to the ruins of St Benet's Abbey (TG383157) on the marshes at Ludham. A much shorter one, allegedly used by monks, was said to run from the cathedral to Samson & Hercules House. The Anglia Restaurant in Prince's Street has a splendid groined crypt for a cellar, and two tunnels from here are said to lead to the cathedral and to St. Andrew's Hall. Monks supposedly used a tunnel from the cellars of the Shrub House at the corner of Charing Cross Street to the site of St. Benedict's Gates. In early January 1644, Cromwell sent his forces to Norwich to demand the surrender of a small group of Royalists, whom he heard to be present at the Maid's Head Hotel. According to legend, as the Parliamentarians entered the hotel, the Royalists retreated through a secret tunnel, stretching steel ropes across the way behind them. Many of Cromwell's men (and their horses) were beheaded as they raced through the tunnel in pursuit, and this incident is used to explain the sound of ghostly hoofbeats often heard emanating from under the ground around the Cathedral Close.Atkin, Malcolm (1975), The Tunnels of Norwich, in 'Norfolk Fair', May 1975, pp. 6 - 7. A postern at Northampton Castle One smugglers' tunnel was rumoured to run from Kinson, now a Bournemouth suburb, to the coast some four miles away. In the 19th century, it was said that an underground passage ran from the remains of the 12th century Gisborough Priory, immediately south of Guisborough parish church, to a field that lay in the parish of Tocketts. Halfway along was said to be a chest of gold guarded by a raven or crow.Henderson, William (1866). Notes on the Folk-lore of the Northern Counties. In Redcar and Cleveland almost every old castle and ruined monastery has its legend of a subterranean passage leading therefrom, which someone has penetrated to a certain distance, and has seen an iron chest, supposed to be full of gold, on which was perched a raven. The raven may suggest a Scandinavian origin of the legends. Binham Priory Bracknell's Old Manor is a sturdy 17th century brick manor house having a priest hole and is said to have secret passages connecting to the exterior. Droitwich Spa is said to have a passageway that leads from St Augustine‚Äôs church, Dodderhill, to Friar Street in the town centre. A system of tunnels is said to run from there to St Augustine‚Äôs and St Andrew‚Äôs churches. The story that Thomas Becket fled from Northampton Castle is a well documented part of 12th century history, but how the persecuted Archbishop of Canterbury managed to flee from the fortress remains a mystery. One myth is that he fled from the clutches of Henry II through a tunnel that linked the castle to All Saints Church in Mercers Row. At Binham Priory in Norfolk a fiddler entered the tunnel which ran beneath the building and could be heard for some distance before all sound of him suddenly ceased. The fiddler was never seen again. The rhyme below dates from the 17th century and recalls the tradition that a tunnel connects what is now Syon House with the friary of Sheen at Richmond in Surrey, a considerable distance away. ::\\"The Nun of Sion, with the Friar of Shean, ::Went under water to play the Quean.\\" The origin of the legend remains a mystery. In Leicestershire a subterranean passage is said to connect a nunnery which once stood near the Humber Stone with Leicester Abbey. In the cellars under Leicester Castle a witch known as 'Black' or 'Cat Anna' is said to have lived. She is said to have journeyed to the Dane Hills through an underground passage. Ireland In Lurgan a tunnel supposedly went from Brownlow House to the local police station, the courthouse and to the church in the middle of the town. Another tunnel was from Soyes Mill to Lurgan Castle. One explanation for the Brownlow tunnel was that Lord Brownlow had a very over protective wife, and after many years of a good marriage, things went sour, so Brownlow had this tunnel dug so he would be able to exit the castle after dark without his wife's finding out. Once out, he would go on the hunt for some Lurgan lassies, book a room at the Ashburn Hotel, then leave early in the morning to get back in time for breakfast at the castle with his wife. Lakafinna, to the South of Bullaun, has a castle and local folklore relates that a tunnel exists between this castle and the village of Ballyara. Scotland Caldwell House circa 1910Pride, David (1910), A History of the Parish of Neilston. Paisley : Alexander Gardner. Facing P. 128. Blackness Castle in Lothian is said to have a tunnel linking it with the House of Binns, about three kilometres distant. A tunnel is said to run from Stanecastle near Irvine to Eglinton Castle and another from Stanecastle to Seagate Castle in Irvine, complete with a mythical piper.Strawhorn, Page 16 Monkredding was a property of Kilwinning Abbey and a tunnel is said to link the two properties. Another tunnel is said to run from Stanecastle to Dundonald. A subterranean passage was found by workmen at Stanecastle in the 19th century.Irvine Times, 04-02-2009. p. 18. Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland A tunnel is said to run from near Ravenscraig Castle down to the Annick Water just up stream of Lainshaw Castle. The tunnel was reportedly crawled through by the grandfather of a local man and may be related to the drainage of the nearby, now flooded, Hillhouse quarry, the Water Plantation area, and other Lainshaw estate lands. A tunnel is said to run from Loudoun Castle under the River Irvine to Cessnock Castle in Galston, East Ayrshire, Scotland.Loudoun, Craufuird, C. A History of the House of Loudoun and Associated Families. Pub. C. C. Loudoun. p 36. Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire was built on top of a cave system, the castle's previous name was 'Cove', Scots for cave. The Marquess of Ailsa sent his piper into the cave and he was never seen again however, according to the legend, the sound of bagpipes can still be heard at the piper's brae that lies above the caverns. A tunnel is said to run from the old Giffen Castle near Beith to the now abandoned farm of Bank of Giffen; some years back some children are said to have found and made their way safely through the tunnel. Cleeves Cove cave, the site of the Elfhame, is said to be connected to Loudoun Hill. It is reported that once the Laird of Auchenskeich's collie dog entered the cave at its entrance above the Dusk Water and came out at Loudoun Hill near Darvel, many miles away. The end of the Cleeves Cove system is said to have never been found.Service (1890), Page 106 Mauchline Castle is said to be linked to Kingencleugh Castle by a tunnel.Cuthbertson, Page 100 A tunnel is said to run the one and a half miles from Craufurdland Castle to Dean Castle in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. It was used to provision Dean Castle when it was besieged for several months in the time of Edward I, and the siege was only abandoned when the besieged hung several freshly killed sheep over the wall and offered them to the attackers. The tunnel entrance was only blocked up in the early 19th century.Chambers, Page 306 Cuthbertson records the tradition of a tunnel running from Dean Castle down to the Kilmarnock Water near the old Begbie's Tavern of Burn's fame. This tunnel is said to have become a public sewer.Cuthbertson, Pages 204-205 Greenan Castle is said to be linked by a tunnel to St John's Tower at Montgomerieston in Ayr. Stories of it containing skeletons in chains and the entrance being found circulated in the 1950s.MacArthur, Page 111 A local tradition was that an underground passage ran from Caldwell House to the old Lugton Inn (now demolished), under the Lugton Water. A search by owners in the cellars did not reveal any signs of a hidden passage. Culross Abbey in Fife Persistent rumours exist of a tunnel which is said to run from Kilwinning Abbey, under the 'Bean Yaird', below the 'Easter Chaumers' and the 'Leddy firs', and then underneath the River Garnock and on to Eglinton Castle. No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries, which does exist under the old abbey, or to the main sewer that would have led from the monastery to the river.Baird, Crawford (1969), The Monastic buildings of Kilwinning Abbey.

At Strathaven Castle in South Lanarkshire tunnels are recorded in local tradition as running from the castle to the Sweetie's Brae, Mill Brae, and the Tower. Road works in the 19th century did not reveal anything of their existence. A tunnel is believed to exist beneath Culross Abbey in Fife and within a man is said to sit on a golden chair waiting to give valuable treasures to anyone who succeeds in finding him. Many years ago a blind piper decided to try and upon entering at Newgate with his dog he proceeded to search and could be heard playing his pipes as far as the West Kirk, three quarters of a mile away. Eventually the dog emerged into the daylight, but the piper was never seen or heard of again. The caves below Keil Point on Isle of Arran contain a slab which may have been an ancient altar. It has the prints of two right feet on it, said to be those of Saint Columba. In the 19th century some women found the secret tunnel of Coupar Angus Abbey near the entrance to the churchyard. One went in and was never seen again; however, in 1982 a local mason found the entrance again and went in some distance before finding a cave-in. It is said that the tunnel ran a further two and a half miles to a souterrain at Pitcur.Holder, page 50.

Near Moniaive in Dumfries and Galloway a tunnel is said to have run from under the Caitloch bridge over the Dalwhat Water to Caitloch House, some distance away. The tunnel is said to have been used by Covenanters evading the king's dragoons during those troubled days and is now blocked.Dumfries and Galloway Council, Moniaive Information board. Brodick Castle on the Isle of Arran had a tunnel which apparently ran down to the shore in Brodick Bay. Circa 1920 the duchess was renovating the castle and had a hollow-sounding section of wall opened up. This work quickly ceased when a story was remembered of two plague victims in the 18th century having been walled up in an old tunnel after they were first covered in quicklime and rubble.Fforde, Page 30 Alexander GordonGordon, Alexander (1726). Interarium septentrionale London. p. 41. in 1726 records that at Ardoch Roman Fort near Dunblane in Perth and Kinross a subterranean passage was said to run from the fort, under the River Tay to the fort or 'Keir' on Grinnin Hill. This tunnel is said to contain a great deal of treasure as recorded in these lines; { cellpadding=\\"10\\" border=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" -  f4f4f4;\\" \\"From the Camp of Ardoch, To the Grinnin Hill of Keir, Are nine Kings rents, For seven hundred year.\\" }  Serbia  In addition to known real tunnel networks, various legends of tunnels exist as well. According to one, Church of Saint George in Petrovaradin is connected by a tunnel under Danube with Church of Saint John of Nepomuk in Novi Sad. Similarly, Kalemegdan fortress is said to be connected with Zemun. Sweden It is said that a tunnel was constructed between the Holy Cross Priory, Dalby and Lund Cathedral to serve as an escape route for fleeing monks. Ukraine A mysterious tunnel said to run to Kniazh Hill was used during emergencies by the Semashko Princes and other owners of Gubkiv Castle, the powerful princes Danylovych. This tunnel, it is said, starts near the deep well in the castle yard. Wales Local legend states that a tunnel connects the now ruined Court Farm with the nearby church in Pembrey, South Wales. == Subterranean passages == Tunnels differ from most of the numerous examples of actual secret passages and the like in that they are usually very long. Many examples of extensive underground passages do actually exist, built for a variety of purposes. However, they often lack a link with churches, aristocracy, or some historical event and do not necessarily involve prominent buildings. An exception is the tunnel that is said to run from the 'bottomless' Saint Michael's Cave in Gibraltar continuing under the Strait of Gibraltar and exiting in Morocco, Africa.  Drains, sewers and water supplies  Prague Castle Drains, sewers and water supply tunnels often have a more than superficial resemblance to pedestrian tunnels and have added to legends of mysterious passages of secretive and ambiguous purposes. An example of a medieval building with many subterranean passages is Prague Castle. In the Middle Ages underground passages were dug out mainly for purposes of defence. Later drainage conduits transported waste water to the foot of the castle wall and then let it fall freely over the slope of the bare cliff face into the bed of the Brusnice stream. The inhabitants of the castle complained of the smell of the slope, so the conduits were extended to the Brusnice stream. One leads from Hradcany Square and the other, known as the castle passage, from the second castle courtyard to the bottom of the Deer Moat. Paisley Abbey At Paisley Abbey in Scotland, few of the original monastic buildings survived into the 20th century, so landscaping of the area around the church in 1990 provided an ideal opportunity to investigate the positions of those now \\"lost\\" channels. The main drain, which would have brought fresh water into the complex and taken away the effluents, would have acted as the spinal column of the buildings. Local knowledge led to the rediscovery of a substantial medieval drain with fine stonework and enough space for a person to walk through. In Exeter, South Devon, medieval tunnels dating from the 14th century under the High Street are a unique ancient monument. The tunnels were built to house the pipes that brought fresh water to the city. These underground passages have long exercised a fascination over local people, bringing stories of buried treasure, secret escape routes, passages for nuns and priests‚Äîeven a ghost on a bicycle. Their purpose was simple: to bring clean drinking water from natural springs in fields lying outside the walled city through lead pipes into the heart of the city.Exeter's Underground Passages on Culture24.  Siege mines or tunnels  Saint Andrews castle ruins Such tunnels may have led to the creation and survival of local legends of subterranean passages. An example of a well documented tunnels is the one dug at St Andrews in Scotland. Cardinal Beaton in March 1546, had the Protestant preacher, George Wishart, burnt at the stake in front of his castle walls and this was subsequently used as a pretext for Beaton's murder at the hands of local Protestant lairds who captured the castle by stealth. A long siege followed on the orders of the Regent, the Earl of Arran, but by November 1546 this had resulted in a stalemate. A determined effort to undermine the walls of the castle via a spacious tunnel large enough to take pack animals was intercepted, after several false starts, by the defenders. They dug a low, narrow and twisting countermine through the rock that eventually broke into the mine itself.  Escape tunnels  Many medieval buildings are said to have had escape tunnels, secret by nature and hence likely to be the stuff of myth, legend and exaggeration. One example is the escape tunnel running from Maynooth Castle with its exit at the tower in Laraghbryan.Maynooth & Laraghbryan. A short escape tunnel has been located at Loudoun Castle in Ayrshire, Scotland, which leads from the old kitchens to a 'tunnel-like' bridge over a burn. Other escape tunnels were longer, such as at Nottingham Castle, where the young king Edward III was imprisoned by Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. In 1330 a small group of armed supporters of Edward III used a secret passage to attack Mortimer. The attackers entered through a long, winding secret passage which led directly into the castle, allowing them to surprise and capture Mortimer, releasing the king, who was unharmed. An example exists of an escape tunnel built in Covenanting times at Newholm in Dolphinton parish, Lanarkshire. This tunnel was built by Major Joseph Learmont, a leading member of the Covenanter cause who fought at Rullion Green and Bothwell Bridge. He hid within the 40 yard long stone lined tunnel when necessary and evaded capture for 16 years until traditionally said to have been betrayed by a maid servant. The stone lining was eventually used to build a walled garden; it had run from a cellar to a turf dyke in mossy ground. Remains of it may have been discovered in the 1960s however details are sparse.Covenanter's Secret Tunnel Discovered in Lanarkshire  Smugglers' tunnels  The Copperhouse Pool, Hayle Porthcothan Bay Many villages on the southern coast of England have a local legend of a smugglers' tunnel; the entrances to most of the actual smuggler's tunnels have been lost or bricked up. Some tunnel stories turn out to be very plausible, such as the tunnel at Hayle in Cornwall which really does seem to have been built specifically for smuggling. More modern tunnels can be found along New England's coast. In other instances the tunnel either doubles as a storm drain or some other functional channel, or else is an extension of a natural fissure in the rock, as at Methleigh and Porthcothan.http://www.smuggling.co.uk/history_hiding.html Smugglers' Britain Beith in North Ayrshire was a notorious haunt of smugglers at one time, and legend has it that a tunnel ran from the town centre down to Kilbirnie Loch. == See also == *Secret passage *Smuggling tunnel == References == ;Notes ;Bibliography # Chambers, Robert (1828).

The Final was held at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford, England. It would be the 28th and last time the World Final would be held in England under the traditional single meeting format. Sweden's Per Jonsson won his only World Individual Championship to become the first Swedish World Champion since Anders Michanek in 1974. Jonsson defeated American Shawn Moran in a run-off after both finished the meeting on 13 points. Moran was later stripped of his second place by the FIM for failing a drug test taken at the Overseas Final. After Moran's disqualification, the FIM did not upgrade the placings, thus records show no second place rider for the 1990 World Final. Australian youngster Todd Wiltshire, believed by many judges to be one who would be making up the numbers in his first World Final, finished third with 12 points after sensationally winning his first two rides. After having won each World Final since 1984, including five 1-2 finishes and taking all podium places in 1988, the 1990 World Final saw no Danish riders finishing on the podium for the first time since 1983. Defending champion Hans Nielsen, the only Dane in the field following an injury to Jan O. Pedersen which kept him from riding, finished in 4th place with 11 points.1990 Individual Speedway World Championship Jonsson became the first rider to win both the Under-21 and Senior Individual World Championships having previously won the 1985 Under-21 World Championship (from 1977 until 1988 the World U/21 title was known as the European U/21 Championship, though the winners have generally been acknowledged as junior World Champions). ==Overseas Series== New Zealand Qualification *First 2 from New Zealand final to Commonwealth final { class= !Date Venue Winner Runner-up 3rd place  - !colspan=6 South Island Final - align=center ??

His music career was put on hold until 1990, when he began playing in local clubs at the urging of a former bassist. In the early 1990s, he formed a group called Mem Shannon and the Membership, who won a spot playing at the 1991 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.

It is located two coves north of Two Harbors at Cherry Cove. The camp, valley and cove get their name from the Catalina cherry trees native to the island.Prunus lyonii, CATALINA CHERRY It also offers non-Scouting programs on a year-round basis. ==Overview== Camp Cherry Valley has operated as a Boy Scout camp since the 1920s, but other groups use it as well. CIMI, the Catalina Island Marine Institute, runs a program from September through November, taking a winter break then recommencing February through May. The CIMI program caters to youth groups other than boy scouts. Being right on the Pacific ocean, the camp allows superb snorkeling and scuba diving. During the summer the calm waters stay around seventy degrees Fahrenheit. Scouts sleep in two-person canvas tents set on wooden platforms located up the canyon under the cherry trees. To reach the camp, Scouts take a two-hour chartered ferry across the channel, a 22-mile distance from San Pedro or Long Beach to Two Harbors and then hike 1.3 miles to the camp. The camp promotes itself to scouts with the Tribe of Torqua. The \\"Tribe\\" was instituted by Council Executive H. Benjamin \\"Skipper\\" Robinson as a special group of honor campers.USSSP Tribe of Torqua As of 2018, five main hikes were available for Scouts to take on Wednesday hike day: * Emerald Bay: 4-mile hike to a sandy beach in a protected harbor, option of adding trip to goat whiskers summit to increase hike to 5 miles. Scouts hike in way and then take a 2-mile guided canoe or kayak the other way. Scouts have the opportunity to swim in the ocean during their time at the bay. * Parson's Landing: 7-mile hike to a sandy beach with a 2-mile canoe/kayak trip. * Shark Harbor: 16-mile round-trip hike to a sandy beach with surf on the windward side of the island. Scouts have the chance to get in the water as well * Silver Peak: 21-mile hike to the highest point on the West end of Catalina. * Little Fisherman's: A 4-mile hike up to Goat Whiskers, the mountain at the top of Cherry Cove, then down to Little Fisherman's beach. *(Note: several other variations of these hike can occur. A hike may be cancelled or not allowed due to staffing shortages, or other difficulties.) Scouts have the opportunity to participate in an Advanced Camper Experience (ACE) while at camp. This program is for Adults and Scouts 14 and up. This program takes place during the week. The program has a morning portion which usually includes a kayak and a snorkel. They go to places like pirates cove and Guerrilla rock. The afternoon portion scouts get the chance to go paddle boarding, sailing or snorkeling. Scouts can take part in the ACE hike which is a hike to shark harbor or silver peak. Scouts can participate in all, or some of the ace activities. Scouts who participate in all activities and the hike can earn the ACE patch. Scouts can earn the BSA snorkel patch as well. The programs activities are staff and weather permitting. ==History== There is a small silver mine located in the cove left from the time the western part of Catalina Island was full of such mines. The mine was shut down by orders from Abraham Lincoln, after he had got rumors the Confederate army may attack California to acquire gold and silver to fund their war efforts. In 1864 Union Troops were put on the island to stop mining. The San Gabriel Valley Council (former Pasadena Council) opened and operated the camp starting in 1923. Throughout the 1920s-1930s, Scouts would travel via train from Pasadena to San Pedro, then take The Great White Steamer (SS Catalina) to Avalon. After arriving in Avalon, they would then travel up to Cherry Cove on the Betty-O, a Wrigley tour boat, now a Marina del Rey fishing boat.Pasadena Star-News, Home to Pasadena, Page A7, column 1, Sunday, September 18, 2011 When Cherry Valley opened in 1923, it was very primitive that first year. There was no pier, so campers had to wade ashore or be shuttled from the Betty-O via rowboats. Scouts ate at an \\"open air\\" Dining Hall and were plagued by yellow jackets. Beginning in 1947, Scouts traveled directly from San Pedro to Cherry Cove on the H-10 water taxi. They would continue to travel via water taxi until 1973.Pasadena History.org The original 1937 lighthouse was blown down in a storm in 1998.

The mountain, sometimes referred to as a hill for its smaller size than a mountain in land form, is the symbolic scenic spot of √úr√ºmqi. The local √úr√ºmqi Television Station adopted the shape of Hong Shan in red as its logo. ==Etymology== As the rocks of the mountain reflect a bright red color, people call it Hong Shan (\\"Red Mountain\\" in Chinese). The red rocks are composed of dark purple sand gravel laid down during the Permian period. Hong Shan Mountain lies at the intersection of Hongshan Road (Á∫¢Â±±Ë∑Ø) and Riverside Road (Hetan Road) (Ê≤≥Êª©Ë∑Ø), √úr√ºmqi, and is best viewed from Xi Daqiao Bridge. ==History== Hong Shan Park is in the center of √úr√ºmqi and contains a 1391-meter-high mountain. The temple lying on the hilltop is called Yu Huang Ge (\\"Chamber of Heavenly King\\") and is said to have been built during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.), when many monks studied scripture there. Since then, this chamber has become a place of tourism for business people from Central Asia and tourists from all over the world. Yu Huang Ge was famous and prosperous until a riot in 1930 destroyed this popular chamber. There is a nine-storey pagoda named Zhen Long Ta at the top of the mountain. It was built in Yuan Dynasty (1277-1367 A.D.). This 25-meter pagoda has been preserved carefully ever since it was built. When the nightfall or sunset begins, the pagoda is marvelous; this view used to be one of the eight most famous scenic spots in ancient √úr√ºmqi. Before the Chinese government began the cultivation-planting project in Xinjiang, the mountain was bare and emerged without any trees. In the 1950s, therefore, after several years of cultivation planting, the mountain gained a brand-new look; the hill today is covered with trees, and the mountain looks beautiful. ==External links== * Pictorial History of Urumqi‚Äôs Hong Shan Park * Â§©Â±±ÁΩëÔºö‰πåÈ≤ÅÊú®ÈΩêÔºçÁ∫¢Â±± Category:√úr√ºmqi Category:Mountains of Xinjiang ","title":"Hong Shan"},{"id":"19331198","text":"Siseni is a town and municipality in Gulmi District in the Lumbini Zone of central Nepal.

It broadcasts to Staffordshire and South Cheshire. ==History== Signal Radio began broadcasting at 6am on Monday 5 September 1983. The first voice on air was breakfast presenter John Evington and the first song played was Beautiful Noise by Neil Diamond. Originally, Signal Radio aired as a single full service station on 104.3 MHz and 1170 kHz (257 metres). The station's name was derived from Signal, the local newspaper in the Five Town novels by Staffordshire writer Arnold Bennett. Signal began broadcasting to south Cheshire on 96.4 FM in 1989, before opening a new frequency for the Stafford area on 96.9 FM a year later. The two frequencies began carrying a new alternative AOR-led service, Echo 96, in October 1990. Echo continued for around a year in Stafford while the Cheshire frequency was merged with that of the short-lived Stockport ILR station KFM to form Signal Cheshire in 1991. By the end of the year, the Stafford service was relaunched as Signal Stafford, carrying opt-out programming from the Stoke-based service. In Staffordshire, Signal Radio began carrying a separate Golden Breakfast Show on 1170 AM in 1992 in order to provide separate services on AM and FM and avoid relinquishing frequencies. The AM opt-out gradually expanded into a full-time separate station, Signal 2. Signal Radio was brought in 1999 by The Wireless Group, which was subsequently acquired by UTV Media six years later for ¬£97 million. Following the sale of its television assets, the group was latterly brought by News Corp in September 2016. In 2000, Signal's Cheshire service was split into two - 96.4 FM was merged with the Staffordshire service while 104.9 FM was relaunched as Imagine FM, a dedicated service for south Manchester and Cheshire, which was latterly sold onto become an wholly independent station in 2009. Signal 1 celebrated its 30th birthday on Saturday 10 August 2013 with a special concert at Betley Court Farm in Crewe. On 8 February 2019, Signal 1 and the Wireless Group's network of local radio stations were sold to Bauer.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/bauer-buys- wireless-groups-local-radio-stations/ In May 2020, Bauer announced that Signal 1 would join the Hits Radio network, while retaining its on-air branding. Signal 1 began introducing the Hits Radio network off peak programming from 15 June 2020.Radio Today: Hits Radio networking starts on new Bauer stations Signal 1 joined the Hits Radio network on 20 July 2020.Bauer starts to roll out Hits and Greatest Hits to new radio stations Stuart Clarkson, Radio Today, 9 July 2020 ==Station information== Studios Signal 1's studios are based on Stoke Road in the Shelton area of Stoke-on-Trent in a building previously occupied as a warehouse. There are seven dedicated studios as well as a studio used for live music recordings, shared with sister station Signal 2 and networked output for the Wireless Group. Studio 7 at Signal Radio is also used to broadcast shows for other stations across Wireless Group. Technical Signal 1's main transmitter is at Alsagers Bank, broadcasting on 102.6 FM. As well as covering North Staffordshire and South Cheshire, the transmitter can be received well into the North West and down into the West Midlands, due to the height of the transmitter. Signal 1 also has relay transmitters at Pye Green, covering Stafford and the surrounding area on 96.9 FM, and at Sutton Common, covering Congleton, Macclesfield and surrounding areas on 96.4 FM. All of Signal 1's transmitters carry split advertising for their specific areas, and both Sutton Common and Pye Green are BT backbone link towers. Signal 1 also broadcasts on the local Stoke and Stafford DAB multiplex 12D. Signal Radio Media Academy In 2012, Signal 1 lent its name to the Signal Radio Media Academy, a course run by Stoke on Trent College as a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Radio Production. For two days a week, the course is based at the Burslem Campus of Stoke on Trent College where the students also run their own radio station, Heatwave Radio. Teaching takes places both at the college in Burslem as well at Signal's studios in Shelton, with specialist input from the station's staff.  Outside broadcasting and events  Occasional outside broadcasts are made in a specially built OB studio on a converted bus. The station's roadshow unit has a self-contained stage and PA system on board. The Signal Radio Street Team also go out and about the area representing the station. Most Street Team members are part of the Signal Radio Media Academy and many have gone on to other roles across the network including presenting, producing and sales. Signal Radio also hosts events for local children's charities every year under the Help a Signal Child banner. ==Programming== All networked programming originates from Bauer‚Äôs Manchester studios.

See drop-down essay on \\"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\\" Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of New Testament writings appeared in Oxyrhynchus (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of Decius. Beginning in AD 284 the Emperor Diocletian persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians. This event became a bloodshed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or Coptic Church. It became known as the 'Era of Martyrs' and is commemorated in the Coptic calendar in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief, though relief of the spirit and of its worldly desires to attain peace and unity with Christ the Creator, not escaping the persecutions. The practice precipitated the rise of monasticism, for which the Egyptians, namely St. Antony, St. Bakhum, St. Shenouda and St. Amun, are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.Jankowski, James, Egypt: A Short History (One World (Oxford)), 2000, p. 32 In 451 A.D., following the Council of Chalcedon, the Church of Alexandria was divided into two branches. Those who accepted the terms of the Council became known as Chalcedonians or Melkites. Those who did not abide by the Council's terms were labeled non- Chalcedonians or Monophysites (and later Jacobites after Jacob Baradaeus). The non-Chalcedonians, however, rejected the term Monophysites as erroneous and insisted on being called Miaphysites. The majority of the Egyptians belonged to the Miaphysite branch, which led to their persecution by the Byzantine imperial authorities in Egypt. First persecutions occurred during reigns of emperors Marcian (450-457) and Leo I (457-474). This continued until the Arab conquest of Egypt. Tragic conflicts between Eastern-Orthodox Greeks and Oriental-Orthodox Copts during that era, from the middle of 5th to the middle of 7th century, resulted in permanent divisions and consequent emergence of anti-Eastern Orthodox sentiment among Copts and anti-Oriental Orthodox sentiment among Greeks. ==Islamic era== The Muslim conquest of Egypt The Muslim conquest of Egypt took place in AD 639, during the Byzantine empire. Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained a mainly Christian, but Copts lost their majority status after the 14th century. Modern era Observers note a large gap between rights for Copts and other minorities that exist under the law and what exists in practice. Critics cite that while in 2016 the parliament worked to pass a bill making it easier for Christians to get government permission to build churches, in practice security officials have stopped actual construction. In Egypt the government does not officially recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity; also certain interfaith marriages are not allowed either, this prevents marriages between converts to Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim education. The government also requires permits for repairing churches or building new ones, which are often withheld. See drop-down essay on \\"Religious Freedom in Egypt\\" Article 235 of the 2013 draft constitution requires the next legislative body to create a law that would remove the restrictions on the building of churches. Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country only if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing. Copts complain that disputes between Christians and Muslims are often put before \\"reconciliation councils\\", and that these councils invariably favour Muslims. Some Copts complain that the police do not respond when crimes are committed against them. Copts also have little representation in government, leading them to fear there is little hope of progress. In 1981, President Anwar Sadat, internally exiled the Coptic Pope Shenouda III accusing him of fomenting inter-confessional strife. Sadat then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. In 1985 President Hosni Mubarak restored Pope Shenouda III. The government and other Egyptian sources blame tribal behavior in rural Egypt for much of the violence. During Mubarak's regime (following that of Anwar Sadat), Copts were still struggling to avoid persecution but there were two appointed Coptic Ministers and one governor, in addition to one Copt (Naguib Sawiris) known as one of the most successful businessmen in the world (and residing in Egypt at the time). Copts face heightened persecution and marginalization as their churches are systematically attacked. Naguib Sawiris does not reside in Egypt anymore.

Further allegations of organised abduction of Copts, trafficking and police collusion continue in 2017. In April 2010, a bipartisan group of 17 members of the U.S. Congress expressed concern to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Office about Coptic women who faced \\"physical and sexual violence, captivity ... exploitation in forced domestic servitude or commercial sexual exploitation, and financial benefit to the individuals who secure the forced conversion of the victim.\\" Post- revolution anti-women radical trend afflicting Copts The synchronization of such fatwas of Abu Islam's and similar scholars that categorize certain groups of women (basically Coptic women) as 'asking for it' just because they are not in the radical boat, or that they are opposers to the regime have been seen as unacceptable and degrading to Egyptian women in general, independent women (widows and divorced) in particular and more specifically to the Coptic women who were categorized as Crusaders, sharameet (prostitutes), lewd and willing to be raped. Salma Almasrya, an Egyptian Activist said that what the scholar has claimed comes in harmony with the official declaration from state men which blamed the female activists for the rape crimes they were subject to, then comes the un-deterred harassment on the part of the Ministry of Media for two media female interviewers in two different situations calling one (hot) on air while asking the other to (come and I will show you where!) when she asked about the freedom of expression, a phrase that was considered very offensive by the media causing many activists to believe there was a state-orchestrated terrorism against female activists by humiliation and intimidation rather than force which has been condemned by many media people around the country. ==See also== * Controversies related to Islam and Muslims * List of modern conflicts in the Middle East * Anti-Oriental Orthodox sentiment ==NotesReferencesBibliography== * * * - Print Online ==External links== * European Centre for Law and Justice (2011): The Persecution of Oriental Christians, what answer from Europe?

Kimmel is also the creator and producer of My Classic Car. The film tells the story of fictional band NOVEM's epic six-day recording session in May 1973 and chronicles the modern day discovery of their lost tapes and who they were. NOVEM has made its way around the film festival circuit and received great acclaim, winning many awards. Though the movie is a work of fiction, it has often been portrayed as a documentary. ==Fictional biography== The story NOVEM is an American rock band that was formed at Harrison State University during the early 1970s. At the time, very little was known about the band or their music. They all died shortly after their first recording session. It wasn't until nearly 31 years later that the tapes of their recording session were found and their story was told. Formation of the band In the spring of 1973, a group of nine college students formed a strong friendship on the campus of Harrison State University, sharing a common bond of music. Four of them were music majors, and the other five had various degrees of musical talent. Austin Rowles, thought to be the unofficial group leader, encouraged the group to \\"jam\\" together after classes. Within weeks, the group was performing in front of fellow college students at frat parties and beer picnics. Very quickly it became apparent the group had a special chemistry and a lot of talent, mainly composing original material. Recording session In April 1973, Mark Winstead came up with an idea for each member of the group to write a song about something they felt strongly about. His uncle owned a recording studio called Dark Horse in Franklin, Tennessee, and he offered the group a chance to record their songs free of charge after the spring semester was complete. The group jumped at the chance, and on May 14, 1973, they packed their gear into Tom Lewdowski's van and headed for Dark Horse Studios. Band name Apparently the group never actually named itself. The band became known as NOVEM when Dan Cook (the recording engineer) wrote 'NOVEM Songs' (NOVEM is Latin for nine) on the outside of the master music boxes. Deaths NOVEM at Dark Horse Studio (1973) L-R: Tom Lewdowski, Dennis Clark, Jaslyn Walker On May 19, 1973, after spending a week at Dark Horse Studios, NOVEM packed up and left the rural studio to head back to campus. Tragically they never made it. For some unknown reason, the van failed to stop at a stop sign and entered an intersection at a high speed where it was struck broadside by a large truck. The resulting impact sent the van careening into a wooded area where it flipped several times and burst into flames. Seven of the nine students died that night. Two survived the accident but died days later. Police suspected that the driver of the van fell asleep at the wheel. The group left with the master session tapes that night, but no evidence of them was found at the accident site. It appears that they stopped by Mark's parent's home in Brentwood, Tennessee shortly after they left Dark Horse. Our best guess is that Mark put the tapes on a shelf in his parent's basement thinking he'd be back later to finish mixing the music.

The master tapes and film cans were in a box, along with other old records, which was purchased by Jordan Shipman at a garage sale in Brentwood, Tennessee. ==Film== Limited theatrical release Landmark's Keystone Art Cinema & Indie Lounge Film festivals * Newport Beach Film Festival (2007) * Westchester Film Festival (2007) * Santa Fe Film Festival (2006) * Tallgrass Film Festival (2006) * Vermont International Film Festival (2006) * Kansas International Film Festival (2006) * Stony Brook Film Festival (2006) * Maryland Film Festival (2006) * Aarhus Festival of Independent Arts (2006) * Sonoma International Film Festival (2006) * Beloit International Film Festival (2006) * Asheville Film Festival (2005) * Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival (2005) * Bethel Film Festival (2005) * Phoenix Film Festival (2005) * Palm Beach International Film Festival (2005) * Waterfront Film Festival (2005) * Indianapolis International Film Festival (2005) * New World Arts (2005) Awards * Audience Choice Award (Phoenix Film Festival, 2005) * Best Soundtrack Award (Phoenix Film Festival, 2005) * Audience Choice Award (Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival, 2005) * Grand Jury PrizeBest Competition Feature (Bethel Film Festival, 2005) * Grand Jury PrizeBest Competition Feature (Indianapolis Film Festival, 2005) * Special Jury PrizeBest Cast Performance (Indianapolis Film Festival, 2005) * Best Indiana Film (Indianapolis Film Festival, 2005) * Audience Choice Award (Beloit International Film Festival, 2006) * Jury Prize for Best American Independent Feature (Sonoma Valley Film Festival, 2006) * Respect Award for Feature Film (Aarhus Festival of Independent Arts, 2006) ==Band members== * Dennis Clark (Drums, Lead Vocals) * Peter Shipley (Bass Guitar) * Mark Winstead (Lead Vocals, Guitar, Piano, Keyboards) * Tom Lewdowski (Guitar, Lead Vocals) * Alan Levinly (Guitar, Lead Vocals, Background Vocals) * Kris Doyle (Violin, Background Vocals) * Dana Taylor (Lead Vocals) * Austin Rowles (Guitar, Lead Vocals) * Jaslyn Walker (Guitar, Lead Vocals) ==References *Official website * Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:2006 films ","title":"NOVEM"},{"id":"19331324","text":"Alistair Ian Campbell (born 15 February 1959) is an English singer and songwriter who was the lead singer and a member of the English reggae band UB40. As part of UB40, Campbell sold over 70 million records worldwide and toured the globe for 30 years. In 2008, Campbell left UB40 due to a dispute with band management and embarked on a solo career. In 2012, Campbell was announced as one of the three judges on the judging panel of the TV show, New Zealand's Got Talent. In August 2014, Campbell announced that he had reunited with former UB40 band mates Astro and Mickey to record a new album, Silhouette, released on 6 October 2014. ==Early life== Alistair Ian Campbell was born in Birmingham, England. He is the brother of former bandmate Robin Campbell and current UB40 frontman Duncan Campbell, and is a son of the late Scottish folk singer Ian Campbell. ==Departure from UB40== In October 2007, Campbell released a solo album titled Running Free. It entered the UK charts at number 9 and went gold. This was the first top ten entry for Campbell for a new studio album since UB40s Labour of Love 3 album, which was released 10 years prior to Running Free. On 24 January 2008, it was reported that Campbell was to quit the group after almost 30 years. Campbell, who was a founding member of UB40, songwriter and lead vocalist, finally quit the band in 2008. Their last gigs together were in February 2008 in Australia, New Zealand and Uganda. Campbell then issued a statement on his website and through his solicitors stating that for many years he had been unhappy with the business practices and business managers of UB40 and launched an investigation into the financial handling of the business. This was the reason for his departure. A few months later, Michael Virtue the keyboard player also left UB40, citing the same reasons as Campbell, and joined Campbell's legal investigation. Virtue subsequently joined Campbell's new band, the Dep band. ==Solo career== In the UK, his solo albums Big Love and Running Free both reached the UK Top 10, while Flying High and Great British Songs reached the Top 20. Campbell scored a number 1 hit in 1994 as featured artist, along with brother Robin, on Pato Banton's cover of The Equals' \\"Baby Come Back\\". On 18 October 2010 Ali released his fourth solo album Great British Songs‚Äîa collection of British pop and rock hits from the 1960s and 1970s. The album reached 15 on the UK Albums Chart where it remained for three weeks. It also gave Campbell his third top 15 charting album in as many years. Critic David Jefferies of AllMusic said of the album, \\"Longtime fans will appreciate that Campbell‚Äôs voice is as strong as ever, but it deserves a better showcase than this mixed bag\\". Campbell's label Jacaranda Music was number one on the UK independent chart in October 2010 and Great British Songs also entered the iTunes reggae album chart at number one.

It has a twofold character. The southern section is the commercial core of the city, with many of its important public and private buildings, most intact from its peak days as a resort town in that era. North Broadway is a residential neighborhood with many large Victorian houses built by frequent visitors to the town and its spas and racetrack. In 1979 it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since then its boundaries have twice been increased to include some adjacent areas after new information became available about the buildings in them, one of which is a church by Richard Upjohn. Another contributing property, the post office, was later listed on the Register in its own right. ==Geography== The district follows a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of Broadway and North Broadway, from the vicinity of Congress Park to a small portion that overlaps into the Town of Greenfield just north of the city limits near Skidmore College, where the street becomes Glen Mitchell Road. It is divided into residential and commercial sections by the intersection with Van Dam Street roughly midway between its two termini. Some portions of neighboring blocks and streets are included. The south end is at the junction of Broadway (also US 9/NY 50) and Spring Street (NY 9P). Some of the properties on Spring to the east (where the district is bordered by the East Side Historic District and Washington Street (NY 29) as far as Woodlawn Avenue to the west are included. Both sides of Broadway ( wide at this point) are included to the junction with Church Street (NY 9N's southern terminus on the west, and NY 29 on the east), at the post office and city hall, along with properties half a block deep in either direction. At Grove Street the eastern boundary returns to the side of Broadway in order to exclude some more modern buildings on that side. Two blocks to the north, at Van Dam, routes 9 and 50 split off from Broadway to the northeast and become a divided highway. Here the boundary again takes in buildings around High Rock Spring on the east as it becomes Broadway Avenue for a block, then Rock Street and Greenfield Avenue. The west boundary follows Wiswall Lane to include houses on the east side of Woodlawn (Some of the areas on the other side are in the West Side Historic District). The east boundary gradually follows rear property lines until First Street, where it runs down the middle of Bryant Street, including the houses on its west side except for some near the Fourth Street junction at the city line. The houses opposite Skidmore's main entrance are included; at the city line the west boundary begins. Within this area delineated are and over 160 buildings. In the northern half these are residential; to the south they are predominantly commercial with a few churches near the south end. ==History== High Rock Spring was known to the native peoples of the area and had long been visited by them for its supposed curative powers. In 1643 Father Isaac Jogues became the first European visitor to see it. Mohawks reportedly carried Sir William Johnson there on a stretcher in 1767, and his recovery went so well that he visited it again later several times. It was well known enough that George Washington tried to buy it in 1783. Gideon Putnam, considered the founder of Saratoga Springs, bought the land around Congress Spring to the south in 1802. He built the first hotel there and eight years later laid out a plan for the city's development. Broadway was always intended to be the main commercial street, and others built hotels on land sold to them by Putnam and his descendants. The coming of the railroad in the 1830s accentuated this, as it paralleled Broadway just to the west. The tracks crossed Broadway at the Van Dam junction, following the route now used by routes 9 and 50. This created the break between commercial Broadway and residential North Broadway in the later years of the 19th century. Like the builders of the houses along Union Avenue, the North Broadway homeowners were primarily wealthy summer residents. But Union Avenue's visitors came from all over the country for the horse races, whereas those on North Broadway were from further south in the Capital District and primarily came to Saratoga Springs to take advantage of the baths and get away for the summer. Today that area is home to a number of notable owners and trainers in thoroughbred racing. The district's historic character is preserved by the city's Design Review Commission, a seven-member body appointed by the mayor to staggered three-year terms. It reviews any proposed signage and exterior changes to any building in any of the city's historic districts. ==Significant contributing properties== *Adelphi Hotel, 361‚Äì65 Broadway. Built in 1877, this is the last surviving hotel from the 19th century. The porch, which features slender columns and open spandrels became known as the \\"Saratoga porch\\" because it was typical of the time and place. *Adirondack Trust Company Building, 473 Broadway.

The first known mineral water spring in the area flows in a polygonal stone springhouse below a steep ledge. *President's House, 670 North Broadway. The home of Skidmore's president is a -story Colonial Revival frame house with projecting columned portico built between 1895‚Äì1900. *Reverey Gardens, 595 North Broadway.

De Negri was born at Calasetta, in Sardinia. Later he lived in the Rome's neighbourhood of Magliana. At the age of 27, he killed former boxer, quarter tough guy, and fellow cocaine addict Giancarlo Ricci. The so-called Canaro's killing (Italian Delitto del Canaro) is notable for being one of the most gruesome crimes carried out in Italy since the end of World War II, particularly because the victim watched powerless during the excessive mutilation.\\"Er canaro: \\"Lasciatemi stare Il conto con la giustizia l'ho pagato\\" La Repubblica, 27 October 2005 (in Italian)Daniele Mastrogiacomo, \\"E alla fine si √® deciso a morire\\", La Repubblica, 23 February 1988 (in Italian) The autopsy, however, later revealed that most of the tortures described by De Negri had, in fact, only been imagined by the man, who probably confused thought and reality as a result of his excessive consumption of cocaine. The boxer has actually been killed with a hammer, in no more than 40 minutes (as opposed to the 7 hours of tortures claimed by De Negri); no shampoo was used, nor has his cranium been opened. On the other hand, some fingers have been amputated post mortem. ==Alleged Giancarlo Ricci's homicide== On February 18, 1988, Ricci entered into Pietro De Negri's shop as usual, beating and slapping him as he had on previous occasions. De Negri had been a victim of Ricci's physical abuse before, but had conceived a plan to kill him. He told Ricci that a cocaine pusher was coming into the shop, and that if Ricci would hide himself into a dog cage, they could steal the pusher's cocaine and money. As soon as Ricci entered into the cage, De Negri locked him inside. He tortured Ricci for seven hours, left him tied with a chain, went to his daughter's school to take her home, and later returned to his shop. Ricci was tortured to death, with some of his fingers having been removed and put inside bodily orifices. Pieces of his face were cut, his tongue was removed, and his penis was put into his mouth, which caused him to die of asphyxiation, according to the post-mortem. De Negri also pierced one of Ricci's eyes with the cut fingers, smashed his teeth and head with a pipe wrench, and \\"washed\\" his brain with dog shampoo.La Repubblica, 23 February 1988 The morning after, Ricci's body was found in a landfill, still smoking, as De Negri had thrown fuel onto the body and tried to burn it. A man that had driven Ricci to the shop the day of the murder admitted what he had done, and De Negri confessed his murder. After conviction, he served 16 years out of his 24-year prison term. == In popular culture == The life and the incident of the murder has been adapted into a film by Matteo Garrone, Dogman. ==NotesReferences== *Archives *Il Giornale Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of South Sardinia Category:Italian people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Italy ","title":"Er Canaro"},{"id":"19331455","text":"The Canton of Bellencombre is a former canton situated in the Seine-Maritime d√©partement and in the Haute-Normandie region of northern France.

Crossley, The Times, 13 October 1911, p.9 He was educated at the Royal School Dungannon and in Bonn. He was first employed at the machine works of W G Armstrong, Elswick, before joining his brother, Francis to found the Crossley Brothers engineering firm in Manchester in 1867. In 1876 the company began the production of gas engines, and the firm went on to be major employers. In 1876 he married Mabel Gordon Anderson. In 1903 he was given the freedom of the City of Manchester. In 1906 he was asked to stand as Liberal candidate for the parliamentary constituency of Altrincham, and defeated the sitting Conservative MP, Coningsby Disraeli. He was created a baronet in 1909. He lost his parliamentary seat at the December 1910 election by 119 votes. Crossley was involved in philanthropic works. He was Chairman of the Manchester Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Throat and Chest and built a sanitorium at Delamere Forest for patients from Lancashire towns at his own expense.

It is an audava rƒÅgam (or owdava rƒÅgam, meaning pentatonic scale ). It is a janya rƒÅgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven swaras (musical notes). The equivalent of Udayaravichandrika in Hindustani music is Dhani.Ragas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH PublicationsRaganidhi by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras == Structure and Lakshana == Udayaravichandrika scale with shadjam at C Udayaravichandrika is a symmetric rƒÅgam that does not contain rishabham or dhaivatam. It is a pentatonic scale (audava-audava rƒÅgam in Carnatic music classification - audava meaning 'of 5') and is equivalent to the Minor Pentatonic Scale in Western Music. Its ' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms): The notes used in this scale sadharana gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam and kaisiki nishadham. Udayaravichandrika is considered a janya rƒÅgam of Kharaharapriya, the 22nd melakarta rƒÅgam, though it can be derived from other melakarta rƒÅgams, Hanumatodi, Natabhairavi or Natakapriya, by dropping both rishabham and dhaivatam. Udayaravichandrika and Suddha Dhanyasi are closely related, so much that many performers treat the two as interchangeable. Some contemporary practitioners consider Shuddha Dhanyasi as more inflected (i.e., using more gamakas), and Udayaravichandrika to be more in the Hindustani tradition with almost bare (i.e., uninflected) notes. Puritans, however, refer to the fact that Udayaravichandrika is an ancient raga in the Venkatamakhin tradition and was reputed to be created by Muthuswamy Dikshitar himself. However, at that time, it had kakali nishadam rather than the kaisiki nishadam of Suddha Dhanyasi. However, the Kaisaki nishadam is used in this topic making more towards Sudha Dhanyasi. The Udaya Ravichandrika, in its pure form should have the following arohana and avarohana: arohanam = avarohanam = In recent years this distinction seems to have blurred, and both ragas are considered roughly equivalent. == Popular compositions == Here are some popular kritis composed in Suddha Dhanyasi raga. *Enta nerchina by Thyagaraja *subrahma·πáyena rak·π£ito'ha·πÉ and ≈õrƒ´ pƒÅrthasƒÅrathinƒÅ by Muthuswami Dikshitar *Himagiri tanaye by Muthiah Bhagavatar *Bhavamu lona by Annamacharya *Narayana Ninna Namada by Purandara Dasa *≈õrƒ´ hari-vallabhƒì by Mysore Vasudevachar *≈õarva·πÉ samƒÅ≈õraye'ha·πÉ by Tulasivanam (pen-name of Ramachandran Nair from Kerala, India) *khƒìlati pi·πá·∏çƒÅ·πá·∏çƒì bhagavƒÅn by Sadasiva Brahmendra *kƒÅlƒÅtƒ´tƒÅya kha·π≠vƒÅ·πÖginƒì namastƒì by Muthiah Bhagavatar *bhƒìru·πá·∏çƒÅmbƒì bƒì·∏çuvƒì by Muthiah Bhagavatar *ƒÅyar pƒÅ·∏çi ka·πá·πáƒÅ by Padma Viraraghavan *pƒÅlaya mƒÅ·πÉ siddhi vinƒÅyaka by Mysore Sadashiva Rao == Film Songs ==  Language:Tamil  {  !D2691E\\" Song !D2691E\\" Movie !D2691E\\" Composer !D2691E\\" Singer - Anandamaana Naadham Shyamala rowspan=2G.

In this Filmation-produced movie, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and other Looney Tunes characters interact with the characters from the Filmation series Groovie Goolies. This movie is notable for being the one and only time that Warner Bros. \\"loaned out\\" their famous Looney Tunes characters to appear in a Filmation production (otherwise they were a silent partner). Warner Bros. had shut down their animation studio in 1969. While Warner Bros. had outsourced production to other companies since the 1960s, it was usually to studios run by former Warner Bros. alumni (such as Friz Freleng and later Chuck Jones), something that was not the case with Filmation. ==Synopsis== Daffy Duck is in Hollywood producing a movie about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, starring himself; also appearing in the film are Porky Pig, Petunia Pig, Sylvester, Tweety, Wile E. Coyote, Foghorn Leghorn, Pep√© Le Pew, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Charlie Dog. At Horrible Hall, the Groovie Goolies are watching a television interview in which Daffy is talking about his new movie, when their program is interrupted by a ghoulish being calling himself The Phantom of the Flickers; he announces his intention to destroy every film that Daffy Duck and the company ever made, including their current King Arthur film. Being a huge fan of Daffy, Frankie goes to Hollywood to offer his help, and the other Horrible Hall residents go along with him. Mayhem ensues when the Looney Tunes and the Goolies first meet, but they eventually settle down and continue filming the movie. But when the Phantom disguises himself as each of the Goolies, Daffy and the others then think that they are in league with the Phantom and run off. The Phantom suddenly grabs the film and, disguised as Hauntleroy, tries to escape from the Goolies by running through a magic mirror into \\"Mad Mirror Land\\" (i.e., the real world). Frankie, Drac, and Wolfie chase after him, and after a cartoonishly slapstick pursuit they bring (or more rather sneeze) the Phantom and the film back to their world. The Phantom turns out to be Drac‚Äôs long-lost uncle Claude Chaney, a formerly famous silent film actor. Chaney's pale complexion left him out of work when color films became popular. Daffy, impressed with Chaney's disguise skills, gives Claude a job. King Arthur wins an Ozzie Award, and the Goolies head for home. ==Notes== * The Phantom of the Flickers is an obvious parody of The Phantom of the Opera, a novel which has been made into movies and plays; Lon Chaney, Sr. played the title role in the 1925 film, and Claude Rains starred in the 1943 version. The name \\"Claude Chaney\\" is derived from these two actors‚Äô names. * The live- action segment uses stop motion, pixilation and undercranking to enable the actors to move like cartoon characters; e.g., when the Goolies drive imaginary cars down the road and Drac appears to fly. Chuck Menville and Len Janson, writers on the special, had previously used the technique for three short films of their own: Stop Look and Listen; Blaze Glory; and Sergeant Swell of the Mounties. * Bugs Bunny was not present in the special, a notable absence considering he is the mascot of the Looney Tunes franchise and the usual foil of both Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam (as well as, secondarily, Wile E. Coyote). Bugs had not been seen since the closure of the Warner Bros. studio in 1964; he did not appear in any of the WB-branded shorts produced by other companies up to this point. * Wile E. Coyote appears without his usual foil the Road Runner. He is mostly silent (expressing dialogue through holding signs as he did in the Road Runner shorts) but occasionally laughs with his refined English voice from the Bugs shorts. * This special marks Petunia Pig's first \\"official\\" color appearance (since she never appeared in any color cartoons in the \\"classic\\" era), and her first appearance on-screen since the 1930s. Petunia's voice in the special is an impersonation of Hedda Hopper, Louella Parsons or Rona Barrett. * Despite that Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Tweety, Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn, Wile E. Coyote and Pep√© Le Pew are voiced by Mel Blanc in the special, they sound a little different from the classic shorts; Daffy's voice is pitched higher and sped up faster than normal (to the point that he sounded a lot like his early \\"screwball\\" incarnation by Tex Avery and Bob Clampett or Woody Woodpecker), Porky's voice isn't sped up, Elmer, Sylvester, Foghorn, Wile E. and Pep√©'s voices sound deeper than normal, and Tweety's voice is sped up faster than normal. This is due to Filmation incorrectly editing Blanc's voice recordings for Daffy and Tweety and forgetting to speed up Blanc's voice recordings for Porky, and Blanc not being thrilled about working on the special and not doing Elmer's voice to his satisfaction (Elmer's normal voice actor, Arthur Q. Bryan, died many years before; Elmer has one line of dialogue in the whole special). Yosemite Sam is the only character who doesn't sound different from the classic shorts. ==Cast== Voice actors * Mel Blanc . . . Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer J.

Distributor Select Video released the film in a number of European countries. The German version of the movie was released in 1983 as Groovie Goolies: Muntere Monster in Hollywood (\\"Groovie Goolies: Groovie Goolies in Hollywood\\"), and re-released in 1986 as Duffy Duck und Co. (\\"Daffy Duck and Co.\\"), and again in 1990 as Die Lustige Monster Show: Duffy Duck und Co. in Hollywood (\\"Groovie Goolies: Daffy Duck and Co. in Hollywood\\"). The original laugh track from the movie was removed for these releases. In January 1985, the movie was released by Select Video in the UK as Groovie Ghouls, and was on sale at Woolworth's. In those instances, the live-action sequence was not present, and it was replaced by an out-of-shot collision before rejoining the original animated sequence. The sequence in these releases was cut for time, as the German versions contained trailers for other Select Video titles. Another notable feature of the German and UK releases was that the Select Video ident was shorter, and had no jingle. In addition, the end credits were different, as they had to edit out the names of the actors in the live-action sequence which was not included, and also had other credits, presumably for Europe-based post-production at Select Video. Despite the aforementioned rights issues, the film remains part of the Groovie Goolies syndication package (split into two half-hours), as of the mid 2000s, and has been rebroadcast several times on television. Sky One broadcast the movie on July 4, 1992. USA Network broadcast the movie as a Halloween special in the mid to late 90s shortly before it stopped broadcasting cartoons altogether. In 1997, Cartoon Network broadcast the movie on Mr. Spim's Cartoon Theatre. A two-part version of the movie was broadcast on German television as Monsterparty auf Schlo√ü Blutenburg: Daffy Duck und das Phantom Der Seifenoper (\\"Groovie Goolies: Daffy Duck and the Phantom of the Flickers\\") in 2002, 2007 and 2013. ==References* * Jim's Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies page * Cartoon Research FAQ-2 Category:1972 television films Category:American television films Category:The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie Category:Animated crossover films Category:Looney Tunes films Category:American films Category:Warner Bros. animated films Category:Filmation animated films Category:1970s American animated films Category:1972 animated films Category:1972 films ","title":"Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies"},{"id":"19331686","text":"Romy Pastrana (born October 5, 1958 in Victorias, Negros Occidental, Philippines), commonly known by his stage name Dagul, is a Filipino dwarf actor, comedian and politician. ==Acting career== Dagul was scouted by singer- host Randy Santiago in 1998. Santiago would later dubbed him as \\"Dagul\\" which is a colloquial term in Pampanga meaning tall or big which contrasts his short height. From doing smaller roles in movies such as Isprikitik, Walastik Kung Pumitik (1999) and Juan & Ted: Wanted (2000), Dagul gained even more exposure when he became Long Mejia's sparring partner in GMA's defunct comedy sitcom Kool Ka Lang (2001). Viewers already appreciated the \\"Long and Dagul\\" tandem when the former decided to transfer to ABS-CBN. Dagul followed. Long Mejia became a regular co-host of Willie Revillame's Masayang Tanghali Bayan, while Dagul did some guest appearances. Soon the tandem split up. Long was included in the cast of Home Alone da River (2002) and Home Along Da Airport (2003) and became preoccupied with doing movies. Dagul, on the other hand, became more visible on TV. He was a mainstay of the defunct sitcom Ok Fine Whatever (2003) and, up to now, a regular defunct in Goin' Bulilit. Dagul is the only adult in the hit children's Sunday gag show defunct, Goin' Bulilit since its inception. Director, Edgar Mortiz was responsible for giving Dagul regular employment by casting him in the show. Unlike the other child cast from the show, Dagul will never \\"graduate\\" or leave the show. ==Filmography== Television *Goin' Bulilit (2005‚Äì2019) *Yes Yes Show (2004‚Äì2005) *Maalaala Mo Kaya Stuffed Toy (2003) *Ok Fine Whatever (2003) *Kool Ka Lang (1998‚Äì2002) *Masayang Tanghali Bayan (2003-2004) Film *Corazon: Ang Unang Aswang (2012) *Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo (2007) *Mr. Suave (2003) *Cass & Cary: Who Wants to Be a Billionaire?

He campaigned himself as \\"The Little Man With a Big Heart\\" and promised to put up daycare centers and deploy additional medical personnel in poor areas if he was elected to the position. ==Personal life== Dagul became a member of the Iglesia ni Cristo along with his family in May 2017. As of February 2013, Dagul is married and has five children, three of which are sons, and a daughter.

It is on the Leeds to Bradford Line between Leeds City and Shipley and was opened in 19 June 2016, near the site of an earlier station with the same name. ==History== The original station opened on 1 July 1860 and closed on 31 July 1905. During 1905, the line between Leeds and was quadrupled, which involved slewing the line and building new bridges in several places. It was not considered worthwhile rebuilding it when the line was diverted onto a new bridge over the canal. A new station could provide opportunities for travel when space became available with the Kirkstall Forge Engineering closing in stages during the 1980s, 1990s and the early 2000s. The new station, near the site of the original, opened on 19 June 2016. Metro, the Passenger Transport Executive for West Yorkshire, opened the station having already overseen the opening of nearby Apperley Bridge in December 2015. Go-ahead for construction at Kirkstall Forge and Apperley Bridge was given in the National Infrastructure Plan released on 29 November 2011.National Infrastructure Plan 2011 HM Treasury ==Facilities== The station's footbridge The new footpath providing access from the West. The station has two platforms, with a footbridge and lifts linking them.Kirkstall Forge station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 29 November 2016 A bus stop, 127 car parking spaces and secure cycle storage were also constructed along with the station. Ticket vending machines are available and there are digital information screens and a P.A system provided for train running information provision. ==Services== Though it is sited on the Airedale and Wharfedale lines, the station was to be served by trains between and providing two trains per hour in each direction. The May 2016 timetable, published by Network Rail and Metro, shows the station as being served by one train per hour between Leeds and , with a limited number of additional calls (peak hour & late night) provided by Airedale Line services to/from Skipton & Bradford.GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Tables 36, 37 & 38 On Sundays Leeds to Bradford Forster Square trains call once per hour each way. In November 2017 the frequency of services was raised in the House of Commons by the local Member of Parliament and plans were subsequently announced to double the frequency between Kirkstall Forge and Leeds to 2 trains per hour from 20 May 2018 (though services were cut back again for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Services to/from Ilkley no longer now stop at Kirkstall as a result of this change, with regular timetabled calls now provided by the Leeds - Bradford Forster Square trains (Ilkley connections are now available at Shipley). Certain Skipton services also stop in the weekday peak and after 19:30 Mondays to Saturdays when the Bradford - Leeds service does not operate. Sunday services remain unchanged. ==Planning and construction== The derelict site of Kirkstall Forge seen in December 2014. In 1999, Metro announced that Kirkstall Forge and Apperley Bridge were among five new or reopened stations which they wished to see achieved over the ensuing five years. Glasshoughton opened in 2005. In July 2007, Leeds City Council approved a planning application to redevelop the Kirkstall Forge site, and the developer, Commercial Estates Group, committed ¬£4 million to build a railway station and provide new rolling stock. In September 2008, the West Yorkshire PTE announced that the Yorkshire & Humber Regional Transport Board had approved funding for its \\"rail growth programme\\" which included stations at Apperley Bridge and Kirkstall Forge. A public exhibition of the plans took place in June 2009 with the planning application submitted to Leeds City Council in March 2010 and approval being granted in June 2010. Despite significant private sector funding, the larger Rail Growth Programme including Apperley Bridge was listed as a schemes under government review in June 2010. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review in Autumn 2010 the Leeds Rail Growth Package was included in the \\"Development\\" pool of schemes. Metro submitted a \\"Best & Final Funding Bid\\" in September 2011 and funding was confirmed November 2011 as part of the National Infrastructure Plan. On 29 May 2014 the Department for Transport committed ¬£9.5 million from a total of ¬£16 million towards the Leeds Rail Growth scheme which included both Kirkstall Forge and Apperley Bridge stations. Works began in November 2014 by designers Amey Plc and the principal contractor C Spencers Ltd on behalf of Network Rail with completion of both stations expected by winter 2015. Partly due to flooding, work for the wider non-rail Kirkstall site ran behind schedule and its opening was delayed until June 2016. It eventually opened on 19 June. ==References Category:Railway stations in Leeds Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 2016 Category:Railway stations opened by Network Rail Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:Kirkstall ","title":"Kirkstall Forge railway station"},{"id":"19331736","text":"The DB Class 82 was a goods train tank locomotive with the Deutsche Bundesbahn in Germany, that was built in the period after the Second World War and was intended for shunting and normal rail services. They were to replace the ten- coupled state railway (L√§nderbahn) engines and also the accident-prone Class 87 DRG Einheitslok (standard locomotive). It was the first of the DB's so- called Neubaudampflokomotiven or newly designed steam locomotives, and was built by the firms of Krupp and Henschel in 1950 and 1951 and also by the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in 1955. Although they were ten-couplers, the 41 engines were also suitable for lines with tight curves such as the Hamburg Harbour railway. To improve curve running the first and last axles were fitted with Beugniot levers. The last two examples were also equipped with Riggenbach counterpressure brakes, which enabled their operation on steep lines. The locomotives were able to haul 800 tonne trains at up to 70 km/h. == Deployment == The engines were predominantly employed in the marshalling yards at Bremen and Hamm as well as on the harbour lines of Emden and Hamburg. The 82s could also be seen on normal railway duties on the steep inclines of the Westerwald and in the Black Forest on the Murg Valley Railway.

Although it has become a less common award as some Scout Associations no longer offer a Rover program, it is still awarded in several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, and in Traditional Scouting organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States. Youth Girl Guides in Australia also have two awards named after Baden-Powell, the Junior BP Award and BP Award, although neither is the highest award possible. The Baden Powell Challenge Award was the ultimate award for Guides in the United Kingdom until it was retired in the spring of 2019. ==Australia== Scouting Prior to 2014, members of Rovers (Australia) were able to earn the Baden-Powell Scout Award through either of two methods, after completing their Rover Skills Badge, outlined below;Rovers Australia1st Epping Rover Crew - About Rovers Method A Method A is the more popular version of the Baden-Powell Scout Award, also known as the \\"Traditional\\" Method, as it is more clearly defined with targets for its badges. {  - ! Scoutcraft ! Service ! Ramblers ! Project - Organise & take part in at least 10 separate camps. Must be more than 10 nights camping, at more than three locations, showing a high standard of campcraft and keeping a log to show to the crew. At least six months service to a community service organisation Organise & lead a trip over at least four days (three nights), presenting a log to the crew of the trip. Over six months, develop a skill, reporting to the Crew as you go. This skill should not be one that is involved in the Rover's work. } Method B Method B includes the Spiritual Development, Intellectual & Emotional Development, Social Development and Physical Development Badges. {  - ! Spiritual Development Badge ! Intellectual and Emotional Development Badge ! Social Development Badge ! Physical Development Badge - This area provides an opportunity for the Rover to find out a great deal about themselves through various avenues including their own lifestyle and personal values system. Through this badge the Rover can explore a vast array of areas that may be unfamiliar to them, ultimately choosing one for further study for this badge. Areas include learning to play a musical instrument; getting involved in or learning about art drama, media or politics; or learning a foreign language.At least six months service to a community service organisation. Again the Rover can explore a vast array of areas that may be unfamiliar but of interest to them, ultimately choosing one for personal development in order to gain this badge. Here the Rover is challenged and must demonstrate initiative, and skills in expeditions and outdoor adventure. Some may undertake to organise, plan (including adequate preparation and training), and complete a one-week activity. } New Baden- Powell Scout Awardhttp://www.vicrovers.com.au/awards/baden-powell At the start of 2014, a new version of the Baden-Powell Scout Award was introduced. All Rovers who had already started the old version of the award (Method A or Method B) were given the choice to either continue with the old award or transfer their completed badges to the new award scheme. The new Baden-Powell Scout Award is broken up into two levels: the St. George Award and the Baden- Powell Scout Award. The St. George Award is made up of four badges: Squire Training, Rover Skills, Service and Physical. A Rover must complete the Squire Training badge before they can start any other badge, but most Rover Crews will have their new Rovers (Squires) complete this badge before they are fully invested into the Rover Crew. {  - ! Squire Training ! Rover Skills ! Service ! Physical - This badge includes Scoutcraft skills, service, camping, learning about the award scheme, Intro to Rovers, the Promise & Law, meetings and a small project for the Crew or its assets. This badge includes holding a position of responsibility, going camping, and running activities for other Rovers. This badge involves providing six or more months of regular, active service to a worthy cause. This badge involves either participating in a physical or sporting activity for six months, or completing a physical journey over four days, or two weekends of over 48 hours' effort each. } The Baden-Powell Scout Award involves the completion of four components: the St. George Award, the Community Development badge, the Personal Growth badge and the Self-Reflection Interview. {  - ! St. George Award ! Community Development Badge ! Personal Growth Badge ! Self-Reflection Interview - The four badges outlined above must be completed, and Rovers must have been Knighted/Fully Invested before they can be awarded the St George Award. This badge aims to contribute to the development of your local, national, or international community. This badge aims to encourage Rovers to explore their personal beliefs, challenge their thinking, or develop their own skills. The self-reflection interview is there to help you think about your journey through the award scheme and reflect on what you have learnt along the way. The interview is facilitated by a member of the BPSA Support Team and will not consider if you have technically completed the required badgework. } Guiding In Girl Guides, participants have the option of completing two different versions of the award, the Junior BP and the BP. Both awards involve the completion of activities (chosen by the guide) in the following categories: Promise and Law, Outdoors, Patrol System, Service, World Guiding and Guiding traditions. In the Junior BP, Guides must complete a total of 12 activities, in the BP they must complete 18. In both awards, the Guide receives an Endeavor badge when they are halfway through. The Junior BP is not a prerequisite for earning the BP. The Junior BP and BP both serve as preparation for the Queen's Guide Award, which is the highest award a Guide can achieve, but it is not essential to complete either to earn Queen's Guide. ==Canada== Baden-Powell Service Association Canada's Baden-Powell Service Association does not have a centralized BPSA Body. Traditional Scouting programs are run by independent Provincial Associations in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick, each of which uses the B-P Award as its highest Rover award. ==Hong Kong== Scout Association of Hong Kong Baden Powell Award continues the training progress of the Rover Scout Award. Self planning and managing are prerequisite to achieve this highest award. During the course from planning to operation, Rovers could equip themselves with a positive value of living, learning Scout knowledge, technique and attitude. The topics of Baden Powell Award are same as the Rover Scout Award in which Service, Scoutcraft and Exploration are compulsory, whilst Scout Knowledge, Self-development, Interpersonal Skills, Personal Pursuit and Look Wide are optional. Rovers are required to take 3 amongst the 5 options for assessment. The assessment of the Baden Powell Award is arranged by the RHQC (RS). Certificate and award will be issued when confirmed and approved by AHQ after the recommendation of Regional Commissioner and District Commissioner. ==New Zealand== The Baden Powell Award is a peer recognition Award, not a badge that can be earned on the completion of a set of criteria. The Rover Crew, in consultation with the Regional Rover Leader, awards the Baden Powell Award for a member which: * Is a continuously active and useful Crew member, having organised and co-ordinated projects and activities which ideally emphasise the aims of the Rover Section, of service to Scouting, the community and personal development. * Sets a personal example of the Scout way of life, and living by the Scout Law and Promise. * Has given outstanding and extensive service as a member of a Rover Crew. * Has held a position of responsibility outside the Rover Crew on Scouting or another community organisation for a period of at least two years. * Has been a member of a Rover Crew for a minimum period of three years. ==South Africa== Scouts South Africa South African Rover Scouts are required to complete four of the seven available Rover proficiency awards in order to qualify for the B-P Award. The B-P Award is awarded after it has been recommended by the District Commissioner, the Rover Scout Leader and the Crew Council who must agree that the Rover has been setting an example of living a lifestyle reflecting the Rover motto of \\"Service\\". ==United Kingdom== The Scout Association The Scout Association no longer operate a Rover Scout section, having abolished the section in 1964, and they no longer offer the Baden- Powell Award. Baden-Powell Scouts Association The Baden-Powell Award is available to invested Rovers of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association. The BPSA requirements for the award are similar to the \\"Traditional\\" option used by Rovers Australia. The Rover must hold the Scoutcraft Star, Service Training Star, Rover Rambler's Badge and Rover Project Badge. They are also required to show that they have been setting a personal example of the \\"Scout Way of Life\\" and to complete an interview with the Chief Commissioner of the Baden-Powell Scouts‚Äô Association.BPSA Rover Crew Training Scheme Girlguiding The Baden-Powell Challenge Award was the highest a Guide could attain, until the award was retired in 2019. ==United States== Baden-Powell Service Association The Baden Powell Award is the highest award a Rover Knight can achieve in the Baden Powell Service Association. It has similar requirements as the Baden-Powell Scouts Association and Rovers Australia; Rover Scouts must earn their Rambler's Badge, Scoutcraft Star, Project Badge and Service Training Star. They must also receive a recommendation from their Rover Crew, Rover Crew Leader, and Group Scoutmaster, and complete an interview with the Association's Chief Commissioner. ==See also== *Scouts Australia *Scouts South Africa *Baden-Powell Scouts' Association *Rover Scouts *Scouts New Zealand *Girlguiding UK ==References *Rovers Australia - National Rover Council *www.nswrovers.com - Rovers in New South Wales *Victorian Rovers - events,properties,training,service,resources,crews *Rover Scouts Association - international Rovering fellowship *SA Rovers *SCOUTS New Zealand Category:Baden-Powell Scouts' Association Category:The Scout Association Category:Scouting and Guiding in Australia Category:Scout and Guide awards Category:Girlguiding UK ","title":"Baden-Powell Award"},{"id":"19331865","text":"William Walker McCune (December 17, 1953 ‚Äì May 2, 2011) was an American computer scientist and logician working in the fields of automated reasoning, algebra, logic, and formal methods.

For the first twelve years of its twenty-two years, it was known under its original name Circuit Noize. Noize has been quoted and referenced in mainstream publications such as Out,Out The New York Times,The New York Times Genre, and the Chicago Tribune. Original Circuit Noize articles have been used by various local AIDS and gay health organizations for education, safe sex, and harm reduction. In 1998, the documentary film Got 2b There by Jos√© TorrealbaImDb featured Circuit Noize as an authority within the circuit community. ==History== Started in late 1993 by Steve Kammon from Florida, the first issue was nothing more than a foldout flyer listing upcoming gay-themed benefit events occurring on what was becoming known as \\"the circuit\\". Kammon was witty and passionate about the parties he loved, and the general sense of community that they inspired in him. For the second issue, he partnered with friends Stephen Ceplenski and Gary SteinbergTravel The New York Times.‚Äîan L.A. couple also deeply involved in the circuit scene‚Äîwho agreed to publish Circuit Noize as a magazine instead of a flyer, selling ads to the promoters of the parties listed in the calendar. The magazine has run quarterly ever since. As Circuit Noize became a fixture in the circuit scene, Kammon listed the events and helped create the very idea of a \\"circuit\\" of gay benefit parties. He also gave a platform to friends in the circuit community to express themselves, exploring the issues facing the mostly gay audience that attended these events regularly. Kammon himself wrote regularly about things such as circuit spirituality and the complexities of drug use in the scene. In addition, Kammon ran regular features profiling the DJs, promoters, and personalities that made the circuit come alive. In 1998, Kammon turned to a friend from New York, Jeffery Taylor, who took up the duty of editing the submissions for clarity and grammar, as well as producing profile content. ==Themes== The roots of the circuit lie in the all-night bacchanals pioneered by people such as Larry Levan and places such as the Saint at Large. Urban gay men suddenly had the opportunity to mingle and party freely amongst themselves with a brash openness that had been unheard of until then, and the explosion of the Stonewall movement ushered in an era of cultural and sexual expression that was both liberating to gay men and somewhat shocking to the average heterosexual. The harsh reality check of the AIDS crisis in the '80s forced these revelers to fight a long, lonely battle to raise money and awareness for a disease that many ignorant people felt they deserved. Benefit beach parties sprang up in the gay summer hideaway of Fire Island, and soon the concept took off and became a staple for raising the much-needed funds to get the ball rolling for local AIDS treatment and prevention organizations such as Gay Men's Health Crisis. Once the circuit became a definable concept, the list of parties vying to be included grew longer and longer. Some notable events include White Party in Miami, Black Party in New York, Cherry in D.C, and Southern Decadence in New Orleans. Circuit Noize listed them all, and covered the events and the lifestyle surrounding them. Kammon was well aware of the complex psychological and personal issues that the circuit audience left at the door when they came out to play, and addressed topics such as safer sex, harm reduction in relation to drug use, and overall spirituality and wellness. Despite the minor controversies that sprang up around the circuit as it became a global playground for a mostly white, wealthy demographic, Kammon never stopped believing in the importance of the community that it provided to the circuit crowd. Even those who never attended the parties soon got the idea that there was a worldwide network of people celebrating gay culture and raising money to help those in need, and some would argue that the circuit helped cement the idea of a global gay community into the minds of the general public. ==Evolution and redesign== On September 13, 2006, Steve Kammon died, leaving the ownership and maintenance of Circuit Noize in the hands of Ceplenski, Steinberg, and Taylor. Taylor enlisted his friend and a Circuit Noize columnist, Michael Taylor (no relation), to help him helm the editorial side, and at the end of 2006 the four met in L.A. to brainstorm how to best carry on Kammon's legacy. The decision was made to do a re-launch as noiZe, encompassing everything that Kammon held dear as well as updating the design elements and broadening the content to include things not directly circuit- related but relevant to their gay audience. Introducing the tagline \\"Celebrate. Explore. Live.\\", noiZe promised to cover the circuit as well as the events, people, and issues that had grown beyond the circuit. The move was misunderstood by some to be a repudiation of the circuit, and was greeted with mixed reactions, sparking a piece in Out magazine by Steve Weinstein, a well- respected New York editor and journalist. The piece, titled \\"Save the Last Dance\\", questioned whether the name change reflected a larger decline within the circuit world, and noted that different types of events, such as festivals and all-gay cruises, were on the rise. These changes, far from proving that the circuit was dead, were actually a reflection of how successful the circuit concept had become over the years. There was a dedicated audience for these types of events, and more importantly, the circuit audience was willing and able to travel extensively to participate. Hoping to grab some of these gay travel dollars, outfits like Atlantis started producing gay vacation packages in Mexico as well as a successful series of gay cruises in places such as the Caribbean, Spain, and Asia. The concept of the circuit party itself was also expanding into the idea of longer festivals‚ÄîBlack & Blue in Canada, Sydney Mardi Gras in Australia, as well as Europride and Loveball in Europe. Gay pride festivals all over the world also took on some circuit aspects, throwing huge closing parties with top circuit DJs and performers. Working now as noiZe allowed more free rein in covering all of these events. The first issue of noiZe, and the 51st issue overall, laid out the noiZe mission in a piece called \\"Flipping the Circuit Breaker\\", which asked: NoiZe then made the unlikely move of recruiting Steve Weinstein to be their editor-in-chief, asking him to help get out the message that noiZe would still cover the circuit as well as emerging forms of gay entertainment and fundraising. With a veteran editor at the helm, noiZe looks to continue expanding its message and continue its influence within the gay community with regards to hard reduction, safe sex, and the responsibilities of partying with integrity. In 2015 noiZe rebranded to noiZe.buzz and noiZe.photos, two website dedicated to gay dance events and over 40,000 photos in an archive that spans over 20 years. ==References *Official 'noiZe' website *Official photo archive website Category:1993 establishments in Florida Category:LGBT- related magazines published in the United States Category:Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:LGBT culture in Florida Category:Magazines established in 1993 Category:Magazines published in Florida ","title":"Noizemag"},{"id":"19331901","text":"Packages of swim diapers (left) A swim diaper or swim nappy is a diaper that is made for those who are incontinent, usually babies or toddlers, which is worn underneath a bathing suit, or as a bathing suit. Swim diapers can be reusable and disposable. They are not intended to be absorbent, but only to contain solid waste (feces); the lack of absorbency prevents the swim diaper from swelling with water. ==Types== Often reusable swim diapers are lined with a fiber which encourages the solid waste to cling to the fiber without an absorbency layer. A snug fit in the legs and waist are key to function. Brands such as Splash About and The Honest Co use tightly knit polyester or neoprene as their material. One disadvantage of a reusable swim diaper is that they must be washed to be reused. On the other hand, a disposable swim diaper is only partially biodegradable and repeated purchases may cost more than reuse. A popular brand of disposable swim diapers is Little Swimmers, marketed under the Kimberly-Clark Huggies brand. Procter & Gamble produces the rival brand Pampers Splashers. Both are sold in three sizes: small (16‚Äì26 lb or 7‚Äì12 kg), medium (24‚Äì34 lb or 11‚Äì15 kg) and large (over 32 lb or 14 kg+). Due to their design for swimwear, they are not as absorbent and not intended for regular diapering. Splash About offer the 'Happy Nappy' reusable neoprene swim nappy which can be washed and reworn. ==Swim diapers at public pools== Some public pools require swim diapers for use by young children and the incontinent out of hygiene concerns. For the same reason, other pools do not allow swim diapers at all. Sick children who are not potty-trained and do not wear swim diapers may transmit e. coli from their fecal matter. When not used properly, or when using inferior products, health experts caution that swim diapers may not protect pool water against communicable diseases, such as norovirus. ==References== Category:Diapers Category:Infants' clothing Category:Babycare ","title":"Swim diaper"},{"id":"19331902","text":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a 4-hour BBC television adaptation of Thomas Hardy's 1891 book of the same name.

It tells the story of Tess Durbeyfield, a low-born country girl whose family find they have noble connections. The series commenced in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2008 and ran until 5 October 2008 airing in four parts on BBC One.

He described it as \\"a wonderfully emotionally-charged story, both intensely romantic and startlingly violent\\". In adapting the novel for the screen Nicholls gave particular focus to the character of Tess as \\"an active, forceful, opinionated young working-class woman\\" and not merely a \\"passive victim\\". He was also \\"keen to emphasise that this is very much a novel about young people in love\\". On completion of the project Nicholls said he was \\"delighted\\" with how it turned out, hoping audiences would find it \\"faithfully captures the light and shade of Hardy's masterpiece\\". Filming Gemma Arterton and Hans Matheson shooting on location. Nicholls worked closely with director David Blair to ensure the visual style of the series complemented his faithful adaptation of the story. The episodes were largely filmed in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire'Tess Of The D'Urbavilles TV Locations' at Gloucestershire On Screen and shot on high quality 35mm film rather than on digital video for a richer and more romantic appearance. Nicholls observed that \\"any adaptation of Hardy has to capture the beauty of his nature writing without forgetting that this is a brutal, unforgiving landscape\\", and that \\"the production should be beautiful but not 'pretty'; it should be about characters in a landscape, not just the landscape.\\" The series made extensive use of location shooting. Filming took place in many parts of southern England, including Thomas Hardy's native Dorset. Nicholls recalled how he found \\"Tess and Angel's farewell in the morning light at Stonehenge... the most moving scene in English literature, so to be able to recreate it, at dawn, on location at the correct time of year, has been tremendously exciting.\\" ==Cast and characters== Primary characters *Gemma Arterton as Tess Durbeyfield - Tess is the innocent but spirited protagonist of the story and the eldest daughter of a poor, rural Victorian family. She is sensitive, loyal and kind and tries to do the best for her loved ones. A \\"fine and handsome girl\\", Tess easily attracts the attention of admirers but her life is undone by their misdeeds and misjudgements. Arterton said, \\"I was attracted to the role because stripped down, it's such a basic story about love and missed opportunities, everyone can relate to it. It's also just brilliant, brilliant storytelling.\\" She perceives Tess as \\"a straightforward country girl, very pretty, but unaware of her beauty. Although people chip away at her life, she grows stronger, which is the incredible thing about her.\\" *Hans Matheson as Alec D'Urbeville - Alec is the self-centered and manipulative eldest son of Tess' supposed illustrious relatives, the D'Urbervilles. After going to work at The Slopes ‚Äî Alec's family home ‚Äî Tess falls into his clutches. He is the \\"tragic mischief\\" and she is easily seduced by his apparent charm and generosity. Matheson observed that \\"Although Alec's actions are extreme, they're unconscious. So you have to understand him as a human being, as well as a villain.\\" He also found the story \\"about the countryside... [about] spring and the seasons and the descriptions of love\\" and found it surprising how few cinematic versions there were of the tale, because \\"the novel is so filmic.\\" *Eddie Redmayne as Angel Clare - Angel is an intelligent and kind clergyman's son. Tess first sees him at a Mayday dance but he ignores her. Choosing to follow a life in farming rather than one in the Church, he wants to work for the \\"honour and glory of man\\". Tess meets him again at a farm where she's working as a milkmaid and they fall deeply in love. Redmayne heaped praise on the novel and the character of Tess, acknowledging that \\"Hardy had the boldness to create a character with great strength at that time, which I think is what makes her so enduring and relevant today\\". *Ruth Jones as Joan Durbeyfield *Ian Puleston-Davies as John Durbeyfield *Jodie Whittaker as Izz Huett *Donald Sumpter as Parson Tringham *Anna Massey as Mrs D'Urbeville *Christopher Fairbank as Groby *Jo Woodcock as Liza-Lu Durbeyfield Secondary characters *Joel Rowbottom as Abrham Durbeyfield *Steven Robertson as Cuthbert Clare *Hugh Skinner as Felix Clare *Laura Elphinstone as Car Darch *Sara Lloyd Gregory as Nancy Darch *Christine Bottomley as Kate *Emma Stansfield as Mary *Merelina Kendall as Miss Evans *Sarah Counsell as Drunken woman *Ellie Darcey-Alden as Modesty * Julie Barclay as Mrs Baxter * Cellan Geraint David as \\"Baby Sorrow \\" ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"width:20px; background:#bfe0bf;\\" # ! bfe0bf;\\"Title ! bfe0bf;\\"Original airdate ! style=\\"width:120px; background:#bfe0bf;\\" Viewers } ==Reception== Reaction to the serial was mixed, generating mainly warm but unenthusiastic reviews. Most critics were impressed with the acting, especially of Gemma Arterton's portrayal of the titular character, but found the series period details to be anachronistic for the era. Euan Ferguson of The Guardian praised the first and second episodes as \\"wonderful\\", and that while it lacked the \\"bubbling, spirited humour of Cranford\\" it was \\"less insipid than so much Austen\\". He also acclaimed Arterton as \\"terribly subtle\\" in the leading role. Hermione Eyre of The Independent called it a \\"commendably faithful adaptation\\" and praised Arterton's performance in the titular role, asserting that the actress \\"brims with life and spirit\\". Eyre did acknowledge, however, that the version lacked the \\"power\\" of Roman Polanski's 1979 version. Robert Hanks, also of The Independent, noted that the series \\"looks lovely\\" but perhaps \\"a bit too lovely\\". While noting Gemma Arterton as \\"gorgeous\\" he found the acting \\"mostly fair to middling\\" with the exception of Anna Massey, whom he called \\"quite brilliant\\" in the role of Mrs D'Urberville. Hanks also bemoaned the lack of realism, noting that too many costume dramas today \\"can‚Äôt afford to remind the viewer too explicitly just how grubby and laborious life was in the days before indoor hot running water, automatic washing machines and biological powder\\". In the US Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times found Blair was able to make \\"full and gorgeous use of Hardy's depiction of Tess as Earth Goddess\\" and praised the \\"visceral visual beauty\\" elicited from the landscape. She also found Arterton \\"a marvelous Tess\\" which she saw as important \\"considering the film pretty much lives or dies with her performance\\". Brian Lowry of Variety also acclaimed Arterton's performance; calling her \\"wide-eyed and lovely\\" he praised how she \\"conveys the pitiful plight of her simple character trapped in an unforgiving society\\". He was, however, critical of the pacing, saying that the series soon becomes an \\"arduous trek\\". Still he found that \\"the payoff is strong enough to justify all that hiking across lush countryside\\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle was less than impressed. He found David Blair's direction \\"competent\\" but also criticised the show's regard for period authenticity, finding that \\"the impoverished Durbeyfields and other villagers look a bit too well scrubbed and freshly laundered and that Wessex itself is a bit too pretty\\". Nevertheless, he remarked that Gemma Arterton was \\"excellent\\" and that the serial would \\"do as a reminder of Hardy's timeless appeal until something better comes along\\". Several viewers, while enjoying the series overall, noted that the hymn 'How Great Thou Art' was anachronistic. Some were disturbed enough to complain to the BBC.Dorset > Entertainment > Thomas Hardy >: \\"More Hardy for TV?\\". - BBC. - 24 January 2008.

Later he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2008. He is also a journalist and served for a time as national secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Sometimes media refers to him as Leader Maximo, due to his first name Massimo, but also for his dominant position in the left-wing coalitions during the Second Republic. Earlier in his career he was a member of the Italian Communist Party, and he was the first former communist to become prime minister of a NATO country and yet the only former communist prime minister of Italy. ==Biography== Massimo D'Alema was born in Rome on 20 April 1949, the son of Giuseppe D'Alema, a communist politician. He is married to Linda Giuva, a professor at the University of Siena, and has two children, Giulia and Francesco. He later became a notable member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), part of which in 1991 gave origin to the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), and in 1998 to the Democrats of the Left (DS). In 1998, succeeding Romano Prodi, he became Prime Minister, as the leader of The Olive Tree centre-left coalition. He was the first former Communist to become prime minister of a NATO country and the first Prime Minister of Italy born after Italy became a Republic in 1946. While D'Alema was Prime Minister, Italy took part in the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. The attack was supported by Silvio Berlusconi and the centre-right opposition, but the far left strongly contested it. In the internal life of his party, mostly during its transition from PCI to PDS, D'Alema stressed that its roots in Marxism should be renovated, with the aim to create a modern Western European social-democratic party. PD's meeting He has been the director of L'Unit√†, formerly the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party, which subsequently became the newspaper of the Democrats of the Left. D'Alema was Member of the European Parliament for Southern Italy with the Democrats of the Left, part of the Party of European Socialists group, and sat on the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on Foreign Affairs, until he stood down following his election to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Following Romano Prodi's win in the April 2006 election, D'Alema was initially tipped to become President of the Italian Republic once the Chamber of Deputies reconvened, but D'Alema himself stepped back, endorsing the official candidate of the centre-left coalition, Giorgio Napolitano, who was elected. Immediately following the April 2006 election, he was proposed as the future President of the Chamber of Deputies. The Communist Refoundation Party, however, strongly pushed for Fausto Bertinotti to become the next President. After a couple of days of heated debate, D'Alema stepped back to prevent a fracture between political parties, an act applauded by his allies. The same month, he was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new Prodi government. He served in those posts until 2008, when Prodi's government fell and Berlusconi's right-wing coalition prevailed in the election that followed in April 2008. D'Alema was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies in this election as part of the recently formed Democratic Party. ==2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict== While Italian Foreign Minister in the 2006‚Äì2008 Romano Prodi center-left government, Massimo D'Alema took a very pro-active diplomatic stance during the 2006 Lebanon War. Italy led negotiations with the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni and was proposed by Israel to head the multinational peacekeeping mission Unifil, although the dangers of the mission for Italian troops sparked warnings from the center- right opposition that it could prove a \\"kamikaze\\" mission, with the peacekeepers sandwiched between Israel and the well-armed Hezbollah. D‚ÄôAlema pledged Italy's willingness to enforce the United Nations resolution on Lebanon and urged other European Union member states to do the same because the stability of the Middle East should be a chief concern for Europeans. ==On the European scene== Massimo D'Alema with Condoleezza Rice D'Alema was briefly a Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2006. Since 2003 he has been member of the scientific committee of Michel Rocard and Dominique Strauss- Kahn's association \\"A gauche en Europe\\". He still figures on the European scene; he signed the Soros letter ('As concerned Europeans') and has called for a stronger European integration. Three year after the peace-keeping role in the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war, D'Alema became one of the favourite candidates for the charges of president of the European Council, high representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, or secretary-general for the Council Secretariat, without being appointed. Since 30 June 2010 he has been the president of the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), the political foundation of the Party of European Socialists.Massimo D'ALEMA : President of FEPS .

Aerts served on the city council of Monte Sereno, California. ==Powerlifting and Bench Press== Alan is the current holder of the men's benchpress world record in the 140 kg weight class for men 50 and over, at 202.5 kg (446.2 lbs.). Alan holds numerous powerlifting and benchpress championships and records in both open and master's competitions, including California, US, and World champion. Alan Aerts serves as a California state powerlifting referee. He also serves as the World Powerlifting Federation records chairman. His wife, Bonnie Aerts, is also a powerlifting and benchpress champion and bodybuilder, holding the United States Powerlifting Federation bench press record in her weight class in 2006. ==Polycythemia== Aerts has a rare blood disease called polycythemia, which causes the body to produce excess red blood cells. Although the disease can be treated for a time, this disease is always fatal. Despite this condition, Aerts continues to compete in powerlifting and bench press competitions, and has become world champion in his weight class after being diagnosed with the disease. ==Public Citizen== Aerts was prominent in Monte Sereno, California where he resided in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2006 he was awarded \\"Citizen of the Year\\" by the city of Campbell, California. He ran for Monte Sereno City Council 2006, and was a commissioner (?-2006) and a city councilman (2007, 2008) for the City of Monte Sereno, California. He has been a very generous philanthropist, donating significant money and time to charities including Guide Dogs for the Blind, Special Olympics, and local charities. His business, \\"Custom Vending Systems,\\" was named \\"Business of the Year\\" by the city of Campbell, California in 2005, and was the leading vending machine business in Silicon Valley. In 2013 Aerts retired from vending, sold his business, and moved to Nevada. After years of creating elaborate Christmas season displays (including cookies and punch for visiting children) at his home, with decorations costing in excess of $150,000 and drawing tens of thousands of visitors, Aerts became the target of neighborhood controversy over the traffic, parking, and other disruption to the neighborhood resulting from all the attention to the displays. Aerts attempted to alleviate concerns by hiring private security to help with traffic management on the four-home court where he lived. Local residents signed a petition, and the city council voted in an ordinance, often referred to as the \\"Alan Aerts\\" ordinance, that prevented the popular display starting in 2003. In protest, the Aerts' raised a statue of The Grinch, which garnered the event attention and coverage in media including The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Daily Show on Comedy Central, MSNBC, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, National Public Radio (NPR), and local newspapers and television shows. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American strength athletes Category:American powerlifters Category:American male weightlifters Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Sportspeople from Santa Clara County, California Category:People from Campbell, California Category:People from Monte Sereno, California ","title":"Alan Aerts"},{"id":"19332098","text":"Jorge Scarso, O.F.M.

It was the second time the championship was held in West Germany after previously being held in Norden in 1983. ==Summary== The World Final was held at the Olympic Stadium in Munich. Hans Nielsen made up for his 1988 run-off defeat to fellow Dane Erik Gundersen by scoring a 15-point maximum to take his 3rd World Championship. Neilsen joined Ove Fundin (Sweden), Barry Briggs and Ivan Mauger (New Zealand), Ole Olsen and Erik Gundersen (Denmark), as a three time Speedway World Champion. Simon Wigg from England finished second with the slick, track suiting his long track style. Wigg defeated fellow Englishman Jeremy Doncaster in a run-off for second and third places. In what would prove to be his last World Final before his career ending crash in the World Team Cup Final at the Odsal Stadium in England just two weeks later, Erik Gundersen finished in fourth place. His chances of an outright second-place finish (after having finished second behind Nielsen in Heat 4) ended when his bike's engine seized while leading heat 9 causing him to not finish the race. In a sad twist, it was also seized engine in Heat 1 of the World Team Cup Final that would cause Gundersen's career ending crash. Australian rider Troy Butler had a lucky passage to the World Final. After finishing fourth in the Australian Championship, he replaced countryman Jamie Fagg in the Commonwealth Final, finishing eighth to qualify for the Overseas Final. He then finished tenth in the Overseas Final to be the first reserve for the Intercontinental Final. He then got a start in the Intercontinental Final at Bradford when Overseas champion Sam Ermolenko injured his back in a horrific Long track motorcycle racing crash and was forced to withdraw (the American would be out for over 6 months). Butler would finish twelfth in the IC Final to become a reserve for the World Final where he once again came in as an injury replacement when Dane Jan O. Pedersen was forced to pull out. The 1986 Australian Champion ultimately finished twelfth in Munich, finishing with 4 points (two second places) from his 5 rides. ==Overseas Series== New Zealand Qualification *First 3 from New Zealand final to Commonwealth final { class= !Date Venue Winner Runner-up 3rd place  - !colspan=6 South Island Final - align=center ??

In 2003, he moved to Saint Petersburg to train in DYuSSh Smena and in 2005 he was accepted into FC Zenit reserves, signing a professional contract with the club. He had a bright start and played 66 games for reserves over three years, scoring once, but after that it was decided that he isn't good enough to join the first team. Before 2008 season he tried to find himself a new club in the two top Russian leagues, namely having a trial with Zvezda Irkutsk, but failed and was loaned to Ykk√∂nen (Finnish second tier) team TP-47. There during two months he played under the guidance of Russian coach Sergey Butenko, and then went on another loan to Bulgarian club OFC Sliven 2000 where he made 3 A PFG appearances. Smena-Zenit After returning to Russia he resumed training with Zenit reserves before their head coach Anatoly Davydov persuaded him to go trial with Vladimir Kazachyonok's FC Smena-Zenit. He signed for Smena-Zenit before 2009 season and was chosen as the young team's captain. After the end of the season in which the team finished at low 16th place, Zenit implemented another change in the club's structure, resulting in FC Smena-Zenit being dissolved and its functions being passed to DYuSSh Smena-Zenit team of U-18s. Mironov thus had to pursue his career elsewhere. Dinamo Vologda In 2010, he joined another Russian Second Division zone West team Dinamo Vologda alongside his former Smena-Zenit teammates Anton Arsenyev and Oleg Babenkov. JK Kalev Sillam√§e In February 2011, Mironov signed a one-year deal with Meistriliiga side JK Kalev Sillam√§e, reuniting with coach Vladimir Kazachyonok from FC Smena-Zenit. Dynamo Saint Petersburg He made his Russian Football National League debut for FC Dynamo Saint Petersburg on 6 July 2014 in a game against FC Tom Tomsk. ==International career== Mironov was a captain of Russia national youth football team of his age since 2003, also playing for team of 1987-born on occasion. He played his last youth international game for Russia U-19 in 2006. ==Playing style and potential== Back in December 2006, Zenit reserves coach Aleksey Strepetov rated Mironov as a talented defensive midfielder, noting his hard work and commitment. He has, however, blamed an overuse in youth international football for slowing down Mironov development, also adding that his limited offensive abilities may be a stumbling block for the footballer to play at the highest level. ==References * Profile at stats.sportbox.ru Category:1988 births Category:People from Veliky Novgorod Category:Living people Category:Russian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Russia youth international footballers Category:Russian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Finland Category:Expatriate footballers in Bulgaria Category:Footballers from Saint Petersburg Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:Russian expatriate sportspeople in Bulgaria Category:DYuSSh Smena-Zenit alumni Category:Expatriate footballers in Estonia Category:FC Ufa players Category:FC Dynamo Saint Petersburg players Category:FC Tekstilshchik Ivanovo players Category:FC Sakhalin Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk players Category:PFC Spartak Nalchik players Category:TP-47 players Category:FC Avangard Kursk players Category:FC Dynamo Vologda players Category:Sportspeople from Novgorod Oblast ","title":"Sergey Mironov (footballer)"},{"id":"19332220","text":"Fran√ßois Verger (November 29, 1911 - December 31, 2001) was a French field hockey player who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

He was the first President of Somaliland, ==Biography== Tuur was born in 1931 in Burao, then a part of the British Somaliland protectorate. He hailed from the Habr Yunis-Garhajis sub clan of the Isaaq He was one of the top student that graduated from the first Intermediate School in British Somaliland Protectorate and was given a scholarship to Sudan in 1948 to study in the famous Hantoob secondary School. In Hantoob he met and befriended with some of the future Sudanese leaders like Ja‚Äôafar Al-Numeiri, Sadeq Al-Mahadi and Hassan Al-Turaabi. Abdirahman excelled both in sports (especially football and track) and in academic studies. He got another scholarship and did his university education at Exeter University UK. After successfully completing his university in the UK Abdirahman returned and started his career as an Administrative Officer in Borama in 1956 and was elevated to the position of District Commissioner (DC) 3 years later (1959). In 1961 he became Governor of the Eastern Region (Burao) and then in 1964 the Governor of Western Region (Hargeisa). In that same year he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where he was appointed in the following diplomatic posts: Sudan 1964-1968 and 1970-1971 Ambassador Ethiopia 1972-1977 Ambassador East Germany 1978-1981 Ambassador UAE 1981 Ambassador He later became the Chairman of the Somali National Movement (SNM), a guerilla force mainly drawn from his Isaaq clan, which was attempting to topple former President of Somalia Siad Barre's military regime. Although the SNM at its inception had a unionist constitution, it eventually began to pursue a separatist agenda, looking to secede from the rest of Somalia. Under Tuur's leadership, the local administration declared the northwestern Somali territories independent on 18 May 1991. He then became the newly established Somaliland polity‚Äôs first President, but subsequently renounced the separatist platform in 1994. Tuur concurrently began instead to publicly seek and advocate reconciliation with the rest of Somalia under a power-sharing federal system of governance. In doing so, he also represented the interests of many other Isaaq members, who were against secession. Tuur additionally lent some support to the UNOSOM peace-building mission in the southern regions. Somaliland and Peace in the Horn of Africa: A Situation Report and Analysis , M.

It was built on a plot close to the rock islet that look towards the Ozama River, granted to Diego Columbus, firstborn son of the discoverer of the Americas, Christopher Columbus, by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, to build a dwelling for him and his descendants on the island Hispaniola, to which he arrived in 1509 as governor. The building houses the Museo Alc√°zar de Diego Col√≥n, whose collection exhibits the Caribbean's most important ensemble of European late medieval and Renaissance works of art, which were acquired in the 1950s. The Tapestry collection (spanning from the 15th to 17th centuries) is particularly important and unique in the Caribbean, and includes pieces produced by the Flemish Van Den Hecke family from cartouches created by Charles Le Brun. The Alc√°zar is the most visited museum in Santo Domingo. The palace is an impressive construction of coralline blocks that once housed some fifty rooms and a number of gardens and courtyards, although what remains today is about half the size it once was. It was built under Diego Col√≥n, the son of Christopher Columbus; when he became the 4th Governor of the Indies in 1509, he ordered the construction of a family home and governor‚Äôs mansion between 1510 and 1512. The architectural style is gothic mudejar typical of the early 16th century. During the early Spanish colonial period, the mansion occupied a very important place in history. It was from here that many expeditions of conquest and exploration were planned. In 1586, the palace was sacked by Sir Francis Drake and his forces. As the influence of Santo Domingo waned, the house fell into ruins, and by the mid-18th century was abandoned and in danger of rotting away. It was rescued and restored between 1955 and 1957, being transformed into a 22 rooms museum filled with period furniture, artwork, and other accessories. A self-guided tour using a portable audio speaker that discusses each room's function is available in various languages. ==Gallery== File:Alcazar de Colon sign.jpgAlcazar de Colon historical marker File:Alcazar de Colon2.jpg File:Santo Domingo - Alcazar de Colon 01.JPG File:Santo Domingo - Alcazar de Colon 02.JPGAs seen from the south File:Alcazar de Colon interior.jpgAlcazar de Colon interior File:Alcazar de Colon window.jpgAlcazar de Colon window File:Alcazar de Colon balcony.jpgAlcazar de Colon balcony ==See also== *Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo) ==References *Official Alc√°zar de Col√≥n museum website Category:Buildings and structures in Santo Domingo Category:Museums in the Dominican Republic Category:Columbus family Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Dominican Republic Category:Tourist attractions in Santo Domingo Category:Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo) ","title":"Alc√°zar de Col√≥n"},{"id":"19332292","text":"Falmouth station is a former railroad station and current bus station located on Depot Avenue in Falmouth, Massachusetts.

Replacement station In 1912 the original station was sold to the Swift family who moved it across the tracks. In its place the New Haven Railroad built a replacement brick station, which stands to this day. It served daily year-round New Haven RR trains to Boston until 1959. Summertime service continued to 1964. The station was also a stop for day and nighttime versions of the NH's Cape Codder service to New York City; these trains were among the trains terminated in 1964. Lynch, Peter E. (2005). New Haven Railroad passenger trains. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI Publishing Company. pp. 119-21. . Failed passenger service proposals Passenger service to Falmouth ceased in 1989, when the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad truncated its rail service in North Falmouth. That same year, a mini-high level platform was built when commuter service was proposed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in order to ease traffic congestion in the seasonally popular town. Falmouth rail service remained a hotly debated topic for nearly two decades, as the housing boom of the 1990s and 2000s took hold. With a new platform in Falmouth that never saw a passenger, resumption of passenger and freight service was promised by the commonwealth. However, pro-rail trail advocates wielded considerable political influence with State Representative Eric Turkington, who passed legislation before leaving office in 2008 that provided funding for the extension of the rail trail to North Falmouth. In June 2008, the line was cut back to North Falmouth and replaced with an extension of the existing bike path. Additionally, this cut off any possibility of restoration of service to Woods Hole Railroad Station, the traditional final station of the north-south branch from Bourne on the west side of the Cape. The former Falmouth railroad station today is used as a bus depot by the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority and Peter Pan Bus Lines. The rail line that once carried trains to the station has today been converted into a bike path which is known as the Shining Sea Bikeway. ==See also== *North Falmouth station *West Falmouth station *List of railroad stations on Cape Cod ==References Category:Falmouth, Massachusetts Category:Old Colony Railroad Stations on Cape Cod Category:Former railway stations in Massachusetts Category:Repurposed railway stations in the United States Category:Bus stations in Massachusetts Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1872 Category:Railway stations closed in 1988 ","title":"Falmouth station"},{"id":"19332301","text":"The Cyborg from Earth is a 1998 science fiction novel by Charles Sheffield. It is the fourth in a series of unrelated stories, published by Tor Books in their Jupiter line. ==Plot introduction== The novel starts in a future dystopian Earth where the upper class lives a life of privilege, while most others live in the \\"pool\\", an endless crowd of unemployable youths depending on government assistance or crime for survival. The book is told from the perspective of the main character, Jefferson Kopal, a young member of an immensely wealthy and powerful spaceship building family founded by his Great Grandfather, Rollo Kopal, an admiral in the Space Navy. As part of the bylaws, all voting members of the company must have served honorably in the navy. Young Jeff is about to take his final test... == Plot summary == \\"Jefferson Kopal is a coward. He knows it, and if he doesn't do something about it soon, so will everyone else.\\" This is the self-evaluation of the novel's main protagonist. Jeff is about to take his final test before a Navy Review Board to see if he is fit for duty as an officer in the Space Navy. After failing the test most valiantly, Jeff is assigned to the Navy's Border Command, an apparent exile from the solar system and prestigious Central Command, where all the great Kopals have served. Jeff is assigned to a ship that will take him into the Messina Dust Cloud, which residents of the Solar System call Cyborg Territory. After a confrontation with his cousin, Jeff leaves Kopal Manor and heads into space. Adjustment to naval life is at first hard on Jeff until he meets the two \\"'jinners\\" or engineers. He is at once at ease with them and is able to show his true interest, engineering. Unfortunately, Captain Dufferin, the Commanding Officer, feels that the Kopals are a plague on the Space Navy and intends to make Jeff suffer for his last name. Jeff is sent to the forward observation bubble prior to the jump to The Messina Dust Cloud. While contemplating his current situation, Jeff notices the formation of a \\"space sounder,\\" a terrifying anomaly that has been known to destroy whole star ships, coming directly for the ship. Jeff warns the Bridge but then blacks out as the ship takes evasive action to avoid certain death. When Jeff awakes, he finds that he has been abandoned by Captain Dufferin and the majority of the crew. Mercy Hooglich, one of the 'jinners Jeff had befriended, explains how the captain and other officers had taken the runabout back to the Solar System, and are going to charge Jeff with dereliction of duty. Jeff also learns that his injuries were so extensive that to be saved, the medical technology of the Cloud, namely, nanotechnology, had to be used. The remainder of the story revolves around the \\"rebellion\\" of the Cloud Territory as well as Jeff fighting to restore his name and place in the family business. In the end, Jeff finds that he is not a coward and everyone else knows that as well. == Continuity == The engines used by Vanguard Mining's spacecraft are Diabelli Omnivores.

The site consists of protecting part of what was once the Wormsloe Plantation, a large estate established by one of Georgia's colonial founders, Noble Jones (c. 1700-1775). The site includes a picturesque oak avenue, the ruins of Jones' fortified house built of tabby,Tabby is a building material consisting of lime, sand, water, and crushed oyster shells, employed where there was no local brickmaking. a museum, and a demonstration area interpreting colonial daily life. In 1736, Noble Jones obtained a grant for of land on the Isle of Hope that would form the core of Wormsloe. He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the Intracoastal Waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence. The State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973 and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979. ==Geographic setting== Jones Marsh, formerly the Skidaway Narrows, looking toward Long Island (spans the horizon) and Skidaway Island (visible top-right) The Isle of Hope is an island (or peninsula, depending on marsh water levels) situated approximately southeast of downtown Savannah in Georgia's Lower Coastal Plain region. The island stretches for approximately from its northern tip to its southern tip and for roughly from its eastern shore to its western shore. The Skidaway River, which is part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, forms the island's eastern shore. The island's southwest shore is formed by the Moon River, and the island's northwest shore formed by the Herb River. Typical of Georgia's inshore coastal islands, the Isle of Hope is completely surrounded by a tidal salt marsh.Dan Rice, Susan Knudson, Lisa Westberry, \\"Restoration of the Wormsloe Plantation Salt Marsh in Savannah Georgia.\\" 2005. Retrieved: September 15, 2008. Skidaway Island is located opposite the Skidaway River to the east and the Georgia mainland is located opposite the Moon River to the west. Wormsloe occupies most of the southern half of the Isle of Hope. A small island known as Long Island lies between Skidaway Island and the Isle of Hope and splits the Skidaway River into two narrow channels, the main (navigable) channel of which is known as the Skidaway Narrows. The main channel of the Skidaway River presently flows between Long Island and Skidaway Island, although in colonial times the main channel flowed between Long Island and the Isle of Hope, giving Wormsloe its historically strategic importance. When traveling by water, the Isle of Hope is just over from the Atlantic Ocean (via the Skidaway, Vernon, and Ogeechee rivers) to the southeast and just over from the port of Savannah (via the Skidaway, Wilmington, and Savannah rivers) to the northwest. Skidaway Road connects Wormsloe and the Isle of Hope to U.S. Route 80 near downtown Savannah. The Isle of Hope is located entirely within Chatham County. Wormsloe Historic Site is managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. ==History== Early history 1780 map showing the location of Wormsloe (\\"Jones\\"), the Bethesda Orphan House, and Henry Parker's ferry Native Americans have probably inhabited the Isle of Hope on at least a semi-annual basis for thousands of years, as indicated by oyster shell deposits excavated in the vicinity. By the time European explorers arrived in the area in the 16th century, the island was claimed by the Yuchi and the Creek tribe. When the first permanent English colonists landed at what is now Savannah in 1733, the island was part of the domain of the Yamacraw, a detached branch of the Creeks, although the island was apparently uninhabited at the time. James Oglethorpe, the leader of these English colonists, maintained a friendly relationship with the Yamacraw chief Tomochichi, and managed to peacefully acquire the Savannah area and the lands in its vicinity. Throughout the late 17th-century, Spain (which had established itself in Florida in the previous century) retained loose control over the Georgia coast via Native American allies. This inevitably brought them into conflict with the growing English colonies to the north, namely North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1702, South Carolina governor James Moore led an expedition against Spanish settlements in Florida and, en route, raided and destroyed the Spanish Native American missions off the Georgia coast. While Spain still claimed the coast and islands, the area was largely abandoned, creating a buffer zone between Spanish Florida and the English Carolinas. In the early 1730s, the English decided to colonize the islands between the Carolinas and Florida. A charter was granted in 1732, and the first colonists set sail in the same year. The English colonists that arrived at Savannah in 1733 formed the core of what would eventually become the colony and state of Georgia. Among them was Noble Jones (d. 1775), a physician and carpenter from Lambeth, England who made the Transatlantic crossing with his wife and two children. Jones was apparently a loose acquaintance of Oglethorpe, and just before the colonists set sail from England, the colony's Trustees made Jones one of the settlement's lead officials. Like the other first settlers, Jones received a town lot in Savannah and a small farm on the outskirts of the town.E. Merton Coulter, Wormsloe: Two Centuries of a Georgia Family (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1955), 3-5. Establishment of Wormsloe The original house site at Wormslow Historic Site. Noble Jones applied for a lease for on the south side of the Isle of Hope in 1736 (the Trustees did not approve the lease until 1745) and began building a fortified house overlooking the Skidaway Narrows. The house was constructed between 1739 and 1745 using wood and tabby, a crude type of concrete made from oyster shells and lime. The fortress consisted of high walls with bastions at each of its four corners. The fort house was 1.5 stories and had five rooms. Oglethorpe allotted Jones' fort a 12-man marine garrison and a scout boat with which to patrol the river.Coulter, 24-5.Some information obtained from the Wormsloe Historic Site brochure, published November 2005. \\"Wormslow\\"-- the name Jones gave to his Isle of Hope estate-- probably refers to Wormslow Hundred, Herefordshire, in the Welsh border country from which the Jones family hailed. Some historians suggest the name refers to Jones' attempts to cultivate silkworms at the plantation, but as his son Noble Wimberly Jones named his plantation \\"Lambeth\\" after his birthplace on the south bank of the Thames, the former theory is more likely.Coulter, 24. Ruins of the tabby fort at Wormsloe Noble Jones' fortified house was one of several defensive works built between Frederica on Saint Simons Island and the Savannah townsite. The English were concerned that the Spanish still claimed the area and would eventually attempt to expel them. Conflict erupted in 1739 with the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the name for the regional theater of the greater War of the Austrian Succession. Jones took part in an English raid along the St. Johns River in northern Florida in 1740, as well as the successful defense of Frederica at the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742.Coulter, 56-63. The end of the war in 1748 largely neutralized Spanish threats to the new colony. The War of Jenkins' Ear is commemorated annually on the last Saturday in May at Wormsloe Plantation. Antebellum Wormsloe The practice of slavery had been banned by Georgia's original charter, so Noble Jones used indentured servant labor to tend Wormsloe in the plantation's early years. When the Trustees revoked the ban on slavery in 1749, Jones used slave labor in order to make Wormsloe profitable. Jones initially planted several types of crops, including corn, rice, various fruits and vegetables, and possibly indigo. The Georgia Trustees encouraged the production of silk; Jones planted mulberry trees and tried unsuccessfully to produce silk at Wormsloe. While Wormsloe never proved profitable, Jones managed to amass real estate wealth throughout his lifetime, including and five town lots in the Savannah area. Jones served the young colony in multiple civic capacities, as judge, militia captain, and colonial legislator.Coulter, 22-31. With the death of Noble Jones in 1775, Wormsloe passed to his daughter, Mary Jones Bulloch (c. 1730-1795). Jones' death occurred just as the American colonies were on the verge of breaking away from England. Jones remained a loyal supporter of King George III throughout his life, a stance that often brought him in direct conflict with his son, Noble Wimberly Jones (1723‚Äì1805), who was an ardent supporter of Patriot causes. Noble Wimberly led the Georgia Commons House in its rejection of the Townshend Acts in 1768, and took part in a mission that seized a large supply of gunpowder from the provincial powder magazine in 1776.Coulter, 121-150. Noble Jones' will stipulated that after the death of his daughter, Wormsloe would pass to Noble Wimberly and thence to Noble Wimberly's heirs \\"forever.\\" Thus Noble Wimberly inherited Wormsloe in 1795 upon the death of his sister, and deeded the plantation to his son George Jones (1766‚Äì1838) in 1804.Coulter, 105, 181. George Jones, who served as a U.S. senator and in various capacities in the Savannah government, built a new, more elaborate house at Wormsloe in 1828, which is the plantation house that is still standing, and made cotton a staple of the plantation. Jones's son, George Frederick Tilghman Jones (1827‚Äì1880), inherited Wormsloe in 1857. George Frederick Tilghman Jones took an active interest in Wormsloe (he changed the spelling from \\"Wormslow\\" to \\"Wormsloe\\"), enlarging the plantation's gardens, adding the first oak-lined avenue, and expanding the house. He changed his name to George Wimberley Jones De Renne (a corruption of his grandmother's maiden name, Van Deren). He began publishing a periodical collection of rare early Georgia documents under the title, the Wormsloe Quartos. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Wormsloe and the Isle of Hope were fortified by Confederate forces. When Union forces captured Savannah in 1864, the Jones/De Renne family was forced to flee. Although the plantation was confiscated by the U.S. government (it seized the property of planters who had supported the Confederacy), the property was eventually returned when De Renne was granted a full pardon by President Andrew Johnson.William Harris Bragg, \\"Wormsloe Plantation.\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia, 24 November 2004. Retrieved: May 20, 2018.Coulter, 206-238. Wormsloe in the 20th century In his will, George Wimberley Jones De Renne entrusted Wormsloe to a Pennsylvania insurance company until the death of his son, Wimberley Jones De Renne (1853‚Äì1916), at which time the estate would pass to his grandchildren. Wimberley Jones De Renne maintained Wormsloe, further expanding the gardens and planting a new oak avenue (still in use) lined with over 400 oak trees. He continued his father's contributions to history and tradition, publishing several works for the Georgia Historical Society and establishing Wormsloe's library. Upon his death in 1916, Wormsloe passed to the grandchildren of George Wimberley Jones De Renne. In 1917, one grandson, Wymberley Wormsloe De Renne (1891‚Äì1966), bought his cousins' shares of the plantation.Coulter, 238-254. In 1930 after the stock market crash, Elfrida De Renne Barrow (1884‚Äì1970) assumed her brother Wymberly's debts, and eventually made the plantation her official residence. Barrow created the Wormsloe Foundation, which continued and expanded the family tradition of publishing works related to Georgia history. In 1961, Barrow donated most of the Wormsloe estate to the Wormsloe Foundation, while retaining ownership of Wormsloe House and its immediate area. In 1972, after the Wormsloe Foundation's tax-exempt status was revoked, the foundation transferred ownership of Wormsloe to the Nature Conservancy, which in turn transferred it to the State of Georgia the following year. In 1979, the state opened the site to the public as Wormsloe Historic Site. The descendants of Noble Jones still control Wormsloe House and its surrounding acreage. Wormsloe Historic Site The arched entrance to Wormsloe is located just off Skidaway Road, near the Isle of Hope community. The state-controlled area includes the scenic oak-lined avenue, a museum, and a walking trail that leads through the dense maritime forest to the ruins of the tabby fort built by Jones in 1745. More recently, the park has established a colonial life demonstration area, which includes a replica wattle and daub hut and several small outbuildings that simulate a living area for Jones' marines and slaves. The Wormsloe site is within a dense oak-pine maritime forest. Much of the forest originally pre-dated European settlement of the Isle of Hope, but a southern pine beetle infestation in the 1970s killed off most of the old-growth pines. A short interpretive trail near the museum displays prints of wildlife and birds by the 18th-century naturalist Mark Catesby.

The project homepage is hosted by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). They are also the chief source of netCDF software, standards development, updates, etc. The format is an open standard. NetCDF Classic and 64-bit Offset Format are an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium. The project started in 1988 and is still actively supported by UCAR. The original netCDF binary format (released in 1990, now known as \\"netCDF classic format\\") is still widely used across the world and continues to be fully supported in all netCDF releases. Version 4.0 (released in 2008) allowed the use of the HDF5 data file format. Version 4.1 (2010) added support for C and Fortran client access to specified subsets of remote data via OPeNDAP. Version 4.3.0 (2012) added a CMake build system for Windows builds. Version 4.7.0 (2019) added support for reading Amazon S3 objects. Further releases are planned to improve performance, add features, and fix bugs. ==History== The format was originally based on the conceptual model of the Common Data Format developed by NASA, but has since diverged and is not compatible with it. ==Format description== The netCDF libraries support multiple different binary formats for netCDF files: * The classic format was used in the first netCDF release, and is still the default format for file creation. * The 64-bit offset format was introduced in version 3.6.0, and it supports larger variable and file sizes. * The netCDF-4/HDF5 format was introduced in version 4.0; it is the HDF5 data format, with some restrictions. * The HDF4 SD format is supported for read-only access. * The CDF5 format is supported, in coordination with the parallel-netcdf project. All formats are \\"self-describing\\". This means that there is a header which describes the layout of the rest of the file, in particular the data arrays, as well as arbitrary file metadata in the form of name/value attributes. The format is platform independent, with issues such as endianness being addressed in the software libraries. The data are stored in a fashion that allows efficient subsetting. Starting with version 4.0, the netCDF API allows the use of the HDF5 data format. NetCDF users can create HDF5 files with benefits not available with the netCDF format, such as much larger files and multiple unlimited dimensions. Full backward compatibility in accessing old netCDF files and using previous versions of the C and Fortran APIs is supported. ==Software== Access libraries The software libraries supplied by UCAR provide read-write access to netCDF files, encoding and decoding the necessary arrays and metadata. The core library is written in C, and provides an API for C, C++ and two APIs for Fortran applications, one for Fortran 77, and one for Fortran 90. An independent implementation, also developed and maintained by Unidata, is written in 100% Java, which extends the core data model and adds additional functionality. Interfaces to netCDF based on the C library are also available in other languages including R (ncdf, ncvar and RNetCDF packages), Perl, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Mathematica, MATLAB, IDL, and Octave. The specification of the API calls is very similar across the different languages, apart from inevitable differences of syntax. The API calls for version 2 were rather different from those in version 3, but are also supported by versions 3 and 4 for backward compatibility. Application programmers using supported languages need not normally be concerned with the file structure itself, even though it is available as open formats. Applications A wide range of application software has been written which makes use of netCDF files. These range from command line utilities to graphical visualization packages. A number are listed below, and a longer list is on the UCAR website. * A commonly used set of Unix command line utilities for netCDF files is the NetCDF Operators (NCO) suite, which provide a range of commands for manipulation and analysis of netCDF files including basic record concatenating, array slicing and averaging. * ncBrowse is a generic netCDF file viewer that includes Java graphics, animations and 3D visualizations for a wide range of netCDF file conventions. * ncview is a visual browser for netCDF format files. This program is a simple, fast, GUI-based tool for visualising fields in a netCDF file. One can browse through the various dimensions of a data array, taking a look at the raw data values. It is also possible to change color maps, invert the data, etc. * Panoply is a netCDF file viewer developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies which focuses on presentation of geo-gridded data. It is written in Java and thus platform independent. Although its feature set overlaps with ncBrowse and ncview, Panoply is distinguished by offering a wide variety of map projections and ability to work with different scale color tables. * The NCAR Command Language (NCL) is used to analyze and visualize data in netCDF files (among other formats). * The Python programming language can access netCDF files with the PyNIO module (which also facilitates access to a variety of other data formats). netCDF files can also be read with the Python module \`netCDF4-python\`, and into a pandas-like \`DataFrame\` with the \`xarray\` module. * Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis environment designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and meteorologists analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. Ferret offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables. Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented graphics are produced with a single command. * The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive desktop tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of earth science data. GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a variety of commonly used operating systems and is freely distributed over the Internet. * nCDF_Browser is a visual nCDF browser, written in the IDL programming language. Variables, attributes, and dimensions can be immediately downloaded to the IDL command line for further processing. All the Coyote Library files necessary to run nCDF_Browser are available in the zip file. * ArcGIS versions after 9.2 support netCDF files that follow the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions and contain rectilinear grids with equally- spaced coordinates. The Multidimensional Tools toolbox can be used to create raster layers, feature layers, and table views from netCDF data in ArcMap, or convert feature, raster, and table data to netCDF. * Origin 8 software imports netCDF files as matrix books where each book can hold a 4D array. Users can select a subset of the imported data to make surface, contour or image plots. * The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library provides support for read and write access to netCDF data. * netCDF Explorer is multi-platform graphical browser for netCDF files. netCDF Explorer can browse files locally or remotely, by means of OPeNDAP * R supports netCDF through packages such as ncdf4 (including HDF5 support)David Pierce (2014). ncdf4: Interface to Unidata netCDF (version 4 or earlier) format data files. R package version 1.13. https://cran.r-project.org/package=ncdf4 or RNetCDF (no HDF5 support).Pavel Michna and with contributions from Milton Woods (2015). RNetCDF: Interface to NetCDF Datasets. R package version 1.7-3. https://cran.r-project.org/package=RNetCDF * HDFql enables users to manage netCDF-4/HDF5 files through a high-level language (similar to SQL) in C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Fortran and R. * ECMWF's Metview workstation and batch system can handle NetCDF together with GRIB and BUFR. * OpenChrom ships a converter under the terms of the Eclipse Public LicenseOpenChrom: a cross- platform open source software for the mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic data, Philip Wenig, Juergen Odermatt, BMC Bioinformatics; 2010; ==Common uses== It is commonly used in climatology, meteorology and oceanography applications (e.g., weather forecasting, climate change) and GIS applications. It is an input/output format for many GIS applications, and for general scientific data exchange. To quote from their site: : \\"NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for array-oriented data access and a freely-distributed collection of data access libraries for C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The netCDF libraries support a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.\\" ==Conventions== The Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions are metadata conventions for earth science data, intended to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF Application Programmer Interface (API). The conventions define metadata that are included in the same file as the data (thus making the file \\"self-describing\\"), that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and of the spatial and temporal properties of the data (including information about grids, such as grid cell bounds and cell averaging methods). This enables users of data from different sources to decide which data are comparable, and allows building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. ==Parallel-NetCDF== An extension of netCDF for parallel computing called Parallel-NetCDF (or PnetCDF) has been developed by Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University. This is built upon MPI-IO, the I/O extension to MPI communications. Using the high-level netCDF data structures, the Parallel-NetCDF libraries can make use of optimizations to efficiently distribute the file read and write applications between multiple processors. The Parallel-NetCDF package can read/write only classic and 64-bit offset formats. Parallel-NetCDF cannot read or write the HDF5-based format available with netCDF-4.0. The Parallel-NetCDF package uses different, but similar APIs in Fortran and C. Parallel I/O in the Unidata netCDF library has been supported since release 4.0, for HDF5 data files. Since version 4.1.1 the Unidata NetCDF C library supports parallel I/O to classic and 64-bit offset files using the Parallel-NetCDF library, but with the NetCDF API. ==Interoperability of C/Fortran/C++ libraries with other formats== The netCDF C library, and the libraries based on it (Fortran 77 and Fortran 90, C++, and all third-party libraries) can, starting with version 4.1.1, read some data in other data formats. Data in the HDF5 format can be read, with some restrictions. Data in the HDF4 format can be read by the netCDF C library if created using the HDF4 Scientific Data (SD) API. ==NetCDF-Java common data model== The NetCDF-Java library currently reads the following file formats and remote access protocols: * BUFR Format Documentation (ongoing development) * CINRAD level II (Chinese Radar format) * DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) * DORADE radar file format * GINI (GOES Ingest and NOAAPORT Interface) image format * GEMPAK gridded data * GRIB version 1 and version 2 (ongoing work on tables) * GTOPO 30-sec elevation dataset (USGS) * Hierarchical Data Format (HDF4, HDF-EOS2, HDF5, HDF-EOS5) * NetCDF (classic and large format) * NetCDF-4 (built on HDF5) * NEXRAD Radar level 2 and level 3. There are a number of other formats in development. Since each of these is accessed transparently through the NetCDF API, the NetCDF-Java library is said to implement a Common Data Model for scientific datasets. The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics: # The data access layer, also known as the syntactic layer, handles data reading. # The coordinate system layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; specialized georeferencing coordinate systems, important to the Earth Science community, are specially annotated. # The scientific data type layer identifies specific types of data, such as grids, images, and point data, and adds specialized methods for each kind of data. The data model of the data access layer is a generalization of the NetCDF-3 data model, and substantially the same as the NetCDF-4 data model. The coordinate system layer implements and extends the concepts in the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions. The scientific data type layer allows data to be manipulated in coordinate space, analogous to the Open Geospatial Consortium specifications. The identification of coordinate systems and data typing is ongoing, but users can plug in their own classes at runtime for specialized processing. ==See also== * Common Data Format (CDF) * CGNS (CFD General Notation System) * EAS3 (Ein-Ausgabe-System) * FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) * GRIB (GRIdded Binary) * Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) * OPeNDAP client-server protocols * Tecplot binary files * XDMF (eXtensible Data Model Format) * XMDF (eXtensible Model Data Format) ==ReferencesnetCDF-Java project at UCAR * ncBrowse - generic netCDF file viewer * netCDF Explorer - netCDF Explorer is multi-platform graphical browser for netCDF files. netCDF Explorer can browse files locally or remotely, by means of OPeNDAP * Unidata's Common Data Model version 4 * \\"An Introduction to Distributed Visualization\\"; section 4.2 contains a comparison of CDF, HDF, and netCDF. * NCO, a suite of programs known as operators, which facilitate manipulation and analysis of netCDF files * dapper data server and DChart web client for OPeNDAP in-situ data in netCDF format * Animating NetCDF Data in ArcMap * ncWMS, a Web Map Service and dynamic web application for visualizing NetCDF data (demo site) * CF Conventions documents * CF home page * Overview of CF * Projects and Groups using CF (partial) * List of software utilities using netCDF files Category:Computer file formats Category:Earth sciences data formats Category:Earth sciences graphics software Category:Meteorological data and networks ","title":"NetCDF"},{"id":"19332383","text":"Joeri Verlinden (born 22 January 1988) is a Dutch swimmer who specializes in butterfly and freestyle.

With this title he was one of the highest officials at the royal court. ==Family== Stela depciting Amenhotep and his son Ipy. Both Stewards of Memphis Amenhotep, with the nickname Huy, was a member of an influential family. His father Heby was mayor of Memphis. His brother Ramose was vizier under Amenhotep III.Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunrise: Egypt from Golden age to Age of Heresy, The American University in Cairo Press, 2014, p 48, p50, p 184 n35, p198 n84. His son Ipy was high steward under Akhenaten. Ipy likely succeeded his father sometime after the first Heb-Sed festival of Amenhotep III. He appears in the tomb of his uncle Ramose at the end of the reign of Amenhotep III when he has taken over his father's duties.O'Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.

Another fine statue was found at Abydos. Already in the early 19th century (1821 or 22), his looted tomb was found in Saqqara. It contained a sarcophagus, a granite canopic chest, model scribal boards and a stele with a long religious text. The scribal palettes are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Acc.

The Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden has a red granite pyramidion (Inv. No. A.M. 6), a quartzite canopic chest (Inv. No. A.M.2) and a wooden leg of a stool. A stela belonging to Amenhotep was found at the Monastery of Apa Jeremias where it had been used as a window sill. Two statues belonging to Amenhotep have been found. One now in the Ashmolean Museum, and the other in the British Museum. In Memphis, there was found a statue reporting his building work for his king. The statue now in the Ashmolean museum records how Amenhotep donated land, serfs and animals. In return he would receive part of the daily royal offerings, which would be placed before his statue.Kurt Sethe: Urkunden der 18. Dynastie. Heft 20-22. Berlin 1957, p. 1793-1811B.J.J.

Administrative and Economic Aspects of the New Kingdom Royal Memorial Temples in Western Thebes, (Egyptologische Uitgaven 12), Leiden 1997 ==Tomb== Amenhotep's now lost tomb had been discovered in 1821 or 1822 and items such as the scribal palettes, the cubit rods and the jars had been removed. The tomb was possibly excavated by Nizzoli and Anastasi. The tomb appears to have been a standard New Kingdom tomb and had two subterranean chambers: an antechamber and a burial chamber. The tomb was undecorated, but a stele depicting Amenhotep and his son Ipy was likely found in the tomb. The tomb also contained a very large sarcophagus with a large lid, but those are presumably still in the tomb. The sarcophagus contained the small pyramidion, the cubit rod, an alabaster palette and at least some of the jars. The tomb would have further consisted of a brick built chapel and this structure would have been topped by the granite pyramidion (now in Leiden). Another quartzite stele was likely situated in this chapel. The stele depicted Amenhotep and his wife Mey before the gods Osiris, Ptah, Isis and Hathor. ==References== Category:Officials of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt Category:14th-century BC people Category:Ancient Egyptian high stewards ","title":"Amenhotep (Huy)"},{"id":"19332423","text":"Little Mother is a 1929 Our Gang short silent comedy film directed by Robert F.

It is part of the high ground between Strath Tummel and Glen Errochty. ==Overview== Beinn a‚Äô Chuallaich is a sizeable and extensive hill which can seem quite inconspicuous when viewed from certain places, especially from the south. This is mainly because of the close proximity of the more eye catching and higher Schiehallion which lies seven km to the SE across Dunalastair Water and dominates Strath Tummel. However Beinn a' Chuallaich is well seen from the head of Glen Errochty where it shows its long NE ridge and its craggy eastern corrie. The hill reaches a height of 892 metres (2926 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn. ==Etymology== The hill's name translates from the Scottish Gaelic language as ‚ÄúHill of the Herding‚Äù and this refers to the fact that it lies on the route of one of the main north-south ancient drovers' roads of Scotland, the area around the mountain was used as a gathering point for the cattle.\\"The Call Of The Corbetts\\", Irvine Butterfield, Page 128 Gives details of name translation and meaning. The western corrie of the hill could well have been the collecting point as it is a huge gentle bowl which is ideal for summer grazing and the concealing of cattle.\\"Climbing The Corbetts\\", Hamish Brown, Page 124 Suggests the western corrie could have been where cattle were grazed and geographical info. James Stobie's map of 1770 refers to the hill as Ben Chualach, Charles Knight‚Äôs Penny Cyclopaedia of the 1840s also uses this name and the hill seems to have been designated as Beinn a‚Äô Chuallaich by Victorian cartographers in the second half of the 19th century.\\"Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge\\" (Google Books online) Mentions hill was formerly called Ben Chualach. ==Geography== Beinn a‚Äô Chuallaich's large bulk dominates the village of Kinloch Rannoch and contains several long ridges and two significant corries. The longest of the ridges goes north and then NE taking in the subsidiary top of Meall nan Eun (852 metres) before broadening and descending NE to the shores of Loch Errochty. The top of Meall nan Eun is marked by a ring of stones and gives a fine view of Loch Errochty which is not visible from the main summit. Loch na Caillich stands on this NE ridge at a height of around 700 metres and is a well known gathering point for deer with Charles Plumb describing it as a place ‚Äúwhere the deer love to wallow‚Äù.\\"Walking in the Grampians\\", Charles Plumb, No ISBN, Gives the quote:‚Äúwhere the deer love to wallow‚Äù. Coire Odhar on the eastern side of the hill is ringed by cliffs which fall from the summit, the corrie itself contains some very large detached boulders. The western corrie, known as Coire Labhrainn is drained by the Allt M√≤r which is a fine sight after heavy rain as it roars through the woodland above Kinloch Rannoch and through the village to join the River Tummel. All drainage from the mountain joins the River Tay eventually either going by Glen Errochty or Strath Tummel. Some of the streams on the eastern side of the hill have been diverted into the Errochty catchwater as part of the Tummel hydro- electric power scheme.\\"The Corbetts And Other Scottish Hills\\", Scottish Mountaineering Club, Page 82 Gives geographical and route information. The summit with the large cairn and trig point with Ben Alder in the distance. The three southern ridges are quite steep as they drop away to the valley of the River Tummel. One goes initially west and then south taking in the craggy and rocky slopes of the outlying top of C√†rn Fiaclach. Another ridge goes just east of south descending to Drumglas on the shores of Dunalistair Water and has the crags of Creag Buidhe on its lower slopes. The third of the ridges on the south side of the mountain goes just west of south and is the most interesting of the three as it ends in a steep and spectacular crag which drops to the B846 road just east of Kinloch Rannoch. The crag is known as Craig Varr and is an example of a truncated spur formed in the Earth's last glacial period about 10,000 years ago when the huge glacier flowing east from Rannoch Moor sliced through the ridge descending to the valley and left steep south facing cliffs.www.rannoch.net.

Approaching the summit from the east from the large boulders in Coire Odhar. ==Rock climbing== The crags of Craig Varr are a popular venue for rock climbers being close to the road and parking spots. The schist crags contain around 30 routes from 30 to 50 metres in length, varying in grade from Very Difficult to Very Severe. The crags are south facing, a fact which adds to their popularity, being quick drying and catching plenty of sunshine.www.ukclimbing.com. Gives details of rock climbing on Craig Varr.\\"The Central Highlands\\", Peter Hodgkiss, Page 174 Mentions rock climbing and gives details of hill. ==Ascents and summit== Beinn a‚Äô Chuallaich is usually ascended from the south or the east. From the south there are routes from Kinloch Rannoch and Drumglas. From Kinloch Rannoch the route goes up the Allt M√≤r, passing a fine waterfall before going steep up to the summit ridge. The route from Drumglas is the most direct and utilises the SE ridge. An approach from the east starts from the B847 road at grid reference and goes past a bothy and a deer fence before going steeply up to climb Coire Odhar and reach the summit. Beinn a‚Äô Chuallaich is a fine viewpoint, having a topographic prominence of 527 metres, it is the highest point for some distance with Schiehallion, over seven km to the SE being the only hill to interrupt the distant view. There is a fine full length view of Loch Rannoch and the Ben Alder massif to the NW. The highest point of the hill is marked by an Ordnance Survey trig point but the highlight of the summit is the three-metre-high cairn built from quartzite boulders which stands 20 metres SE of the trig point. ==References== Category:Corbetts Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Central Highlands Category:Mountains and hills of Perth and Kinross Category:Climbing areas of Scotland ","title":"Beinn a' Chuallaich"},{"id":"19332508","text":"Clorinda attacks Tancredi, one of a series by Paolo Domenico FinogliaClorinda Rescues Olindo and Sophronia by Eug√®ne Delacroix, painting in the Neue Pinakothek. Tancredi Baptizing Clorinda by Domenico Tintoretto, c. 1585. Clorinda is a fictional character appearing in Torquato Tasso's poem Jerusalem Delivered, first published in 1581. She is a warrior woman of the Saracen army. First introduced in the second canto of the poem, when she rescues from execution Sofronia and Olindo, two Christian lovers of Jerusalem, she is next discovered under the command of the King of Jerusalem, Aladine, aiding that city's defences, together with the bold knight Argantes. Tancred saw her on the field and fell in love with her, thus refusing to do battle with her. Because of this, a lesser champion was sent out from the Christian hosts, and Clorinda slew him. Erminia, her companion, being herself enamoured of Tancred, then escaped Jerusalem in the guise of Clorinda, purposing to enter the Christian camp, but being surprised by a party of knights without, she fled and was lost in the forests. Tancred falls in love with her in Canto 3. During a night battle in which she sets the Christian siege tower on fire, she is killed by Tancredi, who does not recognise her in her armour and the darkness. She converts to Christianity before dying (Canto 12). The character of Clorinda is inspired in part by Virgil's Camilla and by Bradamante in Ariosto; the circumstances of her birth (a Caucasian girl born to African parents) are modeled on the lead character (Chariclea) from the ancient Greek novel by Heliodorus of Emesa. ==In the arts== Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda is an operatic scena for three voices by Claudio Monteverdi, dramatising the final fight, first performed in 1624, and popular since the revival of interest in early music in the mid-20th century. Though the spate of 18th- century operas based on Tasso mostly covered different parts of the plot, especially the story of Armida, Clorinda was the first contralto role in French opera, in Tancr√®de, a trag√©die en musique of 1702 by composer Andr√© Campra and librettist Antoine Danchet. Clorinda's fight with Tancred and her conversion and death were especially popular subjects for artists.

Its last assignment was with Tactical Air Command, assigned to Twelfth Air Force at George Air Force Base, California, where it was inactivated on 31 March 1991. The division was first activated in October 1957 to command the two North American F-100 Super Sabre wings stationed at George and to provide support for them through its 831st Air Base Group. In 1958, one of its wings converted to the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, While its second wing continued to fly the \\"Hun\\" until moving in 1962, when it was replaced by a Republic F-105 Thunderchief wing. During and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the division deployed F-104s to Florida to augment the air defense forces there. As United States forces in Southeast Asia grew in size the division's F-105s deployed to support combat operations, with its entire F-105 wing moving in 1964. That year, a wing of McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs was organized under the division, although a year later the F-4 wing moved to Thailand, leaving two of its squadrons behind. After 1966, when the division added the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, the primary mission of the division's wings was training replacement fighter and reconnaissance aircrews, primarily for Southeast Asia operations. During the Pueblo Crisis of 1968, the division gained control of a federalized Air National Guard reconnaissance wing for eighteen months. The division inactivated in 1971 and its two wings were transferred directly to Twelfth Air Force. The division was activated again at George in 1980, replacing Tactical Training, George, which had been the headquarters for George's training operations. A few months after the division's activation, F-4 training operations were split, with one wing using F-4Es to train United States and foreign fighter aircrews and the other flying F-4Gs to train Wild Weasel crews. In early 1989, Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci announced that George would be closing. Training operations were consolidated into a single wing and the division was inactivated in 1991 as operations at George were reduced. ==History== F-100s on the ramp at George AFB F-100 era The 831st Air Division was activated at George Air Force Base, California in October 1957 and assigned to Eighteenth Air Force, when the 413th Fighter-Day Wing was activated as Tactical Air Command (TAC)'s second tactical fighter wing there. The 413th joined the 479th Fighter-Day Wing, which had been at George since 1952.The 413th Wing's 413th Fighter-Day Group had been stationed at George since November 1954. Maurer Combat Units, pp. 297‚Äì298. The division drew its initial cadre from the headquarters of the 479th Wing and Col George Laven Jr., the 479th's commander, became the first commander of the division.Ravenstein, pp. 266‚Äì267 The two wings, which flew the North American F-100 Super Sabre, became the division's initial tactical components, while the 831st Air Base Group was assigned to the division to manage support activities at George. Three months after its activation, the division was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force, which moved without personnel or equipment from Germany to replace Eighteenth Air Force. Late in 1958, when Foster Air Force Base, Texas was shutting down operations, the 450th Tactical Fighter Wing was briefly attached to the 831st. F-104s of the 479th Tactical Fighter WingAircraft are Lockheed F-104C-5-LOs from George AFB, California. Taken in 1960. Although the 413th continued to fly the F-100 until it was inactivated, in October 1958 the 479th Wing began to convert to the Vulcan cannon armed Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. A few months later, in March 1959, the 413th Wing and its components were inactivated and its mission, personnel and aircraft transferred to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, which moved to George from Turner Air Force Base, Georgia without personnel or equipment, when TAC transferred Turner to Strategic Air Command.Ravenstein, pp. 222‚Äì223Ravenstein, pp. 34‚Äì37 The 31st Wing moved to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida at the end of May 1962 and was reassigned, ending the Super Sabre era at George. Deployments and contingencies F-105 at George AFBAircraft is F-105G Serial 63-8320 The 831st's time with only a single wing assigned was brief, however, for in July 1962 the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing was organized under the 831st at George and began to equip with the Republic F-105 Thunderchief. The 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron had been activated in April to begin F-105 operations and was transferred from the division to the 355th Wing when the wing was activated. After becoming combat ready with the Thunderchief, the wing began deploying its squadrons to Southeast Asia. The wing itself moved to McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas in December 1964, although most of its fighters had been operating from bases in Thailand and Viet Nam since early 1964.Ravenstein, pp. 189‚Äì191 During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the division deployed a squadron of F-104s to Key West Naval Air Station to augment Navy interceptors there. Following the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba, Air Defense Command (ADC) still maintained a squadron of F-104As at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, primarily to defend against the possibility of Cuban fighter aircraft striking across the Straits of Florida. However, the F-104A was armed only with AIM-9 Sidewinders, which were not effective against fighters, so the Air Force decided to modify these interceptors by adding cannon armament. From February through April 1964, eight of the division's cannon-armed F-104s were dispatched to Homestead to stand alert there while ADC's Starfighters were being modified.McMullen, pp. 22‚Äì23 In 1964, the Air Force implemented Project Clearwater, which withdrew Convair F-102 Delta Daggers from overseas, primarily to reduce military spending abroad, which was causing negative trade balances.The term current at the time for negative balances of trade was \\"gold flow\\". McMullen, p. 60. Although the returning planes were distributed throughout ADC, three interceptor squadrons and the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing were transferred to George on paper to make up a new McDonnell F-4 Phantom II wing.McMullen, pp. 60‚Äì61 Because Phantoms were available before the 8th Wing could be transferred from Itazuke Air Base in July, TAC activated the 32d Tactical Fighter Wing to manage the initial work up with F-4s. When the 8th arrived, the 32d's aircraft and personnel were transferred to it along with the former F-102 squadrons, while the 32d inactivated.Ravenstein, pp. 37‚Äì38 Division F-104s deployed to the Pacific in 1965 to provide air defense of the Taiwan Straits and the northern provinces of South Viet Nam. The 8th Wing moved to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in December 1965,Ravenstein, pp. 20‚Äì22 briefly leaving the 831st with command of a single wing on a single base. However, in April 1966 the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base was assigned to the division. Until it was inactivated in 1971, the 831st would command wings at two bases. Not all Phantoms left George with the 8th Wing's departure, for the 479th added two squadrons to train crews on the F-4 Phantom. 123d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing RF-101 over Asia c. 1968Aircraft is McDonnell RF-101H Voodoo serial 54-1486 from the 165th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. During the Pueblo Crisis, the division's reconnaissance capability was increased when the 123d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing of the Kentucky Air National Guard was called to active duty and moved to Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri along with three National Guard reconnaissance squadrons flying the McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo. The 123d continued on active duty until July 1969, when it returned to its home station at Standiford Field. Fighter and reconnaissance training RF-4C of the 67th Tac Recce WingAircraft is McDonnell RF-4C-27-MC Phantom II serial 65-922, taken in 1970. In addition to participating in deployments with the Starfighter, as soon as it was activated the division's 479th Wing began training foreign air forces on the export versions of the fighter. The 831st became the active duty advisor for training two airlift wings of the Air Force Reserve early in 1965. The 349th Troop Carrier Wing was at Hamilton Air Force Base and the 452d Troop Carrier Wing was at March Air Force Base, both in California, far from the nearest TAC airlift wing, which was located in west Texas.The 516th Troop Carrier Wing was stationed at Dyess Air Force Base. Mueller, p. 121 When the 8th Wing moved to Ubon at the end of 1965, not all Phantoms left George with the 8th Wing's departure, for the 479th added two squadrons to train crews on the F-4 Phantom. These squadrons were initially assigned to the division and attached to the 479th, but in 1968 they were assigned directly to the wing. Three months after the 479th added the two squadrons it began to operate a formal F-4 Replacement Training Unit, winding down its F-104 operations by July 1967. Shortly after its assignment to the 831st, the 67th Wing at Mountain Home assumed the mission of training RF-4 aircrews.Ravenstein, pp. 105‚Äì107 In 1969 the 479th Wing once again began to train airmen from foreign nations, this time training aircrew and maintenance personnel on the Phantom, continuing the training through 1971 when the division was inactivated and its wings were reassigned directly to Twelfth Air Force. Reactivation The division was reactivated in 1980 when it absorbed the mission, personnel and equipment of Tactical Training, George and was assigned the 35th and 37th Tactical Fighter Wings.The 35th Wing was split four months after the division activated, with Wild Weasel operations being transferred to the newly-activated 37th Wing. In addition to maintaining a capability to deploy worldwide, it trained fighter and Wild Weasel aircrews. Wild Weasel aircraft were used to destroy enemy- controlled surface-to-air missiles The Wild Weasel aircraft were initially specially modified F-105s. but the division switched to F-4Gs in 1981. Fighter training was performed with F-4Es and included training for German Air Force crews. In 1985, Detachment 1 (Air Warrior) of the division was activated to act as the liaison with the Commander of the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. The detachment planned, coordinated and controlled close air support for exercises in the Mojave Desert involving all the Army's combat arms. In July, responsibility for Air Warrior was transferred to the division's 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. Air Warrior exercises continued, with aircraft from various TAC wings staging from George for the exercises.For example, in 1989 TAC units flying from George AFB participated in fourteen Air Warrior exercises. Abstract, TAC 1989 History. In early 1989, Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci announced that George Air Force Base was being considered for closure. In October, the 37th Wing shut down its operations at George and both fighter and Wild Weasel training were again consolidated under the 35th Wing. However, closure plans were put on hold in August 1990, when the division deployed personnel and aircraft from the 35th Wing to Southwest Asia in support of Desert Shield and later, Desert Storm. The 831st was inactivated in March 1991 and its remaining responsibilities at George were transferred to the 35th Wing until George closed the following year. ==Lineage== * Established as the 831 Air Division on 26 September 1957 : Activated on 8 October 1957 : Inactivated on 20 April 1971 * Activated on 1 December 1980 : Inactivated on 31 March 1991Lineage, including assignments, stations, components, aircraft and commanders in AFHRA Factsheet 831 Air Division Assignments * Eighteenth Air Force, 8 October 1957 * Twelfth Air Force, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 20 April 1971 * Twelfth Air Force, 1 December 1980 ‚Äì 31 March 1991 Stations * George Air Force Base, California, 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 20 April 1971 * George Air Force Base, California, 1 December 1980 ‚Äì 31 March 1991 Components Wings * 8th Tactical Fighter Wing: 10 July 1964 ‚Äì 8 December 1965 * 31st Tactical Fighter Wing: 15 March 1959 ‚Äì 1 June 1962 * 32d Tactical Fighter Wing: 1 April ‚Äì 25 July 1964 * 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (later 35th Tactical Training Wing, 35 Tactical Fighter Wing): 1 December 1980 ‚Äì 31 March 1991 * 37th Tactical Fighter Wing: 30 March 1981 ‚Äì 5 October 1989 * 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing: 15 April 1966 ‚Äì 20 April 1971 : Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho * 123d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing: 26 January 1968 ‚Äì 9 June 1969 : Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri * 355th Tactical Fighter Wing: 8 July 1962 ‚Äì 21 July 1964 * 413th Fighter-Day Wing (later 413 Tactical Fighter Wing): 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 15 March 1962 * 450th Tactical Fighter Wing: attached 28 August ‚Äì 4 September 1958 : Foster Air Force Base, Texas * 479th Fighter-Day Wing (later 479 Tactical Fighter Wing): 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 20 April 1971 Groups * 831st Air Base Group (later 831st Combat Support Group): 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 8 June 1969, 1 December 1980 ‚Äì 31 March 1991Tactical Air Command General Order 54, 2 October 1957 (activating the group and assigning it to the 831st Air Division) * 831st Medical Group: (see USAF Hospital, George) Squadrons * 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 6 December 1965 ‚Äì 15 May 1968 (attached to 479th Tactical Fighter Wing) * 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 25 April ‚Äì 8 July 1962 * 431st Tactical Fighter Squadron: 6 December 1965 ‚Äì 15 June 1968 (attached to 479th Tactical Fighter Wing) * 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 6 ‚Äì 8 December 1965 (not operational, attached to 479th Tactical Fighter Wing) * 2067th Communications Squadron, 1 October 1990 ‚Äì 31 March 1991 Other * 831st Tactical Hospital: 25 January 1959 ‚Äì 1 July 1969 (replacement of 4452d USAF Hospital by 831st Tactical Hospital) * 4452d USAF Hospital: 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 25 January 1959 * USAF Hospital, George (later 831st Medical Group): 1 December 1980 ‚Äì 31 March 1991 (redesignation of hospital as a group) * USAF Advanced Flying School: 1 July 1962 ‚Äì 1 January 1963The schools were \\"named functions,\\" rather than units.

Though its effects are evident in many reconstructed as well as attested forms, it did not operate in late PIE, having become morphologized (with exceptions reconstructible via the comparative method). It is named for Hungarian linguist Oswald Szemer√©nyi. ==Overview== The rule deleted coda fricatives *s or laryngeals *h‚ÇÅ, *h‚ÇÇ or *h‚ÇÉ (cover symbol *H), with compensatory lengthening occurring in a word-final position after resonants. In other words: : */-VRs/, */-VRH/ > *-VÀêR : */-VRH-/ > *-VR- (no examples of s-deletion can be reconstructed for PIE) ==Morphological effects== The law affected the nominative singular forms of the many masculine and feminine nouns whose stem ended in a resonant: * PIE \\"father\\" > (Ancient Greek pat·∏ór, Sanskrit pitƒÅÃÅ) * PIE \\"parent\\" > (Ancient Greek gen√©t≈çr, Latin genitor) * PIE \\"earth\\" > (Ancient Greek khth·πìn, Sanskrit k·π£a, Hittite te-e-k√°n) The rule also affected the nominative-accusative forms of neuter plural/collective nouns, which ended in : * PIE \\"seeds\\" > > (on n-deletion see below) Also in the third-person plural perfect ending: * PIE */-ers/ (the third-person plural perfect ending) > *-ƒìr (Latin ƒìr-e, Hittite -er, -ir) Compare: * PIE \\"word\\" > (Latin verbum) ==Further effects== According to another synchronic PIE phonological rule, word-final *n was deleted after *≈ç, usually by the operation of Szemer√©nyi's law: * PIE \\"dog\\" > > (Sanskrit ≈õ(u)vƒÅÃÅ, Old Irish c√∫) The PIE reconstruction for \\"heart\\" is the single instance where *d is deleted after *r, with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. It is not clear whether that is an isolated example or a part of a broader process such as Szemer√©nyi's law. * PIE \\"heart\\" > (Ancient Greek k√™r, Hittite ker) ==Exceptions== Some cases were apparently not affected by Szemer√©nyi's law: * The accusative plural *-ons of thematic nominals. * The genitive singular of stems ending in sonorants, such as *d√©ms \\"of the house\\" (fossilised in the phrase *dems potis \\"master of the house\\"). * Secondary 2nd person singular verb ending *-s with verbs ending in sonorants, such as *g ∑√©ms (from the root *g ∑em- \\"to step, to come\\"). ==Morphologization== In PIE, the resulting long vowels had already begun to spread analogically to other nominative singular forms that were not phonologically justified by the law (PIE 'foot'). The word-final sonorants other than *-n were sometimes dropped as well, which demonstrates that this law was already morphologized in the period of \\"PIE proper\\", and the long vowel produced was no longer synchronically viewed as the outcome of a process of fricative deletion. Exceptions to Szemer√©nyi's law are found in word-final: * PIE \\"woman\\" > (Old Irish b√©) but also *g ∑√©nh‚ÇÇ (Sanskrit j√°ni) as well as medial positions: * PIE *gen- > Sanskrit janman, PIE *genh‚ÇÅ- > Sanskrit j√°nitrƒ´ The forms without a laryngeal are considered to be more archaic and were likely to have been lexicalized at a later stage of PIE. ==See also== * Stang's law ==References== * * * Category:Sound laws Category:Proto-Indo-European language ","title":"Szemer√©nyi's law"},{"id":"19332610","text":"Holy Rood Church, Ossington is a parish church in the Church of England in Ossington, Nottinghamshire.

It is an adaptation in modern English of William Shakespeare's play Othello. It was scripted by Andrew Davies and directed by Geoffrey Sax. == Plot == The film is narrated by Ben Jago, a corrupt police detective who is prepared to manipulate those around him to get what he wants, even the people he loves. After the Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Sinclair Carver is caught using racist language he is forced to resign. The Home Secretary and Prime Minister choose John Othello, a black policeman, to be the next Commissioner as a publicity stunt after a reporter praises him for ending a riot. Jago, Carver's second-in-command, feels that Othello stole his chance to become Commissioner himself, as he had been the favourite for the job. Jago plots to take revenge on Othello by ruining his life and driving him out of his new job. Jago posts on a neo-Nazi website about Othello's marriage to Dessie Brabant, a wealthy white woman, leading her to be attacked in the street. When Othello asks Jago to lend him a man to look after her during the day Jago suggests Michael Cass, an attractive inspector and known womanizer, to look after Dessie. Jago also seduces Dessie's best friend, Lulu, to try to get information about Dessie's past and her relationship with Cass. During this time, Othello has Jago look into the death of Billy Coates, a black drug addict, who was battered to death by three policemen claiming it was self-defense. He discovers, via PC Alan Roderick, that the three policemen actually went to Coates' flat with the intention of attacking him. Jago sympathises with Roderick and offers protection in return for him testifying against the other three policemen. Upon discovering this Othello is given all the credit. Furious that he has once again been overlooked by Othello, Jago decides to ruin the case. Roderick is called to give evidence at the trial causing the other policemen to rebuff him. The day he is called to trial he is found dead from an overdose, and it is suggested that Jago overdosed Roderick with alcohol, knowing he was on anti-depressants. Jago offers to take the blame, but Othello refuses, telling him that he is the \\"only person [he] can trust.\\" Through Jago's prompting and several misunderstandings between Dessie and Cass, Othello begins to become paranoid that Dessie is having an affair. Jago suggests they use DNA to test whether Dessie and Cass sleeping together. During a televised interview Othello has a breakdown and even attacks Cass in a car park. Jago starts to feel guilty, but decides that it is out of his hands. Nonetheless he tells Othello that he got the DNA tests back, confirming that Dessie is having an affair. That night Othello returns home to confront her. When Dessie denies it Othello kills her (via smothering) in a fit of anger. Worried when they don't get a response at the door, Jago and Lulu break into the flat to find Dessie dead. Jago tells Othello that the tests were negative and Dessie was innocent. Realising that he had been manipulated, Othello asks Jago why he did it, to which Jago states that Othello took what was his; despite everything, however, Jago states that he still loves Othello and always will. Jago and Lulu wait outside for the police to arrive when Othello commits suicide. Shortly after the Home Secretary and Prime Minister decide to choose a more reliable pair of hands for the Commissioner, choosing Jago. The film ends with Jago stating that it wasn't about race or politics but love, \\"simple as that.\\" == Cast == {  - ! Character in the play Othello !! Character in Othello (2001) !!

Firstly, is his failure to be promoted and jealousy over Othello's high position, which he feels should be his. Finally, the film adopts a modern idea of the 21st century proposed at the time, inferring that the relationship between Othello and Iago is one of repressed homosexuality. Jago states that \\"It was about love, simple as that\\". This could be taken as a double meaning: 1.) Being the love between Othello and Dessie, and 2.) The repressed love Jago has for Othello. This is further hinted at by his refusal to let Lulu masturbate him during their foreplay, and his stating that \\"[He] loved [Othello] too\\". == External links == * Category:2001 television films Category:2001 films Category:British television films Category:British films Category:English- language films Category:ITV television dramas Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Films based on Othello Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax Category:Television shows based on plays Category:Peabody Award- winning broadcasts Category:London Weekend Television shows ","title":"Othello (2001 film)"},{"id":"19332682","text":"Stewart the Rat is a graphic novel written by Steve Gerber, penciled by Gene Colan, and inked by Tom Palmer.

However, the culture of the Southern and Chesapeake Colonies was different from that of the Northern and Middle Colonies and from that of their common British colonial power. ==Colonial economics== Agriculture Though indigo and rice were also grown, the demand for tobacco and the ease with which it grew turned tobacco into the largest cash crop for the Chesapeake and southern colonies. The desirable niche that tobacco held in the world market resulted in great prosperity for the regions in which it was grown. As agriculture grew in importance in the southern economy, the demand for more workers grew as well. Early on, labor shortages were solved temporarily by indentured servitude; however, this system eventually proved inefficient. Because Native Americans proved independent and difficult to enslave for forced cultivation and indentured servants were only temporary, growers in the South turned to African slave importation to meet their demand for labor. These slaves left a lasting impact upon southern agricultural techniques as well as social aspects of southern society. The family was also affected by the change also, because the need for slaves. Trade Tobacco products, lumber, grain and boats. Local The local economy in the Balls and southern colonies was characterized by the headright, the right to receive of land for any immigrant who settled in Virginia or paid for the transportation of an immigrant who settled in Virginia ( per head). This was intended to promote settlement and ownership of small farms by several immigrants, from which staple crops such as indigo, rice, and especially tobacco could be grown for profit.http://www.lva.va.us/whatwehave/local/va4_headrights.htm Social standing was determined by how much wealth a person had. The best way to get more of it was to acquire more land for more cultivation. Since bringing over indentured servants was the easiest way get more land, it became a popular for wealthy planters to bring in the indentured servants in mass numbers. Also on the rise was the selling and buying of land, due to the fact that captains of ships sold the land that they received every time they landed with a load of indentured servants. This caused the development of large plantations near the Atlantic Coast and little urban activity, as the small farms were forced to live in the back country where Indian relations were volatile.\\"Colonial Class Structure\\", American Issues So it was because of all these effects from the Headright that made the local economy largely rural. As a result, the society became polarized between those who owned large tracts of land near the Atlantic and people whose land was subject to Indian attack as well as former indentured servants who could not afford the favored land . And of course it did not help that, since tobacco prices were unstable from the Navigation Acts, there was a prolonged economic depression. One outcome of this polarized society and economic depravity was Bacon's Rebellion, where farmers, wanting the unused Indian lands, attacked the local tribes and the government. This led to a shift in buying more slaves from Africa, as they did not all speak the same language, making them much easier to control. The local economy polarized the society from the Atlantic Coast plantation owners to the small scale farmers who wanted the unused Indian land. Global Global trade in the Chesapeake and southern colonies was mainly centered on the products of their agriculture. Cash crops like tobacco, rice, and indigo were the areas main exports. The deerskin trade was also a major factor in the economic growth of Charleston, South Carolina, which exported an average of 54,000 deer skins per year between 1699 and 1715. Most of these exports were headed to Britain, whose Navigation Acts restricted trade with other countries. Tobacco, rice, and indigo, which were enumerated products, could only be traded to Britain which had advantages and disadvantages. Obvious disadvantages would be that trade could only occur with one country, eliminating hundreds of thousands of possible buyers. Fortunately, growing demand for these products meant a ready market with mostly escalating prices.The Early Modern Atlantic Economy.Cambridge University Press. Since the demand for all of these products continued to grow, farmers found themselves with a little extra money around. Thus, slave importing began to grow and grow and grow until Charleston was a leading importer in slaves. These slaves led to increased production, increased profit, and a decrease of payment for workers. All of this moneymaking allowed farmers to buy more slaves to continue the cycle. Slaves brought their African knowledge which aided the development of rice and indigo growing. The diversifying of agriculture was key to avoid economic slumps that could have resulted from the fluctuating tobacco prices. The slaves also completed the trading process known as Triangle trade. The south and Chesapeake's point of the triangle involved the import of slaves from Africa, and the exporting of tobacco and other goods to England.Colonial Society and Economy. Cliffsnotes.com The agricultural society affected which items southern colonists exported. Slaves imported into the society influenced which crops would be grown and therefore which crops would be exported. Slave's usefulness and the economic gain to be had by using them also increased the number of Africans that were imported. All of the economic success that resulted from these trading tendencies led to a bigger rich-poor gap in society as the rich became richer and bought more slaves to get even more money. Growth of the wealthy class in turn led to the importing of more luxuries to the region as families began to show off their success. At the beginning of the 18th century, global trade of the southern colonies was changing a lot about their society. ==Social issues== Religion Protestant Christianity was the predominant religion in the Chesapeake colonies until the late 19th century. Class hierarchy Much like the old world, colonial America was divided into a rigid social structure. Pedigree mattered more than anything, and wealthy, English families stood at the top of the social ladder. These families often controlled vast numbers of workers as well. These workers, the African American Slaves, were the lowliest of those living in the colonies, standing below even the indentured workers who powered much of the new world.History of the United States of America, Henry Elson Next, predictably, were these same indentured servants, men who were offered passage to America in return for years of labor. Though some were honest men, wishing to scrape out a new life in the new world, many of these men were criminals, waifs, and convicts, sent to the new world as punishment. The largest social class in the South and Chesapeake regions were the merchants, vendors, and small farmers of the colonies. These people were the rank and file citizens, moderately educated and skilled, but willing to work hard and create the America they needed.\\"Population and Social Rank\\", www.usahistory.info Finally, at the top of the social ladder stood old, wealthy English families, clergymen, magistrates and large land holders in America. In this class, etiquette was rigidly enforced; no one was allowed to \\"dress above their station\\" and were forced to sit in church according to their own social standing. Dr. Alexander Hamilton (1712 ‚Äì 1756) was a Scottish-born doctor and writer who lived and worked in Annapolis, Maryland. Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary Gentleman's Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton is \\"the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America.\\" J.A. Leo Lemay, Men of Letters in Colonial Maryland (1972) p 229. Slavery In the early 17th century, Americans in Virginia and Maryland discovered tobacco to be very profitable. A lot of land was given to tobacco plantations because there was such a high demand for the good in Europe. Before the 17th century indentured servants were used to cultivate the land, but soon the new world's appeal to potential indentured servants decrease because the land grants they were formerly promised were no longer available. Therefore, plantation owners began to import slaves from Africa to do the work. The slaves were taken from their families in Africa and worked all day cultivating, drying leaves, and packing the tobacco. Many slaves tried to escape from their owners but very few succeeded. Generally they were taken back to the plantation and whipped hundreds of times or castrated as punishment. Carolina was a slave colony upon conception. Experienced slaves were brought from Africa to cultivate rice and indigo. By the 18th century the slave population outnumbered the white population. Lawmakers feared the growing African population, so they began to enforce restrictions on the number of black people that were imported. Another way they controlled the population was executing slaves convicted of violence against a white. http://students.ou.edu/H/Mark.A.Hall-1/tippowerpoint.ppt#256,1,Growth of Slavery in the Chesapeake ==Georgia== Founded in 1733 as a model yeoman society, slavery was prohibited. James Oglethorpe, one of the Georgia Trustees strongly resisted pressure from South Carolina to introduce slavery (late in life Oglethorpe was closely associated with Granville Sharp and other leading abolitionists). However, by 1749 powerful South Carolina interests and their allies had clandestinely brought so many slaves into Georgia that the Georgia Trustees were unable to stem the tide. The young colony soon became a satellite of South Carolina, and in a few years had 15,000 enslaved black people working on the plantations.Wilson, Thomas D. The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond. Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia Press, 2012. Chapter 3. == Carolina == Carolina was a slave colony upon conception. Experienced slaves were brought from Africa to cultivate rice and indigo. By the early 18th century the slave population outnumbered the white population. Immigration The first successful settlement in the Chesapeake, Jamestown (1607), was set up by the Virginia Company and therefore its population was made up mostly of English. Because of its large reliance on labor for tobacco plantations that fueled the economy, the Chesapeake relied on indentured servants to work the land. However, after the events of Bacon's Rebellion plantation owners began to find slaves to be a better investment than indentured servants. This was a gradual shift by the 18th century but by 1750 the population of Virginia had skyrocketed to 450,000 and was almost evenly divided between African and European peoples.Dictionary of American History, Third Edition Maryland was established by George Calvert as a refuge for Roman Catholics. Although it was intended as a refuge for Catholics a significant part of the population was Protestants and Protestants gained control of the colony during the English Civil Wars.Dictionary of American History, Third Edition Carolina, originally one colony, later divided into North and South Carolina due to influences by immigrants. While North Carolina adopted the practices and economy of Virginia due to similar environmental set up and immigrant ethnicity, South Carolina developed differently because of the large influx of immigrants from Barbados. This diversity then led to their split with time. By the early 18th century the English government had restricted the immigration of English people to the colonies which caused a growing number of Scotch-Irish and Germans to emigrate. These people tended to settle in the back country and away from the more developed coastal areas.The World Book Encyclopedia Families The husband was master of his household and expected to earn a living for his family. A woman's place was at home or helping her husband. Except for children of the elite, all others were expected to work by age 11 or 12. Although slave marriages were not legally recognized, slaves ‚Äì particularly females ‚Äì did what they could to Urban and rural structure Most large population centers in colonial America were located in New England or the Middle Colonies. In the Chesapeake Bay area cities included only Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, Virginia, in the Chesapeake region, and in the southern colonies, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. These cities served as major seaports for the colonies in their trade with Europe, African, and the Caribbean. They were highly stratified by wealth. In the Chesapeake and Southern regions, society was based heavily on agriculture, and therefore the landscape was much more rural. A large portion of land in the South was frontier \\"back country\\" that was less settled and abutted Indian land. The agricultural land was organized into a plantation system: a manorial structure in which a gentry of landed aristocrats (most of whom were successful early settlers to the region) owned the plantation. Bondspeople worked the land. These workers were indentured servants or, increasingly as the trade became more established, African slaves. Slaves made up a large percentage of the South's population. The remainder of the population was those who were neither landed gentry nor slaves. These colonists (who were not only British‚Äîor of British descent‚Äîbut also German and Scots-Irish) farmed small plots of land which they owned. This group, collectively known as yeoman farmers, constituted the majority of European colonists in the South and the Chesapeake areas.Carr, Lois Green. Robert Cole's World: Agriculture and Society in Early Maryland. Chapel Hill 1991 In the upland country, most free European settlers had similar conditions of wealth and were not as stratified as in the cities.Norton, Mary, and David Katzman. A People and a Nation. 7th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2005. ==Colonial politics== Government systems The first democratically elected government was the House of Burgesses, which was first convened in 1619 by Governor George Yeardley in Virginia. The House of Burgesses, as with most colonial assemblies, was elected by free, white, landowning men. US History Encyclopedia: Colonial Assemblies Both the southern colonies and those in the Chesapeake had a similar government: a governor and a council appointed by the crown, and an assembly or house of representatives that was elected by the people. The governor had the most power of any, his duties including judicial, religious, military, appointing officials, leader of legislature, but no power over public funds. The council generally consisted of 12 upper class residents of their colony. Assembly was the only branch with the power over funds and taxation, and it used this power as leverage over the governor to occasionally steal his power. As much power as the governor had, the ability of the assembly to exert power over the British-appointed governor led was a display of the division between the colonies and their mother country.History of the USA: Colonial Government Bacon's Rebellion, likewise, showed how much influence the people could exert over their government when they disagreed with what the upper class in the government decided. The government was generally run by the rich plantation owners who already had enough land and just wanted to avoid conflict, so the poor free men rebelled by holding the House of Burgesses hostage. While succeeding for a while, the rebellion fell apart when Nathaniel Bacon died, though it still left a reminder of how much influence the average settler had in early American government. British influence As satellites of the British Empire, the Chesapeake region and the southern colonies were subject to the powerful influences of their home country. While the British impacted many aspects of American culture, the political prestige and power of the British Empire perhaps had the strongest effect of all. The political structure of the Southern Colonies and the Chesapeake region and the manner of the different American political figures reflected the structure of the British Government. When the Southern and Chesapeake colonies were first settled, they encountered numerous obstacles including conflicts with the natives. These conflicts led to the appointing of Royal Governors by the King.The Southern Colonies in the Seventeenth Century (Outline). Marlyce. These governors resembled the King and kept order throughout the colonies. However, many of the traits of local governments remained intact. In 1660, the King tightened up the royal government's hold in the colonies due to uprisings throughout the South and the Chesapeake region.Norton, Mary, and David Katzman. A People and a Nation. 7th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2005. The power of the Royal Government grew and they were soon in control of their trade. New laws were passed along with the Navigation Acts, and Vice Admiralty Courts were also established to prevent biased judging towards colonists. As the \\"owners\\" of the Southern and Chesapeake colonies, Great Britain imposed its will upon the region and established control by intervening in legislative affairs. It appointed officials to run each section and they served as rulers away from home. New laws also forced the colonies to change the way they managed their government and economy. While the colonies were separated geographically from their homeland, the powerful political influence of the King and Parliament greatly affected their politics. ==See also== *Colonial history of the United States, including French and Spanish colonization in the South *Middle Colonies * Atlantic Creole * Bristol slave trade * Chesapeake Colonies * Slavery in the colonial history of the United States * Tobacco colonies ==References== Category:Colonial United States (British) Category:Chesapeake Bay Category:Colonial Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Colonial Maryland Category:Colonial North Carolina Category:Colonial South Carolina Category:Colonial Virginia Category:English colonization of the Americas Category:History of the Thirteen Colonies Category:History of the Southern United States ","title":"Colonial South and the Chesapeake"},{"id":"19332735","text":"Rafael V√°squez Santiago is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.

It collaborates with award-winning artists to produce exhibitions of their artwork that are distinctive, appealing to museum visitors of all ages, and of the highest quality. In addition to this unique artistic partnership, following its debut at the NCCIL gallery each exhibition travels to museums, public libraries, and galleries nationwide. The NCCIL hosts FREE Family Fun art workshops on Saturday afternoons, summer art camps and has an extensive docent-led school tour program. NCCIL was begun through the effort of former Mayor Gary D. McCaleb, an administrator at Abilene Christian University. In December 1993, former Abilene mayor Dr. Gary McCaleb was invited to a local elementary school to read William Joyce‚Äôs Santa Calls. Inspired to learn that Joyce had set his story in Abilene, Dr. McCaleb invited Joyce to speak at a Cultural Affairs Council luncheon and when the two men met, they formed an immediate friendship. From this meeting a concept originated of a place that would honor the artwork of children‚Äôs illustrators. In March 1997, the National Center for Children's Illustrated Literature was incorporated as a non-profit organization, and a statue depicting the children from Santa Calls, \\"Childhood's Great Adventure\\" by Rick Jackson, was erected downtown.

Interlac and marriage  Tom joined the Legion fan club The Legion Outpost, and then the Legion amateur press association Interlac, where he met fellow member Gilmore, who had joined the APA around the same time. Through Interlac, the two struck up a relationship. Gilmore lived in California, and as Bierbaum had designs on getting into the entertainment industry, he moved out West, and the two began living together, eventually getting married.Broertjes, Harry. \\"The History of Interlac (and Legion fandom, too!),\\" Interlac APA website. Accessed September 15, 2008. Early on in their relationship, the Bierbaums wrote stories together, their first published piece being a Halloween-themed short story for a local newspaper. (The story was actually a thinly veiled Legion of Super-Heroes story with the characters' names and situations changed.) They also submitted and published articles and stories in Interlac, which attracted the attention of veteran Legion artist Keith Giffen and future Legion editor Mark WaidHaeleury, Michael. \\"A Preview Of DC's New Legion of Super-Heroes,\\" Amazing Heroes #172, (Oct. 1989). Accessed September 28, 2008. (both of whom were also Interlac members).  Keith Giffen and early writing work  Recognizing the Bierbaum's devotion to the Legion, Giffen contacted them, at first using them as a sounding board for his ideas about the Legion. Giffen also utilized a new costume idea for Element Lad that Tom suggested. In 1984, when Giffen was looking for a scripter for his \\"Lightning\\" stories in Deluxe Comics' Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, he recruited the husband and wife writing team for the job. That, along with their work for DC's New Talent Showcase editor Sal Amendola, convinced the editors at DC (specifically Dick Giordano) that they were ready to become Legion scripters.  Legion of Super-Heroes: \\"Five Years Later\\" The Bierbaums wrote the first fifty issues of Legion of Super- Heroes vol. 4, from 1989‚Äì1993, except for the main Story in issues 21-24, written solo by Al Gordon. Working under editor Waid and alongside Giffen and Al Gordon (who was a co-writer and inker on the book) for the first 36 issues, the Bierbaums dialogued the \\"Five Years Later\\" storyline. The revival of the title was controversial with many longtime Legion fans, as it incorporated several major \\"retcons,\\" including the editorially-mandated excision of Superboy from Legion history; the housing of Proty's consciousness in Lightning Lad's body; and the revelation that former Science Police liaison Shvaughn Erin was actually a formerly male transsexual who used drugs to maintain her female identity, while her longtime beau Element Lad was of ambiguous sexuality and would not have required her to be female. The team created Devlin O'Ryan and Kono_(comics) for the Legion. After Giffen's departure, the Bierbaums continued on the title for another year, overseeing the return of several classic characters, until leaving for Legionnaires (a spin-off title) after Legion issue #50 (November 1993). They wrote Legionnaires for its first 15 issues, until 1994. The Bierbaums and Giffen also worked together on DC's short-lived offbeat title The Heckler in 1992‚Äì1993.  Image and other publishers  After their DC work, the Bierbaums went on to write various titles for Image Comics, including Supreme, SuperPatriot, Youngblood: Strikefile, and Star, as well as Xena: Warrior Princess and Jurassic Park for Topps Comics. Most recently, they worked on Wonderlanders for Oktomica and StormQuest for Caliber Comics.

It is a comedy with several erotic touches, where the protagonist Banji Suke (or Sukeban) has to disguise himself as a girl in order to be able to attend an all-female school to try and clear his name after being left the blame for the chaos all over town, while unaware that his assassins are watching his every move. As Suke Ban is a rebellious boy, this situation creates several comedic troubles. The manga was adapted to an OVA in 1992, and was released by ADV Films in the US under the name Delinquent in Drag.

The team was coached by Randy Edsall and played its home games at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut. ==ScheduleGame summaries== Hofstra Making their 2008 season debut, the Huskies came out strong scoring 14 points in each of the first two quarters en route to a 35-3 victory against FCS opponent Hofstra. In the game, Donald Brown rushed for 150 yards and four touchdowns before giving way to Robbie Frey who added a score of his own. UConn also extended their home winning streak to 8 games extending back to last season. Temple As UConn took the show on the road, conditions were less than ideal as Hurricane Hanna (in a weakened state) made her presence felt in Philadelphia. The game which was billed by Temple as UConn/Temple II didn't really live up to the hype of the controversial game last year. In a game which was largely played within the 20s, Donald Brown rushed for a career-high 214 yards, and the game-winning touchdown in overtime. Place kicker Tony Ciaravino added two field goals to give UConn their twelve-point total for the day. Virginia Junior tailback Donald Brown rushed for over 200 yards for the second consecutive week and senior quarterback Tyler Lorenzen had a terrific game running the Connecticut offense as the Huskies manhandled Virginia, 45-10, in a non-conference football game played before a sellout crowd of 40,000 at Rentschler Field. Baylor Junior tailback Donald Brown scored on a three-yard run with 6:04 remaining in the fourth quarter and the Connecticut defense held Baylor on fourth down with less than a minute to play as the Huskies hung on to defeat the Bears, 31-28, before a crowd of 38,870 at Rentschler Field. Louisville The Huskies took the show on the road to start a very long, and potentially very rewarding three game road trip. The defense for UConn was less than stellar allowing 508 yards of offense, almost double their own output. The shining light for the Huskies was Donald Brown, who rushed for 190 yards and a touchdown. When he was given the ball, he made things happen time and time again. The injury bug also hit the Huskies and hit them hard. Starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen suffered a broken foot early in the second quarter paving the way for Notre Dame transfer Zach Frazier to take over the helm. Later in the third quarter, senior tight end Steve Brouse suffered a broken fibula. Despite the injuries to two of their senior offensive leaders, the Huskies rallied late behind Frazier and two way player Darius Butler. Trailing by one point with 2:45 left in the game, Linebacker Lawrence Wilson picked off Cardinal's quarterback Hunter Cantwell and went 45 yards the other way to put UConn up 26-21, with the two-point conversion being unsuccessful. The UConn defense held strong on the ensuing possession, sealing the victory, and the Huskies second consecutive 5-0 start. ==International Bowl== The Huskies had a great season and were invited to their third bowl game in school history for the second straight year. On January 3, 2009 they played the University of Buffalo Bulls in the International Bowl in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Huskies started off committing sloppy turnovers in the first half but would go on to win the game 38-20. Steve Brouse caught the only touchdown pass of the game while running back Donald Brown rushed for 261 yards on 29 carries and one touchdown. He was named the MVP of the game and after the game he decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. ==2009 Draft== Four players on the 2008 UConn football team were selected in the 2009 NFL Draft on April 25, 2009. Donald Brown was selected at #27 by the Indianapolis Colts, Darius Butler was selected by the New England Patriots at #41, Will Beatty and Cody Brown were selected late in the 2nd round at #60 (Will Beatty, New York Giants) and #63 (Cody Brown, Arizona Cardinals). After the Draft, four other Huskies signed free agent contracts with NFL Teams. Those Huskies include: Julius Williams (Jacksonville Jaguars), Dahna Deleston (Chicago Bears), Tyler Lorenzen (Jacksonville Jaguars), and Keith Gray (Carolina Panthers) On May 2, 2009, Senior Martin B√©dard was taken in the second round of the CFL Canadian Football League Draft by the Montreal Alouettes ==Rankings== {  style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" + Ranking Movement - !

Yellow denotes areas conquered by the Normans in the 11th century. Green denotes areas subjected to Viking raids. Viking expansion is the process by which Norse explorers, traders and warriors, the latter known in modern scholarship as Vikings, sailed most of the North Atlantic, reaching south to North Africa and east to Russia, Constantinople and the Middle East as looters, traders, colonists and mercenaries. Vikings under Leif Erikson, the heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up a short-lived settlement in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. Longer lasting and more established settlements were formed in Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Great Britain, Ireland and Normandy. It is debated whether the term Viking represents all Norse settlers or just those who raided.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 3. ==Motivation for expansion== There is much debate among historians about what drove the Viking expansion. Researchers have suggested that Vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands. The concept was expressed in the 11th century by historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his semi-imaginary History of The Normans. Rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines, these polygynous relationships may have led to a shortage of eligible women for the average Viking male. Due to this, the average Viking man could have been forced to perform riskier actions to gain wealth and power to be able to find suitable women. Viking men would often buy or capture women and make them into their wives or concubines. Polygynous marriage increases male-male competition in society because it creates a pool of unmarried men who are willing to engage in risky status-elevating and sex- seeking behaviors. The Annals of Ulster states that in 821 the Vikings plundered an Irish village and \\"carried off a great number of women into captivity\\". Another theory is that it was a quest for retaliation against continental Europeans for their previous invasions of Viking homelands, such as Charlemagne's campaign to force Scandinavian pagans to convert to Christianity by killing any who refused to become baptized.Bruno Dum√©zil, master of Conference at Paris X-Nanterre, Normalien, aggregated history, author of Conversion and freedom in the barbarian kingdoms, 5th ‚Äì 8th centuries (Fayard, 2005)\\"Franques Royal Annals\\" cited in Peter Sawyer, The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings, 2001, p. 20.Dictionnaire d'histoire de France ‚Äì Perrin ‚Äì Alain Decaux and Andr√© Castelot. 1981. pp. 184‚Äì85 .Les vikings : Histoire, mythes, dictionnaire R.

Those who favor this explanation point out that the penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia caused serious conflict and divided Norway for almost a century.History of the Kings of Norway by Snorri Sturlusson translated by Professor of History Fran√ßois-Xavier Dillmann, Gallimard pp. 15‚Äì16, 18, 24, 33, 34, 38. However, the first target of Viking raids was not the Frankish Kingdom, but Christian monasteries in England. According to the historian Peter Sawyer, these were raided because they were centers of wealth and their farms well-stocked, not because of any religious reasons. A depiction of Vikings kidnapping a woman. Viking men often kidnapped foreign women for marriage or concubinage from lands that they had pillaged. Illustrated by French painter √âvariste Vital Luminais in the 19th century. A different idea is that the Viking population had exceeded the agricultural potential of their homeland. This may have been true of western Norway, where there were few reserves of land, but it is unlikely that the rest of Scandinavia was experiencing famine. Alternatively, some scholars propose that the Viking expansion was driven by a youth bulge effect: Because the eldest son of a family customarily inherited the family's entire estate, younger sons had to seek their fortune by emigrating or engaging in raids. Peter Sawyer suggests that most Vikings emigrated due to the attractiveness of owning more land rather than the necessity of having it. However, no rise in population, youth bulge, or decline in agricultural production during this period has been definitively demonstrated. Nor is it clear why such pressures would have prompted expansion overseas rather than into the vast, uncultivated forest areas in the interior of the Scandinavian Peninsula, although perhaps emigration or sea raids may have been easier or more profitable than clearing large areas of forest for farm and pasture in a region with a limited growing season. It is also possible that a decline in the profitability of old trade routes drove the Vikings to seek out new, more profitable ones. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia may have suffered after the Roman Empire lost its western provinces in the 5th century, and the expansion of Islam in the 7th century may have reduced trade opportunities within western Europe by redirecting resources along the Silk Road. Trade in the Mediterranean was at its lowest level in history when the Vikings began their expansion. The Viking expansion opened new trade routes in Arab and Frankish lands, and took control of trade markets previously dominated by the Frisians after the Franks destroyed the Frisian fleet. Settlement demographics Guests from Overseas (1901) by Nicholas Roerich, depicting a Viking raid. (Varangians in Rus') Viking settlements in Ireland and Great Britain are thought to have been primarily male enterprises; however, some graves show nearly equal male/female distribution. Disagreement is partly due to method of classification; previous archaeology often guessed biological sex from burial artifacts, whereas modern archaeology may use osteology to find biological sex, and isotope analysis to find origin (DNA sampling is usually not possible).Shane McLeod. \\"Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD\\" 18 Jul 2011. Early Medieval Europe, Volume 19, Issue 3, pp. 332‚Äì53, August 2011. Web PDF Quote:\\"These results, six female Norse migrants and seven male, should caution against assuming that the great majority of Norse migrants were male, despite the other forms of evidence suggesting the contrary.\\"G. Halsall, \\"The Viking presence in England? The burial evidence reconsidered\\" in D. M. Hadley and J. Richards, eds, Cultures in Contact: Scandinavian Settlement in England in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries (Brepols: Turnhout, 2000), pp. 259‚Äì76. . The males buried during that period in a cemetery on the Isle of Man had mainly names of Norse origin, while the females there had names of indigenous origin. Irish and British women are mentioned in old texts on the founding of Iceland, indicating that the Viking explorers were accompanied there by women from the British Isles who either came along voluntarily or were taken along by force. Genetic studies of the population in the Western Isles and Isle of Skye also show that Viking settlements were established mainly by male Vikings who mated with women from the local populations of those places. However, not all Viking settlements were primarily male. Genetic studies of the Shetland population suggest that family units consisting of Viking women as well as men were the norm among the migrants to these areas.Roger Highfield, \\"Vikings who chose a home in Shetland before a life of pillage\\", Telegraph, 7 Apr 2005, accessed 12 Dec 2012 This may be because areas like the Shetland Islands, being closer to Scandinavia, were more suitable targets for family migrations, while frontier settlements further north and west were more suitable for groups of unattached male colonizers. ==Britain and Ireland== England Map of England in 878, depicting the Danelaw territory King Canute's territories 1014‚Äì1035. (Note that the Norwegian lands of Jemtland, Herjedalen, Idre and S√¶rna are not included in this map). During the reign of King Beorhtric of Wessex (786‚Äì802) three ships of \\"Northmen\\" landed at Portland Bay in Dorset. The local reeve mistook the Vikings for merchants and directed them to the nearby royal estate, but the visitors killed him and his men. The earliest recorded planned Viking raid, on 6 January 793, targeted the monastery on the island of Lindisfarne, off the north-east coast of Northumbria. According to the 12th- century Anglo-Norman chronicler Symeon of Durham, the raiders killed the resident monks or threw them into the sea to drown or carried them away as slavesalong with some of the church treasures. In 875, after enduring eight decades of repeated Viking raids, the monks fled Lindisfarne, carrying the relics of Saint Cuthbert with them. In 794, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a small Viking fleet attacked a rich monastery at Jarrow. The Vikings met with stronger resistance than they had expected: their leaders were killed. The raiders escaped, only to have their ships beached at Tynemouth and the crews killed by locals. This represented one of the last raids on England for about 40 years. The Vikings focused instead on Ireland and Scotland. In 865, a group of hitherto uncoordinated bands of predominantly Danish Vikings joined together to form a large army and landed in East Anglia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described this force as the mycel h√¶√æen here (Great Heathen Army) and went on to say that it was led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan Ragnarsson. Compare: The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Manuscript B: Cotton Tiberius A.vi. Retrieved 12 September 2013. The entry for 867 refers to the Great Heathen Army: mycel h√¶√æen here Compare: pp. 9‚Äì11, 53‚Äì54 The army crossed the Midlands into Northumbria and captured York (Jorvik). In 871, the Great Heathen army was reinforced by what was known as the Great Summer Army, one of its leaders was Guthrum. In 875, the Great Heathen Army split into two bands, with Guthrum leading one back to Wessex, and Halfdan taking his followers north. Then in 876, Halfdan shared out Northumbrian land amongst his men, who \\"ploughed the land and supported themselves\\"; this land was part of what became known as the Danelaw. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings, but King Alfred of Wessex defeated Guthrum's army at the Battle of Edington in 878. There followed the Treaty of Wedmore the same year and the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886. These treaties formalised the boundaries of the English kingdoms and the Viking Danelaw territory, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. Despite these treaties, conflict continued on and off. However, Alfred and his successors eventually drove back the Viking frontier and retook York. A new wave of Vikings appeared in England in 947, when Erik Bloodaxe captured York. The Viking presence continued through the reign of the Danish prince Cnut the Great (reigned as King of England: 1016‚Äì1035), after which a series of inheritance arguments weakened the hold on power of Cnut's heirs. When King Edward the Confessor died in 1066, the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada challenged his successor as King of England, Harold Godwinson. Hardrada was killed, and his Norwegian army defeated, by Harold Godwinson on 25 September 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Harold Godwinson himself died when William the Conqueror defeated the English army at the Battle of Hastings in October 1066. William was crowned king of England on 25 December 1066; however, it was several years before he was able to bring the kingdom under his complete control. In 1070 the Danish king Sweyn Estridsson sailed up the Humber with an army in support of Edgar the √Ütheling, the last surviving male member of the English royal family. However, after capturing York, Sweyn accepted a payment from William to desert Edgar. Five years later one of Sweyn's sons set sail for England to support another English rebellion, but it had been crushed before the expedition arrived, so they settled for plundering the city of York and the surrounding area before returning home. In 1085 Sweyn's son, now Canute IV of Denmark planned a major invasion of England but the assembled fleet never sailed. No further serious Danish invasions on England occurred after this. Although, some raiding occurred during the troubles of Stephen's reign, when King Eystein II of Norway took advantage of the civil war to plunder the east coast of England, sacking Hartlepool and Whitby in 1152, as well as raiding the Yorkshire coast. However, the intention was to raid not to conquer, and the conclusion of these raids marked the end of the Viking Age in England. Scotland Map of the Kingdom of the Isles and Earldom of Orkney The monastery at Iona on the west coast was first raided in 794, and had to be abandoned some fifty years later after several devastating attacks. While there are few records from the earliest period, it is believed that Scandinavian presence in Scotland increased in the 830s. The isles to the north and west of Scotland were heavily colonised by Norwegian Vikings. Shetland, Orkney and the Hebrides came under Norse control, sometimes as fiefs under the King of Norway, and at other times as separate entities under variously the Kings of the Isles, the Earldom of Orkney and the later Kings of Mann and the Isles. Shetland and Orkney were the last of these to be incorporated into Scotland in as late as 1468. Wales Wales was not colonized by the Vikings significantly as in eastern England. The Vikings did, however, settle in small numbers in the south around St Davids, Haverfordwest, and the Gower. Place names such as Skokholm, Skomer, and Swansea remain as evidence of the Norse settlement.Welsh place names. The Vikings, however, were not able to set up a Viking state or control Wales, owing to the powerful forces of Welsh kings, and, unlike in Scotland, the aristocracy was relatively unharmed. Nevertheless, following the successful Viking alliance with Britanny in 865, the Britons made their peace with the Danes, and a Viking/Welsh alliance in 878 defeated an Anglo-Saxon army from Mercia. Although the Welsh had been longtime enemies of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, their relationship with the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex was somewhat warmer. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 893, for example, refers to Vikings being pursued by a combined force of West Saxons and north Welsh along the River Severn. The combined Anglo-Saxon and Welsh army eventually overtook the Vikings before defeating them at the Battle of Buttington.Horspool. Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes. pp. 104‚Äì10 The city of Swansea was founded by Sweyn Forkbeard, king of Denmark, who by 1013 was king of the Danes, Anglo-Saxons and Norwegians. The English name for the town derives from , meaning either Sweyn's island or Sweyn's inlet (see Swansea). The neighboring Gower Peninsula has some place names of Norse origin. For example, Worm's Head is from , the word for snake or dragon, as the Vikings believed that the serpent-shaped island was a sleeping dragon. Some west of Cardiff on the Vale of Glamorgan coast is the semi-flooded island of Tusker Rock, which takes its name from Tuska, the Viking who established a settlement in the area. Cornwall The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported that heathen men (the Danes) raided Charmouth, Dorset in 833 AD, then in 997 AD they destroyed the Dartmoor town of Lydford, and from 1001 AD to 1003 AD they occupied the old Roman city of Exeter. The Cornish were subjugated by King √Üthelstan, of England, in 936 and the border finally set at the River Tamar. However, the Cornish remained semi-autonomous until their annexation into England after the Norman Conquest. Ireland Areas of Norse influence in 10th century Ireland In 795, small bands of Vikings began plundering monastic settlements along the coast of Gaelic Ireland. The Annals of Ulster state that in 821 the Vikings plundered Howth and \\"carried off a great number of women into captivity\\". From 840 the Vikings began building fortified encampments, longphorts, on the coast and overwintering in Ireland. The first were at Dublin and Linn Duachaill.√ì Corr√°in, Donnchadh (2001), \\"The Vikings in Ireland\\", in Larsen, Anne-Christine (ed.), The Vikings in Ireland. The Viking Ship Museum, p.19 Their attacks became bigger and reached further inland, striking larger monastic settlements such as Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Kells and Kildare, and also plundering the ancient tombs of Br√∫ na B√≥inne.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, D√°ibh√≠. Early Medieval Ireland 400-1200. Taylor & Francis, 2016 . p.267 Viking chief Thorgest is said to have raided the whole midlands of Ireland until he was killed by M√°el Sechnaill I in 845. In 853, Viking leader Amla√≠b (Olaf) became the first king of Dublin. He ruled along with his brothers √çmar (possibly Ivar the Boneless) and Auisle.√ì Corr√°in, \\"The Vikings in Ireland\\", p. 28‚Äì29. Over the following decades, there was regular warfare between the Vikings and the Irish, and between two groups of Vikings: the Dubgaill and Finngaill (dark and fair foreigners). The Vikings also briefly allied with various Irish kings against their rivals. In 866, √Åed Findliath burnt all Viking longphorts in the north, and they never managed to establish permanent settlements in that region.√ì Corr√°in, \\"The Vikings in Ireland\\", p.20. The Vikings were driven from Dublin in 902. They returned in 914, led by the U√≠ √çmair (House of Ivar).√ì Corr√°in, \\"The Vikings in Ireland\\", p.22. During the next eight years, the Vikings won decisive battles against the Irish, regained control of Dublin, and founded settlements at Waterford, Wexford, Cork and Limerick, which became Ireland's first large towns. They were important trading hubs, and Viking Dublin was the biggest slave port in western Europe.Gorski, Richard. Roles of the Sea in Medieval England. Boydell Press, 2012 .p.149 These Viking territories became part of the patchwork of kingdoms in Ireland. Vikings intermarried with the Irish and adopted elements of Irish culture, becoming the Norse-Gaels. Some Viking kings of Dublin also ruled the kingdom of the Isles and York; such as Sitric C√°ech, Gofraid ua √çmair, Olaf Guthfrithson and Olaf Cuaran. Sitric Silkbeard was \\"a patron of the arts, a benefactor of the church, and an economic innovator\\" who established Ireland's first mint, in Dublin. In 980, M√°el Sechnaill M√≥r defeated the Dublin Vikings and forced them into submission.Downham, Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland, pp. 51‚Äì52 Over the following thirty years, Brian Boru subdued the Viking territories and made himself High King of Ireland. The Dublin Vikings, together with Leinster, twice rebelled against him, but they were defeated in the battles of Glenmama (999) and Clontarf (1014). After the battle of Clontarf, the Dublin Vikings could no longer \\"single-handedly threaten the power of the most powerful kings of Ireland\\".Downham, Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland, p.61 Brian's rise to power and conflict with the Vikings is chronicled in Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib (\\"The War of the Irish with the Foreigners\\"). ==European mainland== Statue of Rollo, Duke of Normandy Normandy The name of Normandy itself denotes the Viking origin. After their settlement when it became known as \\"Northmannia\\" or Land of The Norsemen. The Viking presence in Normandy began with raids into the territory of the Frankish Empire, from the middle of 9th century. Viking raids extended deep into the Frankish territory, and included the sacking of many prominent towns such as Rouen, Paris and the abbey at Jumi√®ges. The inability of the Frankish king Charles the Bald, and later Charles the Simple, to prevent these Viking incursions forced them to offer vast payments of silver and gold to prevent any further pillage. These pay-offs were short lived and the Danish raiders would always return for more. The Duchy of Normandy was created for the Viking leader Rollo after he had besieged Paris. In 911, Rollo entered vassalage to the king of the West Franks Charles the Simple through the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. This treaty made of Rollo the first Norman Count of Rouen. In addition, Rollo was to be baptized and marry Gisele, the illegitimate daughter of Charles. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory which he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local Gallo-Romance languages and intermarried with the area's original inhabitants. They became the Normans ‚Äì a Norman French-speaking mixture of Scandinavians and indigenous Franks and Gauls. The language of Normandy heavily reflected the Danish influence, as many words (especially ones pertaining to seafaring) were borrowed from Old NorseRidel, Elisabeth, Les Vikings et les mots; l'apport de l'ancien scandinave √† la langue fran√ßaise, √©ditions Errance, 2009, p. 243. or Old Danish.Wood Breese, Lauren, The Persistence of Scandinavian Connections in Normandy in the Tenth and Early Eleventh Centuries, Viator, 8 (1977) More than the language itself, the Norman toponymy retains a strong Nordic influence. Nevertheless, only a few archaeological traces have been found: swords dredged out of the Seine river between its estuary and Rouen, the tomb of a female Viking at P√Ætres, the two Thor's hammers at Saint-Pierre-de-Varengeville and SahursRidel (E.), Deux marteaux de Thor d√©couverts en Normandie in Patrice Lajoye, Mythes et l√©gendes scandinaves en Normandie, OREP √©ditions, Cully, 2011, p. 17. and more recently the horde of Viking coins at Saint-Pierre-des-Fleurs.Cardon, T., en collaboration avec Moesgaard, J.-C., PROT (R.) et Schiesser, P., Revue Numismatique, vol. 164, 2008, p. 21‚Äì40. Rollo's descendant William, Duke of Normandy (the Conqueror) became King of England after he defeated Harold Godwinson and his army at the Battle of Hastings in October 1066. As king of England, he retained the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. The kings of England made claim to Normandy, as well as their other possessions in France, which led to various disputes with the French. This culminated in the French confiscation of Gascony that precipitated what became known as the Hundred Years' War, in 1337. West Francia and Middle Francia West Francia and Middle Francia suffered more severely than East Francia during the Viking raids of the 9th century. The reign of Charles the Bald coincided with some of the worst of these raids, though he did take action by the Edict of Pistres of 864 to secure a standing army of cavalry under royal control to be called upon at all times when necessary to fend off the invaders. He also ordered the building of fortified bridges to prevent inland raids. Nonetheless, the Bretons allied with the Vikings and Robert, the margrave of Neustria, (a march created for defence against the Vikings sailing up the Loire), and Ranulf of Aquitaine died in the Battle of Brissarthe in 865. The Vikings also took advantage of the civil wars which ravaged the Duchy of Aquitaine in the early years of Charles' reign. In the 840s, Pepin II called in the Vikings to aid him against Charles and they settled at the mouth of the Garonne as they did by the Loire. Two dukes of Gascony, Seguin II and William I, died defending Bordeaux from Viking assaults. A later duke, Sancho Mitarra, even settled some at the mouth of the Adour near Bayonne in an act presaging that of Charles the Simple and the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte by which the Vikings were settled in Rouen, creating Normandy as a bulwark against other Vikings. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the Low Countries. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. They set up bases in Saint-Florent-le- Vieil at the mouth of the Loire, in Taillebourg on the mid Charente, also around Bayonne on the banks of the Adour, in Noirmoutier and obviously on the River Seine (Rouen) in what would become Normandy. Antwerp was raided in 836. Later there were raids of Ghent, Kortrijk, Tournai, Leuven and the areas around the Meuse river, the Rhine, the Rupel river and the tributaries of those rivers. Raids were conducted from bases established in Asselt, Walcheren, Wieringen and Elterberg (or Eltenberg, a small hill near Elten). In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of Dorestad declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (), doubts about this have grown in recent years. One of the more important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of Rorik of Dorestad (based in Wieringen) and his brother Harald (based in Walcheren). Around 850, Lothair I acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. Again in 870, Rorik was received by Charles the Bald in Nijmegen, to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during this period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of Oostergo in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882. Buried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.Vikingschat van Wieringen Retrieved 26 June 2008. (Dutch only) Around 879, Godfrid arrived in Frisian lands as the head of a large force that terrorised the Low Countries. Using Ghent as his base, they ravaged Ghent, Maastricht, Li√®ge, Stavelot, Pr√ºm, Cologne, and Koblenz. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as Godfrid, Duke of Frisia. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by Charles the Fat, to whom he became a vassal. In the siege of Asselt in 882, the Franks sieged a Viking camp at Asselt in Frisia. Although the Vikings were not forced by arms to abandon their camp, they were compelled to come to terms in which their leader, Godfrid, was converted to Christianity. Godfrid was assassinated in 885, after which Gerolf of Holland assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end. Viking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in Zutphen and Deventer. The last attacks took place in Tiel in 1006 and Utrecht in 1007. Iberian Peninsula A street plate in P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal, with Siglas poveiras (describing names of local families), related with Scandinavian Bom√§rken. The drawn boat is a Lancha Poveira some researchers say it is derived from the archetypal Viking ship.\\"O Barco Poveiro\\" ‚Äì Oct√°vio Lixa Filgueiras, 1¬™ edi√ß√£o 1966 Compared with the rest of Western Europe, the Iberian Peninsula seems to have been little affected by Viking activity, either in the Christian north or the Muslim south.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 65 and passim. In some of their raids on Iberia, the Vikings were crushed either by the Kingdom of Asturias or the Emirate armies. Our knowledge of Vikings in Iberia is mainly based on written accounts, many of which are much later than the events they purport to describe, and often also ambiguous about the origins or ethnicity of the raiders they mention.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015). A little possible archaeological evidence has come to light,Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 7. but research in this area is ongoing. Viking activity in the Iberian peninsula seems to have begun around the mid-ninth century as an extension of their raids on and establishment of bases in Frankia in the earlier ninth century, but although Vikings may have over- wintered there, there is as yet no evidence for trading or settlement.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 5‚Äì12. The most prominent and probably most significant event was a raid in 844, when Vikings entered the Garonne and attacked Galicia and Asturias. When the Vikings attacked A Coru√±a they were met by the army of King Ramiro I and were heavily defeated. Many of the Vikings' casualties were caused by the Galicians' ballistas ‚Äì powerful torsion-powered projectile weapons that looked rather like giant crossbows. 70 of the Vikings' longships were captured on the beach and burned. They then proceeded south, raiding Lisbon and Seville. This Viking raid on Seville seems to have constituted a significant attack.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 33‚Äì45. 859‚Äì861 saw another spate of Viking raids, apparently by a single group. Despite some elaborate tales in late sources, little is known for sure about these attacks. After unsuccessful raids on both northern Iberia and Al-Andalus, the Vikings seem also to have raided other Mediterranean targetspossibly but not certainly including Italy, Alexandria, and Constantinople‚àíand perhaps over-wintering in Francia.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 47‚Äì64. Evidence for Viking activity in Iberia vanishes after the 860s, until the 960s‚Äì70s, when a range of sources including Dudo of Saint-Quentin, Ibn ·∏§ayyƒÅn, and Ibn IdhƒÅrƒ´, along with a number of charters from Christian Iberia, while individually unreliable, together afford convincing evidence for Viking raids on Iberia in the 960s and 970s.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 79‚Äì93. Tenth- or eleventh-century fragments of mouse bone found in Madeira, along with mitocondrial DNA of Madeiran mice, suggests that Vikings also came to Madeira (bringing mice with them), long before the island was colonised by Portugal. Quite extensive evidence for minor Viking raids in Iberia continues for the early eleventh century in later narratives (including some Icelandic sagas) and in northern Iberian charters. As the Viking Age drew to a close, Scandinavians and Normans continued to have opportunities to visit and raid Iberia while on their way to the Holy Land for pilgrimage or crusade, or in connection with Norman conquests in the Mediterranean. Key examples in the saga literature are Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari (king of Norway 1103‚Äì1130) and R√∏gnvaldr kali Kolsson (d. 1158).Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 95‚Äì104. Italy and Sicily Around 860, Ermentarius of Noirmoutier and the Annals of St-Bertin provide contemporary evidence for Vikings based in Frankia proceeding to Iberia and thence to Italy.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 59‚Äì60. Three or four eleventh-century Swedish Runestones mention Italy, memorialising warriors who died in 'Langbar√∞aland', the Old Norse name for southern Italy (Longobardia). It seems clear that rather than being Normans, these men were Varangian mercenaries fighting for Byzantium.Judith Jesch, Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2001), p. 88. Varangians may first have been deployed as mercenaries in Italy against the Arabs as early as 936. Later, several Anglo-Danish and Norwegian nobles participated in the Norman conquest of southern Italy. Harald Hardrada, who later became king of Norway, seems to have been involved in the Norman conquest of Sicily between 1038 and 1040, under William de Hauteville, who won his nickname Iron Arm by defeating the emir of Syracuse in single combat, and a Lombard contingent, led by Arduin. Edgar the √Ütheling, who left England in 1086, went there,Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, p. 217; Florence of Worcester, p. 145 Jarl Erling Skakke won his nickname after a battle against Arabs in Sicily.Orkneyinga Saga, Anderson, Joseph, (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1873), FHL microfilm 253063., pp. 134, 139, 144‚Äì45, 149‚Äì51, 163, 193. On the other hand, many Anglo-Danish rebels fleeing William the Conqueror, joined the Byzantines in their struggle against Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, in Southern Italy.Translation based on Chibnall (ed.), Ecclesiastical History, vol. ii, pp. 203, 205. Islamic Levant The well-known Harald Hardrada would also serve the Byzantine emperor in Palestine as well as raiding North Africa, the Middle East as far east as Armenia, and the island of Sicily in the 11th century, as recounted in his saga in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla.Sturlason, Snorre. \\"Harald Hardrade\\" in Heimskringla, or the Lives of the Norse Kings. Trans. A.H. Smith. Dover Publications, Inc.: New York, 1990, p. 508, . Evidence for Norse ventures into Arabia and Central Asia can be found in runestones erected in Scandinavia by the relatives of fallen Viking adventurers. Several of these refer to men who died in \\"Serkland\\" (possibly Arabia).Bl√∂ndel, Sigfus. The Varangians of Byzantium. Trans. Benedikt S. Benedikz. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK. 2007, pp. 224‚Äì28, . Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean the Norse (referred to as Rus') were viewed more as \\"merchant-warriors\\" who were primarily associated with trade and business. Indeed, one of the only detailed accounts of a Viking burial come from Ibn-Fadlan's account.Ibn-Fadlan. Journey to Russia. Trans. Richard N. Erye. Markus Wiener Publishers: Princeton, NJ. 2005. . At times this trading relationship would break down into violence ‚Äì Rus' armadas raided in the Caspian on at least three occasions, in 910, 912 and 943. Eastern Europe In Athens, Greece, Swedish Vikings wrote a runic inscription on the Piraeus Lion The Vikings settled coastal areas along the Baltic Sea, and along inland rivers in Russian territories such as Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod and along major waterways to the Byzantine Empire. The Varangians or Varyags (Russian, Ukrainian: –í–∞—Ä—è–≥–∏, Varyagi) sometimes referred to as Variagians were Scandinavians who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries. Engaging in trade, colonization, piracy and mercenary activities, they roamed the river systems and portages of Gar√∞ar√≠ki, reaching and settling at the Caspian Sea and in Constantinople. The real involvement of the Varangians is said to have come after they were asked by the Slavic tribes of the region to come and establish order, as those tribes were in constant warfare among each other (\\"Our country is rich and immense, but it is rent by disorder. Come and govern us and reign over us.\\"Roesdahl, Else; The Vikings: Edition 2, Penguin Group, 1999. p. 287). The tribes were united and ruled under the leadership of Rurik, a leader of a group of Varangians. Rurik had successfully been able to establish a set of trading towns and posts along the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, which were perfect for trade with the Byzantine Empire. Rurik's successors were able to conquer and unite the towns along the banks of the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, and establish the Rus' Khaganate. Despite the distinction of the Varangians from the local Slavic tribes at the beginning, by the 10th century, the Varangians began to integrate with the local community, and by the end of 12th century, a new people ‚Äì the Russians, had emerged. Georgia Around 1036, Varangians appeared near the village of Bashi on the Rioni River, to establish a permanent settlement of Vikings in Georgia. The Georgian Chronicles described them as 3,000 men who had traveled from Scandinavia through present-day Russia, rowing down the Dnieper River and across the Black Sea. King Bagrat IV welcomed them to Georgia and accepted some of them into the Georgian army; several hundred Vikings fought on Bagrat's side at the Battle of Sasireti in 1047. Other Vikings continued westward, thereafter disappearing from history. Swedish researchers recently suggested that the story in the Georgian chronicle was about the Swedish expedition by the Viking chieftain Ingvar den Vittfarne (Ingvar the Far- Traveled), which features in many rune stones in mid-Sweden. ==North Atlantic== Iceland A page from a skin manuscript of Landn√°mab√≥k in the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland The 1590 Sk√°lholt Map showing Latinized Norse placenames in North America:Title: Sk√°lholt Map; Author: Sigurd Stefansson/Thord Thorl√°ksson; Date: 1590 myoldmaps.com * Land of the Risi (a mythical location) * Greenland * Helluland (Baffin Island) * Markland (the Labrador Peninsula) * Land of the Skr√¶lingjar (location undetermined) * Promontory of Vinland (the Great Northern Peninsula) Iceland was discovered by Naddodd, one of the first settlers on the Faroe Islands, who was sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands but got lost and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddoddr named the country Sn√¶land (Snowland). Swedish sailor Gar√∞ar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and named it Gar√∞arsh√≥lmi (literally Gar√∞ar's Islet) and stayed for the winter at H√∫sav√≠k. The first Scandinavian who deliberately sailed to Gar√∞arsh√≥lmi was Fl√≥ki Vilger√∞arson, also known as Hrafna-Fl√≥ki (Raven-Fl√≥ki). Fl√≥ki settled for one winter at Bar√∞astr√∂nd. It was a cold winter, and when he spotted some drift ice in the fjords he gave the island its current name, √çsland (Iceland). Iceland was first settled around 870.Smith K. 1995. \\"Landna'm: the settlement of Iceland in archaeological and historical perspective\\". World Archaeology 26:319‚Äì47. The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named Ing√≥lfr Arnarson. According to the story, he threw two carved pillars overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as Reykjanesskagi. There he settled with his family around 874, in a place he named Reykjav√≠k (Bay of Smokes) due to the geothermal steam rising from the earth. It is recognized, however, that Ing√≥lfur Arnarson may not have been the first one to settle permanently in Iceland ‚Äì that may have been N√°ttfari, a slave of Gar√∞ar Svavarsson who stayed behind when his master returned to Scandinavia. Greenland In the year 985, Erik the Red was believed to have discovered Greenland after being exiled from Iceland for murder in 982. Three years later in 986, Erik the Red returned with 14 surviving ships (as 25 set out on the expedition).Two areas along Greenland's southwest coast were colonized by Norse settlers, including Erik the Red, around 986. The land was at best marginal for Norse pastoral farming. The settlers arrived during a warm phase, when short-season crops such as rye and barley could be grown. Sheep and hardy cattle were also raised for food, wool, and hides. Their main export was walrus ivory, which was traded for iron and other goods which could not be produced locally. Greenland became a dependency of the king of Norway in 1261. During the 13th century, the population may have reached as high as 5,000, divided between the two main settlements of Eystribyg√∞ (Eastern Settlement) and Vestribyg√∞ (Western Settlement). The organization of these settlements revolved mainly around religion, and they consisted of around 250 farms, which were split into approximately fourteen communities that were centered around fourteen churches,Diamond, J. Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (2005). one of which was a cathedral at Gar√∞ar. The Catholic diocese of Greenland was subject to the archdiocese of Nidaros. However, many bishops chose to exercise this office from afar. As the years wore on, the climate shifted (see Little Ice Age). In 1379, the northernmost settlement was attacked by the Skr√¶lings (Norse word for Inuit). Crops failed and trade declined. The Greenland colony gradually faded away. By 1450, it had lost contact with Norway and Iceland and disappeared from all but a few Scandinavian legends. North America Leif Erikson discovering America Christian Krohg, 1893 A Norwegian ship's captain named Bjarni Herj√≥lfsson first came across a part of the North American continent ca. 985 when he was blown off course sailing to Greenland from Iceland. Subsequent expeditions from Greenland (some led by Leif Erikson) explored the areas to the west, seeking large timbers for building in particular (Greenland had only small trees and brush). Regular activity from Greenland extended to Ellesmere Island, Skraeling Island and Ruin Island for hunting and trading with Inuit groups. A short-lived settlement was established at L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, Canada. There is also evidence for Viking contact with Native Americans.Jones, Gwyn, A History of the Vikings (2nd edition, Oxford, 2001). The Vikings referred to them as Skraelings or ‚Äôuglies‚Äô. Fighting between the Natives and the Vikings did take place with the natives having the advanced weaponry of bows and arrows. However trade by barter did also take place between them. This contact led to a mutual amazement of two peoples toward each other. However, the conflict between these two groups led to the Vikings eventual evacuation of the area. The Greenlanders called the new-found territory Vinland. It is unclear whether Vinland referred to in the traditionally thinking as V√≠nland (wine-land) or more recently as Vinland (meadow- or pasture-land). In any case, without any official backing, attempts at colonization by the Norse proved failures. There were simply too many natives for the Greenlanders to conquer or withstand and they withdrew to Greenland. Svalbard Vikings may have discovered Svalbard as early as the 12th century. Traditional Norse accounts exist of a land known as Svalbar√∞ ‚Äì literally \\"cold shores\\". This land might also have been Jan Mayen, or a part of eastern Greenland. The Dutchman Willem Barents made the first indisputable discovery of Svalbard in 1596. ==Genetic evidence and implications== Studies of genetic diversity have provided scientific confirmation to accompany archaeological evidence of Viking expansion. They additionally indicate patterns of ancestry, imply new migrations, and show the actual flow of individuals between disparate regions. However, attempts to determine historical population genetics are complicated by subsequent migrations and demographic fluctuations. In particular, the rapid migrations of the 20th century have made it difficult to assess what prior genetic states were. Genetic evidence contradicts the common perception that Vikings were primarily pillagers and raiders. A news article by Roger Highfield summarizes recent research and concludes that, as both male and female genetic markers are present, the evidence is indicative of colonization instead of raiding and occupying. However, this is also disputed by unequal ratios of male and female haplotypes (see below) which indicate that more men settled than women, an element of a raiding or occupying population. Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome Haplotypes Y-chromosome haplotypes serve as markers of paternal lineage much the same as mDNA represents the maternal lineage. Together, these two methods provide an option for tracing back a people's genetic history and charting the historical migrations of both males and females. Often considered the purest remnants of ancient Nordic genetics, Icelanders trace 75% to 80% of their patrilineal ancestry to Scandinavia and 20% to 25% to Scotland and Ireland.Helgason A, Sigurethardottir S, Nicholson J, Sykes B, Hill EW, Bradley DG, Bosnes V, Gulcher JR, Ward R, Stefansson K. 2000. Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic ancestry in the male settlers of Iceland.

Heredity 95:129‚Äì35. On the maternal side, only 37% is from Scandinavia and the remaining 63% is mostly Scottish and Irish.Helgason A, Lalueza-Fox C, Ghosh S, Sigurdardottir S, Sampietro ML, Gigli E, Baker A, Bertranpetit J, Arnadottir L, Thornorsteinsdottir U, Stefansson K. 2009. Sequences from first settlers reveal rapid evolution in Icelandic mtDNA pool. PLoS Genet 5:e1000343 Iceland also holds one of the more well-documented lineage records which, in many cases, go back 15 generations and at least 300 years. These are accompanied by one of the larger genetic records that have been collected by deCODE genetics. Together, these two records allow for a mostly reliable view of historical Scandinavian genetic structure although the genetics of Iceland are influenced by Norse-British migration as well as that directly from Scandinavia. Common Y-Haplogroups Haplogroup I-M253, also known as haplogroup I1, is the most common haplotype among Scandinavian males. It is present in 35% of males in Norway, Denmark and Sweden; 40% of males within Western Finland.Lappalainen, T., Laitinen, V., Salmela, E., Andersen, P., Huoponen, K., Savontaus, M.-L. and Lahermo, P. (2008). Migration Waves to the Baltic Sea Region. Annals of Human Genetics, 72: 337‚Äì48. It is also prominent on the Baltic and North Sea coasts, but decreases further south. Haplogroup R1b is another very common haplotype in all of Western Europe. However, it is not distinctly linked to Vikings or their expansion. There are indications that a mutant strand, R-L165, may have been carried to Great Britain by the Vikings,Moffat, Alistair; Wilson, James F. (2011). The Scots: a genetic journey. Birlinn. pp. 181‚Äì82, 192. but the topic is currently inconclusive. C1 The mitochondrial C1 haplotype is primarily an East Asia-American haplotype that developed just prior to migration across the Bering sea.Starikovskaya EB, Sukernik RI, Derbeneva OA, Volodko NV, Ruiz-Pesini E, Torroni A, Brown MD, Lott MT, Hosseini SH, Huoponen K, Wallace DC. 2005.

Beringian standstill and spread of Native American founders. PLoS One 2:e829. This maternal haplotype, however, was found in several Icelandic samples. While originally considered to be a 20th-century immigrant, a more complete analysis has shown that this haplotype has been present in Iceland for at least 300 years and is distinct from other C1 lineages.Ebenesersd√≥ttir, S. S., Sigur√∞sson, √Å., S√°nchez-Quinto, F., Lalueza- Fox, C., Stef√°nsson, K. and Helgason, A. (2011), A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?. Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 144: 92‚Äì99. This evidence indicates a likely genetic exchange back and forth between Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland. Surname Histories and the Y-Haplotype There is evidence suggesting Y-Haplotypes may be combined with surname histories to better represent historical populations and prevent recent migrations from obscuring the historical record.Georgina R. Bowden, Patricia Balaresque, Turi E. King, Ziff Hansen, Andrew C. Lee, Giles Pergl-Wilson, Emma Hurley, Stephen J. Roberts, Patrick Waite, Judith Jesch, Abigail L. Jones, Mark G. Thomas, Stephen E.

Cys282Tyr Cys282Tyr (or C282Y) is a mutation in the HFE gene that has been linked to most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. Genetic techniques indicate that this mutation occurred roughly 60‚Äì70 generations ago or between 600 and 800 CE, assuming a generation length of 20 years.Ajioka RS, Jorde LB, Gruen JR et al. (1977). \\"Haplotype analysis of hemochromatosis: evaluation of different linkage-disequilibrium approaches and evolution of disease chromosomes\\".

Hum Genet 102: 517‚Äì25. The regional distribution of this mutation among European populations indicates that it originated in Southern Scandinavia and spread with Viking expansion.Milman N, Pedersen P (2003). \\"Evidence that the Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene originated from a population in Southern Scandinavia and spread with the Vikings\\". Clinical Genetics 64: 36‚Äì47. Due to the timing of the mutation and subsequent population movements, C282Y is very prominent in Great Britain, Normandy, and Southern Scandinavia although C282Y has been found in almost every population that has been in contact with the Vikings. ==See also== * The Exploration Museum ==NotesReferences== Expansion Category:Anglo-Norse England Category:Scandinavian Scotland America Category:Migration Period Category:Historical migrations Category:Norse people Category:Vikings ","title":"Viking expansion"},{"id":"19333331","text":"Time Flies may refer to: ==Entertainment== * Time Flies (1944 film), a 1944 British comedy film starring Tommy Handley * Time Flies (2013 film), a 2013 Canadian short drama film directed by St√©phane Moukarzel * Time Flies (Vaya Con Dios album), a 1992 album by Belgian pop music group Vaya Con Dios * Time Flies (Billy Ray Cyrus album), a 2003 album by American country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus * Time Flies (Melanie Laine album), a 2005 album by Canadian country music singer Melanie Laine * Time Flies (John Michael Montgomery album), a 2008 album by American country music singer John Michael Montgomery * Time Flies (Eason Chan album), a 2010 album by Hong Kong Canto-pop singer Eason Chan * Time Flies...

He first discovered blues in his mid-teens. \\"Getting into blues made me want to play music,\\" he says. He played in blues-rock bands while learning to sing with soulful authority. The two met at an open mic session in their hometown of Wichita, Kansas in 2001 and they quickly bonded and formed an acoustic duo playing traditional and delta blues. The all acoustic duo saw their start after reaching the finals at the 2005 International Blues Competition in Memphis, Tennessee, and followed that success with their first self-produced album, Caney Valley Blues in 2005. In 2006 the duo added a drummer and evolved into an electric powerhouse trio. Later that year they released a self-produced independent album, Floyd's Market. The trio forged a path combining rural blues, Delta, Mississippi Hill Country, and rock styles. They followed in 2008 with 1861 (Northern Blues Music).

Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth.American Psychiatric Association (2004) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (Text Revision). American Psychiatric Association. . It is a dissociative symptom that may appear in moments of severe stress. Derealization is a subjective experience of unreality of the outside world, while depersonalization is sense of unreality in one's personal self, although most authors currently do not regard derealization (surroundings) and depersonalization (self) as separate constructs. Chronic derealization may be caused by occipital‚Äìtemporal dysfunction. These symptoms are common in the population, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 5% and 31‚Äì66% at the time of a traumatic event. ==Description== The experience of derealization can be described as an immaterial substance that separates a person from the outside world, such as a sensory fog, pane of glass, or veil. Individuals may report that what they see lacks vividness and emotional coloring. Emotional response to visual recognition of loved ones may be significantly reduced. Feelings of d√©j√† vu or jamais vu are common. Familiar places may look alien, bizarre, and surreal. One may not even be sure whether what one perceives is in fact reality or not. The world as perceived by the individual may feel as if it were going through a dolly zoom effect. Such perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste, and smell. The degree of familiarity one has with their surroundings is among one's sensory and psychological identity, memory foundation and history when experiencing a place. When persons are in a state of derealization, they block this identifying foundation from recall. This \\"blocking effect\\" creates a discrepancy of correlation between one's perception of one's surroundings during a derealization episode, and what that same individual would perceive in the absence of a derealization episode. Frequently, derealization occurs in the context of constant worrying or \\"intrusive thoughts\\" that one finds hard to switch off. In such cases it can build unnoticed along with the underlying anxiety attached to these disturbing thoughts, and be recognized only in the aftermath of a realization of crisis, often a panic attack, subsequently seeming difficult or impossible to ignore. This type of anxiety can be crippling to the affected and may lead to avoidant behavior. Those who experience this phenomenon may feel concern over the cause of their derealization. It is often difficult to accept that such a disturbing symptom is simply a result of anxiety, and the individual may often think that the cause must be something more serious. This can, in turn, cause more anxiety and worsen the derealization. Derealization also has been shown to interfere with the learning process, with cognitive impairments demonstrated in immediate recall and visuospatial deficits. This can be best understood as the individual feeling as if they see the events in third person; therefore they cannot properly process information, especially through the visual pathway. People experiencing derealization describe feeling as if they are viewing the world through a TV screen. This, along with co-morbidities such as depression and anxiety, and other similar feelings attendant to derealization, can cause a sensation of alienation and isolation between the person suffering from derealization and others around them. as Derealization Disorder is characteristically diagnosed and recognized sparsely in clinical settings. This is in light of general population prevalence being as high as 5%, skyrocketing to as high as 37% for traumatized individuals. Partial symptoms would also include depersonalization, a feeling of being an \\"observer\\"/having an \\"observational effect\\". As if existing as a separate entity on the planet, with everything happening, being experienced and alternately perceived through their own eyes (similar to a first person camera in a game, e.g. Television or Computer-Vision). ==Causes== Derealization can accompany the neurological conditions of epilepsy (particularly temporal lobe epilepsy), migraine, and mild TBI (head injury). There is a similarity between visual hypo- emotionality, a reduced emotional response to viewed objects, and derealization. This suggests a disruption of the process by which perception becomes emotionally colored. This qualitative change in the experiencing of perception may lead to reports of anything viewed being unreal or detached. Some neurophysiological studies have noted disturbances arising from the frontal-temporal cortex, which as noted was highly correlated in temporal-lobe disorders such as epilepsy. This led to speculation of involvement of more subtle shifts in neural circuitry and inhibitory neuro-chemical pathways. Derealization can possibly manifest as an indirect result of certain vestibular disorders such as labyrinthitis. This is thought to result from anxiety stemming from being dizzy. An alternative explanation holds that a possible effect of vestibular dysfunction includes responses in the form of the modulation of noradrenergic and serotonergic activity due to a misattribution of vestibular symptoms to the presence of imminent physical danger resulting in the experience of anxiety or panic, which subsequently generate feelings of derealization. Likewise, derealization is a common psychosomatic symptom seen in various anxiety disorders, especially hypochondria. However, derealization is presently regarded as a separate psychological issue due to its presence with several pathologies or idiopathically. Derealization and dissociative symptoms have been linked by some studies to various physiological and psychological differences in individuals and their environments. It was remarked that labile sleep-wake cycles (labile meaning more easily roused) with some distinct changes in sleep, such as dream-like states, hypnogogic, hypnopompic hallucinations, night-terrors and other disorders related to sleep could possibly be causative or improve symptoms to a degree. Derealization can also be a symptom of severe sleep disorders and mental disorders like depersonalization disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, and other mental conditions. Cannabis, psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants, caffeine, nitrous oxide, albuterol, and nicotine can all produce feelings mimicking feelings of derealization, particularly when taken in excess. It can also result from alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal can also cause feelings of derealization, whose symptoms can be protracted (chronic), delayed-onset , exhibiting high variability in inter-personal subjectivity of the phenomenon. Interoceptive exposure can be used as a means to induce derealization, as well as the related phenomenon depersonalization. ==See alsoReferences== Category:Abnormal psychology Category:Neurology Category:Dissociative disorders ","title":"Derealization"},{"id":"19333422","text":"Zahera Darabid ( ; born May 10, 1980 in Bab Ezzouar, Algiers Province), known by her stage name Zaho (), is an Algerian-Canadian R&B; singer.http://www.music- story.com/zaho/biographiehttp://vibe2lyon.com/actu_zaho/index.html ==Biography== Zahera Darabid was born on May 10, 1980 in Bab Ezzouar, a suburb of the Algerian capital Algiers.

The album had been available to purchase as a download from bleep.com on 15 September 2008. The album originated in a daydream, in which Tom Jenkinson envisioned a rock band performing a concert against the backdrop of a large, glowing coathanger. The performance quickly became surreal: among other things, a river forces the band to kayak whilst performing; the guitarist is able to accelerate or decelerate time at will; and every drum in the drummer's kit begins to switch places with each another. As such, the majority of the album consists of Jenkinson's own version of jazz fusion, threaded through with classical guitar, math rock and funk recordings. ==Track listingReferences *Guardian.co.uk Category:2008 albums Category:Squarepusher albums Category:Warp (record label) albums ","title":"Just a Souvenir"},{"id":"19333435","text":"William's Wish Wellingtons is an animated BBC children's television series produced by Hibbert Ralph Entertainment (who had previously created Spider!), which was originally aired on BBC One from 25 October to 30 December 1994, then moved to BBC Two from 24 December 1995 to 31 May 1996, and moved back to BBC One from 25 September to 13 December 1996. It was narrated by actor Andrew Sachs. It was later translated into Gaelic by B√∫rach Productions with a different narrator and shown as ''''' on BBC Two Scotland. It was shown in the United States as part of Cartoon Network's Big Bag (but, when Big Bag was remade by Yorkshire Television in the United Kingdom, it was replaced with Koki given that it was on ITV). The central theme of the series is not dissimilar to The Galoshes of Fortune (1838) by Hans Christian Andersen. ==Synopsis== In the series' first episode, William and Barksure, William decided to go outside to play in the rain; when his Mum saw him (and the state of his shoes) she took him to buy a new pair of Wellington boots, and when they arrived at the shoe shop the shop owner picked out a pair of sparkling red boots for William. When he got home and decided to put them on, he discovered a note inside: \\"These are Wish Wellingtons, put them on and make a wish\\" - and when he did so, the first thing he wished for was a dog, which he christened \\"Barksure\\". William then realized that he had the power to wish himself anywhere in the world, or ask for anything he wanted; this sometimes got him into a spot of bother, such as the occasion when he wished that he had the biggest conker in the world in order to win his school conker championship, the time when he wished all his toys alive to help him tidy his room, or the time when he put his Wellingtons on the wrong feet and almost prevented Santa Claus from making his deliveries one Christmas Eve (with a series of wishes gone wrong). He also changed the course of history several times, such as the occasion when he wished himself back to ancient Rome and beat a soldier called Superbus in a chariot race (by wishing for a banquet to thwart Superbus's progress, as he immediately stopped his chariot and started eating it). The series comprised twenty-six five-minute episodes; thirteen in 1994 and a further thirteen in 1996, which were animated by Mark Mason (who had previously animated Spider!) and directed by Graham Ralph (who had previously directed the same series and illustrated its book). The inceptive series was released by BBC Worldwide on a VHS entitled William and Barksure (BBCV 5666) in 1995 and the second series on another VHS entitled William Hood (BBCV 5904) in 1996, but because of the presence of the \\"old\\" BBC logo (with underlines) on them these are both now out of print; as with many other older BBC children's television shows, the show is not available on DVD.Amazon.co.uk - William's Wish Wellingtons - William and Barksure (VHS)Amazon.co.uk - William's Wish Wellingtons - William Hood (VHS) There were also several books based on the show (some of the ones that were based on the episodes changed their titles, such as \\"William and Barksure\\" becoming \\"William and the Dog\\", \\"William and the Alien\\" becoming \\"William in Space\\", \\"William of Arabia\\" becoming \\"William and the Camel\\", \\"Jungle William\\" becoming \\"William in the Jungle\\", and, \\"William the Storyteller\\", which was one of only two episodes to feature William's orange-haired cousin Winston, becoming \\"William and the Giant\\"), which were written or adapted by Atholl McDonald, and illustrated by director Graham Ralph; one was a peep-through book, while another was a colouring book, and a third was an activity book.Amazon.co.uk - William and the Dog (William's Wish Wellingtons)Amazon.co.uk - William's Wish Wellingtons: Peep Through Book In 1998, part of the episode \\"William the Conkeror\\" was featured in an eighth-series episode of Bodger and Badger (when they ran the \\"Seagull's Rest\\" bed-and-breakfast); Badger (and Mousey) wanted to watch it in one of their guests' rooms while she was watching the weather forecast, so they switched the channel with their remote (while they were hiding in the back of the room), and after she changed it back with her own remote, they changed it again. The changing went on until the guest complained to Bodger that her TV was defective. ==Episode list== Series 1 (1994-1995) The first eight episodes of the first series were originally broadcast on BBC One as a part of the Children's BBC strand on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:35 pm, while the next four were broadcast on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday after Christmas 1994 at 10:20 am, and the thirteenth one was broadcast on BBC Two almost a year later on Christmas Eve 1995 at 7:30 am, after a rerun of six of the previous twelve; this is due to the fact that its plot featured William almost preventing Santa Claus from making his deliveries. {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" width=\\"99%\\" FFFFFF;\\" !width=\\"1%\\" 7DF9FF;\\"# !7DF9FF;\\"Title !width=\\"20%\\" 7DF9FF;\\"Air Date } Series 2 (1996) The first six episodes of the second series were originally broadcast on BBC Two on Fridays at 8:30 am, and later repeated at 2:05 pm on the same day, while the seventh one was broadcast at 7:35 am and repeated at 1:05 pm and the next four were broadcast on BBC One as part of Ants in Your Pants (which was hosted by Children's BBC's then-puppet Otis the Aardvark) on Wednesdays at 3:30 pm; however, the two final episodes of the series were broadcast on Fridays, again as part of Ants in Your Pants, in that same timeslot. {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" width=\\"99%\\" FFFFFF;\\" !width=\\"1%\\" 005E80;\\"# !005E80;\\"Title !width=\\"20%\\" 005E80;\\"Air Date } ==International broadcast== * UK ** BBC One ** BBC Two ** CBeebies ** Nickelodeon (CBBC on Nickelodeon) ** Cartoon Network (Big Bag) * Ireland ** Network 2 (The Den) * Finland ** Yle TV2 * Zimbabwe ** ZTV ** ZBC * Hong Kong ** TVB Pearl * Macau ** TVB Pearl * USA ** Cartoon Network (Big Bag) * Australia ** ABC TV (aired as part of Mixy) ** ABC Kids (also as part of Big Bag) ** Cartoon Network (Big Bag) ** CBeebies * Papua New Guinea ** ABC TV (aired as part of Mixy) * Vanuatu ** ABC TV (aired as part of Mixy) ** ABC Kids (also as part of Big Bag) * Poland ** TVP1 ** CBeebies * South Africa ** BBC Prime * Iceland ** BBC Prime ** St√∂√∞ 2 * Israel ** Kids Channel * Canada ** TVO (TVO Kids) ** BBC Kids * The Bahamas ** BBC Kids * Jamaica ** BBC Kids * Germany ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) * Cyprus ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) * Bosnia and Herzegovina ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) * Falkland Islands ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) * Gibraltar ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) * Belize ** BFBS (Children's SSVC/Room 785) ** SSVC Television (Children's SSVC) ==References* William's Wish Wellingtons at Toonhound Category:1990s British animated television series Category:1990s British children's television series Category:1994 British television series debuts Category:1996 British television series endings Category:BBC children's television shows Category:British animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:British children's animated adventure television series Category:British children's animated fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows ","title":"William's Wish Wellingtons"},{"id":"19333442","text":"Putzmeister is a German manufacturer of concrete pumps and other equipment for pumping, distributing and placing concrete, mortar and other high-density solids, and for preparing, temporarily storing, processing and transporting these materials.

National Portrait Gallery, London, NPG 638 lion rampant argent in chief three bezants Sir George Treby JP (1643‚Äì1700), of Plympton, Devon, and of Fleet Street in the City of London, was Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and six times Member of Parliament for the Rotten Borough of Plympton Erle, Devon, largely controlled by him and his descendants until abolished by the Great Reform Act of 1832. ==Origins== The Treby family are believed to have originated at the estate of Treby in the parish of Yealmpton in Devon, from which they took their surname.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.520 George was the eldest son of Peter Treby of Holbeton in Devon, an attorney at the Court of Common Pleas by his wife Joan Snelling, daughter of John Snelling of Chaddle Wood, Plympton (which mansion house survives today after early 1800s rebuilding),Pevsner, p.686: Chaddlewood on Glen Road, off Ridgeway and co- heiress to her nephew Francis Snelling.HoP biography ==Education== He was educated at Plympton Grammar School, and was accepted into Exeter College, Oxford in June 1660. He left without completing a degree. ==Career== Legal training He entered the Middle Temple for his legal training on 24 October 1663 and was called to the Bar on 2 June 1671. He became a bencher of Middle Temple on 28 January 1681, served as a reader in 1686 and was treasurer in 1689. Political career In March 1677 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Plympton, over which pocket borough his family exerted considerable power. He was re-elected for both the February and August Parliaments of 1679, and again in 1689 and 1690. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Treby, George In Parliament Treby focused on subjects such as the wool trade, and other topics which concerned Devon. Treby acted as chairman of the Committee of Secrecy dedicated to investigating the supposed Popish Plot revealed in November 1678 by Titus Oates. In June 1679 proposals were discussed for Treby to be elected Speaker of the House of Commons, but were not acted upon as he was so short sighted as not to be able to distinguish between different MPs. Paul D. Halliday, ‚ÄòTreby, Sir George (bap. 1644, d. 1700)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, January 2008, . Retrieved 16 September 2008 He failed to be elected Chairman of the Committee of Elections and Privileges in 1679, but in 1680 was named to the committee investigating people who had promoted the ‚Äòabhorrences‚Äô of petitions to King Charles II for summoning parliament. He became Chairman of the Elections Committee and continued to investigate the Popish Plot, helping introduce the second Exclusion Bill to Parliament. In December 1680 he was one of the lawyers trying William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, the first peer to be arrested as part of the Popish Plot. At about the same time he was appointed Recorder of London and was knighted on 22 January 1681. (Old Style). Until the British calendar reform of the early 1750s, Britain retained the Gregorian Calendar, and the English New Year was on 25 March, not 1 January In February 1681 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for London and Devon. He was again elected MP for Plympton in April 1681 for the Third Exclusion Parliament, and helped to introduce the Third Exclusion Bill. He disclosed information gained about the Popish Plot from Edward Fitzharris, intending to impeach him and thereby to gain more information about the other conspirators. Following the dissolution of the Third Exclusion Parliament and after any information revealed was no longer a threat to the King, Fitzharris was charged with treason. Along with Sir Francis Winnington and Henry Pollexfen, Treby went to court to try to prevent the execution of Fitzharris, his most important witness. The argument was that the Court of King's Bench could not try Fitzharris as he was currently being prosecuted by Parliament; to do so would be to move the case from a higher court to a lower one. The argument was thrown out as the dissolution of Parliament meant that the impeachment case had effectively ceased, and Fitzharris was executed shortly after. After his execution Fitzharris's alleged confession was published by Francis Hawkins, in which it was claimed Treby and others had attempted to pressure him into giving false testimony. Treby is thought to have published Truth Vindicated to defend himself. Opposition to the court He was an active member of the Green Ribbon Club, and suggested that James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth was the rightful king. In 1681 he presented a petition from the City of London to the King requesting another Parliament. The King refused, saying that the City was meddling in business that did not belong to it. In part due to the City's call for a new Parliament, King Charles II and his lawyers attempted to dissolve its corporate charter by use of a writ of Quo warranto. Partly in an attempt to regain the King's favour for the City, Treby made a loyal speech when presenting the new Sheriffs of London in September 1682, but the Quo warranto action continued. Treby argued at the Court of King's Bench that any wrongs committed had been performed by individuals, not by the City as a whole; it was therefore improper to attack the City for those actions. He also noted that while the Quo warranto writ was brought against the City Corporation and claimed that the Corporation's illegal acts had destroyed its corporate personality, it comprised a logical contradiction, being an attack on an organisation which the writ claimed had no legal existence. The latter point was brushed aside on the grounds that the corporation would only be destroyed if judgement was brought against it, which the court duly did. Judgement was deferred in the hopes that the City might surrender its charter to the King, but Treby convinced the City leaders to continue fighting, saying that to surrender would violate their oaths to uphold the rights of the City and its citizens. Despite this, judgement was entered in October 1683 and the corporation ceased its legal existence. Treby lost his Recordership and his position as JP in various counties. In 1684 the Borough of Plympton had a similar case brought against it and informed by the example of the City of London, it surrendered, Treby losing his Recordership there as well. In the elections to the 1685 Parliament Treby stood unsuccessfully against Richard Strode, a member of an old Devon gentry family of Newnham, Plympton St Mary, partially as a result of the Plympton Borough's charter having been re- drafted, which had damaged Treby's political standing.

He was reappointed as Recorder of London on 10 December 1688 and was again returned to Parliament for Plympton in 1689. He was named Solicitor General for England and Wales in March and Attorney General on 6 May 1689. While in Parliament he helped to draft the Bill of Rights (1689), a landmark document in British law. He was seemingly defeated in the March 1690 election, again by his near neighbour Richard Strode, but the result was overturned and voided by the House of Commons and Treby won the second vote two weeks later. In 1692 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and resigned his seat in the Commons and his Recordership. In 1693 he presided at the trial of William Anderton for libel and in 1695 and 1696 he was among the judges who tried the Association plotters. In 1700, after suffering illness, he moved to Kensington near London, with his wife and died there on 13 December. ==Builds Plympton House== Plympton House, Plympton St Maurice, south front.

Located in the Baltic Sea, it is part of Region Sj√¶lland (Region Zealand). As of 1 January 2013, it has 62,578 inhabitants.\\"Danmarks Statistik.\\" Retrieved 26 June 2010. ==Overview== Lolland is also known as the \\"pancake island\\" because of its flatness: the highest point of the entire island is above sea level, just outside the village of Horslunde. The island has been an important communication highway, among others for Nazi Germany during World War II. Historically, sugar beet has been grown in Lolland. Sugar is still a major industry, visible from the large number of sugar beet fields. The largest town of Lolland is Nakskov, with 12,600 residents. Other main towns are Maribo (6,000 residents), which hosts the seat of the Diocese of Lolland and Falster, Saksk√∏bing (3,500 residents) and R√∏dby (2,500 residents). Since January 1, 2007, Lolland has been administered by two municipalities, Lolland covering the western two thirds, and Guldborgsund uniting the eastern third with the neighbouring island Falster. Lolland has motor and railway links both to the island of Falster to the east and to Germany (the German island Fehmarn, linked to the mainland) via ferry. European route E47 links Copenhagen to Hamburg (Germany) via Lolland. ==Transport== Route E47 from Copenhagen crosses the Guldborgsund strait between Lolland and Falster via a modern tunnel, but the motorway currently terminates at R√∏dbyhavn where a ferry carries vehicles and trains to Fehmarn. This ferry, in continuous service since 1963, serves 6 passenger trains per day. Freight trains and night trains do not use the ferry; they take the longer way to the mainland via the Great Belt Bridge, then Funen and Jutland. The governments of Denmark and Germany plan to connect Lolland with Fehmarn by a future immersed tunnel, the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link. Two older bridges also span the strait between Lolland and Falster, the Frederick IX Bridge and Guldborgsund Bridge at the northern end of the strait. Frederick IX bridge is the railway bridge to Falster. ==DemographyTowns and villages== Population 1 January 2014. {  style=\\"float:left; margin- right:1em\\" -  Nakskov  align=\\"center\\" 12,866 -  Maribo  align=\\"center\\" 5,933 -  Saksk√∏bing  align=\\"center\\" 4.539 -  Sundby  align=\\"center\\" 2.847 -  R√∏dby  align=\\"center\\" 2,092 -  R√∏dbyhavn  align=\\"center\\" 1,634 -  S√∏llested  align=\\"center\\" 1,458 -  Holeby  align=\\"center\\" 1,423 } {  style=\\"float:left; margin- right:1em\\" -  Nysted  align=\\"center\\" 1,336 -  Bandholm  align=\\"center\\" 678 -  Horslunde  align=\\"center\\" 671 -  Toreby  align=\\"center\\" 628 -  Guldborg  align=\\"center\\" 572 -  Kettinge  align=\\"center\\" 539 -  N√∏rreballe  align=\\"center\\" 532 -  Nagelsti  align=\\"center\\" 497 } {  style=\\"float:left; margin- right:1em\\" -  Stokkemarke  align=\\"center\\" 440 -  Dannemare  align=\\"center\\" 434 -  Hunseby  align=\\"center\\" 418 -  Sandby  align=\\"center\\" 386 -  Gr√¶nge  align=\\"center\\" 380 -  Lang√∏, Lolland  align=\\"center\\" 319 -  Errindlev  align=\\"center\\" 298 -  Hillested  align=\\"center\\" 284 } {  style=\\"float:left; margin- right:1em\\" -  Ullerslev  align=\\"center\\" 276 -  Frejlev  align=\\"center\\" 264 -  √òster Ulslev  align=\\"center\\" 252 -  Branderslev  align=\\"center\\" 229 -  Radsted  align=\\"center\\" 215 -  Birket  align=\\"center\\" 214 -  Nordlunde  align=\\"center\\" 100 } ==Attractions== Trebuchet ready for firing at Middelaldercentret.

The Centre is an experimental living history museum and it contains a reconstructed part of a medieval town from around 1400. It is among the most authentic reconstructions of the medieval period in Europe, and holds both the largest and the oldest trebuchets in the world.

It was his duty to produce weights used in minting and often he would also be charged with the safekeeping of minting irons when they were not used in producing specie. The occupational name came from the French word gardien (= supervisor).

The NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts. Only two founding members, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are still in the league.The history of the Indianapolis Colts traces to a charter NFL franchise, the Dayton Triangles; however, the NFL officially considers the Colts to be a separate franchise founded in Baltimore in 1953. The Green Bay Acme Packers, founded in 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921, now the Green Bay Packers) are the oldest NFL franchise with continuous operation in the same location. League membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America Football Conference in 1950, of which only the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns survive to the present day. By 1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States. The rival American Football League was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts have helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games. ==Beginnings== Football was first professionalized in 1892, when Pudge Heffelfinger and Ben \\"Sport\\" Donnelly each received a large sum of cash to play for the Allegheny Athletic Association of the Western Pennsylvania Senior Independent Football Conference. Through the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century, professional football was primarily a regional sport, with most informal circuits centered around a single state or region with only limited play outside state lines. There were no national leagues or tournaments for the professional game, despite numerous attempts: an earlier National Football League (backed by what would become today's Major League Baseball) was unable to expand beyond Pennsylvania in 1902, the New York City-based World Series of Pro Football tournament disbanded after two seasons and lack of fan interest, and other attempts to either combine existing circuits or create new ones from scratch never materialized. The regional circuits had coalesced into more or fewer leagues of varying degrees of organization. One of the most prominent at the time was the Ohio League, which boasted the services of legendary Native American athlete Jim Thorpe, among other stars. Another was the somewhat lower-caliber, but better-organized, New York Pro Championship; two of the New York circuit's best teams, the Rochester Jeffersons and the Buffalo All-Stars, went on a barnstorming tour of Ohio in 1917. After the Jeffersons played, and lost badly to Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs in a 1917 match, Jefferson's owner Leo Lyons (believing that the foundation of a league could build a sport that rivaled baseball, which then held an effective monopoly on professional sport, in popularity) suggested to Thorpe that a league be formed.Carroll, Bob. THE CITY THAT HATED PRO FOOTBALL. Professional Football Researchers Association Coffin Corner. 1981. Lyons' vision of a national league of existing football clubs (which, at the time, was competing with another proposed league, again backed by baseball) was cut short by the United States' entry into World War I and further hampered by a flu pandemic in 1918, which forced most of the Ohio League teams to suspend operations due to either travel restrictions or loss of players to the war effort. New York's teams, although they were forced to reduce their schedules, continued and (along with the few other remaining teams that survived the suspension, including the OL's Dayton Triangles and Michigan's Detroit Heralds) picked up many of the stars that remained stateside. A particularly important team that played the 1918 season was the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets football team, which included future Hall of Famers Paddy Driscoll, George Halas and Jimmy Conzelman, all of whom were in the armed forces together and, despite some of them being professionals, competed against college football squads and won the 1919 Rose Bowl. These factors had the effect of spreading out the talent across a broader geographic area. Over the course of 1919, as professional football had increased in parity, teams began reaching out and participating in more barnstorming tours. By then, two informal but distinct interstate circuits had developed: one around the Eastern Seaboard (particularly New York City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia) that played mostly on Saturdays due to blue laws, and another centered around the Midwestern region (Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, and upstate New York) that played on Sundays. It was the latter that formed the basis of what would eventually become the modern National Football League. Ohio's teams went along with the idea in the face of escalating costs: several bidding wars in the early 1900s, both in Pennsylvania and Ohio, had damaged the sport significantly, and another bidding war was about to erupt if something was not done. By forming a national league, teams reasoned that it would eliminate the practices of looting other teams' rosters and concentrating top talent in only a few teams, thus distributing talent more evenly and efficiently thereby reducing costs for each individual team while still keeping a top-level product on the field. ==Birth of a new league== {  style=\\"margin:auto;\\" - ! colspan=\\"6\\"Teams in the 1920‚Äì1932 Era -  Akron Pros  Buffalo  Canton Bulldogs  Chicago Cardinals  Chicago Tigers  Cleveland Tigers -  Columbus Panhandles Dayton Triangles  Green Bay Packers Rock Island Independents  Toledo Maroons  Kenosha Maroons -  Decatur Staleys  Detroit  Hammond Pros  Muncie Flyers  Racine Legion Rochester Jeffersons } New Hayden Building in Columbus, Ohio, once the league's headquarters On August 20, 1920, at a Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, the league was formalized, originally as the American Professional Football Conference, initially consisting only of the Ohio League teams, although some of the teams declined participation. One month later on September 17, the league was renamed the American Professional Football Association, adding Buffalo and Rochester from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), and several other teams from nearby circuits. The eleven founding teams initially struck an agreement over player poaching and the declaration of an end-of-season champion. Thorpe, while still playing for the Bulldogs, was elected president. Only four of the founding teams finished the 1920 schedule and the undefeated Akron Pros claimed the first championship. Membership of the league increased to 22 teams - including more of the New York teams - in 1921, but throughout the 1920s the membership was unstable and the league was not a major national sport. On June 24, 1922, the organization, now headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, changed its title a final time to the National Football League.National Football League \\"NFL History by Decade\\" 2009. Two charter members, the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) and the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears), are still in existence. The Green Bay Packers franchise, founded in 1919, is the oldest team not to change locations, but did not begin league play until 1921. The New York Football Giants (now known as New York Giants) joined in 1925, followed by the Portsmouth Spartans in 1930, relocating to Detroit in 1934 to become the Lions.Footballresearch The heritage of the Indianapolis Colts includes several predecessors, including one of the league's founding teams, the Dayton Triangles. However, both the Colts and the NFL reckon the Colts as a separate franchise which was founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953. Although the original NFL teams representing Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit no longer exist, replacement franchises have since been established for those cities. Early championships were awarded to the team with the best won-lost record, initially rather haphazardly, as some teams played more or fewer games than others, or scheduled games against non-league, amateur or collegiate teams; this led to the title being decided on a tiebreaker in 1921, a disputed title in 1925, and the scheduling of an impromptu indoor playoff game in 1932. The lack of a firm league structure meant that numerous teams regularly were added and removed from the league each year; a franchise owner might trade in his franchise in one city for one in another (as was the case with the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs and Detroit Wolverines), and if a larger-market or more established team wanted a player on a smaller-market upstart, it could buy out the team outright and fold it to gain rights to that player, as the New York Giants did to the Wolverines in 1928 to get Benny Friedman. Cities that hosted NFL teams in the 1920s and 1930s. Cities that still have NFL teams from that era are in black, while other cities are in red. Only teams that played more than ten games in the NFL are included. In league meetings prior to the 1933 season, three new teams, the Pirates, the Cincinnati Reds and the Eagles, were admitted to the NFL.Note: Willis writes their entrance was approved on July 8, 1933. Willis, 2010, p. 310‚Äì311.Coenen, 2005, p. 237. Ten teams were then in the NFL and, at George Preston Marshall's urging, with Halas' support, the NFL was reorganized into an Eastern Division and a Western Division. In the Eastern Division were the Philadelphia Eagles, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Redskins (now the Washington Football Team), and the Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers) . In the Western Division were the Chicago Bears, Portsmouth Spartans, Chicago Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and the Cincinnati Reds. Furthermore, the two owners convinced the league to have the two division winners meet in an NFL Championship Game.Lyons, 2010 pg. 50 By 1934, all of the small-town teams, with the exception of the Green Bay Packers, had moved to or been replaced by teams in big cities, and even Green Bay had begun to play a portion of its home schedule in much larger Milwaukee for more support (a practice they continued well into the 1990s). In 1941, the corporate headquarters moved from Columbus, Ohio, to Chicago. During the early years of the league, rather than coming up with original team names, many NFL teams simply chose the name of the Major League Baseball team in the same city. Thus the Pittsburgh Steelers were the \\"Pittsburgh Pirates\\" for the first seven years of existence and other teams such as the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Buffalo Bisons all represented the NFL at one time or another. An annual draft of college players was first held in 1936.Peterson, 1997, p. 119.Williams, 2004 pp. 41‚Äì42. The first televised NFL game was on October 22, 1939 in a game the Eagles lost 23-14 to the host Dodgers at Ebbets Field.Algeo, 2006, p. 161-162.Peterson, 1997, p. 124-125. It was during this era, however, that the NFL became segregated: there were no black players in professional football in the United States between 1933 and 1945, mainly due to the influence of George Preston Marshall, who entered the league in 1932 as the owner of the Boston Braves. Other NFL owners emulated Marshall's whites-only policy to mollify southern fans, and even after the NFL's color barrier had been broken in the 1950s, Marshall's Washington Redskins remained all-white until forced to integrate by the Kennedy administration in 1962. Despite his bigotry, Marshall was selected as a charter member of the NFL-inspired Pro Football Hall of Fame, primarily for the numerous innovations (fixed schedules, separate conferences and championship games) Marshall encouraged during his time in the league. College football was the bigger attraction, but by the end of World War II, pro football began to rival the college game for fans' attention. Rule changes and innovations such as the T formation led to a faster-paced, higher-scoring game. The league also expanded out of its eastern and midwestern cradle; in 1945, the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles, becoming the first big-league sports franchise on the West Coast.With the exception of the various teams in ice hockey's Pacific Coast Hockey Association, which was a rival to the National Hockey League in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1950, the NFL accepted three teams - the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts - from the defunct All-America Football Conference, expanding to thirteen clubs. For a three-month period in 1950 the league was renamed the National-American Football League, that was subsequently changed back. In 1958, the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants played \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" for the championship. Being the first nationally televised football game, along with its thrilling ending greatly increased the popularity of the NFL. Through these breakthroughs, pro football finally earned its place as a major sport. Racial minorities The NFL's precursor, the American Professional Football Association, had several minority players, including African-American players: between 1920 and 1926, nine black players suited up for NFL squads. It was also common, due to the number of talented players that were produced by the Carlisle Indian School's football team, to see teams (both inside and outside the NFL) openly market Native Americans; in fact, the Oorang Indians of 1922 to 1923 consisted entirely of Native American talent. Running back Walter Achiu and quarterback Arthur Matsu, both of the Dayton Triangles, were the first Asian-American players in the NFL, having joined the league in 1927 and 1928 respectively. Ignacio Molinet and Jess Rodriguez were the first Hispanic players in the NFL and each played one season in 1927 and 1929 respectively. However, since Carlisle had closed in 1918, the talent pool of Indians had dried up. Meanwhile, all black players in the NFL (including future Hall of Famer Fritz Pollard) were summarily kicked out prior to the 1927 season for reasons unexplained . From 1928 to 1932, no more than one black player could be found in the league each season, and none played more than two seasons. In 1933, there were two: Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Lillard was kicked off the Chicago Cardinals for fighting, while Kemp left to pursue what would become a successful coaching career. The moves left the league as all-white, and Boston Redskins owner George Preston Marshall allegedly used his pressure to keep it that way for the next several years, though each team's internal politics and cronyism, as well as the rising tide of racism in the United States as a whole, also played a significant role. Even during the wartime years, when much of the NFL's talent was overseas fighting World War II, players such as Kenny Washington who stayed in the United States were still passed up in favor of white players with normally debilitating medical conditions such as partial blindness. NFL integration occurred only when the Cleveland Rams wanted to move to Los Angeles, and the venue, the Los Angeles Coliseum, required them to integrate their team. They then signed two black players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.Sports Illustrated, October 12, 2009 Other NFL teams eventually followed suit, but Marshall refused to integrate the Redskins until forced to by the Kennedy administration as a condition for using D.C. Stadium (now RFK Stadium). In spite of this open bias, Marshall was elected to the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. In 1946, the Cleveland Browns of a rival Professional Football league, the All- America Football Conference, signed two black players. Teams would often add black players and release them soon after to give an appearance of recruiting more black football players. By 1960, the NFL's new competitor, the American Football League, actively recruited players from smaller predominantly black colleges that had been largely ignored by the NFL, giving those schools' black players the opportunity to play professional football. Early AFL teams averaged more blacks than did their NFL counterparts. However, despite the NFL's previous segregationist policies, the clear competitive advantage of AFL teams with liberal signing policies affected the NFL's drafts. By 1969, a comparison of the two leagues' championship team photos showed the AFL's Chiefs with 23 black players out of 51 players (45%) pictured, while the NFL's Vikings had 11 blacks, of 42 players (26%) in the photo. Chiefs players have been quoted as saying that one motivating factor in their defeat of the Vikings in Super Bowl IV was their pride in their diverse squad. Recent surveys have shown that the current, post-merger NFL is approximately 67-71% non-white (this includes African Americans, Polynesians, non-white Hispanics, Asians, and people that are mixed race), significantly higher than the national average; certain positions, such as cornerback and running back, are almost entirely black. ==Merger with the American Football League== AFL (red) and NFL (blue/black) teams at the time of the merger. Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Baltimore moved from the NFL to the AFC after the merger. In 1946, after World War II, the struggling league had headquarters in Chicago. Commissioner Elmer Layden could not handle the pressure of the AFL set up in the same year. DeBenneville Bert Bell was hired to be the commissioner, and he accepted the office only on condition that the headquarters would move to Philadelphia. Bell had played for the Eagles, and for Penn before that. Till 1959, when he died of a heart attack at Steelers-Eagles game at Franklin Field, the headquarters of NFL were on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, and Bert Bell had transformed the NFL into a commercial and popular success. Within a short period of his death, the NFL offices were moved to Manhattan, where they remain to this day. The NFL held a monopoly on professional football in the United States for most of the 1950s, a rare occurrence for a league that had at least one competing league in every year since 1934. By 1960, a group of potential professional football owners that would become known as the Foolish Club had become frustrated with their efforts to buy into the NFL (some were NFL franchise minority owners such as Harry Wismer and Ralph Wilson; others, such as Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams, had tried but failed to buy NFL teams) and formed a new league, the American Football League. It was the eighth professional football league to use the name and the fourth to be universally considered a major-league competitor to the NFL. The AFL would prove to be the NFL's most formidable challenger to date. By the middle of the 1960s competition for players, including separate college drafts, was driving up player salaries. In 1965, in the most high-profile such contest and a major boost to the AFL, University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath signed with the New York Jets rather than the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals for a then-record $427,000. In 1966, the NFL's New York Giants broke an informal agreement and signed placekicker Pete Gogolak, who was under contract to the AFL's Buffalo Bills. Then AFL Commissioner Al Davis embarked on a campaign to sign players away from the NFL, especially quarterbacks, but behind the scenes a number of NFL team owners began action to end the detrimental rivalry. Several NFL franchises led by Cowboys General Manager Tex Schramm asked to meet with AFL owners to negotiate a merger. In an agreement brokered by Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt, the two leagues announced their merger deal on June 8, 1966. The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end-of-season World Championship Game between the two league champions (later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game). Still another city received an NFL franchise thanks to the AFL, as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana's federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89-800, which permitted the merger and exempted the action from antitrust restrictions. The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress. In 1970, the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams. Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL, three NFL teams - the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and Baltimore Colts - moved to the AFC, the conference containing the AFL teams. Two other teams, the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were also added to the NFL as part of the merger agreement. (These two teams were not added until 1976; during the early 1970s, there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL, and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities. Once the Bills and Patriots built new stadiums and solidified their place in their home markets, the NFL awarded Seattle and Tampa Bay expansion franchises of their own.) There was also a financial settlement, with the AFL teams paying a combined $18 million over 20 years. Although the AFL's identity was subsumed by the NFL, the NFL eventually adopted many of the AFL's innovations including the on-field game clock, names on player jerseys, recruiting at small and predominantly black colleges, gate and television revenue-sharing, establishment of southern franchises, and more wide-open offensive rules. Unlike previous armed conflicts such as World War I and World War II, both of which effectively stopped or dramatically reduced the amount of professional football played in the United States, both the AFL and NFL were largely unaffected by the Vietnam War and did not lose a significant number of players to the war draft. There is at least one recorded incidence of the NFL using champagne units to keep its players from being sent overseas (the Dallas Cowboys used the Texas Air National Guard's 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, a well-known champagne unit to shield seven Cowboys players from combat in Vietnam). Bob Kalsu, then a player with the AFL's Buffalo Bills, left the team to serve in Vietnam and died in combat; he was the only casualty of the Vietnam War that the league would sustain. (Don Steinbrunner, who briefly played for the Cleveland Browns, also died in Vietnam, but he left the NFL over a decade before his deployment there.) ==Modern era== In the 1970s and 1980s, the NFL solidified its dominance as America's top spectator sport, and its important role in American culture. The Super Bowl became an unofficial national holiday and the top-rated TV program most years. Monday Night Football, which first aired in 1970, brought in high ratings by mixing sports and entertainment. Rule changes in the late 1970s ensured a fast-paced game with much passing to attract the casual fan. The World Football League was the first post-merger challenge to the NFL's dominance, and in 1974, successfully lured some top NFL talent to its league and prompted a few rules changes in the NFL. However, financial problems led the league to fold halfway through its 1975 season. Two teams, the Birmingham Vulcans and Memphis Southmen, made unsuccessful efforts to move from the WFL to the NFL. The founding of the United States Football League in the early 1980s would prove to be the longest sustained challenge to the NFL's dominance since the 1970 merger, lasting three seasons. The USFL was a relatively well-financed competitor with big- name players and a national television contract, but overspending on that talent and a decision to move its niche spring operation into a head-to-head competition with the NFL in the fall (abandoning some of its biggest cities in the process) over the objections of many of its original owners were two major factors in the league's demise. The league's last-ditch effort to sue the NFL for hundreds of millions of dollars in antitrust damages, while a technical victory, failed to secure the funds the USFL needed to survive. The XFL was established in 2001 as an attempt by Vince McMahon and NBC, which had lost the NFL broadcast rights for that year, to compete with the league; the XFL folded after just one season. Unlike the WFL and USFL, the XFL had no impact on the NFL's rules or franchise locations, but a few NFL players used the XFL to relaunch their careers, and the league, while still considered a failure, has been reassessed in the 2010s and earned some greater respect for its attempt at integrating sports entertainment and innovative presentations into professional football. McMahon plans to relaunch the XFL in 2020. The United Football League, which began play in 2009, had originally planned to take a direct challenge to the NFL with NFL-comparable salaries and teams in New York City and Los Angeles, but the UFL never did play in those cities (an ostensibly New York team played in Long Island and New Jersey), cut back its salaries, and instead opted for a complementary approach with teams in cities such as Las Vegas, Sacramento and Omaha; after four years, the UFL folded due to massive financial losses. Numerous other leagues have attempted to form over the years, but none have succeeded in having any level of competition comparable to the NFL (most never made it to their first game). On August 31, 2007, a story in USA Today unveiled the first changes to the league's shield logo since 1980, which took effect with the 2008 season. The redesign reduced the number of stars in the logo from 25 (which were found not to have a meaning beyond being decorative) to eight (for each of the league's divisions), repositioned the football in the manner of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and changed the NFL letters to a straight, serifed font. The redesign was created with television and digital media, along with clothing, in mind. The shield logo itself dates back to the 1940s. == Women == In 1987, through a short stint with NBC Sports, Gayle Sierens became the first woman to do play- by-play for an NFL regular season football game when she called the December 27 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Kansas City Chiefs. She was originally to be a regular play-by-play announcer for the season, but a contract dispute with WFLA prevented her from continuing in that role beyond her lone game. In May 2017, Beth Mowins was reported by Sports Illustrateds Richard Deitsch to be the chosen play-by-play announcer on ESPN's Monday Night Football opening week late broadcast between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos. She did that announcing job in September of that year, and thus became the first woman to call a nationally televised NFL game; in contrast to Sierens, Mowins has been a semi-regular broadcaster for the NFL since then. In 2018 Hannah Storm and Andrea Kremer became the first all-female broadcast team to call an NFL game, which they did for an Amazon Prime stream of Thursday Night Football. Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, in a pre-season matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the San Diego Chargers. In 2015 Sarah Thomas became the first full-time female official in NFL history. On March 3, 2013, Lauren Silberman became the first woman to ever try out for the NFL when she appeared as a kicker at the NFL Regional Scouting Combine in Florham Park, New Jersey. However, after two poor kicks, Silberman left the field, citing an injury to her quadriceps; the tryout was suspected by members of the press and public as being nothing more than a publicity stunt. Olympic pole-vaulter Jenn Suhr publicly expressed interest in attending an NFL scouting combine in 2014, but did not indicate what position she would play.Gold-medalist expresses interest in joining Bills. BuffaloBills.com (January 21, 2014). Retrieved January 22, 2014. On July 27, 2015, the Arizona Cardinals hired Jennifer Welter as an assistant coaching intern for training camp and the preseason; as such, she is believed to be the first female coach in the NFL. The Buffalo Bills hired Kathryn Smith as an assistant special teams coach for the 2016 season making Smith the first full-time female assistant coach in the NFL. In 2017, Katie Sowers was hired as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers. Later that year, she came out as gay becoming the NFL's first openly LGBT coach and the first openly LGBT coach in U.S. men's professional sports. In 2020, the 49ers played in Super Bowl LIV making Sowers the first female and first openly gay coach in Super Bowl history. ==International expansion== In recent years, the NFL has expanded into new markets and ventures outside of the United States, beginning with a regular series of exhibition games known as the American Bowl, then with a European-based developmental league culminating in the now defunct NFL Europa, and starting in 2005 the league began hosting regular season games outside the United States, the first in Mexico City, Mexico, and then from 2007 hosting games in London, England, and from 2008 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The American Bowl games began in 1986 and continued until 2005 at various sites in countries around the world. Then in 1991, the league formed the World League of American Football, later known as NFL Europe and still later as NFL Europa, a developmental league that had teams in Britain, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. The NFL shut down the program in June 2007. The league played a regular-season NFL game in Mexico City in 2005, the first-ever NFL regular season game held outside the United States, and marketed across the league as the F√∫tbol Americano game. On October 28, 2007, a regular season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants was held outside of North America for the first time in Wembley Stadium, the 90,000-seat national stadium, in London. It was a financial success with nearly 40,000 tickets sold within ninety minutes of the start of sales, and a game-day attendance of over 80,000. In 2008, the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers played at Wembley, and in October 2009, the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers met. In 2010, it was the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers that played in London. Starting from the 2008‚Äì09 season, building on league links with Toronto, the Buffalo Bills play an annual home game in Toronto's Rogers Centre, marketed by the team as the Bills Toronto Series. In 2014, the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons played at Wembley Stadium. In 2016, the Raiders and Texans played a game in Estadio Azteca, Mexico. The Raiders and Patriots played here in 2017. After 100 years of American football influence in Mexican territory, in 1998 the NFL opened a representation office in Mexico, called NFL M√©xico, as the NFL identified Mexico as a key market outside the United States due to proximity and tradition. The Mexican office handles sponsorship, licensing, detail dealers, sport culture, broadcasting, public relationships and community service. ==Franchise relocations and mergers== In the early years, the league was not stable and teams moved frequently. Franchise mergers were popular during World War II in response to the scarcity of players. An example of this was the Steagles, temporarily formed as a merger between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles. Franchise moves became far more controversial in the late twentieth century when a vastly more popular NFL was free from financial instability and allowed many franchises to abandon long-held strongholds for perceived financially greener pastures. This was done in spite of the promises to Congress by Pete Rozelle in 1966 that if the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger were allowed, no city would lose its franchise. Those promises were made to ensure passage of PL 89-800, which granted antitrust immunity to the merged professional football leagues. While owners invariably cited financial difficulties as the primary factor in such moves, many fans bitterly disputed these contentions, especially in Cleveland (the Rams and the Browns), Baltimore (the Colts), Houston (the Oilers), and St. Louis (the Cardinals and the Rams), each of which eventually received teams some years after their original franchises left (the Browns, another Browns, Ravens, Texans, and Rams, respectively). Notably, the second-largest media market in the United States, Los Angeles, did not have an NFL team from 1994, after both the Raiders and the Rams relocated elsewhere, until 2016, when the Rams returned. The San Diego Chargers, who played their inaugural season in Los Angeles before spending the next 55 years in San Diego, returned to Los Angeles following the 2016 season. The Oakland Raiders (who themselves relocated to Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994 before returning to Oakland in 1995) relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada in 2020. The driving force behind the 2010s relocations was not directly related to finances, as the league was lucrative and stable by this point; instead, the promise of better stadiums drove those relocations. ==Popularity== While baseball is known as \\"America's national pastime,\\" football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States. According to the Harris Poll, professional football moved ahead of baseball as the fans' favorite in 1965, during the emergence of the NFL's challenger, the American Football League, as a major professional football league. Football has remained America's favorite sport ever since. In a Harris Poll conducted in 2008, the NFL was the favorite sport of as many people (30%) as the combined total of the next three professional sports - baseball (15%), auto racing (10%), and hockey (2%).http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research- Professional-Football-Still-Americas-Favorite-Sport-2008-02.pdf Professional Football Still America‚Äôs Favorite Sport Additionally, football's American television viewership ratings now surpass those of other sports, although football season comprises far fewer games than the seasons of other sports.National Football League, \\"NFL:America's Choice\\", January 2007, However, the Harris Poll only allows one unaided selection of a \\"favorite sport.\\" Other studies and polls such as the ESPN Sports Poll and the studies released by the Associated Press (AP) and conducted by Sports Marketing Group (SMG) from 1988 to 2004, show far higher levels of popularity for NFL football since they list from thirty to over 100 sports that each respondent must rate. According to the AP, the SMG polls from 1988 to 2004 show NFL football to be the most popular spectator sport in America. The AP stated that \\"In the most detailed survey ever of America's sports tastes\\" researching \\"114 spectator sports they might attend, follow on television or radio or read about in newspapers or magazines, the NFL topped all sports with 39 percent of Americans saying they loved it or considered it one of their favorites.\\" In a 2003 study conducted by SMG and released by the AP, the NFL was loved or liked a lot by 42.8% of Americans over 18.CNN; AP; 9/27/03 The NFL has the highest per-game attendance of any domestic professional sports league in the world. The NFL's overall attendance, however, is only approximately 20 percent of Major League Baseball, because of the latter's longer schedule (162-game scheduled regular season).An ingredient in the rise of American football's popularity in comparison with baseball is the innovation of television. Television can capture most if not all the lineup in an American football game, but player positioning on a baseball field is too diffused to appear usefully on one screen. A 2007 Turnkey Sports & Entertainment's Team Brand Index for \\"team loyalty\\" ranked NFL teams in twelve of the top twenty-five spots out of 122 total between the four major sports leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers and their fanbase had the top spot, while the New England Patriots, and Indianapolis Colts had the following two spots, followed by the New Orleans Saints at number seven and the Green Bay Packers and their fanbase ranked at number ten. The Arizona Cardinals finished last in the entire survey of 122 teams, though the survey was taken before the team's appearance against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII. ==National Anthem controversy== In the 2016 preseason, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat and later knelt during the national anthem. He did it in protest of racial injustice and police brutality, and he referenced a series of African-American deaths caused by law enforcement. Inspired by Kaepernick, other NFL players conducted various forms of silent protests during the national anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising him and his stand against racism and others (in particular, right-wing politicians and media figures) denouncing the protests. In September 2017 after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should \\"fire\\" players who protest the national anthem. In May 2018, the NFL prohibited players from kneeling in protests during the national anthem. During an interview, President Trump said that the NFL did \\"the right thing\\" of releasing the new policy. He added, \\"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn‚Äôt be playing. You shouldn‚Äôt be there. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be in the country.\\"Following his departure from the 49ers in 2016, Kaepernick went unsigned through the off- season and 2017 training camps, leading to allegations that he was being blackballed because of his on-field political statements as opposed to his performance. In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing league owners of collusion to keep him out of the league. On February 15, 2019, it was announced that Kaepernick reached a confidential settlement with the NFL and withdrew the grievance. In June 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, The New York Times wrote that the NFL had wrestled with the issue of race, noting that three-quarters of NFL players are African-American, yet nearly every NFL team owner is white (and several are prominent Trump supporters). Goodell put out a statement where he apologized for not listening to the concerns of African-American players. The Times wrote that Goodell's \\"words were panned as hypocritical because of the league owners‚Äô rejection of Kaepernick.\\" Michael Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"Mainstream white America is going to reconsider Kaepernick at some point ‚Äî the way it reconsidered Muhammad Ali years after he refused to go to Vietnam, the way it reconsidered Jackie Robinson and Jack Johnson. Progress comes in fits and starts, and this country tends to punish those who urge it to move faster. The reconsideration of Kaepernick has begun.\\" == See also == * Timeline of the National Football League * History of American football * History of the National Football League championship * Homosexuality in American football * United States antitrust law * History of the NFL Commissioner == References Sources== * Algeo, Matthew (2006), Last Team Standing.

They are named after the anemone, a terrestrial flowering plant, because of the colourful appearance of many. Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra. Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. A typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the surface of the water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit. Sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through the mouth into the sea. The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, settle on the seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps. Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild. ==Anatomy== Sea anemone anatomy. 1. Tentacles 2. Mouth 3. Retracting muscles 4. Gonads 5. Acontial filaments 6. Pedal disk 7. Ostium 8. Coelenteron 9. Sphincter muscle 10. Mesentery 11. Column 12. Pharynx A typical sea anemone is a sessile polyp attached at the base to the surface beneath it by an adhesive foot, called a basal or pedal disc, with a column-shaped body topped by an oral disc. Most are from in diameter and in length, but they are inflatable and vary greatly in dimensions. Some are very large; Urticina columbiana and Stichodactyla mertensii can both exceed a metre in diameter and Metridium farcimen a metre in length. Some species burrow in soft sediment and lack a basal disc, having instead a bulbous lower end, the physa, which anchors them in place. The column or trunk is generally more or less cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and is known as the capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted. The oral disc has a central mouth, usually slit-shaped, surrounded by one or more whorls of tentacles. The ends of the slit lead to grooves in the wall of the pharynx known as siphonoglyphs; there are usually two of these grooves, but some groups have a single one. The tentacles are generally tapered and often tipped by a pore, but in some species they are branched, club-tipped, or reduced to low knobs. The tentacles are armed with many cnidocytes, cells that are both defensive and used to capture prey. Cnidocytes contain stinging nematocysts, capsule-like organelles capable of everting suddenly, giving the phylum Cnidaria its name. Each nematocyst contains a small venom vesicle filled with actinotoxins, an inner filament, and an external sensory hair. A touch to the hair mechanically triggers a cell explosion, which launches a harpoon-like structure that attaches to the organism that triggered it, and injects a dose of venom in the flesh of the aggressor or prey. At the base of the tentacles in some species lie acrorhagi, elongated inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; one or both anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles. Actinodendron arboreum, the hell's fire anemone The venom is a mix of toxins, including neurotoxins, that paralyzes the prey so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinotoxins are highly toxic to prey species of fish and crustaceans. However, Amphiprioninae (clownfish), small banded fish in various colours, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected (see Mutualistic relationships). Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few highly toxic species (notably Actinodendron arboreum, Phyllodiscus semoni and Stichodactyla spp.) have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal. Digestive system Sea anemones have what can be described as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonoglyph, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity. The mouth opens into a flattened pharynx. This consists of an in-folding of the body wall, and is therefore lined by the animal's epidermis. The pharynx typically runs for about one third the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that occupies the remainder of the body. The gastrovascular cavity itself is divided into a number of chambers by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge at the base of the pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence. Musculature and nervous system Striped colonial anemone A primitive nervous system, without centralization, coordinates the processes involved in maintaining homeostasis, as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis and one in the gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the septa with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors. The muscles and nerves are much simpler than those of most other animals, although more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles because they are not freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter. Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the contractile cells pull against the fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which acts as a valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body is also used to anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube. ==Lifecycle== Brooding anemone (Epiactis prolifera) with developing young Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other anthozoans) entirely lack the free-swimming medusal stage of their lifecycle; the polyp produces eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which develops directly into another polyp. Both sexual and asexual reproduction can occur. The sexes in sea anemones are separate in some species, while other species are sequential hermaphrodites, changing sex at some stage in their life. The gonads are strips of tissue within the mesenteries. In sexual reproduction, males may release sperm to stimulate females to release eggs, and fertilization occurs, either internally in the gastrovascular cavity or in the water column. The eggs and sperm, or the larvae, are ejected through the mouth. In many species the eggs and sperm rise to the surface where fertilisation occurs. The fertilized egg develops into a planula larva, which drifts for a while before sinking to the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into a juvenile sea anemone. Some larvae preferentially settle onto certain suitable substrates, The mottled anemone (Urticina crassicornis) for example, settles onto green algae, perhaps attracted by a biofilm on the surface. The brooding anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as a female and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self- fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives. Sea anemones have great powers of regeneration and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some species such as certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc at the base of the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks. The sea anemone Aiptasia diaphana displays sexual plasticity. Thus asexually produced clones derived form a single founder individual can contain both male and female individuals (ramets). When eggs and sperm (gametes) are formed, they can produce zygotes derived from ‚Äúselfing‚Äù (within the founding clone) or out-crossing, that then develop into swimming planula larvae. Anemones tend to grow and reproduce relatively slowly. The magnificent sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica) for example, may live for decades, with one individual surviving in captivity for eighty years. ==Behaviour and ecology== Assortment of sea anemones from Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur Movement A sea anemone is capable of changing its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth. Locomotion Although some species of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the majority are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend to stay in the same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal. The sea onion Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself in place by expanding its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.Molodtsova, T. (2015). Cerianthidae.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 13 July 2017 Feeding and diet Tentacles of Aulactinia veratra catch passing prey and thrust it into the mouth in the middle of the oral disc Venus flytrap sea anemone is a suspension feeder and orients itself to face the current Sea anemones are typically predators, ensnaring prey of suitable size that comes within reach of their tentacles and immobilizing it with the aid of their nematocysts. The prey is then transported to the mouth and thrust into the pharynx. The lips can stretch to aid in prey capture and can accommodate larger items such as crabs, dislodged molluscs and even small fish. Stichodactyla helianthus is reported to trap sea urchins by enfolding them in its carpet-like oral disc. A few species are parasitic on other marine organisms. One of these is Peachia quinquecapitata, the larvae of which develop inside the medusae of jellyfish, feeding on their gonads and other tissues, before being liberated into the sea as free-living, juvenile anemones. Mutualistic relationships Although not plants and therefore incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that reside in the animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from the products of the algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro- feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey. Ocellaris clownfish among the tentacles of a sebae anemone Several species of fish and invertebrates live in symbiotic or mutualistic relationships with sea anemones, most famously the clownfish. The symbiont receives the protection from predators provided by the anemone's stinging cells, and the anemone utilises the nutrients present in its faeces. Other animals that associate with sea anemones include cardinalfish (such as Banggai cardinalfish), juvenile threespot dascyllus,Lieske, E.; Myers, R. (1999).

Two of the more unusual relationships are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones live on the shell of the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.Karplus, I; G.C. Fiedler; and P. Ramcharan (1998). The intraspecific fighting behavior of the Hawaiian Boxing Crab, Lybia edmondsoni ‚Äì Fighting with dangerous weapons? Symbiosis 24: 287‚Äì302. Habitats Sea anemones are found in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The greatest diversity is in the tropics although there are many species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic. ==Relationship with humans== Sea anemones and their attendant anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits and both are often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed. In southern Italy and southwestern Spain, the snakelocks anemone (Anemonia viridis) is consumed as a delicacy. The whole animal is marinated in vinegar, then coated in a batter similar to that used to make calamari and deep-fried in olive oil. ==Fossil record== (2) and (3) Mackenzia, Middle Cambrian. Sea anemones do not fossilize well, having no hard parts, and this one was mistakenly identified as a sea cucumber. Most Actiniaria do not form hard parts that can be recognized as fossils, but a few fossils of sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea anemone. ==Taxonomy== Sea anemones, order Actiniaria, are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. Rodriguez et al. proposed a new classification for the Actiniaria based on extensive DNA results. Suborders and Superfamilies included in Actiniaria are: * Suborder Anenthemonae ** Superfamily Edwardsioidea ** Superfamily Actinernoidea * Suborder Enthemonae ** Superfamily Actinostoloidea ** Superfamily Actinioidea ** Superfamily Metridioidea ==Phylogeny== External relationships Anthozoa contains three subclasses: Hexacorallia, which contains the Actiniaria; Octocorallia; and Ceriantharia. These are monophyletic, but the relationships within the subclasses remain unresolved. Internal relationships The relationships of higher-level taxa in Carlgren'sCarlgren O. (1949).

Selected annually since the 1930s from the university‚Äôs student body, the mascot is a popular tradition at the school. The Mountaineer appears in a buckskin costume at West Virginia Mountaineers football games, men's and women's basketball matches, and other University-sponsored events. ==History== Boyd \\"Slim\\" Arnold, the first Mountaineer mascot to don the traditional buckskin uniform. His selection in 1937 marked the beginning of an official process to appoint the mascot annually. Daily Athenaeum articles indicate that designating individuals to serve as the Mountaineer started as early as 1927. The name is derived from \\"Mountain State\\", meaning West Virginia. Clay Crouse was designated that year, followed in 1932 by Burton Crow and then Bill Fahey. It was not until 1934-35 when track runner Lawson Hill was selected that a more stable process was established. By 1937, the Mountaineer was being selected on an annual basis by Mountain Honorary. Beginning in 1934, The Monticola (the WVU yearbook) sponsored a contest to determine the male senior who had contributed most to the university throughout his four years in college. This male was entitled to be ‚ÄúThe Mountaineer‚Äù. During the next decade the criterion was amended to specify a person who was suitable for the role. In the 1930s, the unofficial mascot appeared at WVU sporting events carrying a muzzle-loading rifle while wearing a flannel shirt, a sheep or bearskin vest, and a coonskin cap. Volunteers including Burton ‚ÄúIrish‚Äù Crow, Lawson Hill, and William ‚ÄúBuckwheat‚Äù Jackson made appearances throughout the season. Boyd H. \\"Slim\\" Arnold, a physical education major from Bayard, West Virginia, was the first Mountaineer selected to serve three years in succession (1937‚Äì39) and was the longest tenured until Rock Wilson equaled it from 1991‚Äì93. During Arnold's tenure, he became the first Mountaineer to wear the now traditional buckskin uniform. Meeting minutes from the late 1930s indicate that a donor gave the Honorary several deerskins, asking that a buckskin costume be made for the Mountaineer. In 1944, WVU did not choose a Mountaineer mascot due to World War II. The 1950 Mountaineer Weekend brought about an idea for a Mountaineer mascot statue, raising funds from a carnival held in the Field House (now Stansbury Hall) and subsequent Mountaineer Week celebrations. Proceeds raised allowed for the procurement of a bronze Mountaineer statue, commissioned by Donald De Lue and formally dedicated on October 2, 1971. Today the statue remains situated on the front lawn of the Mountainlair student union. The Mountaineer was first used in commerce in 1972, and was registered as a U.S. trademark in 1985. Mountaineers' retired rifles and costumes are housed in a glass case in the Vandalia Lounge of the Mountainlair, located on the downtown campus. Natalie Tennant, who became the West Virginia secretary of state in January 2009, served as the first female Mountaineer in 1990. Rebecca Durst, in 2009, became the only other woman so far to fill the role. ==Selection== The Mountaineer is a member of the student body chosen by the Mountaineer Selection Committee for outstanding enthusiasm, character, service to the community, and academics. The selected Mountaineer receives a tuition waiver or scholarship in return for their service. ==Duties== The role has remained substantially unchanged since its origins. The costume is tailored to fit each year's winner, and male Mountaineers customarily grow beards during their tenure, though this is not required. The rifle is a custom-built percussion rifle that since 1977 has been built and maintained by Marvin Wotring (WVU alumnus 1965). This style of rifle requires the user to become schooled in the amount of powder required to fire the charge. The responsibilities of the Mountaineer mascot are set forth by the Mountaineer Advisory Committee Manual Regulations. The Mountaineer must attend every away and home West Virginia Mountaineers football game, as well as all home men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball games. They might also be required to travel with the team as determined by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. The Mountaineer leads the football team onto Mountaineer Field every game, firing the rifle into the air. The Mountaineer leads the fans, along with the cheerleaders, on the football field and the basketball court in the Let‚Äôs Go Mountaineers cheer and other cheers. The mascot is encouraged to attend certain alumni events and community events, and visit the WVU Children's Hospital. The Mountaineer may make close to 400 appearances per year. He or she is also responsible for the cleaning, care, and handling of the rifle, which no one else is allowed to fire, except for the alternate Mountaineer. The Mountaineer is expected to follow a proper code of conduct at all times. While in costume, the mascot cannot use alcohol or tobacco, accept money or gifts for appearances, or endorse a company or product for profit. Until 1993 there was no formal term limit for the Mountaineer. That year, a two year term limit was introduced, and in February 2018 a one year term limit was imposed by the Mountaineer Advisory Committee. ==Other schools with a Mountaineer mascot== *Appalachian State University *Berea College *Eastern Oklahoma State College *Eastern Oregon University *Mansfield University *Mount St. Mary's University *Schreiner College *Southern Vermont College *Western State College ==List of MountaineersReferences== * * * ==External links== * http://www.wvu.edu Category:West Virginia University Category:Big 12 Conference mascots ","title":"West Virginia Mountaineer"},{"id":"19333662","text":"Human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labour, sexual slavery, or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others. This may encompass providing a spouse in the context of forced marriage, or the extraction of organs or tissues, including for surrogacy and ova removal. Human trafficking can occur within a country or trans-nationally. Human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation. Human trafficking is the trade in people, especially women and children, and does not necessarily involve the movement of the person from one place to another. People smuggling (also called human smuggling and migrant smuggling) is a related practice which is characterized by the consent of the person being smuggled. Smuggling situations can descend into human trafficking through coercion and exploitation.International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, 9-10 Trafficked people are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), forced labour alone (one component of human trafficking) generates an estimated $150 billion in profits per annum as of 2014. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 21 million victims are trapped in modern-day slavery. Of these, 14.2 million (68%) were exploited for labour, 4.5 million (22%) were sexually exploited, and 2.2 million (10%) were exploited in state-imposed forced labour. The International Labour Organization has reported that child workers, minorities, and irregular migrants are at considerable risk of more extreme forms of exploitation. Statistics shows that over half of the world's 215 million young workers are observed to be in hazardous sectors, including forced sex work and forced street begging. Ethnic minorities and highly marginalized groups of people are highly estimated to work in some of the most exploitative and damaging sectors, such as leather tanning, mining, and stone quarry work. Human trafficking is the third largest crime industry in the world, behind drug dealing and arms trafficking, and is the fastest-growing activity of trans-national criminal organizations. Human trafficking is condemned as a violation of human rights by international conventions. In addition, human trafficking is subject to a directive in the European Union. According to a report by the U.S. State Department, Belarus, Iran, Russia, and Turkmenistan remain among the worst countries when it comes to providing protection against human trafficking and forced labour. == Definition == Although human trafficking can occur at local or domestic levels, it has international implications, as recognized by the United Nations in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (also referred to as the Trafficking Protocol or the Palermo Protocol), an international agreement under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC) which entered into force on 25 December 2003. The protocol is one of three which supplement the CTOC. The Trafficking Protocol is the first global, legally binding instrument on trafficking in over half a century, and the only one with an agreed-upon definition of trafficking in persons. One of its purposes is to facilitate international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting such trafficking. Another is to protect and assist human trafficking's victims with full respect for their rights as established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Trafficking Protocol, which had 117 signatories and as of November, 2018 173 parties, defines human trafficking as: ==Revenue== In 2014, the International Labour Organization estimated $150 billion in annual profit is generated from forced labour alone. ==Usage of the term== Human trafficking activists at 10 Downing Street, London Trafficked people are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. The work or services may include anything from bonded or forced labour to commercial sexual exploitation. The arrangement may be structured as a work contract, but with no or low payment, or on terms which are highly exploitative. Sometimes the arrangement is structured as debt bondage, with the victim not being permitted or able to pay off the debt. Bonded labour, or debt bondage, is probably the least known form of labour trafficking today, and yet is the most widely used method of enslaving people. Victims become \\"bonded\\" when their labour, the labour which they themselves hired and the tangible goods they have bought are demanded as a means of repayment for a loan or service whose terms and conditions have not been defined, or where the value of the victims' services is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt. Generally, the value of their work is greater than the original sum of money \\"borrowed\\". Forced labour is a situation in which people are forced to work against their will under the threat of violence or some other form of punishment; their freedom is restricted and a degree of ownership is exerted. Men and women are at risk of being trafficked for unskilled work, which globally generates US$31 billion according to the International Labour Organization.\\"A global alliance against forced labour\\", ILO, 11 May 2005. Forms of forced labour can include domestic servitude, agricultural labour, sweatshop factory labour, janitorial, food service and other service industry labour, and begging. Some of the products that can be produced by forced labour are: clothing, cocoa, bricks, coffee, cotton, and gold. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), the single largest global provider of services to victims of trafficking, reports receiving an increasing number of cases in which victims were subjected to forced labour. A 2012 study observes that \\"‚Ä¶ 2010 was particularly notable as the first year in which IOM assisted more victims of labour trafficking than those who had been trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation.\\" The IOMs' main focus is \\"to provide secure, reliable, flexible and cost-effective services for persons who require international migration assistance. To enhance the humane and orderly management of migration and the effective respect for the human rights of migrations in accordance with international law. To offer advice, research, technical cooperation and operational assistance to States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders, in order to build national capacities and facilitate international, regional and bilateral cooperation on migration matters...\\" Child labour is a form of work that may be hazardous to the physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development of children and can interfere with their education. According to the International Labour Organization, the global number of children involved in child labour has fallen during the past decadeit has declined by one third, from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million children in 2012. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest incidence of child labour, while the largest numbers of child-workers are found in Asia and the Pacific. ==General== thumbA schematic showing global human trafficking from countries of origin and destination Countries of origin Countries of destination Countries shown in grey are neither countries of origin nor countries of destination thumbA world map showing the legislative situation in different countries to prevent female trafficking according to WomanStats Project. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has further assisted many non-governmental organizations in their fight against human trafficking. The 2006 armed conflict in Lebanon, which saw 300,000 domestic workers from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and the Philippines jobless and targets of traffickers, led to an emergency information campaign with NGO Caritas Migrant to raise human-trafficking awareness. Additionally, an April 2006 report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, helped to identify 127 countries of origin, 98 transit countries and 137 destination countries for human trafficking. To date, it is the second most frequently downloaded UNODC report. Continuing into 2007, UNODC supported initiatives like the Community Vigilance project along the border between India and Nepal, as well as provided subsidy for NGO trafficking prevention campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. UNODC efforts to motivate action launched the Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking on 6 March 2009, which Mexico launched its own national version of in April 2010. The campaign encourages people to show solidarity with human trafficking victims by wearing the blue heart, similar to how wearing the red ribbon promotes transnational HIV/AIDS awareness.Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking On 4 November 2010, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons to provide humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of human trafficking with the aim of increasing the number of those rescued and supported, and broadening the extent of assistance they receive. In 2013, the United Nations designated July 30 as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. In January 2019, UNODC published the new edition of the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons. The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2018 has revealed that 30 per cent of all victims of human trafficking officially detected globally between 2016 and 2018 are children, up 3 per cent from the period 2007‚Äì2010. The Global Report recorded victims of 137 different nationalities detected in 142 countries between 2012 and 2016, during which period, 500 different flows were identified. Around half of all trafficking took place within the same region with 42 per cent occurring within national borders. One exception is the Middle East, where most detected victims are East and South Asians. Trafficking victims from East Asia have been detected in more than 64 countries, making them the most geographically dispersed group around the world. There are significant regional differences in the detected forms of exploitation. Countries in Africa and in Asia generally intercept more cases of trafficking for forced labour, while sexual exploitation is somewhat more frequently found in Europe and in the Americas. Additionally, trafficking for organ removal was detected in 16 countries around the world. The Report raises concerns about low conviction rates 16 per cent of reporting countries did not record a single conviction for trafficking in persons between 2007 and 2010. As of February 2018, 173 countries have ratified the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol, of which UNODC is the guardian. Significant progress has been made in terms of legislation: as of 2012, 83 per cent of countries had a law criminalizing trafficking in persons in accordance with the Protocol.

In 2007, Polaris instituted the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) where callers can report tips and receive information on human trafficking. Polaris' website and hotline informs the public about where cases of suspected human trafficking have occurred within the United States. The website records calls on a map. In 2007, the U.S. Senate designated 11 January as a National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness in an effort to raise consciousness about this global, national and local issue. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, President Barack Obama proclaimed January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Along with these initiatives libraries across the United States are beginning to contribute to human trafficking awareness. Slowly, libraries are turning into educational centers for those who are not aware of this issue. They are collaborating with other organizations to train staff members to spot human trafficking victims and find ways to help them. In 2014, DARPA funded the Memex program with the explicit goal of combating human trafficking via domain-specific search. The advanced search capacity, including its ability to reach into the dark web has already allowed for prosecution of human trafficking cases, although they can be difficult to prosecute due to the fraudulent tactics of the human traffickers. Due to its size and the access to its large airport, Atlanta, Georgia is known as the core of trafficking in the United States. A 2014 study by Urban Institute showed that some traffickers, or \\"pimps\\", in Atlanta grossed over $32,000 in one week. In 2015, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline received reports of more than 5,000 potential human trafficking cases in the U.S. Children comprise up to one-third of all victims, while women make up more than half. The hotline can communicate with different people no matter their language, as it serves in more than 200 languages. Human trafficking is a big business and it is a major problem in South Florida and one of the hotspots of this crime is on Miami Beach. Police in the city say they arrested three dozen suspected human traffickers in 2017. That is believed to be the most in the South Florida area and investigators say in addition to focusing on arresting traffickers they are focusing on providing help to victims. Council of Europe On 3 May 2005, the Committee of Ministers adopted the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197). The Convention was opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005 on the occasion of the 3rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe. On 24 October 2007, the Convention received its tenth ratification thereby triggering the process whereby it entered into force on 1 February 2008. As of June 2017, the Convention has been ratified by 47 states (including Belarus, a non-Council of Europe state), with Russia being the only state to not have ratified (nor signed). While other international instruments already exist in this field, the Council of Europe Convention, the first European treaty in this field, is a comprehensive treaty focusing mainly on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims to prevent trafficking and to prosecute traffickers. In addition, the Convention provides for the setting up of an effective and independent monitoring mechanism capable of controlling the implementation of the obligations contained in the Convention. The Convention is not restricted to Council of Europe member states; non-member states and the European Union also have the possibility of becoming Party to the Convention. In 2013 Belarus became the first non-Council of Europe member state to accede to the Convention. The Convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the Convention through country reports. As of 1 March 2013, GRETA has published 17 country reports. Complementary protection against sex trafficking of children is ensured through the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (signed in Lanzarote, 25 October 2007). The Convention entered into force on 1 July 2010. As of September 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 44 states, with another 3 states having signed but not yet ratified. In addition, the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg has passed judgments concerning trafficking in human beings which violated obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights: Siliadin v. France, judgment of 26 July 2005, and Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, judgment of 7 January 2010. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe In 2003, the OSCE established an anti-trafficking mechanism aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively. The OSCE actions against human trafficking are coordinated by the Office of the Special Representative for Combating the Traffic of Human Beings. In January 2010, Maria Grazia Giammarinaro became the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Dr. Giammarinaro (Italy) has been a judge at the Criminal Court of Rome since 1991. She served from 2006 until 2009 in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security in Brussels, where she was responsible for work to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, as well as for penal aspects of illegal immigration within the unit dealing with the fight against organized crime. During this time, she co-ordinated the Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings of the European Commission. From 2001 to 2006 she was a judge for preliminary investigation in the Criminal Court of Rome. Prior to that, from 1996 she was Head of the Legislative Office and Adviser to the Minister for Equal Opportunities. From 2006 to December 2009 the office was headed by Eva Biaudet, a former Member of Parliament and Minister of Health and Social Services in her native Finland. The activities of the Office of the Special Representative range from training law enforcement agencies to tackle human trafficking to promoting policies aimed at rooting out corruption and organised crime. The Special Representative also visits countries and can, on their request, support the formation and implementation of their anti- trafficking policies. In other cases the Special Representative provides advice regarding implementation of the decisions on human trafficking, and assists governments, ministers and officials to achieve their stated goals of tackling human trafficking. India Preity Zinta at ACT (Against Child Trafficking) (2) In India, the trafficking in persons for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriages and domestic servitude is considered an organized crime. The Government of India applies the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, active from 3 February 2013, as well as Section 370 and 370A IPC, which defines human trafficking and \\"provides stringent punishment for human trafficking; trafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation; or any form of sexual exploitation, slavery, servitude or the forced removal of organs.\\" Additionally, a Regional Task Force implements the SAARC Convention on the prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children. Shri R.P.N. Singh, India's Minister of State for Home Affairs, launched a government web portal, the Anti Human Trafficking Portal, on 20 February 2014. The official statement explained that the objective of the on-line resource is for the \\"sharing of information across all stakeholders, States/UTs[Union Territories] and civil society organizations for effective implementation of Anti Human Trafficking measures.\\" The key aims of the portal are: * Aid in the tracking of cases with inter-state ramifications. * Provide comprehensive information on legislation, statistics, court judgements, United Nations Conventions, details of trafficked people and traffickers and rescue success stories. * Provide connection to \\"Trackchild\\", the National Portal on Missing Children that is operational in many states. Also on 20 February, the Indian government announced the implementation of a Comprehensive Scheme that involves the establishment of Integrated Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in 335 vulnerable police districts throughout India, as well as capacity building that includes training for police, prosecutors and judiciary. As of the announcement, 225 Integrated AHTUs had been made operational, while 100 more AHTUs were proposed for the forthcoming financial year. Singapore As of 2016, Singapore acceded to the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol and affirmed on 28 September 2015 the commitment to combat people trafficking, especially women and children. Singapore appears to be a popular destination for human trafficking with women and girls from India, Thailand, the Philippines and China. According to the latest US Government‚Äôs Trafficking in Person‚Äôs Report from 2018, Singapore is making significant efforts to eliminate human trafficking as it imposes strong sentences against convicted traffickers, improve freedom of movement for adult victims and increases migrant workers‚Äô awareness of their rights. However, it still does not meet the minimum standards as numerous migrant workers‚Äô work conditions indicate labor trafficking, but conviction is not secured. In November 2019, a couple of Indian nationals were convicted for exploiting migrant women, making it the first conviction in the state. This conviction showed that Singapore decided to take strong actions against human trafficking. The Anti-trafficking Policy Index The '3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index' measured the effectiveness of government policies to fight human trafficking based on an evaluation of policy requirements prescribed by the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2000).Cho, Seo-Young, Axel Dreher, and Eric Neumayer. \\"The Spread of Anti-trafficking Policies-Evidence from a New Index.\\" Available at SSRN 1776842 (2011). The policy level was evaluated using a five-point scale, where a score of five indicates the best policy practice, while score 1 is the worst. This scale was used to analyze the main three anti-trafficking policy areas: (i) prosecuting (criminalizing) traffickers, (ii) protecting victims, and (iii) preventing the crime of human trafficking. Each sub-index of prosecution, protection and prevention was aggregated to the overall index with an unweighted sum, with the overall index ranging from a score of 3 (worst) to 15 (best). It is available for up to 177 countries annually for 2000 to 2015 (the 2015 report, published in 2016, is the last as of 26.11.2018). In 2015, three countries demonstrated the highest possible rankings in policies for all three dimensions (overall score 15). These countries were Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom. There were four countries with a near perfect score of 14 (Belgium, Philippines, Armenia, and South Korea). Four more scored 13 points, including the USA. The worst score, the minimum possible, is 3. In addition to North Korea, Libya, Syria, Eritrea and the BES Islands scored 3 with both Iran and Russia scoring only 4 (along with Kiribati, Yemen, and Equatorial Guinea). For more information view the Human Trafficking Research and Measurement website. Religious declaration In 2014, for the first time in history major leaders of many religions, Buddhist, Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020. The signatories were: Pope Francis, MƒÅtƒÅ Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ (also known as Amma), Bhikkhuni Thich Nu Ch√¢n Kh√¥ng (representing Zen Master Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh), Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana, Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Rabbi David Rosen, Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman, Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, Sheikh Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar, Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Basheer Hussain al Najafi), Sheikh Omar Abboud, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.) Anti-trafficking initiatives The Blue Campaign collaborates with law enforcement, government, non-governmental, and private organizations to end human trafficking and protect victims. One of the organizations taking the most active part in the anti-trafficking effort is the United Nations particularly with global initiative such as the Sustainable Development Goal 5. In early 2016 the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United Nations held an interactive discussion entitled \\"Responding to Current Challenges in Trafficking in Human Beings\\". Anti- trafficking awareness and fundraising campaigns constitute a significant portion of anti-trafficking initiatives. The 24 Hour Race is one such initiative that focuses on increasing awareness among high school students in Asia. The Blue Campaign is another anti-trafficking initiative that works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and bring freedom to exploited victims. However, critical commentators have pointed out that initiatives such as these aimed at \\"raising awareness\\" do little, if anything, to actually reduce instances of trafficking.  Vulnerable groups  Trafficking in Persons Report released in June 2016 states that \\"refugees and migrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals; religious minorities; people with disabilities; and those who are stateless\\" are the most at-risk for human trafficking. Governments best protect victims from being exploited when the needs of vulnerable populations are understood. Additionally, in its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, the United Nations notes that women and children are particularly at risk for human trafficking and revictimization. The Protocol requires State Parties not only to enact measures that prevent human trafficking but also to address the factors that exacerbate women and children's vulnerability, including \\"poverty, underdevelopment and lack of equal opportunity.\\" ==Types of trafficking== Trafficking of children Trafficking of children involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation. Commercial sexual exploitation of children can take many forms, including forcing a child into prostitutionMother sold girl for sex, 7 May 2010, The Age. or other forms of sexual activity or child pornography. Child exploitation may also involve forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, the removal of organs, illicit international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, recruitment as child soldiers, for use in begging or as athletes (such as child camel jockeys or football players.), UEFA, 29 September 2006. (archived from the original on 30 April 2009) IOM statistics indicate that a significant minority (35%) of trafficked persons it assisted in 2011 were less than 18 years of age, which is roughly consistent with estimates from previous years. It was reported in 2010 that Thailand and Brazil were considered to have the worst child sex trafficking records. Traffickers in children may take advantage of the parents' extreme poverty. Parents may sell children to traffickers in order to pay off debts or gain income, or they may be deceived concerning the prospects of training and a better life for their children. They may sell their children into labour, sex trafficking, or illegal adoptions, although scholars have urged a nuanced understanding and approach to the issue - one that looks at broader socio-economic and political contexts. The adoption process, legal and illegal, when abused can sometimes result in cases of trafficking of babies and pregnant women around the world. In David M. Smolin's 2005 papers on child trafficking and adoption scandals between India and the United States,, Seton Hall Law Review, 35:403‚Äì493, 2005. (archived from the original on 26 March 2009)Child Laundering: How the Inter-country Adoption System Legitimizes and Incentivizes the Practices of Buying, Trafficking, Kidnapping, and Stealing Children by David M. Smolin, bepress Legal Series, Working Paper 749, 29 August 2005. he presents the systemic vulnerabilities in the inter-country adoption system that makes adoption scandals predictable. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at Article 34, states, \\"States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse\\". In the European Union, commercial sexual exploitation of children is subject to a directive Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (or Hague Adoption Convention) is an international convention dealing with international adoption, that aims at preventing child laundering, child trafficking, and other abuses related to international adoption. (full text) The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict seeks to prevent forceful recruitment (e.g. by guerrilla forces) of children for use in armed conflicts. Sex trafficking Prostitution and Human trafficking in South Korea for G.I. by United States Forces Korea.198x198px 152x152px The International Labour Organization claims that forced labour in the sex industry affects 4.5 million people worldwide. Most victims find themselves in coercive or abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous. Trafficking for sexual exploitation was formerly thought of as the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work with the use of physical coercion, deception and bondage through forced debt. However, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (US), does not require movement for the offence. The issue becomes contentious when the element of coercion is removed from the definition to incorporate facilitation of consensual involvement in prostitution. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 incorporated trafficking for sexual exploitation but did not require those committing the offence to use coercion, deception or force, so that it also includes any person who enters the UK to carry out sex work with consent as having been \\"trafficked.\\" In addition, any minor involved in a commercial sex act in the US while under the age of 18 qualifies as a trafficking victim, even if no force, fraud or coercion is involved, under the definition of \\"Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons\\" in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Trafficked women and children are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are sometimes taken to brothels where they are required to undertake sex work, while their passports and other identification papers are confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning ‚Äì through prostitution ‚Äì their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.Migration Information Programme. Trafficking and prostitution: the growing exploitation of migrant women from central and eastern Europe. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 1995.Chauzy JP. Kyrgyz Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes) Forced marriage A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent. Servile marriage is defined as a marriage involving a person being sold, transferred or inherited into that marriage. According to ECPAT, \\"Child trafficking for forced marriage is simply another manifestation of trafficking and is not restricted to particular nationalities or countries\\". 150x150px A forced marriage can qualify as a form of human trafficking in certain situations and certain countries, such as China and its Southeast Asian neighbours from which many women are moved to China, sometimes through promises of work, and forced to marry Chinese men. Whether such practices constitute exploitation and should be considered as trafficking is doubtful: ethnographic research with women from Myanmar and Cambodia found that many women eventually get used to their life in China and prefer it to the one they had in their home countries. Furthermore, legal scholars have noted that transnational marriage brokering was never intended to be considered trafficking by the drafters of the Palermo Protocol. Labour trafficking Labour trafficking is the movement of persons for the purpose of forced labour and services. It may involve bonded labour, involuntary servitude, domestic servitude, and child labour. Labour trafficking happens most often within the domain of domestic work, agriculture, construction, manufacturing and entertainment; and migrant workers and indigenous people are especially at risk of becoming victims. People smuggling operations are also known to traffic people for the exploitation of their labour, for example, as transporters. 151x151px Trafficking for organ trade Trafficking in organs is a form of human trafficking. It can take different forms. In some cases, the victim is compelled into giving up an organ. In other cases, the victim agrees to sell an organ in exchange of money/goods, but is not paid (or paid less). Finally, the victim may have the organ removed without the victim's knowledge (usually when the victim is treated for another medical problem/illness real or orchestrated problem/illness). Migrant workers, homeless persons, and illiterate persons are particularly vulnerable to this form of exploitation. Trafficking of organs is an organized crime, involving several offenders: * the recruiter * the transporter * the medical staff * the middlemen/contractors * the buyers Trafficking for organ trade often seeks kidneys. Trafficking in organs is a lucrative trade because in many countries the waiting lists for patients who need transplants are very long. == Types of criminal liability == There are two types of criminal liability: individual and corporate. Generally, individuals are prosecuted for their role in human trafficking, but the state's law-enforcement agencies struggle to punish corporations for a range of reasons, including that criminal procedure to pursue corporations is inadequate, punishments do not punish the most culpable individuals, and inadequate effort is made to calculate the true cost to restore and compensate victims of trafficking because they were victims of crime. ==Efforts== There are many different estimates of the number of victims of human trafficking. According to scholar Kevin Bales, author of Disposable People (2004), estimates that as many as 27 million people are in \\"modern-day slavery\\" across the globe.Bales, Kevin. Disposable People : New Slavery In The Global Economy / Kevin Bales. n.p.: Berkeley, Calif. : University of California Press, c2004., 2004. In 2008, the U.S. Department of State estimates that 2 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade.U.S. Department of State, Trafficking in Persons Report, 8th ed. (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of State, 2008), 7. In the same year, a study classified 12.3 million individuals worldwide as \\"forced laborers, bonded laborers or sex-trafficking victims.\\" Approximately 1.39 million of these individuals worked as commercial sex slaves, with women and girls comprising 98% of that 1.36 million.Smith, Heather M. \\"Sex trafficking: trends, challenges, and the limitations of international law.\\" Human rights review 12.3 (2011): 271‚Äì286. The enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000 by the United States Congress and its subsequent re-authorizations established the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which engages with foreign governments to fight human trafficking and publishes a Trafficking in Persons Report annually. The Trafficking in Persons Report evaluates each country's progress in anti- trafficking and places each country onto one of three tiers based on their governments' efforts to comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as prescribed by the TVPA.U.S. Department of State. Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, n.d. Web. 1 April 2013. However, questions have been raised by critical anti-trafficking scholars about the basis of this tier system, its heavy focus on compliance with state department protocols, its overreliance on prosecutions and convictions as success in combating trafficking, its use to serve US political and economic interests and lack of systemic analysis, and its failure to consider \\"risk\\" and the likely prevalence of trafficking when rating the efforts of diverse countries. In particular, there were three main components of the TVPA, commonly called the three P's: * Protection: The TVPA increased the US government's efforts to protect trafficked foreign national victims including, but not limited to: Victims of trafficking, many of whom were previously ineligible for government assistance, were provided assistance; and a non-immigrant status for victims of trafficking if they cooperated in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers (T-Visas, as well as providing other mechanisms to ensure the continued presence of victims to assist in such investigations and prosecutions). In T-Visa cases, a forensic psychiatric examination can assist the fact-finder. * Prosecution: The TVPA authorized the US government to strengthen efforts to prosecute traffickers including, but not limited to: Creating a series of new crimes on trafficking, forced labour, and document servitude that supplemented existing limited crimes related to slavery and involuntary servitude; and recognizing that modern-day slavery takes place in the context of fraud and coercion, as well as force, and is based on new clear definitions for both trafficking into sexual exploitation and labour exploitation: Sex trafficking was defined as, \\"a commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age\\". Labour trafficking was defined as, \\"the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labour or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery\\". * Prevention: The TVPA allowed for increased prevention measures including: Authorizing the US government to assist foreign countries with their efforts to combat trafficking, as well as address trafficking within the United States, including through research and awareness-raising; and providing foreign countries with assistance in drafting laws to prosecute trafficking, creating programs for trafficking victims, and assistance with implementing effective means of investigation. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later identified a fourth P, \\"partnership\\", in 2009 to serve as a \\"pathway to progress in the effort against modern-day slavery.\\" Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report ==Structural factors== A complex set of factors fuel human trafficking, including poverty, unemployment, social norms that discriminate against women, institutional challenges, and globalization. Poverty and globalization Poverty and lack of educational and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work.Weitzer, Ronald. \\"The social construction of sex trafficking: ideology and institutionalization of a moral crusade.\\" Politics & Society 35.3 (2007): 447‚Äì475. As globalization opened up national borders to greater exchange of goods and capital, labour migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. Gender inequalities that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors. Long waiting lists for organs in the United States and Europe created a thriving international black market. Traffickers harvest organs, particularly kidneys, to sell for large profit and often without properly caring for or compensating the victims. Victims often come from poor, rural communities and see few other options than to sell organs illegally. Wealthy countries' inability to meet organ demand within their own borders perpetuates trafficking. By reforming their internal donation system, Iran achieved a surplus of legal donors and provides an instructive model for eliminating both organ trafficking and -shortage. Globalization and the rise of Internet technology has also facilitated human trafficking. Online classified sites and social networks such as Craigslist have been under intense scrutiny for being used by clients and traffickers in facilitating sex trafficking and sex work in general. Traffickers use explicit sites (e.g. Craigslist, Backpage, MySpace) to market, recruit, sell, and exploit women. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites are suspected for similar uses. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, online classified ads reduce the risks of finding prospective customers.Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: Hearings on H.R. 5575, Before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, 111th Cong. 145 (2010) (statement of Ernie Allen, president and CEO, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children). Studies have identified the Internet as the single biggest facilitator of commercial sex trade, although it is difficult to ascertain which women advertised are sex trafficking victims.Shared Hope International, Demand: A Comparative Examination of Sex Tourism and Trafficking in Jamaica, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States, n.d., 5. Traffickers and pimps use the Internet to recruit minors, since Internet and social networking sites usage have significantly increased especially among children.Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, \\"Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences\\", Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series 103, 2009, ii‚Äìxiv. At the same time, critical scholars have questioned the extent of the role of internet in human trafficking and have cautioned against sweeping generalisations and urged more research. While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate human trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the Super Bowl. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl. For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Backpage for Dallas area experienced a 136% increase on the number of posts in the Adult section on Super Bowl Sunday; in contrast, Sundays typically have the lowest number of posts. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads, which suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl, and found that the self-reported ages were higher than usual. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty.Latonero, Mark. \\"Human Trafficking Online: The Role of Social Networking Sites and Online Classifieds.\\" USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy. Available at SSRN 2045851 (2011). However, there has been no evidence found actually linking the Super Bowl or any other sporting event to increased trafficking or prostitution.Anna Merlan, \\"Just in Time for February, the Myth of Sex Trafficking and the Super Bowl Returns\\" , Village Voice Blogs, 30 January 2014. Political and institutional challenges Corrupt and inadequately trained police officers can be complicit in human trafficking and/or commit violence against sex workers, including trafficked victims. Human traffickers often incorporate abuse of the legal system into their control tactics by making threats of deportation 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report, U.S. Department of State or by turning victims into the authorities, possibly resulting in the incarceration of the victims.A Victim-Centered Approach to Sex Trafficking Alvarez, Larry MS and Ca√±as- Moreira, Jocelyn. Anti-trafficking agendas from different groups can also be in conflict. In the movement for sex workers' rights, sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has \\"self-regulatory boards\\" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations. A recent seven-country research by the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women found that sex worker organisations around the world assist women in the industry who are trafficked and should be considered as allies in anti-trafficking work. Criminalization of sex work also may foster the underground market for sex work and enable sex trafficking. Difficult political situations such as civil war and social conflict are push factors for migration and trafficking. A study reported that larger countries, the richest and the poorest countries, and countries with restricted press freedom are likely to have higher levels of trafficking. Specifically, being in a transitional economy made a country nineteen times more likely to be ranked in the highest trafficking category, and gender inequalities in a country's labour market also correlated with higher trafficking rates.Rao, Smriti, & Christina Presenti, Understanding Human Trafficking Origin: A Cross-Country Empirical Analysis, in Feminist Economics, vol. 18, no. 2 (April 2012), pp. 231‚Äì263, esp. pp. 233‚Äì234. An annual US State Department report in June 2013 cited Russia and China as among the worst offenders in combatting forced labour and sex trafficking, raising the possibility of US sanctions being leveraged against these countries. In 1997 alone as many as 175,000 young women from Russia, the former Soviet Union and Eastern and Central Europe were sold as commodities in the sex markets of the developed countries in Europe and the Americas.Johanna Granville, \\"From Russia without Love: The 'Fourth Wave' of Global Human Trafficking\\", Demokratizatsiya, vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 2004): p. 148. Commercial demand for sex Abolitionists who seek an end to sex trafficking explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers. The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the \\"demand for trafficking\\" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations. To this day, the idea that trafficking is fuelled by demand remains poorly conceptualised and based on assumptions rather than evidence. ==Consequences== Traffickers use physical, emotional, and psychological abuse to control and exploit their victims. For victims  Human trafficking victims face threats of violence from many sources, including customers, pimps, brothel owners, madams, traffickers, and corrupt local law enforcement officials and even from family members who don't want to have any link with them . Because of their potentially complicated legal status and their potential language barriers, the arrest or fear of arrest creates stress and other emotional trauma for trafficking victims. Victims may also experience physical violence from law enforcement during raids.Cianciarulo, Marisa Silenzi. \\"Modern-Day Slavery and Cultural Bias: Proposals for Reforming the US Visa System for Victims of International Human Trafficking.\\" Nev. LJ 7 (2006): 826. The challenges facing victims often continue after their removal from coercive exploitation. In addition to coping with their past traumatic experiences, former trafficking victims often experience social alienation in the host and home countries. Stigmatization, social exclusion, and intolerance often make it difficult for former victims to integrate into their host community, or to reintegrate into their former community. Accordingly, one of the central aims of protection assistance, is the promotion of (re)integration. Too often however, governments and large institutional donors offer little funding to support the provision of assistance and social services to former trafficking victims. As the victims are also pushed into drug trafficking, many of them face criminal sanctions also.Zheng, Tiantian, ed. Sex trafficking, human rights, and social justice. Vol. 4. Routledge, 2010. Psychological Short-term impact ‚Äì psychological coercion The use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of psychological stress induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination.Hopper, E. and Hidalgo, J. (2006). Invisible chains: Psychological coercion of human trafficking victims. \\"Intercultural Human Rights Law, 1\\", 185‚Äì209. During the initiation phase, traffickers use foot-in-the-door techniques of persuasion to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This manipulation creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker. Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry. One form of psychological coercion particularly common in cases of sex trafficking and forced prostitution is Stockholm syndrome. Many women entering into the sex trafficking industry are minors whom have already experienced prior sexual abuse. Traffickers take advantage of young girls by luring them into the business through force and coercion, but more often through false promises of love, security, and protection. This form of coercion works to recruit and initiate the victim into the life of a sex worker, while also reinforcing a \\"trauma bond\\", also known as Stockholm syndrome. Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response where the victim becomes attached to his or her perpetrator. The goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.Zimmerman, C., Hossain, M., Yun, K., Roche, B., Morison, L., and Watts, C. (2006). Stolen Smiles: A summary report on the physical and psychological health consequences of women and adolescents trafficked in Europe. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine: Daphne, 1‚Äì28. For victims specifically trafficked for the purpose of forced prostitution and sexual slavery, initiation into the trade is almost always characterized by violence. Traffickers employ practices of sexual abuse, torture, brainwashing, repeated rape and physical assault until the victim submits to his or her fate as a sexual slave. Victims experience verbal threats, social isolation, and intimidation before they accept their role as a prostitute. For those enslaved in situations of forced labor, learned helplessness can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of social connection, as isolation allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's sense of self and increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator. Long-term impact Human trafficking victims may experience complex trauma as a result of repeated cases of intimate relationship trauma over long periods of time including, but not limited to, sexual abuse, domestic violence, forced prostitution, or gang rape. Complex trauma involves multifaceted conditions of depression, anxiety, self-hatred, dissociation, substance abuse, self- destructive behaviors, medical and somatic concerns, despair, and revictimization. Psychology researchers report that, although similar to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Complex trauma is more expansive in diagnosis because of the effects of prolonged trauma. Victims of sex trafficking often get \\"branded\\" by their traffickers or pimps. These tattoos usually consist of bar codes or the trafficker's name or rules. Even if a victim escapes their trafficker's control or gets rescued, these tattoos are painful reminders of their past and results in emotional distress. To get these tattoos removed or covered-up can cost hundreds of dollars. Psychological reviews have shown that the chronic stress experienced by many victims of human trafficking can compromise the immune system. Several studies found that chronic stressors (like trauma or loss) suppressed cellular and humoral immunity. Victims may develop STDs and HIV/AIDS. Perpetrators frequently use substance abuse as a means to control their victims, which leads to compromised health, self-destructive behavior, and long-term physical harm. Furthermore, victims have reported treatment similar to torture, where their bodies are broken and beaten into submission. Children are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy physical and mental health of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self- worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children who grow up in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs. Although 98% of the sex trade is composed of women and girls there is an effort to gather empirical evidence about the psychological impact of abuse common in sex trafficking upon young boys. Boys often will experience forms of post-traumatic stress disorder, but also additional stressors of social stigma of homosexuality associated with sexual abuse for boys, and externalization of blame, increased anger, and desire for revenge. HIV/AIDS Estimated prevalence in % of HIV among young adults (15‚Äì49) per country as of 2011. Sex trafficking increases the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic can be both a cause and a consequence of sex trafficking. On one hand, child-prostitutes are sought by customers because they are perceived as being less likely to be HIV positive, and this demand leads to child sex trafficking. On the other hand, trafficking leads to the proliferation of HIV, because victims cannot protect themselves properly and get infected. Economic impacts , profits from human trafficking were about around US$150 billion each year ranking it along with drug trafficking as one of the most profitable transnational crimes. The following is the breakdown of profits by sector: $99 billion from commercial sexual exploitation; $34 billion in construction, manufacturing, mining and utilities; $9 billion in agriculture, including forestry and fishing; $8 billion is saved annually by private households that employ domestic workers under conditions of forced labour. Although only 19% of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation, it makes up 66% of the global earnings of human trafficking. The average annual profits generated by each woman in forced sexual servitude ($100,000) is estimated to be six times more than the average profits generated by each trafficking victim worldwide ($21,800). The low risk, high reward dynamic has created a breeding ground for the human trafficking transactions to thrive. The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. Corporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers. According to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.Related crimes associated with human trafficking reportedly include the following: fraud, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, bribery, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, car theft, migrant smuggling, kidnapping, document forgery, and gambling. Organised criminal groups intend to establish or invest in a wide range of legitimate businesses to conceal the profit earned from human trafficking. Businesses are set up to launder money and not necessarily to make profits. Legitimate businesses may be possibly held in competition against enterprises that are financially backed by human traffickers with illegally acquired income. Fair competition may be undermined when human trafficking victims are exploited for cheap labour, driving down production costs, thereby indirectly causing a negative economic imbalance. By definition, human trafficking is an organised crime, executed into action by several actors at the source, transit and destination points of trafficking. Huge profits with minimal risk incur from this offence, that is exclusively meant for the gains of its organisers and the exploiters. The revenue accrued from the Illegal industry of human trafficking does not contribute to a nation's GDP. On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities. The exploitation continuously generates large sums of illegal income for criminal networks, with a corresponding threat on other legitimate businesses which have positive economic impacts. Human trafficking is a national threat as it blocks national growth and development. Economic costs that have been associated with human trafficking include lost labour productivity, human resources, taxable revenues, and migrant remittances, as well as unlawfully redistributed wealth and heightened law enforcement and public health costs. Trafficking of migrants specifically has a negative impact on the potential financial gains of the migrants themselves, government and legitimate employers as income is redirected to traffickers and their associates. All indications lead to the fact that profits generated by related organized crime are significant and global. As a major component of organized crime, with significant financial influence, human trafficking has a complex and interlocking negative impact across human, social, political and economic spheres. Popular culture ==Criticism== Both the public debate on human trafficking and the actions undertaken by the anti-human traffickers have been criticized by numerous scholars and experts, including Zbigniew Dumienski, a former research analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. The criticism touches upon statistics and data on human trafficking, the concept itself, and anti- trafficking measures. Problems with statistics and data According to a former Wall Street Journal columnist, figures used in human trafficking estimates rarely have identifiable sources or transparent methodologies behind them and in most (if not all) instances, they are mere guesses.Bialik, Carl, 2010, 'Suspect Estimates of Sex Trafficking at the World Cup', The Wall Street Journal, 19 June.see also: US Government Accountability Office, 2006, Human Trafficking: Better Data, Strategy and Reporting Needed to Enhance U.S. Antitrafficking Efforts Abroad, Highlights of GAO-06-825 Report, Washington, DC. Dumienski and Laura Agustin argue that this is a result of the fact that it is impossible to produce reliable statistics on a phenomenon happening in the shadow economy.Agustin, Laura, 2008, Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry, London and New York: Zed Books. According to a UNESCO Bangkok researcher, statistics on human trafficking may be unreliable due to overrepresentation of sex trafficking. As an example, he cites flaws in Thai statistics, who discount men from their official numbers because by law they cannot be considered trafficking victims due to their gender.Feingold, David A. (2010) 'Trafficking in Numbers' in P. Andreas and K. M. Greenhill (eds) Sex, Drugs, and Body Counts (London: Cornell University Press) A 2012 article in the International Communication Gazette examined the effect of two communication theories (agenda-building and agenda-setting) on media coverage on human trafficking in the United States and Britain. The article analyzed four newspapers including the Guardian and the Washington Post and categorized the content into various categories. Overall, the article found that sex trafficking was the most reported form of human trafficking by the newspapers that were analyzed (p. 154). Many of the other stories on trafficking were non-specific. Problems with the concept According to Zbigniew Dumienski, the very concept of human trafficking is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it may be an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis. British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument. Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization. The critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking. The international Save the Children organization also stated: \\"The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se‚Ä¶trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other‚Ä¶On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti- trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution.\\" Claudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ \\"politics of pity,\\" which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering. One critic identifies two strategies that gain pity: denunciation attributing all violence and suffering to the perpetrator and sentiment exclusively depicting the suffering of the women. NGOs' use of images of unidentifiable women suffering physically help display sex trafficking scenarios as all the same. She points out that not all trafficking victims have been abducted, abused physically, and repeatedly raped, unlike popular portrayals. A study of the relationships between individuals who are defined as sex-trafficking victims by virtue of having a procurer (especially minors) concluded that assumptions about victimization and human trafficking do not do justice to the complex and often mutual relationships that exist between sex workers and their third parties. Another common critique is that the concept of human trafficking focuses only on the most extreme forms of exploitation and diverts attention and resources away from more \\"everyday\\" but arguably much more widespread forms of exploitation and abuse that occur as part of the normal functioning of the economy. As Quirk, Robinson, and Thibos write, \\"It is not always possible to sharply separate human trafficking from everyday abuses, and problems arise when the former is singled out while the latter is pushed to the margins.\\" O' Connell Davidson too argues that the lines between the crimes of human trafficking/modern slavery and the legally sanctioned exploitation of migrants (such as lower wages or restrictions on freedom of movement and employment) is blurry. Problems with anti- trafficking measures Groups like Amnesty International have been critical of insufficient or ineffective government measures to tackle human trafficking. Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures \\"not fit for purpose.\\"  Collateral damage  Rights groups have called attention to the negative impact that the implementation of anti-trafficking measures have on the human rights of various groups, especially migrants, sex workers, and trafficked persons themselves. The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women drew attention to this \\"collateral damage\\" already in 2007. These negative impacts include various restrictions on women's right to migrate and undertake certain jobs, suspicion and harassment at international borders of women travelling alone, raids at sex work venues and detention, fines and harassment of sex workers (see below section on the use of raids), assistance to trafficked persons made conditional on their cooperation with law enforcement and forced confinement of trafficked persons in shelters, and many more. Victim identification and protection in the UK In the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status. High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system. Laura Agustin has suggested that, in some cases, \\"anti-traffickers\\" ascribe victim status to immigrants who have made conscious and rational decisions to cross the borders knowing they will be selling sex and who do not consider themselves to be victims. There have been instances in which the alleged victims of trafficking have actually refused to be rescued'Chinese Prostitutes Resist Efforts to Rescue Them from Africa', 2011, Times LIVE, 1 January. or run away from the anti-trafficking shelters. In a 2013 lawsuit, the Court of Appeal gave guidance to prosecuting authorities on the prosecution of victims of human trafficking, and held that the convictions of three Vietnamese children and one Ugandan woman ought to be quashed as the proceedings amounted to an abuse of the court's process. The case was reported by the BBC and one of the victims was interviewed by Channel 4. Law enforcement and the use of raids In the U.S., services and protections for trafficked victims are related to cooperation with law enforcement. Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle \\"criminal networks\\", and to rescue victims from abuse.. The problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be. Another study found that the majority of women \\"rescued\\" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid. Law enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful. Social workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers. As raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS. Scholars Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model. \\"End Demand\\" programs Critics argue that End Demand programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, \\"John schools\\" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work. The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C. (2002). Vice lessons: A survey of prostitution offenders enrolled in the Toronto John School Diversion Program\\" Canadian Journal of Criminology 3(3), 227‚Äì248: 394. Monto, Martin A. and Steve Garcia. 2001. \\"Recidivism Among the Customers of Female Street Prostitutes: Do Intervention Programs Help?\\" Western Criminology Review 3 (2). (Online)] However, according to a 2008 study, the Swedish approach of criminalizing demand has \\"led to an equality-centered approach that has drawn numerous positive reviews worldwide.\\" ==Modern feminist perspectives== There are different feminist perspectives on sex trafficking. The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on \\"sexualized domination\\", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals. Third-wave feminism harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf. Third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to Amartya Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims. Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. \\"Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.\\" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409‚Äì1458. Legal Collection. Web. 6 March 2013. The clash between the different feminist perspectives on trafficking and sex work was especially evident at the negotiations of the Palermo Protocol. One feminist group, led by the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful; however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol. Social norms According to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of social norms that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma, further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking. ==See also== * Abusive power and control * Adoption fraud * Bride-buying * Comfort woman * Human trafficking by country * Human Trafficking (miniseries) * Financial abuse * Gaslighting * List of organizations opposing human trafficking * Kidnapping * Migrant sex work * Serious and Organised Crime Group * Sexual jihad * Sexual trafficking in Kosovo * Sharecropping * She Has a Name * South East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking * Transnational efforts to prevent human trafficking * Western princess * Wife selling ==ReferencesGlobal Report on Trafficking in Persons * The Islamic State and its human trafficking practice, pp. 15‚Äì21.

His duties were defined differently at different locations and ages. ==Middle ages== The need for currency was relatively low during Merovingian times. The M√ºnzmeister produced coins in small workshops, working alone or with the aid of a few assistants, and handled the precious metals required. During Carolingian times, minting of specie became the task of royally appointed officials. During the High Middle Ages they were replaced by the M√ºnzerhausgenossenschaft, or minting house cooperative. Its members came from the ranks of rich burghers: usually merchants, precious-metal traders, moneychangers, goldsmiths, who in turn appointed one out of their ranks as M√ºnzmeister. For their labor, the members of the cooperative were due a share of the minting profits. They also enjoyed certain rights and privileges, including a monopoly on the purchase of gold and silver, exemption from customs duties and taxes, and independent jurisdiction in minting matters. The house cooperatives saw their heyday in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the late Middle Ages, the minting house cooperatives vanished when minting was taken over by sovereigns or cities. The M√ºnzmeister was now an entrepreneur who determined weight, precious-metal content, seignorage and their own share, by way of free negotiations with the principals. Next to mines and shipyards, mints had become the largest enterprises of the age. ==Modern era== In modernity, local entrepreneurs and their mints gained in importance. The era saw the rise of M√ºnzmeister dynasties, with leases that were extended over several generations. Frequently the coins bear symbols engraved by the M√ºnzmeister, often as tiny rosettae, tools, monographs or initials. In the 17th and 18th century the number of Jewish leaseholders in minting increased, not least because access of Jews to other occupations became more restricted on religious grounds. During the Habsburg era in Austria and Germany, the government soon began to establish a minting system. Austria created the office of a supreme heritable M√ºnzmeister that provided for a sinecure without a share in profits. In Bohemia, too, the supreme office of M√ºnzmeister was held by dukes and noblemen who at the same time supervised all the kingdom's mining facilities. Besides the M√ºnzmeister, there were other minting officials, such as the master smith, the dye-cutter, and the minter. The M√ºnzwardein (in Latin, wardinus) was tasked with making sure that minting was done properly from the right alloy. He also had to take samples that were presented to the Probationstag (= sampling commission) in line with official regulations. The sampling commission was constituted from the royal court or local gentry or their representatives. ==See also== * Master of the Mint * Warden of the Mint Category:Titles Category:Obsolete occupations Category:Directors of coin mints Category:Numismatics Category:Metalworking occupations Category:Production of coins ","title":"M√ºnzmeister"},{"id":"19333698","text":"Pentas lanceolata, commonly known as Egyptian starcluster, is a species of flowering plant in the madder family, Rubiaceae that is native to much of Africa as well as Yemen.

When Bill Clinton was on the campaign trail as the Democratic candidate for President in 1992, he suggested both orally and in a letter to Congressman Bruce Morrison that he would favor the appointment of a Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Clinton was not alone in supporting a more active U.S. involvement in Northern Ireland. On February 23, 1993, shortly after Clinton assumed office as President, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy, together with 16 co-sponsors, sponsored a Congressional Resolution calling for the appointment of a Special Envoy. The Resolution called that it be:U.S. House Concurrent Resolution 49 of the 103rd Congress, 1st Session (H. CON. RES. 49) ‚Äì concerning the appointment of a special envoy to Northern Ireland. The Resolution also recalled that \\"the list of human rights abuses involving the British Government is lengthy and well documented\\" and that \\"the United States has a unique opportunity to insist that Great Britain adhere to recognized standards of international law in Northern Ireland\\". However, the proposed Resolution initially came to nothing. Nevertheless, Clinton discussed the prospect of appointing a Special Envoy with the Irish premier, Albert Reynolds when the two leaders first met on St. Patrick's Day in 1993. However Clinton deferred any appointment. When the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) declared a ceasefire in 1994, Sinn F√©in party leader, Gerry Adams urged Washington to play a \\"nudging role\\" as it did in South Africa and the Middle East. Congressman Bruce Morrison was considered a potential candidate. ==George Mitchell== It was not until 1995 that a decision to appoint a Special Envoy was finally made. The announcement of the appointment of former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell as Special Envoy initially \\"infuriated\\" the British Government. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy but someone representing a President with a deep interest in events. However, around the time of Mitchell's appointment, it was agreed with both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Major and Taoiseach John Bruton that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups. Mitchell went on to successfully chair the talks that resulted in the Good Friday Agreement. ==Later envoys== The United States has continued to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and has demonstrated its readiness to assist the process in any way. On June 10, 2003, President George W. Bush announced his intention to designate Ambassador Richard N. Haass as the Special Envoy. Haass was an active Envoy. In 2001, within a week of the September 11 attacks, Haass warned Irish Republicans that the suspected links between the IRA and Colombian terrorist groups could have \\"potentially serious consequences for the role of the United States in the peace process\\". Later, Haass attacked then Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble for setting a deadline for pulling out of power-sharing, accusing him of adding to a sense of crisis. Later, Mitchell Reiss was appointed as the Special Envoy. At the invitation of the British and Irish governments, Reiss participated in the peace process negotiations that took place at Leeds Castle in 2004.Ambassador Kenny's Remarks on Ireland‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpecial Relationship‚Äù with Europe and America on 12 October 2004 On February 15, 2007, Paula Dobriansky, U.S. Undersecretary for Democracy and Global Affairs at the State Department, was named the Special Envoy for Northern Ireland.U.S. Embassy to Ireland ‚Äì US Special Envoy on Northern Ireland The transition from the former Special Envoy, Ambassador Mitchell Reiss, took place on February 15, 2007.

It is very tolerant of pollution and has a cosmopolitan distribution, making it one of the most common lichens. It harbours a unicellular Trebouxia green algal symbiont. ==Taxonomy== First described by Thomas Taylor in 1836 under its current name, Parmelia sulcata has a large number of named varieties and forms, but no subspecies despite its extensive range. Most taxonomists have left the species in the genus to which Taylor originally assigned it, though mycologist Maurice Choisy assigned it to the genus Parmotrema in 1952. The genus name Parmelia is a compound of two Greek words: parme, meaning \\"fruit bowl\\" and -eileo, meaning \\"enclosed\\". This likely refers to the lecanorine apothecia of species belonging to the genus. The specific epithet sulcata is derived from sulcatus, meaning \\"grooved\\" or \\"furrowed\\". The species is known by a number of colloquial names, including hammered shield lichen, cracked- shield lichen, powdered crottle, furrowed shield lichen, powdered shield, and waxpaper lichen. ==Description== Parmelia sulcata is a foliose lichen with a generally circular thallus that can range in color from glaucous white to gray on the upper cortex; the lower surface is black. The thallus is broadly lobed. Each lobe measures between in width, and lobes are overlapping. The lichen's medulla and soredia react positively with potassium hydroxide (K), turning red-orange. They react positively with para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning orange. The lichen does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light. ==Distribution and habitat== Parmelia sulcata is a common species throughout much of the world, found from temperate to cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. ==Ecology== This species can be used to make dyes, producing a reddish-brown color. Indigenous people in North America used the lichen medicinally. The M√©tis peoples rubbed it on the gums of teething babies, while the Saanich peoples used it for a variety of ailments, with the medicinal qualities depending on what type of tree it was harvested from. It often grows in lichen communities with other species. In the Jura Mountains of Switzerland, for example, it regularly occurs with Lobaria pulmonaria and various Nephroma species. ==References== Category:Cosmopolitan species Category:Lichens Category:Parmeliaceae Category:Fungi described in 1836 ","title":"Parmelia sulcata"},{"id":"19333934","text":"Chisapani may refer to several places: *Chisapani, Bheri *Chisapani, Gandaki *Chisapani, Ramechhap *Chisapani, Mechi *Chisapani, Khotang ","title":"Chisapani"},{"id":"19333935","text":"Wolf Gremm (26 February 1942 ‚Äì 14 July 2015) was a German film director and screenwriter. Gremm was born in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1942. In the 1960s, he studied German literature, psychology, sociology and theater. After graduation, he studied film direction at the Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin and directed his first feature film Ich dachte, ich w√§r tot in 1973. During the 1970s and early 1980s, he produced several feature films. His greatest success was the 1980 film Fabian based on a novel by German author Erich K√§stner. This film was chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 53rd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not nominated. He was a close friend of the German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who also starred in Gremm's 1982 film Kamikaze 1989. ==Personal life== Gremm was married to the film producer Regina Ziegler, who began her career as the producer of Gremm's first feature film Ich dachte, ich w√§r tot.

The islands' population is currently transient, and there never were any native South Georgians, although a handful of people have been born there. ==Current== The church at Grytviken with the Latin inscription \\"Anno 1913\\" English language English has been used throughout the recorded history of South Georgia, from the earliest explorations by Anthony de la Roch√© and James Cook to the present day. It is used for the territory's administration, postage stamps and various other purposes. The majority of the area's toponyms are either in English or anglicised, and have been given by both British and American explorers - e.g. Bird Island, Grass Island, Echo Pass, Gold Harbour and many others. Latin Latin is used in the motto of the islands - \\"Leo Terram Propriam Protegat\\" meaning \\"May the Lion protect his own land\\". It also appears on the church at Grytviken. ==Historic== Several languages have been used historically in South Georgia. Norwegian Solveig Jacobsen standing (with her dog) in 1916. Norwegian was used in South Georgia mainly by the numerous whalers. Norwegian's main legacy is in a sizeable number of placenames, including Hestesletten (\\"Horse's Plain\\"), Skrap Skerries (\\"skrapskjaer\\" or \\"skrapskjar\\"), Trollhul and Elsehul. A couple of whaling stations had Norwegian names- Husvik (house bay) and Godthul (good hollow). The first person to be born in South Georgia (and south of the Antarctic Convergence), Solveig Gunbj√∏rg Jacobsen would have been a Norwegian speaker. The settlement Grytviken (which is a Swedish name) was founded by Carl Anton Larsen, another Norwegian speaker. Russian Russian was used by some explorers, such as Bellinghausen, and is retained in placenames such as Visokoi Island (–≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–π meaning \\"high\\"), Zavodovski and Kupriyanov Islands (Mys Kupriyanov) and Annenkov Island. Spanish Argentine weather station, 1923 The role of Spanish is more controversial, particularly as Argentina still contests the British claim to the islands, and considers them part of the Tierra del Fuego province. The Compa√±√≠a Argentina de Pesca operated in Grytviken until about 1960. The Argentine naval station Corbeta Uruguay was clandestinely built on Thule Island, South Sandwich Islands on 7 November 1976, in the wake of many protests. At an early stage of the Falklands War, 32 special forces troops from Corbeta Uruguay were brought by the Argentine Navy ship Bah√≠a Para√≠so to South Georgia and landed at Leith Harbour on March 25, 1982. During this period, Argentina would have used Spanish \\"officially\\". However, Argentine control was not complete, and the Argentines in South Georgia surrendered to the British on April 25, 1982. Spanish does not feature much in the official toponomy of the islands, other than the names of scientific bases, and Carlita Bay; however, a number of placenames have Spanish equivalents, e.g. Vindication Island is \\"Isla Vindicaci√≥n\\". Swedish language Swedish is closely related to, and largely mutually intelligible with, Norwegian. Placenames of Swedish origin include Grytviken (meaning \\"Pot Bay\\") and Maiviken (Norwegian spelling of the original Swedish name Majviken meaning \\"May Bay\\"). Others Numerous other languages would have been used by explorers, whalers, sealers etc. in the vicinity, these would include Lowland Scots (along with some Scottish placenames), and German (retained in placenames such as Bertrab Glacier and Brocken).

During World War II, he was assigned to the US Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) in London in 1942. He was \\"named head of counterintelligence in Paris and enter[ed] Dachau with the 45th Division in April 1945.\\" In 1953, he became a radio stringer in Cairo, where he met up with \\"former CIC roommates from London, James Eichelberger and Miles Copeland Jr.\\" Kearns covered several Middle East conflicts including Egypt's Suez Crisis and the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War. For his 1957 coverage of Algeria's struggle for independence from the French where he was embedded with the freedom fighters for six weeks, Kearns was honored with a Peabody Award for providing \\"news in depth by going behind current happenings to identify related problems and underlying causes,\\" the George Polk Memorial Award for \\"distinguished achievement in journalism,\\" and the Overseas Press Club of America Award for \\"Best Foreign Reporting on Radio and Television\\" for his critical contributions to the CBS documentary \\"Algeria Aflame.\\" He was named a network staff correspondent with CBS on September 25, 1958. He reported from news bureaus in London, Paris, Moscow and Rome. Four years later, he was named the CBS News Africa Bureau Chief. From a base in London, he reported on numerous wars and disputes including Rhodesia‚Äôs bid for independence, the civil war in Biafra and the bloody conflicts in the Congo Crisis. In 1971, Kearns left CBS News to accept a teaching position at his alma mater West Virginia University, where he served as a distinguished Benedum Professor of Journalism. In 1976, Sig Mickelson, the former president of CBS News, told a U. S. Senate committee that during his early years as a ‚Äústringer‚Äù (part-time reporter) in Egypt, Kearns had U.S. Central Intelligence Agency \\"connections.\\" In addition, the press alleged that the CIA relationship had been approved by senior CBS management. In 1983, Kearns retired from the classroom and settled in Sardinia, Italy, where he spent the last three years of his life.

Assagay lost its independent Health Committee status in 1996, i.e. after the 1994 fully democratic elections, and was made subject to administration by the Outer West Local Council - a substructure council of the then Durban Unicity. Subsequently in 2000 this body, i.e. the Outer West Local Council, along with other local councils, were disestablished and replaced by the single eThekwini Municipality encompassing the entire Durban metropolitan area. ==Assagay today== Assagay has access to both the M13 and N3 freeway systems linking it directly with Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and Kassier Road links it via Old Main Road to the central commercial area of Hillcrest. The suburb of Assagay had become known as a middle-income residential area containing a mixture of individual houses, small holdings and small town house complexes; however the considerable development in the greater Hillcrest area, over the past 10 years, has tended to change this image of the area. Large secure gated estates such as Queensbridge, Silver Oaks, Highmead and the nearby Aintree Lane residential development at Shongweni surrounding the Assagay Hotel (previously known as the Polo Pony Hotel) have seen the character change to more of a high-income area. The PheZulu Safari Park and the currently developing Stoneford Equestrian Estate is in Assagay and borders on Alverstone which is situated on the plateau of that name. The new Hillcrest Private Hospital which is now operational and a Retirement Village which is under construction has easy access to the M13. These developments have further boosted the property values in this up-market area. International Polo (sponsored by BMW) is played to the Shongweni Polo Ground opposite the Assagay Hotel. Conservation and the environment The Assagay valley forms the original catchment area of the Umhlatuzana river which flows through the Madwala Reserves. Working for Water has made a contribution towards clearing the area of invasive plants and continues to eradicate all alien flora with the cooperation of landowners. ==Origin of name== Assagay is perhaps more commonly spelled as \\"assegai\\". The name for the village of Assagay will have in turn been taken from the underlying farm named Assagay Kraal. The Voortrekkers having named the early farms in their Natalia Republic (Natal) after settling throughout the area in 1839 after defeating the Zulu king Dingane. The parcels of land comprising the adjacent Alverstone area are still portions of the farm Assagay Kraal No 853. ==References== Category:Populated places in eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality ","title":"Assagay"},{"id":"19334164","text":"Briquette made by a Ruf briquetter out of hay Straw or hay briquettes Ogatan, Japanese charcoal briquettes made from sawdust briquettes (Ogalite). Quick Grill Briquette made from coconut shell Biomass briquettes are a biofuel substitute to coal and charcoal. Briquettes are mostly used in the developing world, where cooking fuels are not as easily available. There has been a move to the use of briquettes in the developed world, where they are used to heat industrial boilers in order to produce electricity from steam. The briquettes are cofired with coal in order to create the heat supplied to the boiler. ==Composition and production== Biomass briquettes, mostly made of green waste and other organic materials, are commonly used for electricity generation, heat, and cooking fuel. These compressed compounds contain various organic materials, including rice husk, bagasse, ground nut shells, municipal solid waste, agricultural waste. The composition of the briquettes varies by area due to the availability of raw materials. The raw materials are gathered and compressed into briquette in order to burn longer and make transportation of the goods easier.\\"Feed Biomass.\\" Biomass.net. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. These briquettes are very different from charcoal because they do not have large concentrations of carbonaceous substances and added materials. Compared to fossil fuels, the briquettes produce low net total greenhouse gas emissions because the materials used are already a part of the carbon cycle.\\"Biomass Briquettes for Green Electricity Production.\\" Bionomicfuel.com. 4 May 2009. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. One of the most common variables of the biomass briquette production process is the way the biomass is dried out. Manufacturers can use torrefaction, carbonization, or varying degrees of pyrolysis. Researchers concluded that torrefaction and carbonization are the most efficient forms of drying out biomass, but the use of the briquette determines which method should be used.Chohfi, Cortez, Luengo, Rocha, and Juan Miguel. \\"Technology to Produce High Energy Biomass Briquettes.\\" Techtp.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. Compaction is another factor affecting production. Some materials burn more efficiently if compacted at low pressures, such as corn stover grind. Other materials such as wheat and barley-straw require high amounts of pressure to produce heat.Mani, Sokhansanj, and L.G. Tabil. \\"Evaluation of compaction equations applied to four biomass species. \\" University of Saskatchewan College of Engineering. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. There are also different press technologies that can be used. A piston press is used to create solid briquettes for a wide array of purposes. Screw extrusion is used to compact biomass into loose, homogeneous briquettes that are substituted for coal in cofiring. This technology creates a toroidal, or doughnut-like, briquette. The hole in the center of the briquette allows for a larger surface area, creating a higher combustion rate.\\"Biomass Briquetting: Technology and Practices - Introduction.\\" Centre for Ecological Sciences INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE BANGALORE. Web. 04 Dec. 2010. ==History== People have been using biomass briquettes in Nepal since before recorded history. Though inefficient, the burning of loose biomass created enough heat for cooking purposes and keeping warm. The first commercial production plant was created in 1982 and produced almost 900 metric tons of biomass. In 1984, factories were constructed that incorporated vast improvements on efficiency and the quality of briquettes. They used a combination of rice husks and molasses. The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) along with the Institute for Himalayan Conservation (IHC) created a mixture of coal and biomass in 2000 using a unique rolling machine.Ramesh Man Singh. \\"History of Bio-Briquetting . \\" brgcnn.net. 2008. Web. 30 November 2010. Japanese Ogalite In 1925, Japan independently started developing technology to harness the energy from sawdust briquettes, known as \\"Ogalite\\". Between 1964 and 1969, Japan increased production fourfold by incorporating screw press and piston press technology. The member enterprise of 830 or more existed in the 1960s. The new compaction techniques incorporated in these machines made briquettes of higher quality than those in Europe. As a result, European countries bought the licensing agreements and now manufacture Japanese designed machines.\\"Biomass Briquetting: Technology and Practices - Introduction.\\" Centre for Ecological Sciences INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE BANGALORE. Web. 04 Dec. 2010. ==Cofiring== Cofiring relates to the combustion of two different types of materials. The process is primarily used to decrease CO2 emissions despite the resulting lower energy efficiency and higher variable cost. The combination of materials usually contains a high carbon emitting substance such as coal and a lesser CO2 emitting material such as biomass. Even though CO2 will still be emitted through the combustion of biomass, the net carbon emitted is nearly negligible. This is due to the fact that the material gathered for the composition of the briquettes are still contained in the carbon cycle whereas fossil fuel combustion releases CO2 that has been sequestered for millennia. Boilers in power plants are traditionally heated by the combustion of coal, but if cofiring were to be implemented, then the CO2 emissions would decrease while still maintaining the heat inputted to the boiler. Implementing cofiring would require few modifications to the current characteristics to power plants, as only the fuel for the boiler would be altered. A moderate investment would be required for implementing biomass briquettes into the combustion process.PRABIR, B. and BUTLER, J. and LEON, M., \\"Biomass co-firing options on the emission reduction and electricity generation costs in coal- fired power plants\\", Renewable Energy, 36 (2011), 282-288. Cofiring is considered the most cost-efficient means of biomass. A higher combustion rate will occur when cofiring is implemented in a boiler when compared to burning only biomass. The compressed biomass is also much easier to transport since it is more dense, therefore allowing more biomass to be transported per shipment when compared to loose biomass. Some sources agree that a near-term solution for the greenhouse gas emission problem may lie in cofiring.PRABIR, B. and BUTLER, J. and LEON, M., \\"Biomass co-firing options on the emission reduction and electricity generation costs in coal-fired power plants\\", Renewable Energy, 36 (2011), 282-288. ==Compared to coal== The use of biomass briquettes has been steadily increasing as industries realize the benefits of decreasing pollution through the use of biomass briquettes. Briquettes provide higher calorific value per dollar than coal when used for firing industrial boilers. Along with higher calorific value, biomass briquettes on average saved 30‚Äì40% of boiler fuel cost.

However, in the long run, briquettes can only limit the use of coal to a small extent, but it is increasingly being pursued by industries and factories all over the world. Both raw materials can be produced or mined domestically in the United States, creating a fuel source that is free from foreign dependence and less polluting than raw fossil fuel incineration.Yugo Isobe, Kimiko Yamada, Qingyue Wang, Kazuhiko Sakamoto, Iwao Uchiyama, Tsuguo Mizoguchi and Yanrong Zhou. \\"Measurement of Indoor Sulfur Dioxide Emission from Coal‚ÄìBiomass Briquettes.\\" springerlink.com.

There was also a reduction from 11.1% to 38.5% in emissions when compared to coal from three different leading producers, EKCC Coal, Decanter Coal, and Alden Coal. Biomass briquettes are also fairly resistant to water degradation, an improvement over the difficulties encountered with the burning of wet coal. However, the briquettes are best used only as a supplement to coal. The use of cofiring creates an energy that is not as high as pure coal, but emits fewer pollutants and cuts down on the release of previously sequestered carbon.Montross, Neathery, O'Daniel, Patil, Sowder and Darrell Taulbee.

The economies are rapidly increasing due to cheap ways of harnessing electricity and emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide. The Kyoto Protocol attempted to regulate the emissions of the three different worlds, but there were disagreements as to which country should be penalized for emissions based on its previous and future emissions. The United States has been the largest emitter but China has recently become the largest per capita. The United States had emitted a rigorous amount of carbon dioxide during its development and the developing nations argue that they should not be forced to meet the requirements. At the lower end, the undeveloped nations believe that they have little responsibility for what has been done to the carbon dioxide levels.\\"CBC News In Depth: Kyoto and beyond.\\" CBC.ca - Canadian News Sports Entertainment Kids Docs Radio TV.

A lot of conversions of boilers from FO to biomass briquettes have happened over the past decade. A vast majority of those projects are registered under CDM (Kyoto Protocol), which allows for users to get carbon credits.http://agrofuelindia.com The use of biomass briquettes is strongly encouraged by issuing carbon credits. One carbon credit is equal to one free ton of carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere. India has started to replace charcoal with biomass briquettes in regards to boiler fuel, especially in the southern parts of the country because the biomass briquettes can be created domestically, depending on the availability of land. Therefore, constantly rising fuel prices will be less influential in an economy if sources of fuel can be easily produced domestically.\\"Biomass Briquette. \\" Www.gcmachines.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. Lehra Fuel Tech Pvt Ltd is approved by Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), is one of the largest briquetting machine manufacturers from Ludhiana, India. In the African Great Lakes region, work on biomass briquette production has been spearheaded by a number of NGOs with GVEP (Global Village Energy Partnership) taking a lead in promoting briquette products and briquette entrepreneurs in the three Great Lakes countries; namely, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. This has been achieved by a five-year EU and Dutch government sponsored project called DEEP EA (Developing Energy Enterprises Project East Africa) . The main feed stock for briquettes in the East African region has mainly been charcoal dust although alternative like sawdust, bagasse, coffee husks and rice husks have also been used. ==Use in developed world== Coal is the largest carbon dioxide emitter per unit area when it comes to electricity generation. It is also the most common ingredient in charcoal. There has been a recent push to replace the burning of fossil fuels with biomass. The replacement of this nonrenewable resource with biological waste would lower the carbon footprint of grill owners and lower the overall pollution of the world.\\"Biomass Briquettes.\\" Biomass.com.

Critics argue that the use of this land should be utilized for food distribution rather than crop degradation. Also, climate changes may cause a harsh season, where the material extracted will need to be swapped for food rather than energy. The assumption is that the production of biomass decreases the food supply, causing an increase in world hunger by extracting the organic materials such as corn and soybeans for fuel rather than food.\\"Biomass Energy: Pros and Cons ‚Äì Updated Article With New Information.\\" Green Energy Investments and News. 20 Sept. 2010.

Barbary and colleagues report that the spectrum of light emitted from the object does not match known supernova types, and is dissimilar to any known phenomenon in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. The light in the blue region shows broad line features, while the red region shows continuous emission.Mystery object spied with Hubble The European Homepage for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope November 2008 update The spectrum shows a handful of spectral lines, but when astronomers try to trace any one of them to an element the other lines fail to match up with any other known elements. Because of its uncommon spectrum, the team was not able to determine the distance to the object using standard redshift techniques; it is not even known whether the object is within or outside the Milky Way. Furthermore, no Milky Way star or external galaxy has been detected at this location, meaning any source is very faint. The European X-ray satellite XMM Newton made an observation in early August 2006 which appears to show an X-ray glow around SCP 06F6,How they wonder what you are, Nature News, 19 September 2008 two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of supernovae.G√§nsicke et al.: SCP06F6: A carbon-rich extragalactic transient at redshift z~0.14. Preprint, 2008. Observations from the Palomar Transient Factory, reported in 2009, indicate a redshift z = 1.189 and a peak magnitude of ‚àí23.5 absolute (comparable to SN2005ap), making SCP 06F6 one of the most luminous transient phenomena known as of that date. == Possible causes == Supernovae reach their maximum brightness in only 20 days, and then take much longer to fade away. Researchers had initially conjectured that SCP 06F6 might be an extremely remote supernova; relativistic time dilation might have caused a 20-day event to stretch out over a period of 100 days. But this explanation now seems unlikely. Other conjectures that have been advanced involve a collision between a white dwarf and an asteroid, or the collision of a white dwarf with a black hole.Star Light, Star Bright, Its Explanation Is Out Of Sight, Science Daily, 8 January 2009 An analysis by a team from the University of Warwick (Boris G√§nsicke et al.) suggests that the light spectrum is \\"consistent with emission from a cool, carbon-rich atmosphere at a redshift of z~0.14\\", possibly representing the core collapse and explosion of a carbon star. G√§nsicke's group concurs with Barbary and colleagues that SCP 06F6 may represent \\"a new class\\" of celestial object. The analysis of Israeli astronomers of Technion suggests four alternative explanations for SCP 06F6, in plausibility order: the tidal destruction of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole, a type Ia supernova exploding inside the dense stellar wind of a carbon star, an asteroid that was swallowed up by a white dwarf or, least likely, a core-collapse supernova.\\"Galactic vs. Extragalactic Origin of the Peculiar Transient SCP 06F6\\" Noam Soker, Adam Frankowski, Amit Kashi (Technion, Israel) Observations in 2009 indicate that it may be a pair-instability supernova.

Muslim Bagh was formerly called Hindu Bagh, which is believed to have originated in a garden that was planted here by a Hindu saint in ages past.\\"Killa Saifullah District,\\" Government of Balochistan, 2013, Retrieved on 21 Nov 2017 Later it was named as \\"Muslim Bagh\\" by former minister Moulvi Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of that time . In some winters, Kan Mehtarzai and Muslim Bagh experience several feet of snow, though normal temperature is about -7 ¬∞C to 10 ¬∞C (19 ¬∞F to 50 ¬∞F). Various tribes of Kakar inhabit the valley. In Kakar tribes the most famous tribes are Khoidadzai, Morizai, Meerzai, Mardanzai, Metherzai, Rahatzai, Sargarah, Merdadzai, Sultanzai, Bazai, Younskhail, Taran and Domar. Though in touch with the outside world for a long time they have retained their age-old traditions and are proud of them. Their hospitality is well known and the coming of a guest is always considered a blessing. == Railways == The section of railways, when laid during the British Raj, was called the Zhob Valley Railway (ZVR). It has been out of service since 1986 but these days all the left over track is being uprooted and sold as scrap. This was once longest Narrow-Gauge Railways of the British Raj. During First World War, a Railway line was laid from a place called Khanai (30 km north of Quetta) to Muslim Bagh. Muslim Bagh had Chrome mines, which was used in amunitions of First World War. The railway line at that time was a private siding for the Balochistan Chrome Ore Company. The work started on Khanai-Muslim Bagh line in 1916 and was opened for rail traffic in 1921. In 1927, the Muslim Bagh to Qila Saifullah section was opened and finally the section up to Zhob was opened in 1929. The total length of this railway from Bostan to Zhob was 294 km, which made it the longest narrow gauge railway of the British Raj in the 1920s. It had 11 stations in between including the famous Kan Mehtarzai station which was the highest station in Pakistan at an altitude of 2224 metres (7295 feet). For a long part of its journey, the railway followed the Zhob River and thus it was called the Zhob Valley Railway (ZVR). == Chromite == Chromite is the source of chromium used commercially and as an alloying element plays an important role in metallurgy. Balochistan is endowed with huge reserves of chromite. The first discovery was made at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai in district Kila Saifullah in 1901. Muslim Bagh deposits were first discovered by Vredenburg during the same period in the course of regional reconnaissance mapping of the province. Chromite mining has not been systematic but random and totally disorganised. It is mined by both open pit and underground methods. In Muslimbagh, Ras Koh Range and Wad areas, chromite is mostly mined by open pit method. However, due to podiform nature of the chromite, underground mining is also done. Use of donkeys for hauling the ore from underground is still in practice. The haulage machinery is also used. Presently, 300 to 500 tons of chromite are being produced at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai daily. It is taken in trucks to Karachi where it is crushed and packed in bags for export to foreign countries. Price depends on chrome content. China is a big market for the Balochistan chromite. Production activity in the sector directly depends upon the export market. The Provincial Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for regulating the mining operations. Presently, a few local companies are engaged at Muslim Bagh. The sources added that during the 1970s, Pakistan Chrom Mines (PCM) project was launched in Muslim Bagh area which was closed in 1989 due to financial constraints and lack of locally available technical staff. The land for mining is allotted under the Mines Act 1923 by the Directorate of Minerals, Balochistan. Different land belong to different people especially Sargarah, Khoidadzai, Metherzai, Bazi, and Merdadzai. == Archeology == The district has some archaeological sites mainly attributed to the Mughals. The ruins of an old fort called Mughalo Killa or \\"the fort of the Mughals\\" were found to the west of the Karezgai village, about 3¬º kilometres from Muslim Bagh, below which there is a spring of water which was reopened about 125 years ago. Fragments of ancient pottery were found in these ruins and it is said that old silver and copper coins were also found. The ruins of a fort called Khanki lie near Shina Khura about 25 kilometres east of Muslim Bagh. Local tradition asserts that the fort was held by Miro, a Mughal governor, who was miraculously overthrown by Sanzar Nika, the progenitor of the Sanzarkhel Kakars. There are also ruins of an old fort called the Mughalo Brunj in Murgha Faqirzai. Similar ruins occur near Toiwar, Sharan, Ismailzai and on the Zhar hill near Akhtarzai. There also exist ancient karezes, said to have been made in Mughal times, which may be considered as relics of archaeological interest. These include Karez Akhtarzai, Karez Soghai and Mustafa Karez in Killa Saifullah sub-division and 2 karezes in Sra Khulla, about 6¬Ω kilometres from Muslim Bagh.

Curzon was the son of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 2nd Baronet of Kedleston, and his wife, Sarah Penn, daughter of William Penn of Penn, Buckinghamshire. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 8 July 1690, aged 16 and was awarded BA in 1693. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1692. Curzon was returned with Thomas Coke in a contest as Member of Parliament for Derbyshire at the second general election of 1701. He was classified as a Tory and was returned with Coke unopposed in the English general elections of 1702, and 1705 English general election. At the 1708 British general election, Curzon was returned with Coke again unopposed. His only vote he recorded during that Parliament was against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. In June 1710, he presented a loyal address from Derbyshire, which was a calculated snub to Thomas Coke , who though a Tory was surrendering his principles to keep his lucrative public offices. At the 1710 British general election Curzon selected a new running mate and Coke went to stand elsewhere. Curzon was more active in this Parliament and was included among the ‚ÄòTory patriots‚Äô favouring peace, and as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who had helped to detect the mismanagements of the previous ministry. He was also a member of the October Club. At the 1713 British general election, he was returned unopposed again, but his brother had joined him in the House of Commons, and it is not possible to distinguish their contributions. One of the Curzons was responsible for managing through Parliament a bill for the Trent navigation. Curzon was returned again at the 1715 British general election. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy on 4 March 1719. He was returned again at the 1722 British general election. He died just before the dissolution for the 1727 general election.

Caught by the Germans, he escaped and returned to his homeland in the Bia≈Çystok countryside, which had been incorporated to the Soviet Union. He immediately began organizing anti- Soviet resistance movement, taking advantage of the landscape of the province, full of forests and swamps. His unit stayed around August√≥w, between the Biebrza river and the August√≥w Canal.

He took the Parliamentary side during the English Civil War. Skinner was of Tutsham Hall at West Farleigh in Kent and belonged to a newly arrived rather than established Kent family (his ancestors being from Devon. In 1642, he was elected Member of Parliament member for Kent the Long Parliament. He supported parliament in the Civil War and was sufficiently orthodox in his support to survive Pride's Purge. He refused to accept appointment as a Commissioner in the trial of the King. After the expulsion of the Rump Parliament he represented Kent again in the Parliament of 1654, and in the restored Rump in 1659. He was an active Justice of the Peace throughout the Commonwealth period, and it was said that Cromwell had great confidence in him as a magistrate. Skinner borrowed money to buy two manors which had been confiscated from the Bishop of Rochester; when these were restored to their original ownership at the Restoration, he found himself heavily in debt. His brother William was in similar difficulties, and together they procured a private Act of Parliament in 1660 to allow them to sell other lands to raise funds, Skinner's seat at Tutsham Hall being sold to one Edward Goulston. Skinner was still unable to meet his obligations and, being arrested for debt, he eventually died in the Fleet Prison in 1672, aged 78. He was buried at West Farleigh. Skinner made two good marriages, to Elizabeth Twisden, daughter of Serjeant-at-Law Richard Braithwaite, and to Ann Franklin, daughter of Thomas Franklin, an Alderman of the City of London; but his only son, also called Augustine (born 1618), lived less than a year, so that his heir was his brother, William. ==References== *D.

Blaptica dubia, the Dubia roach, also known as the orange-spotted roach, Guyana spotted roach, or Argentinian wood roach, is a medium-sized species of cockroach which grows to around . They are sexually dimorphic; adult males have full wings covering their body, while females have only tiny wing stubs, their tegmina (forewings) being around a fourth of their body length. Adults are dark brown to black with somewhat lighter orange spot/stripe patterning sometimes visible only in bright light. Coloration does differ slightly with environment and diet from one colony to another. Blaptica dubia are partially ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young after eggs hatch inside the female, and can give birth to 20 to 40 nymphs per month under favorable conditions. The Dubia cockroach is found in Central and South America, beginning in Costa Rica. It is common from French Guiana and Brazil to Argentina and Southern Africa Documented specimens have been found in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. ==Flight== While rarely known to fly, adult males have fully developed wings and pigmented musculature typical of cockroaches able to meet the rapid energy requirements of sustained flight. In laboratory test launches from a ramp 2.5 m high, adult male B. dubia were able to right their dorso-ventral position and rapidly deploy their wings to control and direct their descent; however, active powered flight did not maintain or increase their altitude. Adult females have only rudimentary forewings and lack the muscles required for flight, and showed no flight control in test launches. == Climbing == Neither adults nor juveniles can climb smooth, vertical surfaces, since they do not have a developed arolium. However, juveniles have been known to climb silicone surfaces, and the plastic sides of containers. == Habitat == Ideal temperature range is the higher end of a 24¬∞C - 35¬∞C range. They will not breed below 20¬∞C. They will not molt successfully if the humidity is too low. Dubia roaches can tolerate lower humidity than many other roach species. This species of roach will also sequester more water in its body when well fed upon fruits and water will be released at times of stress. In captivity, enclosure humidity is less important than a supply of high moisture foods, negating the need to mist the enclosure at all when compared to some other tropical pet insect species. Captive habitats should be kept clean and dry in order to have fecal droppings dry and not provide a medium for bacterial or fungal growth. Vertically stacked egg crates greatly help in this, as does good airflow. == Diet == The Dubia cockroach is a frugivore that prefers fruits and grains, shunning (but still eating) such high protein sources as meat or waste droppings from other animals. They particularly like semisweet vegetable matter. Appropriate feed for raising Dubia roaches includes: carrots, all manner of tropical fruits (mangos and papayas), apples, avocados, banana, cherries, pears, oranges, strawberries, fresh corn, tomatoes (some individuals show no interest in tomatoes while others eat readily), and lettuce (not iceberg or romaine)‚Äîmany other leafy greens will be accepted, including herbs.. All grain-based dry cat/dog food, fish food, rodent pellets, crested gecko meal and bearded dragon food can also be used to supplement their diet. They will also eat wheat bran and germ-based food products like assorted breads, non-sweetened breakfast cereals (such as Cheerios or Special K), and even softened pasta, although such diets must be augmented with edible vegetation and fruit of some sort to provide sufficient water. High starch tubers like potatoes and yams are eaten with disdain and seemingly only for their water content. Newborn nymph Dubia seem to depend on the adults waste for survival and hiding. Too much protein in Dubia may create too much uric acid, causing gout and potentially death in a colony and animals that eat them.. == Lifecycle == * Mating occurs when the male deposits a sperm packet in the female. This sperm packet inhibits the female from further mating. * B. dubia are ovovivoparous as such, eggs hatch within the female body. * Gestation is about one month (28 days). * Nymphs hatch inside the female. Between 20 and 40 live young, each about 2mm long, are produced in each clutch. * Nymphs mature in about 4‚Äì6 months depending on temperature and food supply. * Nymphs undergo 7 instars, its pronotum grows about 25% between molts, before reaching adulthood. * Adults live about 16 months to 2 years. == Use as feeder insect == Blaptica dubia has become a popular feeder insect, particularly among tarantula, amphibian and reptile enthusiasts. Keeping or breeding the insect is made easier by their inability to jump or climb smooth surfaces, relatively slow movement, and rarity of flying. They are also quiet, unlike crickets, and tropical environmental requirements reduce the likelihood of establishment of escapees in colder, dryer climates. B. dubia can cause allergic reactions in humans, although they produce relatively little odor compared to many cockroaches. A study found other cockroaches (Turkestan (\\"red runner\\") cockroaches, Madagascar hissing cockroaches,) provided a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, more so than mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates. Canada and some US states do not allow importation by the general public of B. dubia, considered by some as an invasive species. A Florida man was arrested on felony charges in 2011 related to ordering 500 B. dubia over the internet using a doctored permit, typically issued to researchers. == Reproduction == B. dubia is an ovoviviparous species, generally giving birth to live young, and pregnancy in one study lasted 48‚Äì64 days, in a 26¬∞C (78.8¬∞F) environment with alternating 12-hour light and dark photoperiods. It carries the ootheca (egg capsule), which holds about 20-35 eggs, until they are ready to hatch, or may drop it earlier under stress conditions. Adults live for up to 2 years, females slightly longer than males. Growth and reproduction rates are sensitive to environmental conditions, optimally 25‚Äì30¬∞C and above 60% relative humidity. == References == Category:Cockroaches Category:Pet foods Category:Insects described in 1838 ","title":"Blaptica dubia"},{"id":"19334466","text":"A police state is a government that exercises power through the power of the police force.

It was directed by Paul Cohen and Oeke Hoogendijk. ==Plot summary== Barneveld Castle, 2020. The Saved portrays the true story of about 600 Jews from the Netherlands and uncovers the shame that haunts them decades subsequent to their experience. This group of individuals was specially selected to live through the Holocaust since they were regarded as beneficial to their nation. Conversely, almost a hundred thousand Jews living in the Netherlands were expelled from the country and murdered by the Nazis. After a high-ranking Hague bureaucrat chose to intercede in order to assist a confidant, he was able to obtain a pact of sorts, which assured the safety of a pair of notable Jews and their households. When news of the deal became public, the Jewish population throughout the Netherlands wrote letters urging to be added onto the exclusive list. It was ultimately expanded to include hundreds of Jews. The group included renowned educators, artists, doctors and scientists. They came to be identified as the Barneveld group. Sent off to Barneveld castle, the Barneveld Jews formed a mini-city shaped after the world of high culture and refinement, which they were accustomed to at home. While the terror of the Holocaust devastated a majority of the European Jewish population, the Barneveld residents existed in comparative ease. Inhabitants carried along with the; home furnishings and porcelain dishware. A school was established and musical performances took place. As opposed to individuals held captive at death camps, the Barnevelders could spend time grooming themselves. A survivor remembers that the women constantly had their hair fashioned in the latest styles and the men never went a day without shaving. Love developed in the Barneveld community due to the close proximity of men and women. A couple met, became engaged and today have four adult children, their lifelong journey together started at the Barneveld home. As the castle‚Äôs population began to rise, the large home became more and more crowded. Some residents compared the situation to being in a large jail cell, with no bars. Soon after food was given out in rations and to make the most out of sleeping quarters, the men and women were divided into barracks styled housing. As time progressed communication with life beyond the castle was severely limited. Collectively, the unit fought to preserve an impression of individual pride and an air of ordinariness. Coping within the castle was difficult for a former resident, because everything that belonged to them was taken away; so it was challenging to show your uniqueness. In September 1943, the Barneveld clique was relocated to Westerbork, a Nazi labor camp located in Netherlands. The jolt was tremendous, from living in a mansion to residing in camp quarters. They were compelled by the Germans to take part in the expulsion of their neighbors at the camp. The Barnevelder group observed relatives and acquaintances being transferred form Westerbork to Auschwitz. However, the Barnevelders continued to be untouched. While the environment they lived in constantly worsened, the protection of their lives continued. Ultimately, the Barnevelders were moved to Theresienstadt, where they were forced to witness the death of relatives and friends members. Yet their destinies were secure. Virtually every Barnevelder accomplished to come out of World War II physically whole. Nevertheless the emotional pain lingers, and for many, the feeling of sorrow due to living through the war is even still now hard to conquer. At every point the chosen group was rescued from murder, although some see their continued existence as a blessing and a burden. The discussion of this past situation is one that leads to uproar, by the very people who lived through this experience. At the beginning of the documentary a Barnevelder expresses their displeasure about the creation of the film. This member believes more focus is due on the Dutch Jews that were killed, whose number total 100,000. Not on the extremely small minority that managed to survive throughout the war. All the same, the anomaly that is the Barnevelder group commands to be explored . ==NotesSee also== *List of Holocaust films ==References== * ==External links== *The Jewish Channel * Marjorie I.

The band comprised Phil Kline (vocals, guitar); Jim Jarmusch (vocals, keyboards); Philippe Hagen (bass); Josh Braun (percussion, drums); and Dan Braun (drums, percussion). Luc Sante wrote the lyrics to some of their songs, while James Nares sometimes contributed as a percussionist, and occasionally John Lurie performed with them on stage. They released a 12\\" EP: Girl's Imagination (1981), an LP: Lies to Live By (1982), and a 7\\" single: Draft Riot (1982). In 1985-86 they recorded two more songs (\\"The Last Time\\" and \\"Fascination\\"), which were never finished or officially released. The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page \\"At that time everyone in New York had a band,\\" Jarmusch recalled in an interview for The Washington Post (1984). \\"The idea was that you didn't have to be a virtuoso musician to have a band. The spirit was more important than having technical expertise, and that influenced a lot of filmmakers.\\"Interview posted at the Jim Jarmusch Resource Page According to Sante, they were \\"a band that insouciantly blended high and low, virtuosity and amateurism, calypso and science fiction, pots and pans and drones and the Supremes. They released several records, on a British label, which did very well in the former Yugoslavia.\\" They played a number of concerts at clubs such as CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club in New York City. Two of their songs were featured in Wim Wenders' 1982 film The State of Things. At the time, Hot Press said that their debut LP was \\"a debut equal to anything out of New York these past six years\\", and Melody Maker described it as \\"mighty stuff...

Consisting of a patty made from a mixture of beef or pork and an inexpensive meat extender such as soybeans, it is deep fried in oil. It is typically served on a bun with mustard, pickles, onion, and in some places with a side of French fries or onion rings. ==History== John Weeks brought his hamburger recipe from Chicago to Corinth in 1917. Weeks had local butchers grind his hamburger meat to specification, asking them to include potato flakes and flour. These small hamburgers were originally called Weeksburgers. Sometime before 1950, soy grits replaced the potato and flour and has remained the primary extender. According to town legend the term \\"slugburger\\" comes from the slang term for a metal disk the size of a nickel that would work in vending machines.Slugburger, History of Slugburger Sandwich, Corinth, MississippiCrossRoads Access, Inc.

The Slugburger Festival was started in 1988. In 2012, the first World Slugburger Eating Championship was held at the Festival, and the winners have come exclusively from Northern California, as professional Major League Eating eaters have dominated. Matt Stonie from San Jose, California won the first three, the last of which in 2014 he set the world record with 43 slugburgers eaten in 10 minutes, beating out Joey Chestnut in the field of 11. In 2015, Chestnut made amends just days after the eight-time Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest was defeated there by Stonie, who did not compete in Mississippi, by taking Stonie's crown in slugburgers with 33 eaten. He repeated the feat with 41 in 2016, after he had reclaimed the Nathan's title days earlier. ==See also== * List of hamburgers * Slider sandwich ==References *Weeks' Diner *History of the Slugburger *Slugburger Festival Homepage Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:Hamburgers (food) ","title":"Slugburger"},{"id":"19334717","text":"This is a list of former and current New York Times employees, reporters, and columnists. ==Current== Publisher * Arthur Gregg Sulzberger (2018‚Äìpresent)https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/business/media/a-g- sulzberger-new-york-times-publisher.html Masthead List of masthead employees as of August 2020: News * Dean Baquet, executive editor * Joseph Kahn, managing editor * Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy managing editor * Steve Duenes, deputy managing editor * Matthew Purdy, deputy managing editor * Elisabeth Bumiller, assistant managing editor * Sam Dolnick, assistant managing editor * Monica Drake, assistant managing editor * Matt Ericson, assistant managing editor New York Times Company,\\"Matt Ericson Named Assistant Managing Editor\\",January 30,2018 * Alison Mitchell, assistant managing editor * Carolyn Ryan, assistant managing editor * Sam Sifton, assistant managing editor * Michael Slackman, assistant managing editor Editorial * Kathleen Kingsbury, editorial page editor Business * Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., chairman of The New York Times Company * Mark Thompson, chief executive officer * Roland A.

The Park is owned by Westchester County and operated by its Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. Acquired in 1924, Willson's Woods is one of the oldest parks in the County's parks system. The Park was named for the former owner of the land, Charles Hill Willson of the Willson & Adams Lumber Company. The park is flanked to the east by the Hutchinson River Parkway and by Pelham Lake. It was built with the northern entrance passing under the now defunct New York, Westchester and Boston Railway line, and the southern under the still working New Haven Line. Consisting of twenty-three acres, the Park contains amenities and facilities for a variety of activities, including fishing, hiking, ice skating, picnicking, and swimming.\\"Westchestergov.com - Willson's Woods Park\\" In 2010, Willson's Woods received the highest inspection scores out of all the county's active parks. == Swimming Facility == Willson's Woods Park has been home to a swimming facility since 1928. The construction of a one-million-gallon swimming pool and two-story, Tudor Revival style bathhouse on the Park's property began in 1927. Construction was completed in 1928, and the facility opened on Independence Day of that year under the name Willson's Woods Pool. A swimming competition was held at the Pool on opening day. Following the summer of 2004, Willson's Woods Pool underwent a major renovation, transforming it into what the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation has called an \\"aquatic playground.\\"\\"Westchestergov.com - Pool and Beach Fees\\" Although the bathhouse remained virtually the same, the old pool was replaced with a wave pool, two eighteen-foot water slides, a small pool and play structure for young children (called the Aqua Playground), and a splash pad (called the Sprayground).\\"Westchestergov.com - Willson's Waves\\" The new facility opened for the summer of 2005 under the name Willson's Waves. The original plans for the renovation included two additional water slides and had the wave pool being a larger size; however, these aspects of the project had to be abandoned due to monetary reasons. In most instances, people wishing to enter Willson's Waves must possess an identity card called a Park Pass. Park Passes are available for purchase by residents of Westchester County at the facility during its operating season as well as at various locations throughout the County.\\"Westchestergov.com - Where to Buy Passes\\" People using one of the Park's reserved picnic areas can use their picnic permit in place of a Park Pass for the day of their reservation. Residents of the County who would like to enter Willson's Waves but do not wish to purchase a Park Pass can pay a higher admission rate as along as they present sufficient identification and proof of their residencey in the County; however, people who enter in this manner are not allowed to bring other adults or children into the facility with them. Park Pass holders have the option of purchasing a Season Swim Pass for an additional fee; the Season Swim Pass, valid for one summer, allows an individual or a family to pay a single upfront fee instead of paying admission on a daily basis.\\"Westchestergov.com - Season Swim Pass\\" There currently are plans to expand Willson's Waves by adding the two water slides that were intended to be part of the 2004 renovation. In addition, replicas of the original bathhouse windows are to be installed, but no further improvements are planned for the bathhouse in order to maintain the building's architectural aesthetic and have it declared a historic site of some kind. == Picnicking == Located in Willson's Woods Park are areas that are available for use for group picnics. Reservations must be made in advance with the Group Permit Office of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation by either a resident of Westchester County or a business that is located in the County. The Park has three picnic areas, each able to accommodate up to seventy-five people, located on its southeastern property. There also is a pavilion, called DeMatteo Terrace (in honor of \\"valued County employee\\" Charles \\"Chuck\\" J. DeMatteo), located on the second story of Willson's Waves bathhouse that can hold up to one hundred people.\\"Westchestergov.com - Group Picnic Fees and Pavilions\\" == References  * Official site Category:Mount Vernon, New York Category:Parks in Westchester County, New York ","title":"Willson's Woods Park"},{"id":"19334760","text":"Dieudonn√© Yougbar√© (February 16, 1917 ‚Äì November 4, 2011) was a Burkinab√©-born bishop of the Roman Catholic Church.

Mediocre reached #10 on Billboard's Latin Pop Albums, and spawned the hit single \\"Vidas Paralelas\\" (\\"Parallel Lives\\"). The album gained additional attention when the iTunes Store featured Sari√±ana's song \\"Normal\\" as the canci√≥n de la semana ‚Äî iTunes' free Latino song of the week ‚Äî during the week of . Mediocre garnered good reviews from many critics, receiving five stars from SoMinty, four stars from Time Out, and four stars from Rolling Stone magazine. Many critics praise Mediocre for being an eclectic album with a diverse style of songs featuring pop, rock, alternative, and nueva canci√≥n styles. == Theme == Sari√±ana clarified that her title choice, \\"Mediocre\\", means to denounce mediocrity and conformity. She explained in an interview, \\"This whole idea of the perfect woman of the ‚Äò50s is what the title song is about... There was no possibility of being something different, and that, in turn, created a prototype of a woman who was mediocre.\\" The album artwork for Mediocre meant to emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sari√±ana elaborated, \\"The cover is a take on the idea that women in the ‚Äò40s and ‚Äò50s had to be ‚Äòperfect.‚Äô Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and embroidering perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea.\\" Sari√±ana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: \\"It‚Äôs not to say that the material is mediocre, but rather that it‚Äôs a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title.\\" == Recording and production == Recording commenced in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in May 2007 and finished in August 2007. Various studio musicians were brought in for the recording of Mediocre. Bruno Bressa, the drummer of Volov√°n, helped in the production process of the album, and also played the keyboard and tabla for its tracks. Argentine producer Tweety Gonz√°lez and Uruguayan producer Juan Campod√≥nico produced the album in 2008. == Musical style == Mediocre showcases rock, pop, and hip-hop influences. Jimmy Draper of Time Out New York describes the musical style as \\"full of buoyant, jazz-inflected pop with occasional electronic underpinnings and outbursts of rock\\". The album opens with \\"Mediocre\\", a heavily rock-influenced track, leading to the pop single \\"Vidas Paralelas\\". Sari√±ana relies heavily upon the piano in the pop track \\"Normal\\", which also features brass and vocal harmonies. \\"La Tina\\" displays a hip-hop influence through its use of electronic beats. \\"No Vuelvo M√°s\\" features Sari√±ana's use of additional vocal harmonies, as well as acoustic guitars. Ron Bronson of SoMinty points out that \\"Un Error\\" and \\"Sintiendo Rara\\" are slower songs reminiscent of Sari√±ana's interest in jazz. Lissette Corsa of Orlando Weekly points out that Mediocre follows a unique contemporary jazz style. Corsa praises Mediocre, calling it a \\"deftly crafted alt-pop record\\", but notes that \\"it‚Äôs the electronic embellishments, dub effects and jazz trimmings‚Äîin the form of loose piano lines, subtle tempo changes and vocal improvisations‚Äîthat make it unique.\\" Corsa also praises Sari√±ana, whose \\"lyrics exhibit a remarkable depth for someone her age\\", saying Sari√±ana has \\"a keen understanding of composition and melodic structure\\".  Genres  Since Mediocre incorporates many different styles of music, the exact genre of the album is disputed. Allmusic classifies Mediocre as a pop/rock album with adult alternative pop/rock stylings. However, the iTunes Store classifies Mediocre as an alternativo album to accentuate its Latin American style as well as its alternative style. SoMinty classifies Mediocre as an indie pop album, and Rhapsody categorizes Mediocre as nueva canci√≥n, or \\"new song\\". == Critical reception == Criticism of Mediocre has been mostly positive, and many critics highly acclaim the album. The Rolling Stone staff rated Mediocre four stars, and Rolling Stones average viewer rating is four and a half stars. Mark Kemp, a music journalist from Rolling Stone, called Mediocre one of the strongest debuts from a female singer-songwriter since Norah Jones' Come Away with Me, exclaiming \\"There's sultry torch songs, folky ballads, smart rock ‚Äî and not a bum track among them.\\" Ron Bronson, a music journalist from the website SoMinty, awarded Mediocre five stars. He describes Sari√±ana's voice on Mediocre as being \\"something along the lines of Nellie McKay meets countryman Julieta Venegas meets Sia. [Her voice is] original, in other words. Very original.... If you have any real desire to listen to music en espa√±ol, you'll be hard pressed to find a better singer on the indie scene these days. Ximena has got chops, folks.\\" Ernesto S√°nchez of People en Espa√±ol labeled Mediocre \\"one of the most promising Latin Music albums of [2008]\\". Eric Danton of The Hartford Courant pointed out that \\"her prospects in the United States are less predictable thanks to a fragmented radio landscape and what for many English- speaking listeners is a language barrier.\\" == Awards and nominations== Sari√±ana was nominated for two awards at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 for Mejor Nuevo Artista (Best New Artist) and Mejor Canci√≥n Alternativa (Best Alternative Song) for her single \\"Normal\\". Sari√±ana won an award at the MTV Latin America Awards 2008 for Artista Revelaci√≥n (Discovery Artist).

Upon completion of loading at Port Chicago, California, and at San Pablo, California, she steamed for Pearl Harbor 28 December. Newcastle Victory departed Pearl Harbor 17 January 1945, arrived Guam 1 February, departed 6 February in a small convoy bound for Ulithi, where she anchored 8‚Äì17 February. She then returned to Guam and offloaded ammunition for the newly commissioned ammunition depot there. She departed 7 March for San Francisco via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. At Pearl Harbor she received a three-week availability, which brought new ordnance and radar equipment and habitability improvements. She departed Pearl Harbor 17 April, arrived San Francisco 23 April, and then took on a new cargo of ammunition at Port Chicago, California. She steamed towards Leyte 15 May, via Pearl Harbor, Saipan, and Ulithi. During June she serviced ships in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, in the Philippine Islands; during July she returned to Ulithi and there assumed duties as station issues ship. Newcastle Victory was directed to proceed to Seattle, Washington, in November 1945, where she was laid up in a reduced manning status until May 1946, when she was directed to report to the 3d Naval District for disposal. She steamed in early May via the Panama Canal and Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, where she offloaded her ammunition. ==Post-war decommissioning and career== She reported to Commander, 3d Naval District, New York, 30 May and decommissioned 21 June. She was stricken from the Navy List 3 July 1946. Returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission, she was laid up in the Hudson River, New York.

It allows divers to descend several hundred metres. Precautions are necessary when using hydrox, since mixtures containing more than a few percent of both oxygen and hydrogen are explosive if ignited. Hydrogen is the lightest gas (half the weight of helium) but still has a narcotic potential and may cause hydrogen narcosis. ==History== Although the first reported use of hydrogen seems to be by Antoine Lavoisier (1743‚Äì1794), who had guinea pigs breathe it, the actual first uses of this gas in diving are usually attributed to trials by the Swedish engineer, Arne Zetterstr√∂m in 1945. Zetterstr√∂m showed that hydrogen was perfectly usable to great depths. Following a fault in using the surface equipment, he died during a demonstration dive. The study of hydrogen was not resumed until several years later by the United States Navy and by the Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), initially during their Hydra I and Hydra II experiments, in 1968 and 1969.Comex keeps up the High Pressure, Comex Magazine Comex subsequently developed procedures allowing dives between 500 and 700 metres (1650 to 2300 feet) in depth, while breathing gas mixtures based on hydrogen, called hydrox (hydrogen-oxygen) or hydreliox (hydrogen-helium-oxygen).  Memorial dives  In July 2012, after about a year of preparation and planning, members of the Swedish Historical Diving Society and the Royal Institute of Technology Diving Club, performed a series of hydrox dives in memory of Arne Zetterstr√∂m, who was accidentally killed during the ascent from his record dive using hydrox in August 1945. The memorial dives were performed using the same breathing mixture of 96% hydrogen and 4% oxygen as was developed and tested by Zetterstr√∂m in the 1940s. The dives were made to a depth of , just deep enough to be able to use the oxygen-lean gas mixture. Project Leader Ola Lindh commented that in order to repeat Zetterstr√∂m's record the team would need to make a dive to , and even today a dive to that depth is considered extreme. ==Use== Hydrox may be used to combat high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS), commonly occurring during very deep dives. These studies scored a resounding success with a simulated dive to , by Theo Mavrostomos on 20 November 1990 at Toulon, during the COMEX Hydra X decompression chamber experiments. This dive made him \\"the deepest diver in the world\\". ==Biochemical decompression== The United States Navy has evaluated the use of bacterial flora to speed decompression from hydrox diving. ==See also== *Argox *Heliox *Hydreliox *Nitrox *Trimix ==References *COMEX Hydra - Hyperbaric Experimental Centre *Diving With Gas Mixes Other Than Air, Larry \\"Harris\\" Taylor *Theo Mavrostomos picture *Fact sheet and links Category:Breathing gases Category:Hydrogen technologies ","title":"Hydrox (breathing gas)"},{"id":"19334831","text":"John Hill was an American screenwriter and television producer.

Springfield, Massachusetts was the first charitable institution in Western Mass. At that time, the Study Home addressed women's issues, family welfare, emotional rehabilitation and child development. Its first President was Rachel Capen Merriam. The home responded to problems facing women and children at the end of the American Civil War era. On April 27, 1865, the home received its incorporation from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A ‚Äúwell built and commodious house‚Äù on Union Street was purchased. According to Article 2 of the 1865 Constitution, the ‚Äúobject of this institution shall be to provide a temporary home for friendless and destitute women and children; and to give them employment and instruction with the ultimate design of providing for them a more permanent situation, or fitting them to maintain themselves.‚Äù At the end of its first year in March 1866, forty women and twenty children had received services from the Home for Friendless Women and Children. In 1866, the Massachusetts Legislature was asked to allocate $2,000 to the organization which was granted with the provision that the community in Springfield provide a match of funds through private donations. The community raised $2,123.91 along with more tangible donations such as flour and clothes. The home came to be known as Springfield's first public charity. Throughout the 19th century the home continued to serve women and children enduring some type of difficulty due to the war, immigration, physical abuse, sexual abuse, imprisonment, illness, drug addiction, and/or unmarried and pregnant. In 1870, after outgrowing the Union Street home, and after the donations of many, a new additional facility was constructed on Buckingham Street, a Children's Home, and its grand opening was in May 1871. The first school was established in 1873. The Union Street home then had the space needed for females. Around 1872 Rachel Capen Merriam transferred leadership to a new President, Mrs. William Rice. During the following decades and into the new century, the troubles of society commanded growth of facilities and growth of donations. In 1897, a home on Williams Street opened, a Home for Women, and an addition to the Buckingham Street home was added. By 1926 the structure on Buckingham Street was demolished due to structural condition. The Sherman Street address was added in November 1928 at St. Peter's Rectory. The Williams Street facility became known as the only home for unwed mothers in the city. At this point, the managerial structure of the corporation had been divided into three divisions with Mrs. Edward Bradford chairing the William Street committee; Mrs. Frederick Everett chairing the Buckingham Street committee; and Mrs. Robert Cooley chairing the newly created Sherman St. Committee. The cottage was opened in 1935. Eventually a third building was added to Sherman Street to house administration, laundry and staff. Due to findings of the Council of Social Agencies, the Home for Unmarried mothers was closed forever in 1938. The corporation would now focus exclusively on children's needs. The Home at this time was providing temporary care for youngsters facing some type of disruption in their family life. In 1940, the United Fund and the Community Council asked the Home to consider a different program for emotionally disturbed boys and girls up to age 12. This was accepted and that work began. At this time, the agency became known as The Children's Study Home to reflect the diagnostic and treatment work we pioneered for children with emotional and behavioral problems. By 1959, it became necessary to address the Home's mission and future direction due to decline in admissions. The board voted in 1961 to accept recommendations for a treatment oriented institution for emotionally disturbed boys and girls ages 6 to 12. In addition, the recommendation called for a foster home program followed by a group home arrangement for children ready to re-enter the community. On February 28, 1966, the Kathleen Thornton School, named after the director of the agency from 1940‚Äì1960 opened as a school to educate youngsters not able to function in public school. The agency was again expanded in 1976 to include treatment of teenagers facing emotional challenges. By 1979 a campus in the Sixteen Acres section of Springfield was acquired to meet the special needs of this program. The Mill Pond School, houses a middle school for grades 6‚Äì8 and a high school, grades 9‚Äì12 and today, still includes academic, administrative and recreational components, and in 2001 added SHARP 1, an adolescent residential program. The Children's Study Home began providing services for Cape Cod and the Islands in 1993 with a focus on adolescent and family services and today has expanded to provide additional services for youth and families. The Children's Study Home Inc. today lives through its mission of being a charitable organization devoted to identifying and solving child and family problems for the community. == External links == *www.studyhome.org == References == *Gagnon, Frances (1990)125 Years The Children's Study Home, Founded as The Springfield Home For Friendless Women & Children Category:Non- profit organizations based in Massachusetts Category:Organizations established in 1865 Category:1865 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Organizations based in Springfield, Massachusetts ","title":"The Children's Study Home"},{"id":"19334851","text":"Qayalƒ± or Kayaly may refer to: *Qayalƒ±, Barda, Azerbaijan *Qayalƒ±, Jalilabad, Azerbaijan *Qayalƒ±, Qubadli, Azerbaijan ","title":"Qayalƒ±"},{"id":"19334855","text":"Francis Kompaon (born 16 January 1986 in RabaulFrancis Kompaon's biography on the official website of the 2008 Paralympics) is a T46 Papua New Guinean athlete.

It is considered as part of the K√§rnten traditional organisations. The purpose of the organisation is to care for the memorials to returning soldiers (Heimkehrergedenkst√§tte) on the Ulrichsberg and in Klagenfurt, as well as the organisation of an annual meeting of war veterans and their families. == The organisation == The Ulrichsberggemeinschaft (\\"Ulrichsberg society\\") was founded on 1 June 1953, and is based in Klagenfurt.Zentrales Vereinsregister des BMI, ZVR-Zahl 454661194 Various Klagenfurt politician belonged to the society, including then mayor of Klagenfurt, Leopold Guggenberger (√ñVP), who succeeded acting Landeshauptmann Rudolf Gallob (SP√ñ), who had resigned in 2009 because \\"the clear rules to avoid extremism\\" had failed. Ex-minister Herbert Haupt (BZ√ñ) and Klagenfurt mayor Harald Scheucher (√ñVP) supported the organisation as members. Scheucher's father Blasius Scheucher had served as a Gebirgsj√§ger and was a founder member of the society. Since 2002, besides membership fees and donations, a significant proportion of the finance of the society has been provided by the Bundesland K√§rnten. Between 2005-12, the society received 115 thousand euros from state funds. Landesrat Wolfgang Waldner reported that this subsidy would be significantly reduced in future, and that if the society were not to distance itself completely from right-wing radicalism, the subsidy would be completely cut. == Ulrichsberg meeting == Wreath-laying by the Kameradschaft IV-Landesverband Steiermark - S√ºdburgenland as part of the Ulrichsberg meeting of 2008 Commemorative plaque for the Heimatvertriebene. Since 1958 there has been a regular memorial on the small meadow next to the cross for the victims of both world wars and of the defence of K√§rnten. Right- wing and neo-nazi groups have also been known to frequent this meeting, and it is therefore observed by the Austrian Verfassungsschutz (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism). In 2009, the Austrian army under Norbert Darabos ended its logistic support for the meeting. At the same time, the defence minister also forbade the wearing of army uniforms at meetings of the Ulrichsberg society. Darabos distanced himself from the meeting of veterans, because \\"the Ulrichsberg meetings have always had a right-wing flavour\\". For these reasons, as well as the political controversy, the 2009 meeting was completely cancelled. BZ√ñ governor Gerhard D√∂rfler also distanced himself from the meeting, because it was \\"politically too far right\\". About 400 people took part at the 2010 meeting, which took place at the herzogstuhl (Duke's Chair). In 2011, the meeting took place at the Klagenfurt concert hall, and the Verfassungschutz reported that about 100 people attended. In 2012, the meeting returned to the Ulrichsberg. One of the speeches was held by a previous Hitlerjugend and Waffen-SS member Herbert Belschan von Mildenburg, although this had been denied by the organisers beforehand. Instead of the expected crowd of 1000, only about 300 people attended the meeting. ==Political appearances and controversies== In 1995, FP√ñ governor J√∂rg Haider notably expressed his thanks to the attending Waffen-SS veterans: J√∂rg Haider had a significant influence on the public image of the society with another speech: The meeting as such, as well as the participation of the three largest parties in K√§rnten (FP√ñ, SP√ñ und √ñVP) has recently been strongly criticised. == Protests against the meeting == Traditional group \\"HIAG Ostsachsen\\" at the Ulrichsberg meeting at Ulrichsberg mountain in 2003 In the night of 17 August 1997, the Ulrichsberg memorial site was defaced and the memorial plaques were destroyed.

In the last configuration the circles are pairwise coincident. In geometry, the six circles theorem relates to a chain of six circles together with a triangle, such that each circle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and also to the preceding circle in the chain. The chain closes, in the sense that the sixth circle is always tangent to the first circle. It is assumed in this construction that all circles lie within the triangle, and all points of tangency lie on the sides of the triangle. If the problem is generalized to allow circles that may not be within the triangle, and points of tangency on the lines extending the sides of the triangle, then the sequence of circles eventually reaches a periodic sequence of six circles, but may take arbitrarily many steps to reach this periodicity. The name may also refer to Miquel's six circles theorem, the result that if five circles have four triple points of intersection then the remaining four points of intersection lie on a sixth circle. == References  * Category:Circles Category:Theorems in plane geometry ","title":"Six circles theorem"},{"id":"19334944","text":"Andre Durie (born July 27, 1981) is a former professional Canadian football running back/slotback who played for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 2007 to 2016. He signed with the Argonauts on May 10, 2007 as a free agent after he went undrafted in the 2007 CFL Draft. He played CIS football for the York Lions. As of 2016, Durie is longest tenured member of the Argonauts, having played for the team since 2007. == College career == After attending Iona Catholic Secondary School in Mississauga, Ontario, Andre Durie played CIS football for York University in Toronto. He started playing for the York Lions in 2003 after he set a junior Ontario Varsity Football League record with 22 touchdowns in a season. In 2004, Durie had a record-breaking season starting eight games at running back and set an Ontario University Athletics record for single game rushing yards with 349 and single-season York records for rushing yards (1,367), scoring (96 points), and rushing touchdowns (15), and a career York record for rushing touchdowns (23). Durie also tied a CIS single-game record with six touchdowns to lead York to a 55-33 win over Waterloo. In the second game of the 2005 season he suffered nerve damage in his knee after a botched juke on third down and sat out the remainder of 2005 and 2006 seasons. == Professional career == After overcoming injuries that hurt his CIS career, Durie impressed the Argonauts management at the league evaluation camp and he appeared in 5 games for the Argos in 2007. After suffering another injury setback which has cost Durie more than half of the 2008 season he returned to action on special teams and as back-up running back. In 2009, Durie dressed for all 18 games including weeks 1-5 as backup running back. In week 6 he made the switch to slotback and has remained in that role since, although still a backup. In this same season, he attained a 1000-yard kickoff return season, becoming the fourth Argonaut to do so, with 43 returns for 1033 yards. In the 2010 season, Durie won a job in the starting lineup as a RB/SB, but sees most of his touches as a receiver. In 2012, Durie won his first Grey Cup, defeating the Calgary Stampeders, scoring a touchdown in the 35-22 win.https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=410276 Durie had his best receiving season of his career during the 2013 CFL season, setting career highs in receptions with 92 and yards with 986. Following the 2013 season Durie re-signed with the Argos through the 2016 CFL season, a deal that will reportedly earn around $140,000 annually.Argos Re-Sign Veteran Slotback Durie to Contract Extension ==Career statistics== { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"1\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"65%\\"  - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Rushing ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

The common names of the plant include baby sun rose,. heart-leaf, red aptenia or aptenia in English, as well as rooi brakvygie or brakvygie in Afrikaans, and umjuluka, ibohlololo, or uncolozi omncane in isiZulu in South Africa. It is known as heartleaf iceplant in the USA British names may be heart-leaved aptenia or heart-leaved midday flower because, like many other representatives of the Aizoaceae, it opens its flowers only during the sunshine of the day. It is a creeping plant that forms a carpet of flat-growing perennial herbs in groups on the ground from a base.C. Brickell (ed.): Encyclopedia of garden and indoor plants. Orbis, Munich 1994, Genus name means middle-embryo flower in reference to the position of the ovary in the flower. The specific epithet is derived from Latin for heart-shaped leaves. ==Taxonomy== Mesembryanthemum cordifolium is an accepted name according to \\"The Plant List\\" http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2363065 database, the primary source for the modern APG taxonomy of flowering plants. Formerly placed in the genus Aptenia and known as A. cordifolia, it was included in Mesembryanthemum in 1997 when the whole genus Aptenia was redused to synonymy.Klak, Cornelia & Bruyns, Peter & Hedderson, Terry. (2007). A Phylogeny and New Classification for Mesembryanthemoideae (Aizoaceae). Taxon. 56. 737-756. 10.2307/25065858. Perhaps the most common plant seen under this name in gardens is actually Mesembryanthemum 'Red Apple', a hybrid with more vigorous growth, red flowers and bright green leaves, whose parents are M. cordifolium and M. haeckelianum. The true species of M. cordifolium has magenta-purple flowers and more heart- shaped, mid-green, textured leaves.Flora of North America Editorial Committee, e. 2003.

Plants only rise to about tall but prostrate stems reach up to about long. The stems are green and stalk-round. The fleshy, small leaves are opposite, ovate to cordate, about long and covered with fine papillae. Bright pink to purplish solitary flowers appear in the leaf axils, open during the day but close up at night and remain closed on cloudy days. These colored whorls are not petals, but non-functional modified stamens. Normal stamens are yellow. Flowers bloom primarily from spring to fall. The fruit is a capsule of little more than one centimeter in length with millimeter brown tuberose seeds. There is a variegated form.W. Haage: Cacti and succulents. Quelle & Meyer, Heidelberg 1989, ==Uses== The primary use of the plant is ornamental. The locals of the region of origin use the plant for its anti-inflammatory properties.J. Ettelt: succulent card index. In: cacti and other succulents. 3/2004. Cultivation Mesembryanthemum cordifolium can be planted as a fast- growing, not hardy, groundcover in flower boxes and around traffic lights. The plant needs a sunny spot and well drained soil. This plant is also ideal for covering walls, rockeries and areas bare of grass. Due to its quick growth, it is useful to prevent the growth of weeds in the field where it is planted. It can also survive without problems in a pot, where it is grown in hanging baskets so the long trailing branches can hang down with their leaves spaced out. Over-wintering should take place in a frost-free, sunny place at approximately . No serious insect or disease problems are known. In addition to the species and the hybrid 'Red Apple', one also encounters the variety A. x. 'Mezoo', a mutant of 'Red Apple' whose variegated leaves have creamy white edges, and rarely on a white-flowering form. Propagation It easily reproduces from cuttings of the developed stems, roots, seeds of its capsular fruit, and even from its own buried leaves. Seeds must be sowed in summer and cuttings can be done in early spring in cooler climates. For cuttings, the plant can be divided and runners can be planted directly into the ground. The garden bed must be readied by digging over the soil. Compost and a slow- release fertilizer may be added to ensure healthy growth. With regard to risks, it is very resistant to drought, but with moist soil it grows rapidly. It is convenient that the farmland has good drainage. It cannot withstand frost, where it freezes below . ==Gallery== File:Aptenia cordifolia 1.jpgFlower File:Aptenia cordifolia 02.jpgOn ground ==References *Jepson Manual Treatment *Flora of North America *Photo gallery cordifolium Category:Garden plants of Southern Africa Category:Flora of Southern Africa Category:Plants described in 1782 ","title":"Mesembryanthemum cordifolium"},{"id":"19334976","text":"≈û…ônlik is a village and municipality in the Aghjabadi Rayon of Azerbaijan.

His successful career as a general spanned three decades, chiefly against the Sassanid Persians. ==Career under Maurice== Map of the Roman-Persian frontier. Little is known about Philippicus's early years. He was married to Gordia, sister of Emperor Maurice (reigned 582‚Äì602), probably in 583,. and was at some point raised to the high rank of patricius.. At about the same time, he was appointed comes excubitorum (Commander of the Excubitors, the imperial bodyguard), and in 584, he replaced John Mystacon as magister militum for the East, thus becoming responsible for the conduct of the ongoing war against the Sassanid Persians. He commanded numerous raids into Persian territory in 584‚Äì585, ravaging the plains near Nisibis, and making inroads in the regions of Arzanene and eastern Mesopotamia.. During the same period, he actively tried to improve the discipline and efficiency of his troops.. Philippicus spent the winter of 585-586 in Constantinople, and returned to his headquarters in Amida in the spring. After Persian peace proposals were rejected, he advanced his troops to the frontier, where he defeated a superior Persian force under Kardarigan at the Battle of Solachon. He then proceeded to invade and plunder Arzanene and laid siege to the fortress of Chlomaron. However, the approach of a Persian relief army panicked the Romans, who fled in disorder back into Roman territory. There, possibly due to illness, he handed over command of his army to his hypostrategos (lieutenant general) Heraclius, the father of the future emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641). In spring 587, he was again ill, and unable to campaign in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, and sent them to raid Persian territory. He did not campaign himself that year, and in the winter, he set off towards Constantinople. On his way, he learned that he had been replaced by Priscus.. When Priscus arrived in the East, however, the soldiers refused to obey him, and elected the dux of Phoenice Libanensis, Germanus, as their leader in his stead. Philippicus, who was soon re-appointed as commander of the East, could only assume his command after the mutiny was quelled through the intervention of the Patriarch of Antioch.. After a public reconciliation with his troops, in the summer of 589 he campaigned against the city of Martyropolis, which had recently fallen to the Persians through the treacherous defection of a Roman officer named Sittas. Philippicus failed to retake it and was defeated by a Persian relief force led by Mahbodh and Aphrarat, after which he was replaced by Comentiolus.. Except for a diplomatic mission in 590 to the recently deposed Persian ruler Khosrau II (r. 590‚Äì628), who had taken refuge in Roman territory, Philippicus disappears from the scene for several years. In 598, he was briefly appointed general in the ongoing war in the Balkans,. and is credited by some sources with a victory over the Avars in Thrace,. although this is most likely due to a confusion with general Priscus.. ==Career under Phocas and Heraclius== At some point in 602, suspicions fell upon him of plotting against Emperor Maurice, since a prophecy stated that the name of Maurice's successor would begin with a Œ¶ (Phi). Indeed, soon after, Maurice was deposed and killed by a revolt in the Balkan army led by Phocas. As a close associate of Maurice, Philippicus was tonsured and forced to enter a monastery in Chrysopolis.. He was still at the monastery when Heraclius overthrew Phocas in 610. The new emperor recalled him and sent him to negotiate with Phocas's brother, Comentiolus, who commanded the eastern army. Comentiolus imprisoned him and intended to execute him, but Philippicus was saved when Comentiolus himself was murdered. In 612, he was again appointed by Heraclius as magister militum per Orientem succeeding the disgraced Priscus, and campaigned against the Persians in Armenia. In 614, as a Persian army under Shahin invaded Asia Minor and reached the shores of the Bosporus at Chalcedon, Philippicus invaded Persian territory in turn, hoping to cause Shahin to withdraw. Philippicus died shortly after, and was buried in a church he had built at Chrysopolis. ==Possible authorship of the Strategikon== As one of the leading generals of his day, and with both the time and opportunity to write it sometime after 603, during the years he spent in a monastery, Philippicus is one of the possible authors of the military treatise known as the Strategikon and traditionally attributed to Maurice. ==ReferencesSources== * * * Category:6th-century births Category:610s deaths Category:6th-century Byzantine military personnel Category:7th-century Byzantine military personnel Category:Comites excubitorum Category:Generals of Heraclius Category:Generals of Maurice Category:Justinian dynasty Category:Magistri militum Category:Patricii Category:People of the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628 Category:People of the Roman‚ÄìSasanian Wars ","title":"Philippicus (comes excubitorum)"},{"id":"19334991","text":"≈û…ônlik or Sheinli may refer to: *≈û…ônlik, Aghjabadi, Azerbaijan *≈û…ônlik, Kalbajar, Azerbaijan ","title":"≈û…ônlik"},{"id":"19334999","text":"Seven circles theoremIn geometry, the seven circles theorem is a theorem about a certain arrangement of seven circles in the Euclidean plane.

She lives and works in Brooklyn, New York with her husband Jon Lott and son August. ==Early life and education== Al-Hadid was born in Aleppo, Syria. At the age of five, she emigrated with her family to North Canton, Ohio. She speaks both Arabic and English. Al-Hadid grew up creating art with her grandmother and from a young age, she was enamored with the relationship between space and perspective. At the age of 11, Al-Hadid decided that she wanted to be an artist. Al-Hadid attended Glen Oak High School in Canton, Ohio. In 2003, Al-Hadid received a BA in art history and a BFA in sculpture from Kent State University in Ohio. While attending Kent State, Al-Hadid's artwork focused on the similarities and differences between her Arab and American cultural backgrounds. In 2005, she received an MFA in sculpture from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, where she began experimenting with materials such as polystyrene, fiberglass, and plaster. She would continue to use these and other industrial materials in her future works. In 2007, she attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture where she completed an artist residency. At the time, she was one of the only, if not the only, female Arab-Americans attending these schools. After all her education she moved to Brooklyn, New York where she still currently resides with her husband and son. ==Works== Al-Hadid is a Muslim and female artist, which can present challenges in the culture of today. She uses her art and non-Western concepts to help bridge her Western life to her Middle Eastern upbringing. Al-Hadid's body of work consists mainly of large scale sculptures, including bronze sculptures, and drawings. Al-Hadid utilizes many of the same ideas and techniques in both her two-dimensional work as well as her three- dimensional work including abstraction and the interaction of visual and physical stability.Fool's Gold, 2014, polymer gypsum, fiberglass, wood, plaster, cement, gold leaf  Sculpture  Gregory Volk describes Al-Hadid's work in an articulate manner by saying, \\"They are imbued with potent, world- shaping forces, including regeneration and entropy, growth and decay.\\" An incomplete list of her sculptures includes Tomorrow's Superstition (2008), Actor (2009), Trace of a Fictional Third (2011), At the Vanishing Point (2012), and Divided Line (2012). An incomplete list of her bronze sculptures includes In Mortal Repose (2011), Missed Mark (2010), Stage Fright (2010), and Graphite on Leak (2010).  Construction  Al-Hadid makes sculptures from simple materials such as cardboard, expanded polystyrene, plaster, and wax; some are built in parts so that they can be assembled and disassembled. She often uses ornamentation in many of her sculptures, which is a tie to Middle Eastern cultures. Al-Hadid ties her Syrian heritage in with many of her works, one in particular being, The Gradual Approach of My Disintegration. In this work she pairs sandals with the Aleppo Citadel, which is a Muslim holy site, to create a work that showcases the culture of Syria visually and briefly. Although many of her works have a tie and direct message linked to her Middle Eastern heritage, the materials she uses in her sculptures are a tie to her American upbringing. Al-Hadid's early work focused on creating contrast through scale. She began incorporating partial figuration into her sculptures with works such as Actor (2009). The sculpture In Mortal Repose (2011) is her first use of bronze. Al-Hadid creates visually stimulating sculptures with a variety of materials. Her sculptures are meticulously created with eccentric patterns and melded parts. Her sculptures show a potential to fall at any moment but are truly quite stable. Al-Hadid uses materials such as cardboard, plywood, plaster, and resin to create sculptures that appear to be breaking or even melting. In her bronze sculptures, she manages to manipulate the material in a way that looks as if it is dripping. Her sculptures, though not truly moving, have a sense of movement about them that causes the viewer to want to view her work at every possible angle. Through her sculptures, she focuses on the relationship between a person‚Äôs mind as well as their physical being. Many of her sculptures allow the audience to walk among the different parts of the sculpture. Al-Hadid is successful at combining the use of human forms, architectural elements, and landscapes in a manner that allows them to bleed into one another, making it difficult for the viewer to decipher what is what. Al-Hadid's works are primarily monochromatic and best known for their resemblance to ancient ruins and their unique drip structures. Al-Hadid works with the concept of the pedestal, and her work has also evolved to the point where she intentionally uses and includes the pedestals that her pieces are displayed on as actual parts of the sculptures, and incorporating and redesigning this traditional gallery space structure into works such as At the Vanishing Point (2012). Manipulation of gravity and the illusion of instability are also key concepts in her sculptures.  Inspiration  Al- Hadid draws inspiration for her artworks from a multitude of varying sources, including, but not limited to, architecture, Syrian water clocks, black holes, the particle accelerator, and Italian Renaissance paintings, successfully taking the perspectives and viewpoints of two-dimensional works and transforming them into three-dimensional. One of the specific architectural structures that Al-Hadid has drawn inspiration from includes the Chartes Cathedral. Al-Hadid is intentional about the titles of her sculptures, naming them in ways that allude to her inspiration. Al-Hadid often draws inspiration for her human forms from the figures in art history, be she transforms them in ways so that they are not recognizable, and she often does away with the practice of making her forms idealized. Certain works are directly connected to specific Italian Renaissance paintings, such as At the Vanishing Point (2012), which takes inspiration from a sixteenth-century fresco, and her piece Divided Line (2012), which draws directly from Raphael's Christ's Charge to Peter (1515). By utilizing her knowledge of both Western culture and non- Western culture, Al-Hadid is able to make visual connections in reference to the architectural styles of the Western and Islamic worlds. She often alludes to the existence of different architectural elements including different styles of archways, flying buttresses, towers, and columns. Al-Hadid's works are poetic causing the viewers to stop and reflect on what it is she is trying to say through her work. It is hard to decipher whether her sculptures are being built up or torn down. Her sculptures often pose the question of nature versus the man-made, and whether man is taking over nature, or if nature is taking over the man-made with the slow, but continuous destruction of man-made structures. alt=  Drawings  Al-Hadid also creates various drawings using similar sources of inspiration that she uses for her sculptures. Not only are these drawings inspired by the same sources, they are also created in a similar manner as her sculptures as she creates them in a manner of \\"building up\\" the material but adding layers upon layers of material, often in vertical movements up and down the canvas, but these drawings are not preliminary sketches of her sculptures. She often composes her drawings using cont√©, pastel, acrylic, and Xerox-transfer techniques, among other materials. Unlike her sculptures, almost all of Al-Hadid's drawings are not given titles. == Notable pieces ==  At the Vanishing Point (2012)  In accordance with its title, Al-Hadid's sculpture embraces perspective effects originally used in two-dimensional artworks. At the Vanishing Point specifically draws from Jacopo Pontormo's fresco The Visitation (1515), re-imagining the architectural structures of the work in three dimensions, with significant alterations. Al- Hadid uses four pedestals as a part of the sculpture, one of several elements that lead the viewer's eye into the interior of the structure, where the vanishing point parallels are most effective. The sculpture, like many of Al- Hadid's works, is primarily monochromatic but does contain traces of blues and of metallic silver (from aluminum foil).  Phantom Limb (2014)  First displayed at the Vienna Secession in 2014 and later the central artwork of exhibitions at both The Art Gallery at New York University Abu Dhabi and the David Winton Bell Gallery at Brown University, Phantom Limb displays the phenomenon of phantom limb syndrome through the maimed torso at the top of the work and the detached leg resting on a pedestal below the figure. The sculpture incorporates Al-Hadid's typical features of drips and manipulation of pedestals, while the separated statue brings additional meaning to the work.  Tomorrow's Superstitions (2008)  This piece, in particular, draws from Pieter Brueghel the Elder's painting Tower of Babel (1563). This piece takes an architectural structure and takes it apart placing the broken pieces onto areas that they would not normally appear. These sculptures melt and break apart recognizable imagery into an aesthetic creation that energizes the space it is in. == Collections and exhibitions == Al-Hadid has been exhibited in various galleries and museums across the globe. She has been exhibited as both a solo artist and in group exhibitions. There are also several galleries and museums that have various pieces of Al-Hadid's in their permanent collection. It is important to note that this is not a comprehensive list of exhibitions and collections that Al-Hadid is, and has been, a part of. Al- Hadid has an extensive list of solo exhibitions and has been continually showing each year, often multiple times a year, since her first solo exhibition, which dated back to 2007, the same year she attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. She is still a solo exhibiting artist and is scheduled to have a solo show in Nashville, beginning in May 2019. The number and variation in the locations of her solo exhibitions has been a driving force in her popularity and global recognition.

Set 10 years after the events depicted in Wilson's much better-known The Boy Friend, it is a pastiche of 1930s musicals (in particular those of Cole Porter) rather than the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" shows (mostly early Rodgers and Hart) that inspired the earlier work. ==Productions== Divorce Me, Darling! was first presented at The Players' Theatre on December 9, 1964, where Wilson's The Boy Friend had first appeared. On 1 February 1965, it moved to the West End and ran for 91 performances at London's Globe Theatre. It had its U.S. premiere at the Arena Theatre, Theatre Under the Stars, Houston, Texas, in 1984. It played at the Chichester Festival Theatre in July 1997, featuring Ruthie Henshall as Polly. It is still occasionally revived at both an amateur and professional level, sometimes on a double-bill with The Boy Friend. ==Synopsis== Prologue The action takes place over two days in the summer of 1936 on the French Riviera. The characters are older versions of the characters introduced in The Boy Friend. Act I In Nice on the French Riviera in the foyer of the Hotel du Paradis greeted by the hotel manager Gaston singing \\"Here We Are In Nice Again\\" with an assortment of hotel guests. The three naughty wives (Dulcie, Fay, and Nancy) confess to hotel receptionist Hortense that they're on a spree after telling their French husbands that they were going to England to visit their families there. Polly, our heroine, arrives without her husband, Sir Tony, who is busy at home handling their estate. The three naughty wives reappear with giddy greetings all around. Reflecting on their dreary mates who seem more concerned with matters of business than with matters of the heart, they croon \\"Whatever Happened To Love?\\" Hortense consoles the frustrated wives and cheers them up with the news that tomorrow night an international star, the mysterious Madame K, will appear in un Grand Cabaret. The American, Bobby van Husen, enters tipsily from the bar and sings \\"Someone to Dance With\\" offering to waltz, fox-trot, tango, or rumba if only he could find a partner. Hardly recognizing each other, Bobby and Polly meet and each asks after the other's spouse. Bobby says his wife Maisie is supposedly in London seeking a husband for his older sister Hannah. Bobby and Polly plan to have dinner together. Meanwhile, Mme Dubonnet confides in Hortense that she is the mysterious entertainer Madame K; she also admits she is Polly's stepmother, married to Percy who fled to South America after losing his fortune in the stock-market crash of 1929. With the loss of their fortune and his escape to the New World, she was forced to pursue a lowly career in cabaret. She wants to keep the awful truth from Polly; she's changed her hair to blonde and her name to Mme K (that should do it!) and expresses her hard, heart-breaking life behind the \\"glittering facade\\" of her theatrical calling in her number, \\"Lights! Music!\\" Offstage cheering heralds the arrival of the South American nation of Monomania. Pierre, Marcel and Alphonse, the errant husbands of Nancy, Fay, and Dulcie, show up in Nice feeling like bachelors again and sing of a special girl, \\"Maisie,\\" they remember from their carefree single days. Lady Brockhurst (Polly's mother-in-law) arrives with a trio of young girls dressed in hiking gear. Their anthem is \\"Back To Nature,\\" urging one and all to forget the city and explore the rugged life of the great outdoors. She brings her troops to a halt and (of course!) Lord Brockhurst, dressed in plus-fours, is a reluctant member of her troop‚Äîfar more interested in pinching the rear than bringing it up. The troop march off in search of a spot to pitch camp, and true to form, Lord Brockhurst sneaks off in the opposite direction in pursuit of a skirt. He runs into Dulcie, Fay, and Nancy, and they agree not to snitch on one another for deserting their mates for a frolic. They sing \\"On The Loose.\\" The President of Monomania and Percy, in a tropical suit and dark glasses, greet each other as compatriots. Since they are of the same stature, Percy agrees to don a false beard and the President's uniform to take his place at the Caf√© Pataplon gala, as the President must be elsewhere for a reason he cannot reveal. Then Percy spots a poster of Madame K and recognizes his wife Kiki (Mme Dubonnet) but with blonde hair. Scene 3 reveals two balconies side by side. Hortense and Gaston (both of the hotel staff) are inspecting each of the suites and simultaneously come out on the balconies to glimpse of the Riviera view. Ever dedicated to their chosen professions, their duet describes their dream resort, \\"Paradise Hotel\\" as other members of the staff join in the song. They exit before Polly enters one suite, kissing the photo of her husband Sir Tony; Bobby in the other suite follows suit, kissing the photo of his Maisie. Polly goes out on her balcony, Bobby goes out on his, and he invites her over for champagne‚Äîas old friends, of course. They drink to absent mates, sing \\"No Harm Done,\\" and dance a bit. She protests, saying they must say goodnight before anything silly happens. They dance a bit more from his suite to hers. He accidentally drops his scarf in her quarters. Her telephone rings; it's Sir Tony, then Bobby gets a call on his telephone; It's Maisie. In the adjoining suite Sir Tony spots the scarf. He argues with Polly as to what it's doing there. Angrily he exits to take a bath. She rushes to the balcony to tell Bobby about his scarf. His news is that Maisie's on her way up. He welcomes Maisie to the suite and pours champagne. The glass has lipstick on it. She accuses him of having a secret lover‚Äîso that's why he came to Nice! In tears she rushes out of the room. He calls for Polly from the balcony and lets her know he has made Maisie as jealous as she has made her Tony. Isn't it delicious? Soon, from inside each suite, we can hear their mates apologize for their suspicious behavior. Polly and Bobby signal each other that they've each won this round. The next morning each couple in turn in pajamas and negligees on their respective balconies have breakfast and sing \\"Together Again.\\" As the number ends the two couples spot each other. What a coincidence! Bobby acts surprised, as does Polly. Suddenly, Bobby's older husband-hunting sister Hannah bursts in looking for her brother. Sir Tony's mum, Lady Brockhurst, still in her camping togs, looking for her son and complaining about the hotel management follows the intrusion. She seems to have set up her tent in the hotel gardens. Arguments ensue. Hannah introduces herself to Sir Freddy once she discovers he's a baronet. From the suite above, Madame K (Mme Dubonnet) complains about all the noise below. Enter valets, chambermaids, manicurists, and chefs, all squeezing into the tiny room. Hortense and the hotel staff join in for a reprise of \\"Paradise Hotel\\" as pandemonium ends the act. Act II Outside the Cafe Pataplon, Hannah mentions the scarf as well as the lipstick stain on the glass and provokes another argument between each couple (Tony vs. Polly; Bobby vs. Maisie). They sing to their mates \\"Divorce Me, Darling.\\" Others arrive at the cabaret discovering their mates' flirting. Husbands and wives are shocked at each other's capricious behavior accuse each other and pick up loose ends of the song. The President (actually Percy in a false beard, the President's military uniform, and dark glasses) is ceremoniously announced as the Monomania \\"Anthem\\" is struck up by the band. Upon seeing his daughter Polly, Percy does a double-take and enters the ballroom. Hannah laments her unattached state with \\"Here I Am, But Where's My Guy?\\" As the sibilance- challenged Sir Freddy arrives, she nabs him and sweeps him into the ballroom. Mme Dubonnet (Madame K) confides in Hortense that if she did her nightclub act, Polly would find out that her stepmother is a lowly cabaret performer. She convinces Hortense to don a mask and go on in her place. They rehearse a brief reprise of \\"Lights! Music!\\" Bobby and Maisie are still at odds and she's still determined to divorce him. He sings \\"Out Of Step\\" and urges her to dance. She joins him reluctantly. The manager of the Cafe Pataplon introduces the act, and Hortense, wearing a mask, goes on as Madame K singing \\"Fancy Forgetting\\" (reprise). Percy (disguised as the President) leaps up to expose the impostor. He tears off Hortense's mask and Mme Dubonnet steps in singing a line from the song. Percy is overwhelmed. She, in turn, exposes him. He's not the President of Monomania! He admits it tearing off the beard. Polly cries out \\"Daddy!\\" Lady Brockhurst and her uniformed girls march in and perform a military drill. A champagne bottle literally explodes! Someone has placed a bomb in the jereboam to kill the President of Monomania. The real President enters and commends Percy for his bravery in impersonating him and putting himself on the line. The President invites all to continue the party aboard his yacht. Percy, Mme Dubonnet, and Polly are reunited (\\"Together Again\\" (reprise)). The proper British Sir Freddy and the all-American Hannah also reunite (\\"You're Absolutely Me\\"). Act III On board the President's yacht Polly and Tony are reunited, each apologizing for playing games and acting foolish. They are in each other's arms (\\"Back Where We Started\\"). Polly and Bobby run into each other on deck and she assures him everything is patched up between her and Tony. Maisie is approaching them as the yacht lurches and Polly stumbles into Bobby's arms. Maisie, in tears, runs off. Entertaining the President and his guests, Mme Dubonnet sings (a la Marlene Dietrich) \\"Blondes For Danger\\", warning sailors to beware of this breed (\\"You can make a household pet/Of a redhead or brunette... \\" but cautions them about the dangerous blonde). Commending Percy for his heroism, the President awards him a deed to the Monomanian Platinum Mine. Percy and Mme Dubonnet embrace. Hannah has Sir Freddy in tow; they're to be married. Bobby is searching for Maisie. Lady Brockhurst is shocked to see her girls have traded their scouting uniforms for scanty shorts, sailor caps and tap shoes as they break into song with a trio of sailors: \\"Swing Time Is Here To Stay\\". Maisie, in an abbreviated seafaring uniform, leads the cast in the song and dance. Bobby patches things up with Maisie, supported by Polly and Tony. Suddenly Polly faints. In turn Maisie and the other girls faint as well. Their husbands come to their rescue‚Äîall delighted to discover they're all in the family way (\\"Divorce Me, Darling\\" (reprise)). \\"I would like to make it plain/You'll never hear me say again/Divorce me, darling!\\" ==Songs== ;Act I *Overture - Orchestra *Here We Are In Nice Again - Dulcie, Nancy, Fay, Hortense, Ensemble *Whatever Happened To Love? - Polly, Dulcie, Nancy, Fay *Someone To Dance With - Bobby, Ensemble *Lights!

He became a naturalised US citizen on 21 June 2019 in Los Angeles, California.Photograph of ceremony and naturalisation certificate, posted on his Instagram account, @theoneandonlydavidwillis, 21 June 2019 ==Education== Willis was educated at St Joseph's College, an independent school in the county town of Ipswich in Suffolk, followed by Harlow Technical College, since renamed Harlow College, in the new town of Harlow in Essex. ==Career== Willis entered journalism after college as a cub reporter on the Hertfordshire Mercury newspaper and joined the BBC in 1983. After spells in local radio and regional television, he moved to London to assume the role of Political Correspondent, based at the Houses of Parliament. His career as a foreign correspondent began in 1994, after he was appointed the BBC's Asia Correspondent. During six years based in Singapore, he covered the Hong Kong handover, the funeral of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, and obtained exclusive pictures of the Cambodian dictator Pol Pot‚Äôs \\"trial\\" by fellow Khmer Rouge cadres. He also reported first-hand on the downfall of Indonesia's president Suharto, as well as the subsequent bloodbath in East Timor‚Äì during which he was briefly jailed by the Indonesian authorities ‚Äì and broke a series of exclusive reports relating to the downfall of Singapore-based, \\"rogue trader\\" Nick Leeson. Appointed the BBC's California correspondent in January 2000, Willis has since covered a string of top stories in north, south and Central America. He travelled the length and breadth of the country after 9/11, gauging reaction to the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, chronicled the economic collapse in Argentina‚Äìduring which he and his crew were tear-gassed on the streets of Buenos Aires‚Äìand spent the 2002 football World Cup reporting from Rio de Janeiro on the progress of the ultimately triumphant Brazilian national team. He unearthed exclusive and disturbing evidence of child soldiers serving on the front line in Colombia‚Äôs drugs war, and covered the 2002 election of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil. For the last ten years he has also covered the Academy Awards. Willis has also served as a war correspondent. He was \\"embedded\\" with U.S. forces during the 2003 military invasion of Iraq, and filed vivid dispatches from the front line, as American marines battled their way to Baghdad. He survived an ambush by members of the Republican Guard, and attacks on the marine unit to which he was assigned. His reports also featured prominently on National Public Radio (NPR) and ABC News, and in a BBC book, The Battle for Iraq. Since the invasion, he has undertaken a string of difficult and dangerous follow-up assignments in Iraq. In 2003 Willis was invited to take up a place on the Reuters Fellowship, which every year provides study scholarships to senior journalists from around the world. During the three-month sabbatical as a visiting scholar at Oxford University, he conducted research on the relationship between the Bush administration and the media. Some of his current projects include covering breakthroughs in the fight against Alzheimer's, health problems occurring as a result of oil drilling in Colorado, and other longer-form news features. He has also served as a regular guest presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Americana.' Willis lives in Silver Lake, California, and is currently working on a book, a humorous account of his journey at attempting stardom, and a tongue-in-cheek look at how easy‚Äîor difficult‚Äîit is to break into Hollywood. He drew inspiration from his six-month sabbatical from the BBC in 2006, during which he tried to become a successful thespian. In an article he said, \\"Although I won't be giving up the day job any time soon, as far as acting is concerned I've caught the bug, and it's much too early to take the final bow.\\" ==Articles== *The Long Goodbye: Part 1, 30 July 2008 *Gas Boom / BBC World News America, 30 April 2008 *Bad spelling shot down in US, 8 May 2008 *LA workers swap cars for subway, 22 May 2008 *Britney's MTV comeback falls flat, 10 September 2007 *A Hollywood romance, 6 October 2006 *Finding the actor's inner anger, 30 June 2006 *Perfecting the Hollywood headshot, 8 June 2006 *From front line to chorus line, 4 May 2006 ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:BBC newsreaders and journalists Category:English writers Category:People educated at St Joseph's College, Ipswich Category:Alumni of Harlow College ","title":"David Willis (journalist)"},{"id":"19335235","text":"Philip Adam Cave (born 12 May 1987) is an English footballer who plays for Ashington as a left-sided defender. ==Career== Cave started off as a trainee at Newcastle United but did not make a first team appearance before signing for Gateshead in August 2007.

His involvement with the church was lifelong: at age eight he was an altar boy at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Conception in Franca. He attended high school at the Col√©gio S√£o Jos√© in Batatais, run by Claretian fathers, and in 1935 entered the Seminary of Maria Imaculada do Ipiranga in S√£o Paulo, where he studied philosophy and theology. On December 7, 1941 Coelho was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of S√£o Sebasti√£o in Ribeir√£o Preto.\\"Sepultamento Dom Jaime\\".

He initiated and oversaw the fourteen-year construction of the Cathedral Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria (completed May 10, 1972). He was influential in constructing and later enlarging the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia of Maring√°, a major Catholic hospital operated by the Congrega√ß√£o dos Irm√£os da Miseric√≥rdia de Maria Auxiliadora.

Every set of three of these four circles has among them three crossing points, and (by the assumption of non-collinearity) there exists a circle passing through these three crossing points. The conclusion is that, like the first set of four circles, the second set of four circles defined in this way all pass through a single point P (in general not the same point as M). The second theorem considers five circles in general position passing through a single point M. Each subset of four circles defines a new point P according to the first theorem. Then these five points all lie on a single circle C. The third theorem considers six circles in general position that pass through a single point M. Each subset of five circles defines a new circle by the second theorem. Then these six new circles C all pass through a single point.

He made his league debut on 19 September 1896 in a 3‚Äì4 loss at Derby, but had to wait until the 1898‚Äì99 season to become a first choice player. He was an ever-present for two successive seasons during 1899‚Äì1901, amassing 168 games for the club over a nine-year stay. He then moved to neighbours West Bromwich Albion in November 1904 for a ¬£500 transfer fee and in the same month made his debut against Manchester United in a Division Two match. He appeared in 152 games for Albion in all competitions, scoring 22 goals. The defender joined Leicester Fosse in 1910 but never played a game for them. He died of peritonitis just two weeks after signing for the club, on 17 July 1910 aged 33. (An obituary in the West Bromwich & Oldbury Chronicle, dated Friday 22 July 1910, suggests that Ted Pheasant had recently signed for Darlaston after being released by WBA.

In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting. ==History== Multics originated the idea of a search path. The early Unix shell only looked for program names in \`/bin\`, but by Version 3 Unix the directory was too large and \`/usr/bin\`, and a search path, became part of the operating system. ==Unix and Unix-like== On POSIX and Unix-like operating systems, the \`$PATH\` variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by colon (\`:\`) characters. Open Group Unix Specification, Environment VariablesOpen Group Unix Specification, execve() function. Directories in the \`PATH\`-string are not meant to be escaped, making it impossible to have directories with \`:\` in their name. Dash exec.c as an example of an implementation of a PATH-string parser The \`/bin\`, \`/usr/bin\`, and \`/usr/local/bin\` directories are typically included in most users' \`$PATH\` setting (although this varies from implementation to implementation). The superuser also typically has \`/sbin\` and \`/usr/sbin\` entries for easily executing system administration commands. The current directory (\`.\`) is sometimes included by users as well, allowing programs residing in the current working directory to be executed directly. System administrators as a rule do not include it in \`$PATH\` in order to prevent the accidental execution of scripts residing in the current directory, such as may be placed there by a malicious tarbomb. In that case, executing such a program requires specifying an absolute (\`/home/userjoe/bin/script.sh\`) or relative path (\`./script.sh\`) on the command line. When a command name is specified by the user or an exec call is made from a program, the system searches through \`$PATH\`, examining each directory from left to right in the list, looking for a filename that matches the command name. Once found, the program is executed as a child process of the command shell or program that issued the command. ==DOS, OS/2, and Windows== On DOS, OS/2, and Windows operating systems, the \`%PATH%\` variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by semicolon (\`;\`) characters.Microsoft.com, PATH command The Windows system directory (typically \`C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\`) is typically the first directory in the path, followed by many (but not all) of the directories for installed software packages. Many programs do not appear in the path as they are not designed to be executed from a command window, but rather from a Graphical User Interface. Some programs may add their directory to the front of the PATH variable's content during installation, to speed up the search process and/or override OS commands. In the DOS era, it was customary to add a PATH {program directory};%PATH% or SET PATH={program directory};%PATH% line to AUTOEXEC.BAT. When a command is entered in a command shell or a system call is made by a program to execute a program, the system first searches the current working directory and then searches the path, examining each directory from left to right, looking for an executable filename that matches the command name given. Executable programs have filename extensions of \`EXE\` or \`COM\`, and batch scripts have extensions of \`BAT\` or \`CMD\`. Other executable filename extensions can be registered with the system as well. Once a matching executable file is found, the system spawns a new process which runs it. The PATH variable makes it easy to run commonly used programs located in their own folders. If used unwisely, however, the value of the PATH variable can slow down the operating system by searching too many locations, or invalid locations. Invalid locations can also stop services from running altogether, especially the 'Server' service which is usually a dependency for other services within a Windows Server environment. ==References== Category:Computer file systems Category:Environment variables ","title":"PATH (variable)"},{"id":"19335390","text":"Emmanuel Mathias (born April 3, 1986) is a Togo international footballer, who is currently a free agent. ==Career== In 2004, he transferred to Togolese top club topclub √âtoile Filante de Lom√©, and earned a Togolese passport.

The effect of the virus is to cause nasal discharge, a high fever, filmed over eyes, failures of the lymphatic system, inflammation of various mucous membranes, and occasionally necrosis of the upper digestive system. Very advanced cases show signs of decay of the nervous system. Occasionally, lesions, arthritis, and digestive problems such as diarrhea have been observed. == Cause == The agent of MCF in hartebeests, it is related to other variants that strike down antelopes. It was isolated in 1960 and is believed to be carried as reservoirs by goats, sheep, and other domestic animals. There are variants that have affected deer, gnu, and other captive species in zoos around the world. ==Range == All species of African wildebeest and hartbeest can be infected or at least carry this virus. There is no direct evidence that other African wild variants like addax can be hosts, but research is ongoing. The alcelaphine antelope affecting form is primarily found in Africa, in the natural habitat of wildebeest, hartebeest, and topi. It has also occurred in zoos and wild animal parks that also kept wildebeest. The increasing popularity in North America of wild animal parks may spread its range further. == Transmission, clinical effects, and morbidity == Alcelaphine herpesvirus 2 is primarily transmitted by nasal emissions, by contact with water, flood, feces, or close contact. It can be destroyed by prolonged exposure to sunlight, but has a very long incubation period and thus may have a long period of time to infect other animals. There are three forms usually seen. The first a nasal form with fever, nasal inflammation and digestive problems that is very mild and only lasts a few days. The second is a more severe form that involves fever, diarrhea, heavy nasal discharge, and lymph system failure, with a morbidity of 28 percent. The so-called \\"head and eye\\" form is the most lethal and serious form, which results in all known effects and central nervous system damage, predated by nervous shakes and eventually muscular failure. Morbidity in some cases is as high as 90 percent. == Vaccination == As the primary infected strains of animals are wild and free range animals, vaccination programs have been largely ineffective. ==References== Category:Animal viral diseases Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 2"},{"id":"19335417","text":"Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale (1726 ‚Äì 5 December 1804) of Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire was an English Tory politician and peer.

Printed for F. C. and J. Rivington, 1812 Curzon was elected in 1747 as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe, holding the seat until 1754, when he took over his father's seat for Derbyshire. In 1758 he succeeded his father to the baronetcy and Kedleston Hall and in 1761 was created Lord Scarsdale. He later served as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords. Kedleston Hall Curzon had started work on the development of Kedleston Hall before he inherited, having employed the landscape gardener William Emes to replace the formal water features with natural lakes. In 1759 he commissioned the rebuilding of the house, designed in the Palladian style by the architects James Paine and Matthew Brettingham. Robert Adam was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park at the time and Curzon was so impressed with Adam's designs that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion. Curzon died in 1804. He had married, in 1751, Lady Carolina Colyear, daughter of Charles, Earl of Portmore, with whom he had 5 sons and 2 daughters. His eldest son, also Nathaniel, succeeded to the title and became the 2nd Lord Scarsdale. ==Kedleston Hall== The Hall is located 4 miles north-west of Derby, and is now open to the public, as one of the properties owned by the National Trust. One wing of Kedleston is still occupied by the Curzon family. Curzon intended Kedleston Hall to outshine the house of his Whig neighbour the Cavendishes at Chatsworth. He employed several architects and in December 1758 he met Robert Adam, who he would employ in his reconstruction of Kedleston. Curzon's cabinet-maker of choice was John Linnell. Linnell created the arguably the most magnificent sofas of the Georgian era for the Drawing Room at Kedleston.

He married Gina Dorthea Sandal in 1912. He started working as a cabinetmaker in Bergen when he was 14 years old. He joined the local union in 1909, and was a board member of the Bergen chapter for several years. He was also a board member of the Labour Party in Bergen. He was a board member of the radical union branch Fagopposisjonen av 1911, which had been founded by Martin Tranm√¶l. ==1923‚Äì1940== He was elected general secretary for the Communist Party of Norway (Norges Kommunistiske Parti, NKP) from its foundation in 1923, and was chairman of the party from 1925 to 1930. During this period he was among the loyal Moscow supporters and criticized people who diverged from the \\"correct\\" political line, as well as the Labour Party. Furubotn stayed in Moscow from 1930 to 1938, when he returned to Norway. He was also deputy chairman of the Communist Party of Norway after the Finnish War in 1946. ==World War II== Furubotn was arrested in August 1940, but released after interrogation. He immediately went undercover. He was elected secretary general of the NKP in 1941, after the arrest of de facto leader Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen following the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941. He managed an undercover resistance organization in Norway during the five years of German occupation. From a centralized camp he activated resistance groups in different parts of the country. The camp developed sectors for economy, transport, distribution, newspapers, sabotage, intelligence and courier traffic, and organized farmers, women and youth. The camp was typically located in isolated mountain dairy farms, and could have a security zone with a 10-kilometre radius. External visits to the headquarters were only allowed during relocation periods. Frequent conferences were normally held at mountain huts or farms within a wider zone. Security personnel were located in the surrounding rural districts, and the camp received intelligence reports from observations of the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo and other cities. The Germans made several efforts at catching Furubotn and his communist resistance organization. During the German Operation Almenrausch in June 1944 he successfully made a close escape from a large number of German troops, together with his family and central political activists, including √òrnulf Egge, Roald Halvorsen, Samuel Titlestad and Arne Taraldsen.Titlestad, 1977: pp 64‚Äì71 Several other members of the organization were arrested in the operation.

Proposed in 2006, the mission was the second of NASA's Mars Scout Program, which had previously yielded Phoenix. It was selected for development for flight in 2008. Mars Scout missions target a cost of less than US$485 million, not including launch services, which cost approximately $187 million.NASA Awards Launch Services Contract for Maven Mission (October 21, 2010) The total project costs up to $671 million. On August 2, 2013, the MAVEN spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center Florida to begin launch preparations. On October 1, 2013, only seven weeks before launch, a government shutdown caused suspension of work for two days and initially threatened to force a 26-month postponement of the mission. With the spacecraft nominally scheduled to launch on November 18, a delay beyond December 7 would have caused MAVEN to miss the launch window as Mars moved too far out of alignment with the Earth. However, two days later, a public announcement was made that NASA had deemed the 2013 MAVEN launch so essential to ensuring future communication with current NASA assets on Mars‚Äîthe Opportunity and Curiosity rovers‚Äîthat emergency funding was authorized to restart spacecraft processing in preparation for an on-time launch. ==Objectives== MAVEN's interplanetary journey to Mars. Features on Mars that resemble dry riverbeds and the discovery of minerals that form in the presence of water indicate that Mars once had a dense enough atmosphere and was warm enough for liquid water to flow on the surface. However, that thick atmosphere was somehow lost to space. Scientists suspect that over millions of years, Mars lost 99% of its atmosphere as the planet's core cooled and its magnetic field decayed, allowing the solar wind to sweep away most of the water and volatile compounds that the atmosphere once contained.MAVEN Mission to Investigate How Sun Steals Martian Atmosphere By Bill Steigerwald (October 5, 2010) The goal of MAVEN is to determine the history of the loss of atmospheric gases to space, providing answers about Martian climate evolution. By measuring the rate with which the atmosphere is currently escaping to space and gathering enough information about the relevant processes, scientists will be able to infer how the planet's atmosphere evolved over time. The MAVEN mission's primary scientific objectives are: #Measure the composition and structure of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere today, and determine the processes responsible for controlling them. #Measure the rate of loss of gas from the top of the atmosphere to space, and determine the processes responsible for controlling them. #Determine properties and characteristics that will allow us to extrapolate backwards in time to determine the integrated loss to space over the four- billion-year history recorded in the geological record. == Timeline == MAVEN launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on November 18, 2013, using an Atlas V 401 rocket. It reached Mars on September 22, 2014, and was inserted into an elliptic orbit approximately by above the planet's surface. In October 2014, as the spacecraft was being fine-tuned to start its primary science mission, the Comet Siding Spring was also performing a close flyby of Mars. The researchers had to maneuver the craft to mitigate harmful effects of the comet, but while doing so, were able to observe the comet and perform measurements on the composition of expelled gases and dust. On November 16, 2014, investigators completed MAVEN's commissioning activities and began its primary science mission, scheduled to last one year. During that time, MAVEN had observed a nearby comet, measured how volatile gases are swept away by solar wind, and performed four \\"deep dips\\" down to the border of the upper and lower atmospheres to better characterize the planet's entire upper atmosphere. In June 2015, the science phase was extended through September 2016, allowing MAVEN to observe the Martian atmosphere through the entirety of the planet's seasons. On October 3, 2016, MAVEN completed one full Mars' year of scientific observations. It had been approved for an additional 2-year extended mission through September 2018. All spacecraft systems were still operating as expected. In March 2017, MAVEN's investigators had to perform a previously unscheduled maneuver to avoid colliding with Phobos the following week. On April 5, 2019, the navigation team completed a 2-month aerobraking maneuver to lower MAVEN's orbit and enable it to better serve as a communications relay for current landers as well as Mars Perseverance. This new elliptic orbit is approximately 4,500 km (2,800 mi) by 130 km (80 mi). With 6.6 orbits per Earth day, the lower orbit allows more frequent communication with rovers. As of September 2020, the spacecraft is continuing its science mission as well, with all instruments still operating and with enough fuel to last at least until 2030.

Scientific instruments  Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) ‚Äì measures solar wind and ionosphere electrons. MAVEN's magnetometer. MAVEN's SEP instrument. The University of Colorado Boulder, University of California, Berkeley, and Goddard Space Flight Center each built a suite of instruments for the spacecraft, and they include: Built by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory: * Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) ‚Äì measures solar wind and ionosphere electrons. The goals of SWEA with respect to MAVEN are to deduce magneto-plasma topology in and above the ionosphere, and to measure atmospheric electron impact ionization effects. * Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) ‚Äì measures solar wind and magnetosheath ion density and velocity. The SWIA therefore characterizes the nature of solar wind interactions within the upper atmosphere. * SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC) ‚Äì measures thermal ions to moderate-energy escaping ions. This provides information on the current ion escape rates from the atmosphere and how rates change during various atmospheric events. * Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) ‚Äì determines the impact of SEPs on the upper atmosphere. In context with the rest of this suite, it evaluates how SEP events affect upper atmospheric structure, temperature, dynamics and escape rates. Built by the University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics: * Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrometer (IUVS) ‚Äì measures global characteristics of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. The IUVS is one of the most powerful spectrographs sent to another planet. It boasts separate Far-UV and Mid-UV channels, a high resolution mode to distinguish deuterium from hydrogen, optimization for airglow studies, and capabilities that allow complete mapping and nearly continuous operation. * Langmuir Probe and Waves (LPW) ‚Äì determines ionosphere properties and wave heating of escaping ions and solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) input to atmosphere. This instrument provides better characterization of the basic state of the ionosphere and can evaluate the effects of the solar wind on the ionosphere. Built by Goddard Space Flight Center: * Magnetometer (MAG) ‚Äì measures interplanetary solar wind and ionosphere magnetic fields. * Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) \\\\- measures the composition and isotopes of neutral gases and ions. This instrument evaluates how the lower atmosphere can affect higher altitudes while also better characterizing the structure of the upper atmosphere from the homopause to the exobase. SWEA, SWIA, STATIC, SEP, LPW, and MAG are part of the Particles and Fields instrument suite, IUVS is the Remote Sensing instrument suite, and NGIMS is its own eponymous suite. ==Results==  Atmospheric loss  Mars loses water into its thin atmosphere by evaporation. There, solar radiation can split the water molecules into their components, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen, as the lightest element, then tends to rise far up to the highest levels of the Martian atmosphere, where several processes can strip it away into space, to be forever lost to the planet. This loss was thought to proceed at a fairly constant rate, but MAVEN's observations of Mars' atmospheric hydrogen through a full Martian year (almost two Earth years) show that the escape rate is highest when Mars' orbit brings it closest to the Sun, and only one-tenth as great when it is at its farthest. On November 5, 2015, NASA announced that data from MAVEN shows that the deterioration of Mars' atmosphere increases significantly during solar storms. That loss of atmosphere to space likely played a key role in Mars' gradual shift from its carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere ‚Äì which had kept Mars relatively warm and allowed the planet to support liquid surface water ‚Äì to the cold, arid planet seen today. This shift took place between about 4.2 and 3.7 billion years ago. Atmospheric loss was especially notable during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection in March 2015.  Different types of aurorae  In 2014, MAVEN researchers detected widespread aurorae throughout the planet, even close to the equator. Given the localized magnetic fields on Mars (as opposed to Earth's global magnetic field), aurorae appear to form and distribute in different ways on Mars, creating what scientists call diffuse aurora. Researchers determined that the source of the particles causing the aurorae were a huge surge of electrons originating from the sun. These highly energetic particles were able to penetrate far deeper into Mars' atmosphere than they would have on Earth, creating aurorae much closer to the surface of the planet (~60km as opposed to 100-500km on Earth). Scientists also discovered proton aurorae, different than the so-called typical aurora which is produced by electrons. Proton aurorae were previously only detected on Earth.  Interaction with a comet  The fortuitous arrival of MAVEN just before a flyby of the comet Siding Spring gave researchers a unique opportunity to observe both the comet itself as well as its interactions with the Martian atmosphere. The spacecraft's IUVS instrument detected intense ultraviolet emission from magnesium and iron ions, a result from the comet's meteor shower much stronger than anything ever detected on Earth. The NGIMS instrument was able to directly sample dust from this Oort Cloud comet, detecting at least eight different types of metal ions.  Detection of metal ions  In 2017, results were published detailing the detection of metal ions in Mars' ionosphere. This is the first time metal ions have been detected in any planet's atmosphere other than Earth's. It was also noted that these ions behave and are distributed differently in the atmosphere of Mars given that the red planet has a much weaker magnetic field than our own.  Impacts on future exploration  In September 2017, NASA reported a temporary doubling of radiation levels on the surface of Mars, as well as an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier. This occurred due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm. The observation provided insight into how changes in radiation levels might impact the planet's habitability, helping NASA researchers understand how to predict as well as mitigate effects on future human Mars explorers. ==See also== * Atmosphere of Mars * ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter * Exploration of Mars * List of Mars orbiters * List of missions to Mars * Mars Express * Mars Global Surveyor * Mars MetNet * Mars Next Generation (a proposed orbiter) * Mars Orbiter Mission * New Frontiers program * Sandra Cauffman * Space weather ==References *MAVEN ‚Äì NASA *MAVEN ‚Äì JPL *MAVEN ‚Äì University of Colorado Boulder *Integration of MAVEN Propellant Tank ‚Äì NASA *SpaceflightNow MAVEN mission status center *Released results from MAVEN Category:2013 in the United States Category:Mars Exploration Program Category:Artificial satellites orbiting Mars Category:Lockheed Martin satellites and probes Category:Mars Scout Program Category:Missions to Mars Category:NASA space probes Category:Space probes launched in 2013 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Geography of Mars ","title":"MAVEN"},{"id":"19335618","text":"JMB Realty was a real estate investment company based in Chicago. In 1993, after suffering during the early 1990s recession, the company was reorganized as Urban Shopping Centers, Inc., which was acquired by Rodamco in 2000 and broken up. It debt finance group was spun-out as JMB Financial Advisors and still exists as a going concern based in Chicago. ==History== The company was founded as Robert Judelson & Co. in 1968. In October 1969, Judelson was joined by University of Illinois roommates Neil Bluhm and Judd Malkin. Judelson split from the partnership in 1973 to form Balcor Company with Jerry Reinsdorf. Bluhm became chairman and Malkin was president. In 1983, JMB acquired Federated Realty Associates from Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) for $112 million. In 1984, it acquired Urban Development from Aetna for $45 million in cash and $131 million in notes. At that time the company had a $9 billion real estate portfolio. In 1985, it acquired the portion of Water Tower Place that it did not already own. In 1986, the company acquired a real estate portfolio in Century City for $600 million from Alcoa. In 1987, the company acquired Arvida (now St. Joe Company), a developer of planned communities in Florida and Georgia, from The Walt Disney Company for $400 million. It also acquired Cadillac Fairview, Canadian developer-owner of shopping centers and office buildings, for $2.6 billion. In 1988, it acquired Amfac, a large Hawaii sugar cane land owner for $920 million. In 2002, Amfac was put into bankruptcy. As part of the bankruptcy reorganization, the company formed Xanterra Travel Collection, which was acquired by Philip Anschutz in 2008. In 1989, it acquired Randsworth Trust P.L.C. for $800 million. In 1990, it acquired Houston Center for $400 million. During the early 1990s recession, the company was forced to give some properties to its lenders. In 1993, it reorganized and completed the corporate spin-off and initial public offering of Urban Shopping Centers Inc. The company acquired Houston Galleria and Century Square Shopping Center. In 1997, the company sold Copley Place for $300 million. In 2000, Urban Shopping Centers was acquired by Rodamco. Who later sold Urban to a small consortium of The Rouse Company, Westfield Group, and Simon Property Group in 2002. ==References== Category:1968 establishments in Illinois Category:2000 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Real estate companies established in 1968 Category:Defunct real estate companies of the United States ","title":"JMB Realty"},{"id":"19335630","text":"The 1988 Individual Speedway World Championship was held at the Vojens Speedway Center, owned by former World Champion Ole Olsen.

explorer who charted Great Oyster Bay, Maria Island, and Marion Bay on the east coast of Tasmania in 1789, aboard his armed brig HMS Mercury. == Early years == John Henry Cox was born c. 1750, the son of a rich jewellery merchant in London. His father James had a factory in Shoe Lane, which specialised in the manufacture of clocks and automatons (known as \\"sing-songs\\" in pidgin English), designed as bribes for Chinese mandarins who were in control of the native merchants with whom Europeans were obliged to deal in trade negotiations in Canton. He even published a work on his activity.J. Cox, A Descriptive Inventory of Several Exquisite and Magnificent Pieces of Mechanism and Jewellery. (London 1773). When his father died towards the end of the 1770s, Cox turned to the East India Company for permission to stay in China for three years to sell the residue of his father's stock of clocks, and ostensibly \\"for his health's sake\\". In May 1780 he was given permission to stay for two years and February 1781 saw him installed at Canton as a merchant, but privately and not under the control of the company.H.B. Morse, The Chronicle of the East India Company trading to China 1635‚Äì1834, vol. II., (Oxford, 1926), 85. When the two years had passed, he applied for a year's extension, which was granted because of his \\"good bearing\\" and because he had been of special help to certain company chiefs. Cox then found it advantageous to move to Macao, where he was in association with a Scot, John Reid ‚Äì who from 1779 had been Austrian consul and a naturalised Austrian subject ‚Äì together with another Scotsman, Prussian consul Daniel Beale. All of their subterfuges were aimed at bypassing the East India Company's restrictive regulations. In 1784 Cox branched out and, with some of his associates connected with the East India Company, financed the first maritime fur trade voyage to the northwest coast of America, with the goal of acquiring sea otter furs to sell in Macao or Canton. In 1779 the crews of Captain Cook's ships, after Cook's death, had discovered that the sea otter furs they had acquired at Nootka Sound could be sold in Canton for an enormous profit, and this information spread quickly after the official account of Cook's third voyage was published in 1784. Cox, wanting to capitalize on this discovery, acquired and outfitted a small 60 ton brig named Sea Otter, commanded by James Hanna. Cook had noted that the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast near Hinchinbrook Island were eager for pieces of iron at least long and wide. So Hanna took a cargo of iron bars and other trade goods. Hanna sailed from Macao in April, 1785, and arrived at Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in August. The native Nuu-chah-nulth attempted to board and seize Sea Otter, but were repulsed with considerable slaughter. Hanna treated the wounded and a great deal of trading occurred. Near the end of September Hanna sailed for China via the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Macao in late December, 1785. He had acquired 560 sea otter pelts, which were sold to Chinese merchants for 20,400 Spanish dollars‚Äîmaking the voyage a significant financial success. Business went so well, that Cox and his associates founded the Bengal Fur Society in Calcutta and continued their activity into the following years. James Hanna made a second voyage in Sea Otter, from 1786 to 1787. This voyage was less successful than the first, but plans were made for a third voyage. However, these voyages led to Lord Cornwallis, Bengal's general governor, in 1787 complaining to the East India Company, all to no avail. By this time, other British ship captains had joined in the maritime fur trade, such as James Strange, John Meares, George Dixon, Nathaniel Portlock, as well as the Americans John Kendrick and Robert Gray of the ships Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington. Evidence of their activity remains in the \\"Columbia\\" and Washington medals, which Boston merchants struck to celebrate the sailing in September 1787 of these two US vessels for the northwest coast of America. The British Admiralty had in 1772 issued similar medals (struck by Matthew Boulton) featuring and celebrating James Cook's second voyage. == Mercury== Swedish endorsement Cox, at this stage, having already considerably overstayed his welcome, thought it wise to disappear to England for a spell but was soon back with newly hatched plans. This time, his idea was to see whether he could exploit the Russo-Swedish War of 1788‚Äì90. He paid a visit first to Gothenburg, where he made good use of the services of the Swedish East India Company's representatives there, William Chalmers, Lars Gotheen and J.A. Sandberg. Through these men he was able to make contact with Baron Erik Ruuth who was Gustav III's Swedish king Secretary of State for Commerce and Finance. The king was apparently very enthusiastic about Cox's quite fantastic proposal which was in effect to put his brig Mercury, newly purchased from the renowned Marmaduke Stalkartt, Deptford, at the disposal of Sweden and with her act as a privateer to raid both the eastern Russian coasts and their North American fur and skin establishments, for which Sweden would earn ten percent of the prizes., copper-bottomed, 16-gun brig Mercury launched 15 December 1788 by the renowned Marmaduke Stalkartt, Deptford, 82' x 22'6\\", 152 tons. Builder's Certificate dated 22 December 1788. The last page of the king's instructions is signed Gustaf by the king at Ghi√∂teborg (Gothenburg) 11 November 1788 and refers to his authorisation to Captain John Henry Cox of the Swedish naval brig Gustaf den Tredie, (Gustaf III), Mercury's cover-name.The Swedish National Archives Reference No to King Gustav III's instructions to John Henry Cox is: Ruuthska handlingarna (1 volym) SE/RA/721404.Georg Hafstr√∂m, ‚ÄùJohn Henry Cox som svensk sj√∂officer‚Äù, Forum navale (Stockholm), 14, 1957, s.6‚Äì29. England to Tasmania The Thames was still suffering under extreme weather conditions that winter, with the river frozen, and Mercury was not able to leave Gravesend on her prospective long voyage before 26 February 1789, but under English colours, as her destination was to be kept secret. Cox had provided himself with a chronometer made by William Hughes of Holborn and had it set to GMT in the mathematical school in Christ's Hospital, the headmaster of which was William Wales, who had sailed as astronomer in Captain Cook's second voyage from 1772‚Äì5. Cox had originally intended taking the route via Cape Horn, but on account of the late departure decided to change this plan and take the route via the Cape of Good Hope. Lieut. George Mortimer of the Marines wrote an account of the voyage.Rolf E. Du Rietz, \\"A secret Anglo- Swedish naval expedition to the Pacific in 1789\\", Banksia (Uppsala), no. 5, 2002. Unfortunately he records almost no details of the ship's crew but does mention the death of the ship's cook Thomas Smith on 8 October 1789. He also mentions that Cox had invited a number of his friends, making it sound almost like a rich man's yacht cruise. On 25 March they sailed from Tenerife, crossed the Line in 20 degrees West and on 28 April they were passing Tristan da Cunha. Just about then, Captain William Bligh of HMS Bounty and the loyal members of the crew were being forced into the long boat by the mutineers led by Fletcher Christian. On 29 May Mercury reached their first objective, Amsterdam Island in the Roaring Forties, half way between Africa and Australia, discovered in 1522 by del Cano during his circumnavigation. Here they procured 1,000 seal skins and several barrels of oil. Mortimer believed that Mercury was probably the first English vessel to visit the island. He refers to Alexander Dalrymple's Account of the Discoveries Made in the S. Pacific Ocean, (London, 1767), which deals with the island, and states that the account by the Dutchman Willem de Vlamingh, first to land on the island, in 1696, though short, was tolerably accurate. On 8 July Mercury was anchoring in a bay on the east coast of Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, for wood and water, and Cox named it Oyster Bay, a name that still holds. He also charted Maria Island and Marion Bay there. Crossing the Pacific They reached Tahiti on 13 August and anchored in Matavai Bay, where Bounty had lain for many months. Although some of the mutineers had remained, it was assumed that they lay hidden while Mercury was there. Mortimer communicated the intelligence to the Admiralty in respect of the probable destination of the Bounty mutineers, \\"as it is hoped will enable Captain Edwards of the Pandora frigate to bring them to that condign punishment they so justly merit\\". Captain Edwards' name appears on the list of subscribers to Mortimer's book. Mercury stayed at Hawaii for only about two days between 23 and 25 September. On 27 October they were anchored in an inlet on Unalaska Island, one of the Fox Islands of the Aleutian Islands. They had come a month or two too late, and found that the natives had no furs to trade, but they did stay for about two weeks, which seemed long enough for the United States to name one of the Alaskan rivers Coxe, using the spelling of his name that he used when referring to his Swedish assignment. It seems in fact that Cox only took the brig there as a gesture of fulfilling the contract with the Swedish king. Apparently he had considered returning at a more suitable time, but the Russian-Swedish Treaty of V√§r√§l√§ signed on 14 August 1790 precluded any such plans. If Cox had gone prowling further afield round the North Pacific he might have found unexpected and surprising opposition; the Empress Catherine II had commissioned an expedition to carry out exploration work in the far east of Siberia and the Bering Sea. In charge of the Expedition was an Englishman in the Russian Naval Service, Commodore Joseph Billings,M. Sauer, An Account of a Geographical and Astronomical Expedition to the Northern parts of Russia, (London, 1802). who was alerted regarding Cox's presence, but far too late, for by that time Cox was back in Macao, where he anchored on 27 December 1789, careful to advertise the appearance of the Swedish armed brig \\"Gustavus III\\" commanded by Captain John Henry Cox of the Swedish Royal Navy. He lost no time in writing a report to the Directors of the Swedish East India Co on 4 January 1790.Godeg√•rdsarkivet I Nordiska Museet, J.A. Grills handlingar, Korrespondens, vol. 13. Northern Pacific Port Cox (since renamed Clayoquot Sound), a bay southeast of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and Cox's Channel, a strait at the northwestern tip of Haida Gwaii between Langara Island and Graham Island and now named Parry Passage are named after Cox,J. Meares, Voyages made in the years 1788 and 1789 from China to the North West Coast of America, (London, 1790), 143, 365. as is Cox Island, in the same area of Haida Gwaii. According to the record in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), the nation's official geographic names repository of the US Board of Geographic Names, the mouth of the Coxe River, (note spelling) where it empties into Katlian Bay is at . The source, or where the stream begins, is at .Internet communication 4 May 2009 from Roger Payne, US Board on Geographic Names. Cox appears to have intended to use the Swedish contract more as a talisman with which to confound the East India Company rather than wreak any damage on the Russians. Some evidence of this lies in the fact Mortimer's account has no mention of any gun drill, something that ought to have been a necessary part of the operation; only once does Mortimer mention even airing their powder. Excessive speculation drove Reid into bankruptcy. He therefore closed the Austrian Consulate and left China. Cox's partnership however with Daniel Beale and his younger brother Thomas continued, at any rate under the combined name, during Cox's long period away from Canton. There were further successful voyages to northwest America, always under the Portuguese flag. However, in later years, competition from Spanish ships began to have effect. After his return to Canton, Cox was quickly in business again in Macao. It was at the end of September 1791 that Cox sailed Mercury up the river to Canton's outer port Whampoa. The Honourable East India Company did not welcome him; on the contrary it threatened Cox in every way, refusing to allow him right of residence because it was considered that he, English citizen that he was, had broken the company's \\"sacred\\" monopoly. Nonetheless, Cox raised a Prussian flag and landed exuding disrespectful protests. == Death == Cox did not live long enough to really enjoy the fortune he had amassed and died aged 41 years, on 5 October 1791 and was buried the following day on French Island that lay within sight of the ships moored at Whampoa, and was where all foreigners who died at Canton, or aboard the ships, were interred at the end of the 18th century. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Robert J.

In 2008, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent John Perzel in Pennsylvania's 172nd Legislative District in Northeast Philadelphia. ==Early years== Rich Costello was born in Northeast Philadelphia to an Irish-Catholic family. He attended Holy Ghost Preparatory School followed by St. Joseph's University. Costello earned his Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, graduating cum laude in May 1973. ==Police service== Following graduation Costello joined the Philadelphia Police Academy and graduated in September 1973. Shot in the line of duty On the night of December 11, 1973 Costello dropped his partner off at 7:30 PM to guard the Faith Baptist Church in the Strawberry Mansion section of Philadelphia. Fifteen minutes later Costello was driving his patrol car east on Cumberland St past the intersection of 32nd St when, without warning, a gunman opened fire from the sidewalk. Costello was struck twice in the head with one bullet remaining permanently lodged behind his right ear. Costello survived and spent two years recovering from his wounds but was able to successfully rejoin the force. Both the diligent police response and public outcry kept Costello's case in the headlines. Despite a $10,000 reward from the FOP and a $5,000 reward from the Philadelphia Daily News no one came forward with information and the case remains unsolved. Rise in the FOP In 1978 Costello joined the FOP as Unit Director after perceiving wrongdoing in the Union's health care benefits sector. After rising to Assistant Administrator of First Dental & Prescription Plan in 1982, Costello uncovered the Kravitz Corruption Scandal. Dr. Charles Kravitz was the director of American Health Programs (AHP) which was given contracts by the FOP. Kravitz had been bribing top FOP officials to continue contracting out business to his company. After the scandal was uncovered Kravitz was charged and sentenced to Federal prison. Having established himself as a credible reformer, Costello was made Recording Secretary in 1984‚Äì a position he held until 1988. In October 1988 Bob Hurst stepped down as President and Costello was elected to his first term as FOP president which lasted until 1990. After this he served as Chairman of Law Enforcement Health Benefits until 1994, when he was elected to his second term as FOP president. In 2002 after 8 more years as president of the FOP Costello decided not to seek re-election, citing his desire to allow a new generation to move up. He was succeeded by Robert Eddis in October 2002. Richard Costello's loyalty to individual police officers was known, and admired, by members of the Philadelphia Police Department. Through arguing the position of the individual police officer and never compromising the values they stood for, Costello was able to serve the City of Philadelphia as President of the Fraternal Order of Police. Abu-Jamal criticism During his tenure as FOP President Costello was an outspoken critic of Mumia Abu-Jamal and his supporters. Abu-Jamal was convicted of the 1981 murder of officer Daniel Faulkner. This has led Costello to be featured on radio programs such as Michael Smerconish's as well as televised debates. Known for his extemporaneous speech, during one televised debate he made use of a Bible passage to describe Abu-Jamal as \\"a liar, the father of lies, and a murderer from the beginning.\\" Maureen Faulkner, the wife of the fallen officer, described Costello as \\"a cop who took a bullet in the head and cowers in front of no one\\" in her book Murdered By Mumia (cowritten by Smerconish). ==Entry into politics== 2008 primary In January 2008 Costello decided to challenge long-time Philadelphia Republican Boss, and former House Speaker, John M. Perzel. Costello cited Perzel's many corruption scandals and his refusal to address the problems the Northeast faces with drugs and gun crime as his primary motivation for running. Perzel is heavily backed by the NRA and has refused to enact regulations on guns consistent with the City's upsurge in violence. Costello handily won the Democratic Primary against challenger Tim Kearney. Kearney had previously challenged Perzel in 2004 and 2006. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Saint Joseph's University alumni Category:Philadelphia Police Department officers Category:American shooting survivors Category:American victims of crime ","title":"Richard Costello"},{"id":"19335678","text":"HM Prison and Young Offenders Institute Bullingdon is a public sector prison operated by HM Prison and Probation Service an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. The prison is located near MoD Bicester, in the Oxfordshire countryside. HM Prison Bullingdon is a local and resettlement prison accepting Security Category B and C male prisoners. New admissions from courts are generally sent to 'local' prisons and are considered as a Category B prisoner until their initial security assessment. Prisoners must be over the age of 18 (as a Young Offender (YO)). As YO prisoners are not subject to the same 4 level security category, they are either considered 'YOI Closed' or 'YOI Open' - depending on whether they are suitable for transfer to open conditions. The prison generally only holds prisoners on short sentences (under 12 months) and those on remand. With the additional resettlement function, prisoners in the local area of the prison should be transferred for their 12 week pre-release period. HMP & YOI Bullingdon also has a dedicated 'Vulnerable Prisoners' unit which holds several hundred sex offenders who are at Bullingdon in order to complete a Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP). ==History== Opened in 1994, Bullingdon was constructed on obsolete Ministry of Defence site - MoD Bicester. The prison opened with 4 residential units, named after villages in the local area. * A - Wing (Arncott Unit) * B - Wing (Blackthorn Unit) * C - Wing (Charndon Unit) * D - Wing (Dorton Unit) Each of the 4 wings were created virtually identical, with only different coloured doors to be able to identify the unit. As the prison population continued to grow the prison constructed 2 new units * E - Wing (Edgcott Unit) - used to house vulnerable prisoners only. * F - Wing (Finmere Unit) - Spur 1 - Induction / First Night Centre and Spur 2 - Enhanced Spur (for full-time workers) Since the prison opened back in 1994 it has been surrounded in scandal and failing HMIP reports. The most noticeable is when back in January 2003, former Deputy Governor Terence McLaren was suspended from the prison after he had been arrested on suspicion of being involved with child pornography offences. Then in 2006; Governor Phil Taylor banned officers from displaying the English Flag as he was fearing that it may upset the foreign prisoners. Alongside this HM Inspectorate of Prisons have published countless damning reports into overcrowding, safety issues, gang violence and drugs to name just a few. ==Notable inmates== * Munir Hussain, a businessman who participated with others in severely beating a home invader was held for a month in Bullingdon. * Rolf Harris, entertainer and TV personality, found guilty in July 2014 of twelve sex crimes against minors, was imprisoned in Bullingdon instead of HM Prison Wandsworth.Sharp, Aaron. \\"Rolf Harris taken straight to cushy prison despite reports pervert would do hard time at tough jail\\" Daily Mirror, 19 July 2014 ==References *Ministry of Justice pages on HMP Bullingdon *HMP Bullingdon - HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports Bullingdon Bullingdon Bullingdon Bullingdon Bullingdon ","title":"HM Prison Bullingdon"},{"id":"19335695","text":"Sunnyside is a historical novel by Glen David Gold. ==Synopsis== The novel is about Charlie Chaplin and the rise of Hollywood and celebrity during 1918.Gold, Glen David. 2009.

Stanley was also a regular extra on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine for six seasons. ==Biography== Stanley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of Italian, German, Cherokee Indian, Scotch/Irish and English heritage.Quote from 2002 interview with Bobby Brogan for an Academic paper He said in a 2002 interview that as a child he was \\"shy, bright, blessed ...[with a] strict father gentle mother ...[and] three beautiful sisters.\\" Stanley's uncle taught him to play the ukulele at an early age, and at sixteen he got his first recording contract and in 1970 did his first Los Angeles recording session through his friend Cass Elliot of The Mamas & the Papas. Stanley and Elliott remained friends until her death. About his early attempts at songwriting, Stanley said \\"The Producer told me to write songs, so I did. They were terrible.\\" Stanley spent time in the United States Air Force during the late 1960s as a Chinese linguist and from 1969 to 1972 studied music at Los Angeles City College and Cal State-Northridge. Upon graduation, Stanley began working as a songwriter for producer Bones Howe, a relationship which led Stanley to a recording contract with Wooden Nickel Records, a Chicago label distributed by RCA. Early work Stanley's first self-titled album on Wooden Nickel was released January 23, 1973, and one month later he had his first booking as a recording artist, opening for Les Paul at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica. Though Stanley had a ten-album contract, he was unhappy with the promotion offered by the label. \\"Publicity campaign?\\", Stanley said. \\"They made three T-shirts, one for me, one for the president of Wooden Nickel and one for his wife. And there was one group ad with Tower Records L.A. in which my album was included. So far as I know, that was it.\\" Critically, Stanley fared much better. \\"I received nothing but brilliant reviews. I remember Billboard Magazine, then the biggest music/showbiz mag in the world, choosing only a few albums to spotlight the week I put out Three's the Charm: Queen's Night at the Opera, Loggins and Messina's Sittin In /Ten Years After with Alvin Lee / and Three's the Charm.\\" After a positive critical reception for Three's the Charm and little support from Wooden Nickel, Stanley asked to be released from his contract which still had seven albums to go. The label agreed. Six years later, Stanley recorded Midnight Radio (1980) for Regency Records. A compilation album of Stanley's earlier recordings titled Eclipse (1982) was released by Jollye Roger. Stanley then recorded Racing the Moon (1984) for Takoma. Beachwood Recordings Following the release of Racing the Moon, Stanley made the decision to start his own label Beachwood Recordings. Stanley said, \\"I wanted to make a recording of music and comedy and all the labels said: 'Choose one or the other.' So I chose to start my own label and do just what I do.\\". Stanley currently records for Beachwood, and tours regularly, performing up to three hundred dates each year. He has performed with such diverse acts as Steven Wright, Bonnie Raitt, Robin Williams, Nicolette Larson and Bill Cosby. Since 1990 Stanley has also been working on a musical titled Straight From The Heart, the story of two women and their relationship. In recent years Stanley has collaborated on \\"two-man band\\" projects with Peter Tork, Michael Smith, John Batdorf and Cliff Eberhardt, and the upcoming \\"two-man band\\" project All Wood and Led with Dan Navarro. ==Discography== Singles *\\"Every Minute\\" / \\"I Knead You\\" (1973) *\\"Wishing Well\\" / \\"This Could Be Goodbye\\" (1973) *\\"Afternoon Rain\\" / \\"Lydia\\" (1974) *\\"Plenty of Reason (For Going)\\" / \\"Windmill\\" (1974) *\\"Midnight Radio\\" (1980) *\\"Same Olde Samba\\" / \\"The Dancer\\" (1989) Albums (LPs) *James Lee Stanley (1973) *James Lee Stanley,Too (1973) *Three's The Charm (1974) *Midnight Radio (1980) *Eclipse (1982) *Racing the Moon (1984) *James Lee Stanley/Live (1985) rereleased on Beachwood with national distribution by Capitol Records in 1988 *Simpatico (1989) Compact Discs *Simpatico (1989) *Ripe Four Distraction (1991) *The Envoy (1993) *Even Cowgirls Get the Blues: A Soundtrack Inspired by the Novel (1993) *Two Man Band with Peter Tork (1996) *Domino Harvest (1997) *Freelance Human Being (1998), One of the Top 200 CD's of All Time ‚Äì FI Magazine, (March 1999) *Once Again with Peter Tork (2001) *Beachwood Christmas CD ‚Äì 2001 (2001) *Two Man Band Two with Michael Smith (2002) *Beachwood Christmas CD ‚Äì 2002 (2002) *Traces of the Old Road (2003) *A Beachwood Christmas ‚Äì 2003 (2003) *All Wood And Stones with John Batdorf (2005) *Live / Backstage @ The Coffee Gallery ‚Äì Peter Tork & James Lee Stanley (2006) *The Eternal Contradiction (2007) *New Traces of the Old Road (2008) *Live in Tehachapi, Vol. 1‚Äì2 (2009) *Backstage at the Resurrection (2011) *All Wood and Doors with Cliff Eberhardt (2011) *All Wood and Stones II with John Batdorf (2013) *The Apocaloptimist (2014) *Straight From The Heart ‚Äì The Musical with Pamala Stanley and Chris Bennett (2015) *Alive at Last ‚Äì In Philadelphia (2016) *Dove ‚Äì The Soundtrack to the Novel by M.H.

The building, much expanded and adapted, is now used as a country house hotel and conference venue, but retains its original appearance and character. ==Location== The house is located south of the village of Creaton, Northamptonshire, England, approximately north west of Northampton on the A5199 road and south of the start of the A14 road, which runs from the Catthorpe Interchange with the M1 and M6 motorways, via Cambridge, to Felixstowe. ==History== Highgate House from the south on 13 September 2008 The current house is built on the site of an earlier inn with the present buildings dating from 1663. When the main Welford road, now the A5199 became a turnpike in 1721 the inn rose in importance. Successive members of the Bosworth family were licensees until 1837 when the establishment of the railways took over Royal Mail distribution around the country more effectively. At that time the most famous inhabitant was the Revd, and fiery Welshman, Thomas Jones, who came to Creaton in 1785. Unable to find lodgings in the village he resided at the inn in defiance of both fellow clergy and also Canon Law. However, the landlady supported him saying that his presence had a good effect on the conduct of the other customers, and his Bishop turned a blind eye for 51 years. In contrast to other more relaxed clergy he filled the church with his preaching and set up the first Sunday School in the county. Distressed by local poverty he also became Rector of Spratton, a neighbouring village to the south. There he organised a clothing and sick club and employed a woman to teach sewing, all based on his principle of helping the poor to help themselves. With income from the books he wrote, he built six Almshouses in Creaton village. The house then passed into the Langham family estate at Cottesbrooke Hall in the neighbouring village of Cottesbrooke about 1 mile north, being later bought by its tenant Lt Colonel Charles Eyre-Coote when the estate was sold in 1911. The house was used as a base for hunting with the Pytchley Hunt based nearby. At this time a large amount of money was spent on the house with the addition of a floor and the Baronial Hall, which is visible in the south elevation behind the 3-storey leaded bay window. The Elizabethan linen-fold wooden panelling in the room was architectural salvage. The building later became a private house and was eventually sold by the late Mrs Coote, in a somewhat dilapidated state, to the Chudley family in the 1960s. It has since been restored and sympathetically expanded and converted into its current form. ==References== Category:Coaching inns Category:Country houses in Northamptonshire Category:History of Northamptonshire Category:Tourist attractions in Northamptonshire ","title":"Highgate House"},{"id":"19335857","text":"Extrinsic fraud is fraud that induces one not to present a case in court or deprives one of the opportunity to be heard or is not involved in the actual issues. More broadly, it is defined as: Extrinsic fraud often involves fraud on the court, but may arise in other contexts. Extrinsic fraud does not mean merely lying or perjury, nor misrepresentations, nor intrinsic fraud, nor \\"to matters that could have been raised during the divorce proceeding.\\"Ellett v. Ellett, No. 0824-00-2, Virginia, (Cir. Ct. Richmond City 2001), with cases cited therein, found at Virginia state courts website. Retrieved September 15, 2008.

For example, paternity cases are sometimes the subject of extrinsic fraud; the classic case is when a man is encouraged to sign an acknowledgment that he is the father of a newborn baby, thus giving up his right to contest the matter in a filiation action. In Love v. Love, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that extrinsic fraud had led the putative father to sign an admission against his interest, thus allowing the court to grant equitable relief to undo the fraud. It also may occur when a man fails to appear in court when a paternity suit is filed against him, thus resulting in a default judgment due to the fraud by his \\"paramour\\".Denise G. Callahan, \\"Insufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud leads to reversal in W.\\" Daily Record and the Kansas City Daily News-Press, October 7, 2005, found at Find Articles website. \\"In the best interest of a child, the state of Missouri defended a mother who fooled a man into thinking he had fathered a son. In State of Missouri ex rel. Misty Lowry v. Richard Carter, the Department of Social Services, Family Support Division appealed Jackson County Judge Sandra Carol Midkiff's ruling that set aside a 1993 default paternity judgment against Carter. The Western District Court of Appeals sided with the state.\\" Retrieved September 15, 2008. In such cases, there is a high burden of proof (typically moral certainty or beyond a reasonable doubt) of the petitioner to prove the intrinsic fraud, because of the state's interest \\"in the best interests of the child\\" to ensure that every child has a father. That is called paternity by estoppel, in which the putative father is actually prevented from proving he is not the father due to the high standard of evidence necessary as a matter of law. Other examples Extrinsic fraud may occur in real estate transactions or financing, such as when a lender forces a homeowner to lose his or her real property in a foreclosure through acts of fraud. A lawyer who intentionally keeps information from his or her client about an upcoming hearing or trial could be held responsible for extrinsic fraud, as well as being subject to disciplinary action and a legal malpractice lawsuit. It is at least theoretically possible for a court to enjoin a criminal proceeding, but unlikely.\\"Equity Jurisdiction: Enjoining Execution of Criminal Judgment: Extrinsic and Intrinsic Fraud\\", California Law Review, Vol. 11, No. 4 (May, 1923), pp. 279-282, found atJSTOR website.

Beckwith. Beckwith cast his first stove around 1867 to heat his struggling foundry and shortly after, the Michigan Central Railroad ordered the heaters for its depots between Detroit and Chicago. By 1871, Beckwith was mainly producing heating stoves, and thus founded the company. The origin of the name Round Oak is unknown. The first theory is that Beckwith stoves were round and could hold a section of whole round oak tree in the firepot. The second theorizes that he named it after a foundry of the same name in England. Round Oak was considered the finest heating stove money could buy because of the quality of its durable heating stove and by the late 1890s there were many ‚Äúoak‚Äù imitators on the market. The company expanded rapidly and at its height in the 1910s, employed 1200 of the 5000 residents in Dowagiac, Michigan. Round Oak's influence on Dowagiac went far beyond its factory grounds. The company sponsored a semi-professional baseball team and the Round Oak Band. Dances were held in Round Oak Hall. P. D. Beckwith died in January 1889, leaving the management of the firm to his son-in-law, Fred E. Lee. In 1892 in memory of P. D. Beckwith, his daughter Kate and son-in-law, Fred Lee built the Beckwith Memorial Theatre in the downtown at Front and Beeson streets. Regarded as one of the finest theatres between New York and Chicago, it hosted such well-known names as William S. Hart, Roland Reed, Robert Mantell and Otis Skinner. The original Beckwith building also contained space used for a bank, city hall and Round Oak Company offices. The busts that decorated the building's exterior included Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Emerson, Whitman, Shakespeare, Sarah Bernhardt and Susan B. Anthony. When the building was razed in 1966, the busts were salvaged. Eight are today used in columns standing at the entrance to the Lyons Building at Southwestern Michigan College in Dowagiac. After Beckwith's death, the official company name was changed to The Estate of P.D. Beckwith Incorporated. Most stoves produced after 1890 carry the mark of ‚ÄúEstate of P.D. Beckwith‚Äù along with ‚ÄúRound Oak‚Äù, which has confused novice collectors as to the original owner of Round Oak stoves ‚Äì many believing they have purchased a stove actually used by Beckwith himself. The company also added new products, like furnaces and cooking stoves, and introduced a popular mascot around 1900 ‚Äì Chief Doe-Wah-Jack. Chief Doe-Wah-Jack, a fictional Native American Indian, appeared on most Round Oak Stove Company and Estate of P.D. Beckwith Inc. advertising and stoves until the company's demise in 1946. Chief Doe-Wah-Jack was introduced when, with the spread of the telephone, customers had trouble pronouncing Dowagiac when asking the operator for a connection. Chief-Doe-Wah-Jack remedied that problem by providing the town's phonetic spelling. Poor management and deaths led to the start of Round Oak's decline in 1914. Ormal Beach, the company's first salesman, died that year; Arthur Beckwith, Philo's adopted son and major innovator of Round Oak products over the years, died of tuberculosis; and lastly, veteran employee Arthur Rudolphi left to start his own furnace company after being denied a promotion. In 1915, the Rudy Furnace Company became the first of three Round Oak competitors to open in Dowagiac, followed by Premier in 1920 and Dowagiac Steel Furnace in 1929. Round Oak stayed strong into the 1920s and survived the Great Depression, though greatly damaged. World War II government contracts helped the company stay afloat, but once the war ended, Round Oak was in ruins. The company stopped producing stoves in 1946 and in 1947, sold its buildings to Kaizer-Frazer for the production of automobile engine parts. The Round Oak name was sold to Peerless Furnace, which continued to make repair parts for furnaces and stoves. The complex of Round Oak buildings on Spaulding Street now house Ameriwood Furniture. Today, a small collection of Round Oak Stoves is displayed within the offices of the Greater Dowagiac Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Development Authority, located within the historic Dowagiac train depot. The Estate of P.D. Beckwith Inc. and Round Oak Stove & Furnace Company artifacts are collected worldwide today. The Dowagiac Area History Museum on West Railroad Street, in Dowagiac, Michigan has the largest public collection of Round Oak heating stoves in the world. The museum's vast collection includes (in addition to stoves) artifacts related to P.D. Beckwith's grain drill and early stove business, advertising, company ledgers and papers, workers‚Äô implements and many one-of-a kind pieces. ==Further reading== * ‚ÄúIdentification and Dating of Round Oak Heating Stoves,‚Äù Steven Arseneau and Jill Dixon, editors * ‚ÄúRound Oak: A Good Thing from Doe-Wah-Jack,‚Äù by Leland Haines * ‚ÄúThe Round Oak Stove People and other Dowagiac, Michigan Personalities,‚Äù by Barbara and Grafton Cook == References  * Southwestern Michigan College Museum: RRound Oak Stoves * Antiquestoves.net: Round Oak Stove Catalog, vintage images * Vlex.com: Supreme Court Decision (April 1920) * Roundoakman.com: Round Oak replacement parts manufacturer * Dowagiacroundoakstoves.com: Round Oak restoration service * Dowagiac Chamber of Commerce.com: Early history of Dowagiac, Michigan Category:Stoves Category:Manufacturing companies based in Michigan Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Cass County, Michigan Category:American companies established in 1871 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1871 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1946 Category:1871 establishments in Michigan Category:1946 disestablishments in Michigan Category:Defunct companies based in Michigan ","title":"Round Oak Stove Company"},{"id":"19335929","text":"Prestwick Carr is a large area of low-lying wetland on the northern boundary of the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northeastern England between Dinnington and Ponteland. It is known for attracting various birds of wetlands and open country and is an Site of Special Scientific Interest and a nature reserve managed by the Northumberland Wildlife Trust. A large part of the site is owned by the Ministry of Defence. ==Description and vegetation== Prestwick Carr sits within a low lying basin of peat to the north west of Newcastle- upon-Tyne. Within the site there are a range of wetland habitats including tall fen with soft rush and reed canary-grass, Common alder and downy birch dominated carr and a raised bog which is now surrounded by a coniferous forestry plantation. These wetlands were more extensive in the past but drainage has reduced their extent. The remaining open water supports a variety of aquatic species and the relict raised bog supports the rare bog rosemary. ==Birds== Prestwick Carr holds wildfowl and waders in the winter and has breeding Water rail, Eurasian skylark, willow tit and meadow pipit in summer. Barn owls and short-eared owls are also found there. In 1853 a pair of wood sandpiper were recorded as nesting at Prestwick Carr, an unusual record for England. In 2019-20 an Eastern yellow wagtail spent the winter at this site, part of an influx to Britain that winter. Other unusual records have included great grey shrike and little gull. ==Dragonflies== Prestwick Carr also holds dragonflies and the first records in Northumberland of four-spotted chaser and common darter were made there by early naturalists. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Tyne and Wear ","title":"Prestwick Carr"},{"id":"19335934","text":"Jeffrey Pfeffer (born 23 July 1946, St. Louis, Missouri) is an American business theorist and the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, and is considered one of today's most influential management thinkers.Quest for Innovation, Motivation Inspires the Gurus. Wall Street Journal, May 5, 2008Accenture top 50 business intellectuals ==Biography== Pfeffer graduated high school from the Webb School of California. He received his BS and MS degrees from Carnegie-Mellon University and his PhD from Stanford University. He began his career at the business school at the University of Illinois and then taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 1973-1979. Pfeffer has given talks in 39 countries around the world and has taught management seminars for numerous companies and associations in the United States including Sutter Health, the Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, John Hancock, Hewlett-Packard, and the Online Publishers Association now called Digital Content Next (DCN). Pfeffer has served on the boards of several human capital management companies including Resumix, Unicru, and Workstream. He also served on the board of publicly traded Sonosite (SONO) for ten years and on the boards of private high-technology companies Actify and Audible Magic. He is currently on the board of directors of the nonprofit, Quantum Leap Healthcare, as well as on the advisory boards of several private companies. Pfeffer has won numerous awards for his articles and books. He was elected a fellow of the Academy of Management more than 25 years ago, was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, won the Richard D. Irwin award for scholarly contributions to management, is in the Thinker's 50 Hall of Fame, and in 2011, was awarded an honorary doctorate from Tilburg University in The Netherlands. ==Work== Pfeffer‚Äôs research interests are very broad, although he is probably most famous in academic circles for developing resource dependence theory (The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence-Perspective). Pfeffer has done theoretical and empirical research on the subjects of human resource management, power and politics in organizations, evidence-based management, the knowing-doing gap, leadership, stratification and labor markets inside organizations, the sociology of science, how and why theories become self-fulfilling, the psychological relationship between time and money, and economic evaluation. Pfeffer has also been recognised for writing case studies, and was listed among the top 40 case authors published by The Case Centre in 2016. He was ranked 25th in 2015/16. Elective on power in organizations Pfeffer has taught both elective and core classes in human resource management and the core course in organizational behavior. When he joined the Stanford faculty, he developed an elective on power in organizations. First called Power and Politics in Organizations, some years ago the class was retitled The Paths to Power. The elective has been consistently popular, with Pfeffer teaching two sections per year and, over the years, other colleagues teaching sections as well.  Writings  Pfeffer has written more than 150 articles and book chapters. He is the author of 15 books including The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First, Managing with Power: Politics and Influence in Organizations, The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge Into Action, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People, Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths, and Total Nonsense: Profiting from Evidence-Based Management, What Were They Thinking? Unconventional Wisdom About Management, and Power: Why Some People Have It‚ÄîAnd Others Don't, published and released in September 2010 . Pfeffer's book, entitled Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time, was published in 2015 by HarperBusiness. His latest book ‚ÄúDying for a Paycheck‚Äù analyzes workplace practices that are detrimental to employees‚Äô health. He estimates that such practices cause 120,000 excess deaths per year in the USA, about half of which might be preventable. Pfeffer has written cases on how individuals acquire power and manage their careers, including cases on Keith Ferrazzi, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, Ross Walker, Amir Dan Rubin, Zia Yusuf, and Laura Esserman. He has also written cases on companies that practice high commitment/high performance work arrangements, including Southwest Airlines, DaVita Inc., the Men's Wearhouse, Holy Cross Hospital, SAS Institute, and the Andean region of Kimberly-Clark. For five years, Pfeffer wrote a monthly column for the Time-Warner magazine, Business 2.0. For almost three years, he wrote a career advice column for Capital, the leading economics and business magazine in Turkey. He currently writes an online column about twice a month for Fortune. ==Publications== * 1978. The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence Perspective. with Gerald R. Salancik.

He is the University and George Holmes Distinguished Professor of Management, Emeritus at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. ==Education== Luthans graduated from the University of Iowa with a B.A. in mathematics in 1961, an MBA in 1962, and a Ph.D. in management and psychology in 1965. Iowa Professors Henry Albers and Max Wortman were his PhD academic advisers. He took post-doctoral seminars in management at Columbia University while serving in the United States Army stationed at the United States Military Academy, West Point. ==Academic career== After serving as an Army captain teaching psychology and leadership to cadets at West Point from 1965‚Äì1967, Luthans joined the faculty of the Department of Management at the University of Nebraska, where he remained for his entire academic career. In 1986, he was elected president of the Academy of Management.http://www.aomonline.org/aom.asp?ID=&page;_ID=74 In 1997, he received the Academy's Distinguished Management Educator Award and in 2017 received the Organizational Behavior Division's Lifetime Achievement Award.https://business.unl.edu/news/fred-luthans-honored-with-lifetime- achievement-award/?contentGroup=alumni ==Research== As a scholar of management, Luthans applied behavioral science for the purpose of managing human behavior in organizations. His textbook Organizational Behavior, now in its 14th edition, has been widely used over the years.Luthans, F. (1973). Organizational behavior. New York: McGraw-Hill. Luthans‚Äôs initial research applied theories associated with positive reinforcement and behaviorism to improving employee performance.Luthans, F., & Kreitner, R. (1975). Organizational behavior modification. Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman. A meta- analysis mainly consisting of studies he and colleagues conducted indicated a strong relationship between his concept of \\"organizational behavior modification\\" (O.B.Mod.)and improved employee performance in both manufacturing and service organizations.Stajkovic, A., & Luthans, F. (1997). A meta-analysis of the effects of organizational behavior modification on task performance. Academy of Management Journal, 40, 1122-1149. In the 1980s, Luthans conducted observational, qualitative/mixed method research on what managers do in their day-to-day activities.Luthans, F., Hodgetts, R.M., & Rosenkrantz, S. (1988). Real managers. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger. His research showed the importance of playing the game (e.g., networking, politicking and interacting with outsiders) in order to get ahead in organizations.Luthans, F. (1988). Successful vs. effective real managers. Academy of Management Executive, 2, 127-132. This research was summarized in the Luthans, Hodgetts & Rosenkrantz book \\"Real Managers\\" (Ballinger, 1988) and has recently been updated and re-published as \\"Real Managers Revisited\\" by Hogan Assessment Systems, Inc, 2019. In the 1990s, with globalization taking the forefront in the management field, Luthans‚Äôs research also took on an international focus and resulted in his 1991 book (co-authored with Richard Hodgetts and, in later editions, Jonathan Doh) International Management (now in 10th Edition, McGraw- Hill)Luthans, F., & Hodgetts, R.M. (1991). International management. New York: McGraw-Hill.. Luthans previous work in both behavioral management and managerial activities were tested in other cultures, mainly Asia and Eastern Europe. During this period he also focused on taking Bandura's social learning theories and research to the workplace. This work culminated in the widely cited meta-analysis with Alex Stajkovic which found a strong relationship between self-efficacy and work-related performance.Stajkovic, A., & Luthans, F. (1997). A meta-analysis of the effects of organizational behavior modification on task performance. Academy of Management Journal, 40, 1122-1149. This research served as a foundation and point of departure for his now well known positive approach to leading, managing and developing for improved employees/teams performance and well-being. Luthans founded and with colleagues conducted research on positive psychological capital, or PsyCap. This second-order, core construct of PsyCap is composed of the criteria meeting (theory/research, valid measurement, state-like/open-to-development, desired impact) first-order psychological resources of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism or the \\"HERO Within\\".https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/psychological-capital-fred- luthans/1101395649?ean=9780195187526&pcta;=u&st;=PLA&sid;=BNB_Nook%20Catch- All,%20Low&sourceId;=PLABiNA&dpid;=tdtve346c&2sid=Bing_c&msclkid;=b6e98f933c9115852188d381e6c4d007&adlclid;=ADL-15d33a64-590c-4cf2-8a32-1437887a5149 The initial research found that overall PsyCap is more closely related to both performance and satisfaction than is each of the individual components.Luthans, F., Avolio, B., Avey, J., & Norman, S. (2007).Positive psychological capital: Measurement and relationship with performance and satisfaction. Personnel Psychology, 60, 541-572.

While on leave from his position in 2009 he was a candidate for Manhattan District Attorney. His list of endorsements included Congressman Jerry Nadler, Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, State Senators Eric Schneiderman and Eric Adams, Assemblypersons Jonathan Bing, Deborah Glick, Richard Gottfried, Brian Kavanagh, Daniel O'Donnell, Linda Rosenthal and Michelle Schimel, and gun control organizations the Brady Campaign, Gun Free Kids, Million Mom March and New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. He lost the election to Cy Vance. In 1979 Aborn became an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's office under Robert M. Morgenthau. In the District Attorney's office he prosecuted felonies, including homicides, until 1984 when he began the law firm of Aborn and Anesi. From 1992-1996 Aborn served as the president of Handgun Control Inc. (now the Brady Campaign) and was a principal strategist behind the passing of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act as well as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Aborn also served as the president of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. In 1999 Aborn was commissioned by the New York City Public Advocate to conduct an investigation of the NYPD's disciplinary system and its response to civilian complaints of misconduct. On behalf of the Public Advocate, he also investigated NYPD's disciplinary decisions in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo. In 2001 Aborn served as the senior law enforcement advisor to the Democratic mayoral nominee. During that campaign he developed criminal justice policies for New York City including the establishment of a \\"311\\" program which Mayor Michael Bloomberg implemented. ==References * Richard Aborn for Manhattan District Attorney ( DA ) campaign web site * Richard Aborn Facebook page *Richard Aborn Featured in the New York Times: District Attorney Hopefuls Await 89-Year-Old‚Äôs Call * CAAS example publications by Richard Aborn * Transcript including Richard Aborn as a guest on \\"HANNITY & COLMES\\", June 3, 2004 * Transcript including Richard Aborn as a guest on \\"HANNITY & COLMES\\", January 3, 2003 * The website of Constantine & Aborn Advisory Services (CAAS) * The website of Citizens Crime Commission of New York City Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:1952 births ","title":"Richard Aborn"},{"id":"19336091","text":"G…ônc…ôli or Gyandzhali may refer to: * G…ônc…ôli, Khachmaz, Azerbaijan * G…ônc…ôli, Salyan, Azerbaijan ","title":"G…ônc…ôli"},{"id":"19336100","text":"K.

It was established in 1992 to develop noninvasive medical devices and techniques to increase prospects for prevention, earlier diagnosis, improved treatment and prognosis of diseases. It employs 200 people and is adjacent to the University of Winnipeg campus in Downtown Winnipeg. The impact on Winnipeg's economy amounts to $30 million a year. In 2005, the lab expanded to a second building of where the NRC Centre for the Commercialization of Biomedical Technology (NRC-CCBT) took up quarters. The early history of the NRC lab in Winnipeg was not an auspicious one. Shortly after that lab was built in 1984, it was shuttered by the government of Brian Mulroney. At that time, the lab was called NRC Institute for Manufacturing Technology. It later became the Canadian Institute for Industrial Technology before becoming the Institute for Biodiagnostics. ==External links== *Institute for Biodiagnostics (Atlantic) Category:Buildings and structures in Winnipeg Category:Laboratories in Canada Category:Research institutes in Canada ","title":"Institute for Biodiagnostics"},{"id":"19336148","text":"Ben Diogaye B√®ye (born 1947) is a Senegalese filmwriter, filmmaker, film producer and journalist.

Planters lay the seeds down in precise manner along rows. Planters vary greatly in size, from 1 row to 54, with the biggest in the world being the 48-row John Deere DB120. Such larger and newer planters comprise multiple modules called row units. The row units are spaced evenly along the planter at intervals that vary widely by crop and locale. The most common row spacing in the United States today is 30 inches. Kinze 2200 planter Various machines meter out seeds for sowing in rows. The ones that handle larger seeds tend to be called planters, whereas the ones that handle smaller seeds tend to be called seed drills, grain drills, and seeders (including precision seeders). They all share a set of similar concepts in the ways that they work, but there is established usage in which the machines for sowing some crops including maize (corn), beans, and peas are mostly called planters, whereas those that sow cereals are drills. On smaller and older planters, a marker extends out to the side half the width of the planter and creates a line in the field where the tractor should be centered for the next pass. The marker is usually a single disc harrow disc on a rod on each side of the planter. On larger and more modern planters, GPS navigation and auto-steer systems for the tractor are often used, eliminating the need for the marker. Some precision farming equipment such as Case IH AFS uses GPS/RKS and computer-controlled planter to sow seeds to precise position accurate within 2 cm. In an irregularly shaped field, the precision farming equipment will automatically hold the seed release over area already sewn when the tractor has to run overlapping pattern to avoid obstacles such as trees. Older planters commonly have a seed bin for each row and a fertilizer bin for two or more rows. In each seed bin plates are installed with a certain number of teeth and tooth spacing according to the type of seed to be sown and the rate at which the seeds are to be sown. The tooth size (actually the size of the space between the teeth) is just big enough to allow one seed in at a time but not big enough for two. Modern planters often have a large bin for seeds that are distributed to each row known as central commodity systems. A class of planters that dig down farther than others are called listers. They are not used much anymore, as their use belonged to a set of high-till methods that low-till and no-till methods have largely replaced. Corn listers were common on the Great Plains in the 1920s through 1950s. == Drive systems == There are different types of planters available with the main difference being mechanically driven vs. hydraulic/electrical driven. In a mechanical drive system the unit works by a small suspended tire being driven by another which is in contact with the ground (driven) tire. As the operator lowers the planter the two tires make contact and the planter is engaged. When the driven wheel begins to turn it then turns a series of gears that determine the population of the seed produced. The gears can be changed by the operator in order to change the planting population. A hydraulic driven system came about to correct the shortfalls of the ground driven system. Hydraulic driven systems allow the operator to change population on the go, as well as allowing the computer controller to follow a prepared prescription for an individual field. The system also allowed for plant populations to be infinite in that mechanical gears systems are limited to set number of population settings and gears available from manufactures. In 2014 John Deere introduced the ExactEmerge row unit which introduced high-speed planting. Precision Planting followed suit and released the vDrive system. These system were unique, not that they were electrical, but that they allowed an operator to double their speed when planting. Other manufacturers had already developed an electrical planter, but lacked these additional improvements. Traditionally, an operator would plant at about 4.5-5.5 mph for optimal performance. However, with the advent of these systems electrical motors match the speed of the tractor and \\"dead-drop\\" the seed in the trench using either a belt or brush-belt which cause the forward momentum of the planter to be offset by the rearward momentum of the seed. Older systems would instead drop the seed through a tube after the meter rather than place it in the seed trench directly. ==References== Category:Agricultural machinery ","title":"Planter (farm implement)"},{"id":"19336335","text":"Burro Flats Painted Cave (BFPC) is located near Burro Flats, in the Simi Hills of eastern Ventura County, California, United States. The Chumash-style \\"main panel\\" and the surrounding 25-acres were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, with a boundary decrease in 2020. The main panel includes dozens of pictographs in a variety of colors. The cave is in the mountains, near the bi-lingual Chumash/Fernandeno village of Huwam/Jucjauynga. Burro Flats Painted Cave and the rest of the former Santa Susana Field Laboratory are not accessible to the public. ==Pictographs== Among the pictographs are two human figures wearing feathered headdresses. There are also \\"raked anthropomorph\\" motifs, possible comet figures, and many more naturalistic elements. The Burro Flats Painted Cave pictographs are some of the best preserved Native American art in Southern California. Archaeologists estimate the paintings to be several hundred years old. The site was used to predict and celebrate the winter solstice. In 1971, Fernande√±o Indians asked NASA (the property owner) to safeguard the site. At the time, Fernande√±o tribal leader Rudy Ortega, Sr. said, \\"We really know very little of our heritage. ... The paintings are one of the few physical links to our heritage. We hope one day to interpret their stories for our people.\\" Tribal leaders expressed concern about damage that could result from vandals or weather and asked NASA to enclose BFPC in glass, but this was never done, in order to keep the site and surrounding area as pristine as possible. However, the site and surrounding area was fenced off, to keep unauthorized people out of the immediate area. In 1978, the pictographs were the subject of the documentary film, \\"Cave Paintings of the Chumash Indians.\\" The Santa Susana Field Laboratory has been closed for many years and is undergoing a complex cleanup. Historical Resource studies and site protection are part of the process. Boeing transferred an easement to the North American Land Trust which requires their property to remain as open space and protected from residential and agricultural development by future owners. NASA has declared its part of the former Field Laboratory to be \\"excess government property\\" and will divest its holding, following area clean-up. Those acres will most likely become permanent open space also. The Chumash tribe has requested the return of the site to the tribe. The Santa Ynez Chumash have suggested that the general area be renamed The Sky Valley/'Alapay a 'altuqipin Traditional Cultural Property, and the tribe has nominated the entire former Santa Susana Field Laboratory to the National Register of Historic Places (the nomination is pending, as of May 2019). In order to guard the pictographs, the exact location of the cave is kept secret. Archeologists are allowed to occasionally visit the site for research purposes only ‚Äì no casual visitors are allowed, and only members of the local Native American community are granted regular access. ==History== The Sky Valley/Burro Flats area was part of the Rancho San Jos√© de Nuestra Senora de Altagracia y Simi, and was used exclusively for cattle and sheep grazing throughout the Spanish and Mexican periods, and well into the American Period, until the mid-20th Century. The Josiah D. Whitney Expedition arrived in February 1861. They were exploring and mapping California which had been acquired by the United States a decade earlier. Whitney himself was not with the group, which was led by William H. Brewer. Brewer's history of his explorations can be found in \\"Up and Down California in 1860‚Äì1864\\" (2003:45-46 University of California Press). Brewer's party explored a large area in a short amount of time, and he does not specifically mention any native \\"rock art.\\" The first non-native person known to have visited BFPC was Walter Brinkop, who was a member of the Pierre Agoure family, for whom the Agoura Hills area is named. Brinkop made several simple field sketches of the BFPC art in 1914, and he presented his drawings to Dr. Hector Alliott, the then Director of the Southwest Indian Museum, in Los Angeles. Almost 40 years later, the Archaeological Survey Association of Southern California (ASASC) performed extensive archaeological excavations at the site. The thousands of artifacts recovered are at the Autry Museum of the American West. At about the same time Brinkop visited, members of the local Native American community told the anthropologist John Peabody Harrington that there had been \\"a very large rancheria\\" at Burro Flats, and that \\"There are painted caves\\" near the old village (John P. Harrington Fernandeno Reel 106 notes; transcripts of Harrington's 19-teen notes were not published until 1986). In 1939 the Burro Flats area was acquired by the Henry Silvernale and William Hall families, who named their property \\"Sky Valley Ranch.\\" Area historic research by Bob Edberg has shown that William Hall's family was familiar with the local Native American community, and it is likely that the local Native American community continued to have access to the area, at least until Sky Valley Ranch was acquired by North American Aviation (the predecessor to the Santa Susana Field Laboratory) in 1954. Indeed, it is quite possible that the name \\"Sky Valley\\" may be an English translation of the old Indian name for the Burro Flats area. The polychrome \\"main panel\\" paintings came to the attention of the general public due to the work of the ASASC. This was largely due to two of the crew members: the artist Charles La Monk, who made full-scale reproductions of several of the paintings, and who published a short report on his work in 1953, and Gordon Redtfeldt, who made several field sketches at this time. La Monk's paintings and Redtfeldt's sketches were circulated in the archaeological community, and knowledge of the existence of the site and the paintings began to spread. In 1959‚Äì1960, Dr. Charles Rozaire performed the first general survey of the area and he recorded eleven more-or-less distinct \\"sites.\\" These were given the State of California site numbers CA-VEN-151 to CA-VEN-161; BFPC itself thus became CA-VEN-160. Rozaire also performed new excavations in the same area where the ASASC had worked some years earlier. This was at what Rozaire had recorded as CA-VEN-151. These two \\"sites\\" are adjacent to each other, but are distinct; there was no archaeological deposit IN BFPC, the floor of which is bedrock. The artifacts that Rozaire recovered were added to the ASASC collections, and they are now also in the possession of the Autry Museum. Of the BFPC art, Rozaire noted that they are most like \\"those in the west-central coast ranges of Santa Barbara, Kern, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties.\\" As such, the painting were composed in what is now called the Chumash-style. This was confirmed by the noted rock art expert, Campbell Grant, who visited the site in the mid-1960s. Grant recorded the main panel in detail and gave it his number Ventura-4, and he described it as his Ventureno (i.e. Eastern Chumash) type-site (see Rock Paintings of the Chumash 1965). The area was examined again in 1973 by the archaeologist Franklin Fenenga, who consolidated all 11 of Rozaire's \\"sites\\" into a single large site, although Rozaire's 11 \\"site\\" numbers continued to be cited by many researchers. Fenenga said that, \\"Because of its magnitude, the complex of features which are integral to it, the dramatic physiographic location, the unmodified natural landscape, and the fine state of preservation [it is] one of the major examples of aboriginal American art, one of the most important archaeological sites in America [i.e. in the United States] and it certainly meets the criteria for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.\\" The area that was first described by Rozaire in the 1960s, and later by Fenenga in 1973, was listed on the National Register in 1976. The listing is called \\"Burro Flats Painted Cave,\\" which is of itself actually only one site- locus. The 25 acres that were listed include at least 24 loci, many of which include pictographs, petroglyphs, and cupules; a more apt name might have been the Burro Flats Painted Cave Site Complex, which is applied by at least one archaeologist. The work by the ASASC, Rozaire, Grant, and Fenenga, focused on and described the BFPC art and the archaeological components of the site. The research begun in 1979, by the archaeologist John Romani, Edwin Krupp (the Director of the Griffith Observatory), and others, showed that the site (complex) was utilized to predict and observe both the winter and summer solstices. This fact about its past use attracted peoples' attention, and generated a new level of interest in the site. Additional research in the early 1990s refined previous descriptions of the 25-acre National Register of Historic Places-listed site complex, which was re-recorded, generally following Fenenga's 1973 definition of the site boundaries, as CA-VEN-1072. The BFPC \\"main panel\\" (i.e. Rozaire's CA-VEN-160) thus became CA-VEN-1072, Locus 10. ==In popular culture== A replica of the pictographs can be seen on a six-foot-high wall in the magazine area of Simi Valley Library.Brant, Cherie (2006).

Web threats use multiple types of malware and fraud, all of which utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols, but may also employ other protocols and components, such as links in email or IM, or malware attachments or on servers that access the Web. They benefit cybercriminals by stealing information for subsequent sale and help absorb infected PCs into botnets. Web threats pose a broad range of risks, including financial damages, identity theft, loss of confidential information/data, theft of network resources, damaged brand/personal reputation, and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce and online banking. It is a type of threat related to information technology (IT). The IT risk, i.e. risk affecting has gained and increasing impact on society due to the spread of IT processes. ==Reaching path== Web threats can be divided into two primary categories, based on delivery method ‚Äì push and pull.Trend Micro (2008) Web Threats: Challenges and Solutions from http://us.trendmicro.com/imperia/md/content/us/pdf/webthreats/wp01_webthreats_080303.pdf Push-based threats use spam, phishing, or other fraudulent means to lure a user to a malicious (often spoofed) website which then collects information and/or injects malware. Push attacks use phishing, DNS poisoning (or pharming), and other means to appear to originate from a trusted source. Precisely-targeted push-based web threats are often referred to as spear phishing to reflect the focus of their data gathering attack. Spear phishing typically targets specific individuals and groups for financial gain. In other push-based web threats, malware authors use social engineering such as enticing subject lines that reference holidays, popular personalities, sports, pornography, world events and other hot topics to persuade recipients to open the email and follow links to malicious websites or open attachments with malware that accesses the Web. Pull-based web threats are often referred to as ‚Äúdrive-by‚Äù threats by experts (and more commonly as ‚Äúdrive-by downloads‚Äù by journalists and the general public), since they can affect any website visitor. Cybercriminals infect legitimate websites, which unknowingly transmit malware to visitors or alter search results to take users to malicious websites. Upon loading the page, the user's browser passively runs a malware downloader in a hidden HTML frame (IFRAME) without any user interaction. ==Growth of web threats== Giorgio Maone wrote in 2008 that \\"if today‚Äôs malware runs mostly runs on Windows because it‚Äôs the commonest executable platform, tomorrow‚Äôs will likely run on the Web, for the very same reason. Because, like it or not, the Web is already a huge executable platform, and we should start thinking of it this way, from a security perspective.\\"Maone, Giorgio (2008) Malware 2.0 is Now! from http://hackademix.net/2008/01/12/malware-20-is-now/ The growth of web threats is a result of the popularity of the Web ‚Äì a relatively unprotected, widely and consistently used medium that is crucial to business productivity, online banking, and e-commerce as well as the everyday lives of people worldwide. The appeal of Web 2.0 applications and websites increases the vulnerability of the Web. Most Web 2.0 applications make use of AJAX, a group of web development programming tools used for creating interactive web applications or rich Internet applications. While users benefit from greater interactivity and more dynamic websites, they are also exposed to the greater security risks inherent in browser client processing.Horwath, Fran (2008) Web 2.0: next-generation web threats from http://www.it-director.com/technology/security/content.php?cid=10162 ==Examples== In September 2008, malicious hackers broke into several sections of BusinessWeek.com to redirect visitors to malware-hosting websites. Hundreds of pages were compromised with malicious JavaScript pointing to third-party servers.Naraine, Ryan (2008) Business Week site hacked, serving drive-by exploits from http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1902#more-1902 In August 2008, popular social networking sites were hit by a worm using social engineering techniques to get users to install a piece of malware. The worm installs comments on the sites with links to a fake site. If users follow the link, they are told they need to update their Flash Player. The installer then installs malware rather than the Flash Player. The malware then downloads a rogue anti-spyware application, AntiSpy Spider.Danchev, Dancho (2008) Compromised Web Servers Serving Fake Flash Players from http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2008/08/compromised-web-servers-serving-fake.html by humanitarian, government and news sites in the UK, Israel and Asia. In this attack the compromised websites led, through a variety of redirects, to the download of a Trojan. In September 2017, visitors to TV network Showtime's website found that the website included Coinhive code that automatically began mining for Monero cryptocurrency without user consent. The Coinhive software was throttled to use only twenty percent of a visiting computer's CPU to avoid detection. Shortly after this discovery was publicized on social media, the Coinhive code was removed. Showtime declined to comment for multiple news articles. It's unknown if Showtime inserted this code into its website intentionally or if the addition of cryptomining code was the result of a website compromise. Coinhive offers code for websites that requires user consent prior to execution, but less than 2 percent of Coinhive implementations use this code. German researchers have defined cryptojacking as websites executing cryptomining on visiting users' computers without prior consent.Musch, M., Wressnegger, C., Johns, M., & Rieck, K. (2018). Web-based Cryptojacking in the Wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.09474. With 1 out of every five hundred websites hosting a cryptomining script, cryptojacking is a persistent web threat. ==Prevention and detection== Conventional approaches have failed to fully protect consumers and businesses from web threats.

Today, the Society is one of five theatre groups on the Georgetown campus and is entirely student-run. The group continues to provide an opportunity for students to develop artistic, technical, and administrative skills, while performing high-quality theatre in its 168th season. Mask and Bauble produces four main stage shows annually, including the Donn B. Murphy One Acts Festival, which focuses on student-written work. All shows are directed, produced, designed, and performed by students. ==History== Mask and Bauble was founded in 1852 as The Dramatic Association of Georgetown College, staging its first show, Pizarro, a play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, on February 27, 1853. World War I priorities caused a suspension of its performances, and after the war the group was revived with the new name of Mask and Bauble. The society was the first of its kind to use female actresses in 1922, as female roles were previously filled by male actors. It formally accepted female members in 1934. During this time the Society had a close relationship with the Roosevelt White House, with Eleanor Roosevelt as a society patron. During the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, student technicians from the group assisted with the technical aspects of some of the nation's first televised presidential press conferences. This intimate relationship with the White House was nurtured by the society's faculty adviser, Donn B. Murphy, who also served as theatrical adviser to Kennedy and Johnson. Murphy served until 1976, although he remains involved with Georgetown theatre. The Society's annual playwright contest and one acts festival bears his name, and promotes student- written plays. == Today == Mask and Bauble performs in Poulton Hall's Stage Three, on the Georgetown campus. This theater space, part of the university, was occupied by students from the group over spring break in 1975. Unsatisfied with university commitment to theater, they squatted in what was previously Room 57, and built a makeshift theater they named Stage Two. The university forced this to be taken down, but built the group a small theater in Poulton Hall, which became Stage Three. Stage One was then converted into the scene and costume shop. While the club's alumni were very active in raising money to build Georgetown's new Davis Performing Arts Center, the society and other student groups have been restricted from using the Center's main theatre due to their insistence on maintaining student, rather than faculty, direction. In 2009, Mask & Bauble co-produced Caroline, or Change with the Black Theater Ensemble and the Department of Performing Arts on the main stage of the Davis center, making it the first student directed play on the Gonda Stage. Club membership currently stands over 100 students, surpassing Nomadic Theatre, one of the other theatre organizations on campus. ==Production History== 2017-2018 (166) *Rumors by Neil Simon *DBMOAF: featuring Roots by Devika Ranjan *Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play by Anne Washburn (In collaboration with Nomadic Theatre) *Footloose by Tom Snow, Dean Pitchford, and Walter Bobbie 2016-2017 (165) *An American Daughter by Wendy Wasserstein (In collaboration with The Black Theatre Ensemble) *Wind Me Up, Maria!: A Go-Go Musical by Natsu Onoda Power and Charles \\"Shorty Corleone\\" Garris (In collaboration with Georgetown University Department of Performing Arts and The Black Theater Ensemble) *DBMOAF: featuring Victimology by Rachel Linton and The Gun by Grayson Ullman *Stupid Fucking Bird by Aaron Posner 2015-2016 (164) *All My Sons by Arthur Miller *DBMOAF: featuring Beyond *Cyrano by Aaron Posner and Michael Hollinger *Into the Woods by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine 2014-2015 (163) *Inherit the Wind by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee *DBMOAF: featuring Sonder *Killer Joe by Tracy Letts (in collaboration with Nomadic Theatre) *Urinetown by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis 2013-2014 (162) *Don't Drink the Water by Woody Allen *DBMOAF: featuring How To Succeed With Dolls by Tim Lyons *Proof by David Auburn *She Loves Me by Jerry Bock, Sheldon Harnick, and Joe Masteroff 2012-2013 (161) *The History Boys by Alan Bennett *DBMOAF: featuring Spiritual Ecstasies *Polk Street by T.

Although the country has a large potential for hydroelectric and bagasse-fueled power generation, most of its 226 MW of installed capacity correspond to thermoelectric diesel-engine driven generators. Reliability or electricity supply is very low, linked both to technical and institutional deficiencies in the sector, with total losses close to 40% and commercial losses of about 30%. This low reliability has led most firms to install their own diesel generators, which in turn leads to higher than average electricity costs. Guyana is likely to benefit greatly geopolitically after the transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked no. 3 in the index of geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition (GeGaLo Index). == Electricity supply and demand ==  Installed capacity and generation  Installed power generation capacity in Guyana in 2007 was 226 MW or 0.4 kW per capita, which is lower than in other countries in the region and is hardly sufficient to cover the current demand for electricity in the country. Most electricity generation uses Diesel engines to drive generators. There are plans for introduction of power generation facilities based on renewable resources, but these would still account for only a small share (10 percent) of the generation capacity in the country.World Bank 2007 Self-generation is widely spread in Guyana, where 100%, 82% and 37% of large, medium and small firms respectively own generators which supply them with 64%, 54% and 31% respectively of the total electricity consumed. A side effect of self-supply of energy is that the corporate demand for electricity in some regions of the country has decreased significantly. While private generation temporarily eases the pressures on the overall capacity for the sector, it also prevents the realization of economies of scale at a system level. Self-provision of energy appears more costly to companies (up to US$0.38 per KWh) than regional and even local tariffs (around US$0.22 and US$0.25 respectively on average).World Bank 2007 In 2007, electricity supplied to the grid was 833 GWh, shared among generators as follows: {  - ! Generator ! Electricity generated (GWh) -  Guyana Power & Light (GPL)  551 -  Guyana Sugar Corporation  267 -  BERMINE/AMC  15 } Source: Guyana Energy Agency, Statistics  Supply vs demand  While the consumption of electricity has increased substantially in the past few years, the installed generation and distribution capacity has increased at a lower pace. Obviously, self-generation has played an important role to fill the gap between consumption and generation of electricity.World Bank 2007 The low income in the country, high cost per kilowatt hour and low level of Guyana's rural electrification leads to use of kerosene, wood and charcoal still playing an important factor. == Access to electricity == Access to electricity is usually constrained by a country's level of income; however, in the case of Guyana, this indicator appears lower than what would seem justifiable on the basis of economic fundamentals. It is estimated that the electricity system in Guyana services only about 60 percent of the population, well below the level achieved by many regional peers. Similarly, while electrification is higher in coastal towns with a high industry concentration, there are vast areas of the country that appear underserved on this account. Even companies within regional access to the grid have to wait up to 99 days for connection.World Bank 2007 For more information about energy in unserved areas in the Hinterland, see Hinterland energy in Guyana. == Service quality ==  Service interruptions  Reliability of electricity supply is low, and characterized by frequent and long outages (the highest incidence in Latin America and the Caribbean), load discharges and voltage variations. Poor reliability has been linked to dependence on old and obsolete equipment for power generation, underinvestment in the distribution grid, and lack of incentives for efficient provision of service. The poor quality of electricity supply becomes a key obstacle to growth. For example, companies‚Äô losses attributable to energy outages are estimated to reach up to four percent of their total sales on average. Since large firms can afford to invest on own power generation equipment, these losses are smaller for them than for small firms.World Bank 2007  Distribution and transmission losses  Losses at the distribution level account for almost 40 percent of the energy generated, well above the 13.5% weighted average for LAC.Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005 At a commercialization level, the utility has failed to enforce collection of bills, and to eradicate theft and corruption in under billing of the service.World Bank 2007 In 2006, non-technical losses were divided as follows:Guyana Power and Light 2006 {  - !!style=\\"text- align: center; background-color:#ffdead;\\"Source !!style=\\"text-align: center; background-color:#ffdead;\\"Losses (%) -  Electricity theft  align=\\"center\\" 11 -  Defective meters  align=\\"center\\" 11.3 -  Billing system  align=\\"center\\" 6.5 - ! Total ! 29 } Source: Guyana Power & Light The objective of Guyana Power and Light (GPL) is to reduce total losses to 15.4% by the year 2010, 10.3% on the technical front plus 5.1% commercial. == Responsibilities in the electricity sector ==  Policy and regulation  The legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the electricity sector includes:World Bank 2007 Office of the Prime Minister (OPM): has principal policy-making and regulatory responsibility in the sector, including for granting licences to the public utilities and independent power producers and approval of development and expansion plans and of operating standards and performance targets for Guyana Power & Light (GPL), the principal supplier. Guyana Energy Agency (GEA): is the successor of the Guyana National Energy Authority (GEA). The GEA came into operation on 1 June 1998 by appointment of the Minister; it is responsible for all energy related matters. It is the mandate of the GEA \\"To ensure the rational and efficient use of imported petroleum-based energy sources, while encouraging, where economically feasible and environmentally acceptable, increased utilization of indigenous new and renewable sources of energy.\\" Public Utilities Commission (PUC): is the multi- sector independent regulatory agency with authority to set rates, develop regulations and resolve disputes.  Generation, transmission and distribution  Guyana Power & Light (GPL) dominates the electricity sector in Guyana. GPL is a vertically integrated government-owned utility with a monopolistic position on transmission and distribution, and a major stake (55%) in generation. The fragile financial position of GPL (due mainly to heavy system losses and high exposure to oil prices) constrains its investment capacity on essential maintenance and improvement of generation plants and transmission lines and grid. GPL faces financial difficulties due to a combination of net operating losses (i.e. tariffs below costs) and high commercial losses.World Bank 2007 == Sector policy == The ‚ÄúEnergy Policy of Guyana,‚Äù completed in 1994, advocates the replacement of imported petroleum, as far as possible, by indigenous renewable energy sources. Increased and more efficient use of domestic energy resources, primarily hydropower and bagasse for electricity generation, is envisaged to contribute significantly in this regard. More recently, the System Development Plan prepared by GPL (Guyana Power and Light) in 2000 and its 2007-2011 Development and Expansion Programme (D&E;) reflect the official government policy of utilizing Guyana's renewable energy resources such as biomass and hydropower.World Bank 2007 Meanwhile, the sector policy has also relied on the encouragement of private sector participation in building a healthy market-oriented economy. The policy envisaged that Independent Power Producers (IPPs), which are investor-owned enterprises involved in power generation, will be encouraged. Additional policies are certainly needed to strengthen the energy sector.World Bank 2007  Expansion plans  The short to medium term generation plans included the use of renewable resources, including 4MW from a Wind Farm and 10MW from a Bagasse co-generation facility. These together with some 35MW of heavy fuel oil fired capacity would provide a total of 49MW of firm capacity during the five-year (2007‚Äì2011) programme. According to GPL's annual report 2006, the inability to conclude Power Purchase Agreements for the Wind Farm and 35MW of heavy fuel oil-fired capacity meant that the entire generation plan had to be rolled forward into the 2007‚Äì2011 Development & Expansion Programme. == Renewable energy ==  Hydroelectricity  Guyana has a massive but yet unrealized potential for hydropower generation. Hydropower generation capacity has been estimated at 7,600 MW, that is, more than 30 times the current installed capacity in the country. Feasibility studies have been carried out for specific projects, but up to now, this potential remains untapped, mainly due to the considerable capital investments required to set up new power facilities. Indeed, beside the actual investment in generation plants, transmission lines would also be required, as most of the generation potential is inland, far from the zones of heaviest demand along the coast.World Bank 2007 Continued steep increases in the price of fuel influenced a Government decision to accelerate the development of hydropower. Consequently, negotiations for the 100MW Amaila Falls Hydroelectric Project on the Kuribrong River moved forward with the aim to bring it to fruition in the year 2011.  Bagasse Guyana has opportunities for electricity generation based on renewable resources linked to its large sugar industry. Electricity can be generated using bagasse, a by-product of sugar production, as basic fuel for thermoelectric facilities. Bagasse generation benefits from lower and more stable cost of than oil-based generation, as well as lower carbon emissions. A major bagasse co-generation project was implemented in 2006 by the Guyana Sugar Corporation (Guysuco). This project expanded power generation capacity by a further 25 MW (15 MW bagasse-based and 10 MW diesel-based) through an investment of US$27 million in a bagasse co-generation scheme. One third of the new capacity was allocated to the local grid through a power purchase agreement.World Bank 2007 Because of its climate, Guyana has a large potential for sugarcane crops, as well as a large sugar industry that could benefit from additional revenue opportunities such as energy generation. Even though it may not be feasible to meet Guyana's power demand with bagasse-based facilities, they can help to reduce the reliance of the sector on imported oil, while having a positive environmental impact through reduced carbon emissions. However, an important constraint to Guyana's bagasse-based generation potential is the lack of year-round supply of bagasse, which means that a substantial investment in storage and hauling would be required.World Bank 2007 Wind The potential for wind-based generation is considered to be significant, although no comprehensive studies have been carried out. The Guyana Energy Agency reported a pilot project for a wind turbine in Guyana's east coast. This is a small project with expected energy savings of around US$30,000, and a payback period of 40 months. However, no major projects are being put in place. Other Caribbean countries such as Barbados and St. Lucia have promoted the use of such renewable energy sources through initiatives that include the removal of taxes and import tariffs on wind-farm equipment.World Bank 2007 == History of the electricity sector == Guyana Power & Light (GPL) was originally named the Guyana Electricity Corporation, wholly owned by the Government of Guyana. In late 1999, a 50/50 equity partnership was established between the Government of Guyana and a consortium comprising the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom, and the Electricity Supply Board International (ESBI) of Ireland which created the new Company, GPL. This partnership was dissolved in 2003 and GPL reverted to 100 percent ownership by the Government of Guyana.World Bank 2007 The failure of GPL to significantly cut back its technical and commercial losses has been deemed to be largely due to the lack of incentives for efficiency due to its ownership structure. Accordingly, its privatization was expected to generate commercial incentives to improve efficiency, while also enhancing private funding to develop the system. However the privatized venture failed to deliver the results expected and, after a few years returned to Government ownership. A future re-privatization of GPL is unlikely to occur before the regulatory and institutional framework of the sector is improved.World Bank 2007 == Tariffs and subsidies ==  Tariffs  Electricity prices in Guyana are the third highest in the Caribbean due in large part to the country's reliance on expensive imported oil for electricity generation. At present the cost of fuel accounts for up to 60 percent of the total cost of electricity generation. Recent oil price hikes are passed on to consumers, as logically part of such increases in production inputs would be reflected in the price that consumers have to pay.World Bank 2007 An announced tariff reform will aim to rebalance the loads between industrial and domestic use through an increase in the domestic tariff, and a reduction of the industrial tariff. The new tariff structure will be implemented within a timeframe of 4 to 5 years after its approval by the Prime Minister.World Bank 2007 Tariffs effective February 2008 are: * Residential: 0.246 to 0.273 US$/kWh ( weighted average for LAC in 2005: 0.105 * Commercial: US$0.355/kWh * Industrial: 0.276 to 0.320 US$/kWh ( weighted average for LAC in 2005: 0.1075) * Government: 0.283 to 0.370 US$/kWh  Subsidies  n/a == Investment and financing == Reduction of Guyana's reliance on imported oil and the improvement of energy efficiency will require large investments that will impact on the fiscal stability of the country. The World Bank estimates that an increase in electricity intensity in Guyana at a level comparable with peer Caribbean countries would require investments over the next 10 years of between US$805 million and US$1,497 million (or between 10 and 19 percent of its GDP). However, under the current ownership structure of the system, this level of investment would pose a significant burden on the Government of Guyana, and would create considerable debt sustainability concerns.World Bank 2007 Installed capacity is expected to increase by 62.5 MW in the period 2007-2009, as part of a US$120 million plan for future development managed by GPL. This plan also aims to address issues of distribution (through the construction of transmission lines and enhancement of the network) and efficiency.World Bank 2007 == Private sector participation in the electricity sector == Independent Power Producers (IPPs) own and operate 45 percent of the installed generation capacity, which is thermoelectric. The table below shows the generation share of GPL and IPPs:World Bank 2007 {  - !!style=\\"text-align: center; background-color:#ffdead;\\"Company !!style=\\"text-align: center; background- color:#ffdead;\\"Installed capacity (MW) (1) -  Guyana Power and Light (GPL)  align=\\"center\\" 126 -  Omai Gold Mines Ltd.

Total ! align=\\"center\\"226 } Source: World Bank, 2007 (1) In 2005-2007, only GPL, GSC, BERMINE and AMC have sold electricity to the grid. IPPs are mainly large corporate firms that generate power for their own needs and sell excess capacity to the national grid. In the last few years, there have been formal efforts to enhance the relationships between IPPs and GPL; these include co- generation projects, plans for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and explicit interest government interest in renewable energy projects. The expectations for capacity growth are reliant on the participation of these independent producers.World Bank 2007 A significant enhancement of the regulatory framework will be required in order to ensure the viability of GPL as a potential private venture, and to encourage further private investment. While private participation is desirable, it may also not lead to significant improvements when regulatory capacity is weak and enforcement of contracts is insecure, as is the case in Guyana.World Bank 2007 Summary of private sector participation The electricity sector in Guyana is dominated by Guyana Power and Light (GPL), a vertically integrated government-owned utility with a monopolistic position on transmission and distribution, and a major stake in generation.World Bank 2007 {  - !Subsector !Private participation (%) -  Generation  align=\\"center\\"45 -  Transmission  align=\\"center\\"0 -  Distribution  align=\\"center\\"0 } == Electricity and the environment == The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the institution in charge of environmental issues in Guyana, focusing on effective environmental management and protection and the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources.Environmental Protection Agency Guyana emitted 1.58 million tons of in 2005, which corresponds to 2.07 t per capita annually.Energy Information Administration, International Emissions Data Currently (September 2008), there in one CDM registered project in the electricity sector in Guyana, the Skeldon Bagasse Cogeneration Project.

The IDB is also providing technical assistance for: * Strengthening Electricity Sector Regulation in Support of Private Investment: technical assistance recently completed (July 2008) * Expanding Bioenergy Opportunities in Guyana: this US$675,500 technical assistance aims to improve the capacity of the Government to better respond to project proposals related to non- traditional energy sources, with particular emphasis on bioenergy and to increase capacity within the Government in relation to bio-energy technology and research. == See also == * Guyana * Economy of Guyana * Water supply and sanitation in Guyana * History of Guyana * Politics of Guyana * Hinterland energy in Guyana == Sources == * Guyana Power and Light, 2006.

The Metropolitan Cathedral of Quito (), known simply as la Catedral, is the Catholic cathedral in Quito, Ecuador. Located on the southwestern side of the Plaza de la Independencia (La Plaza Grande), it (and its predecessor building) served as a seat of the Diocese of Quito from 1545 until 1848 when it was elevated to Archdiocese. In 1995, it was elevated to the Cathedral of Ecuador, making it the seniormost Catholic church in the country.Arquidi√≥cesis de Quito y Primada del Ecuador (25 Jan 2013), La Arquidi√≥cesis de Quito en la historia (1545‚Äì2009) [In Spanish]. ==Description== The Cathedral is a white-painted monumental church with a single high belltower offset to the right of the main entrance. Built on a plan comprising three longitudinal naves surmounted by semi-ogival arches on square pillars, the basic spatial structure of the Cathedral is typical of the 16th century. Based upon interior features ‚Äî especially the details of the pillars, arches, and the carved and coffered ceiling ‚Äî some experts assert that the Cathedral should be characterized as Gothic-Mud√©jar in style. It has Gothic features in the pointed arches of its naves, as well as in the ambulatory that surrounds the presbytery.Architectural Guide of Quito ‚Äì Evelia Peralta & Rolando Moya tasquer ‚Äì Trama Ediciones ‚Äì 2007. Exterior In a deviation from Spanish convention, the Cathedral actually has two main entrances: one at mid-nave that faces the Plaza and the other, with the belltower, at the northwest facade facing Calle Garcia Moreno. The axis has a southeast-northwest orientation due to the local topography: 16th century ravines prevented the main facade from facing the plaza, as is customary. The elaborate arched side-entrance and its semi-circular staircase facing the Plaza were an early 19th-century addition. Known as the Carondelet Arch, this portal is the main interface between Cathedral and square. The relationship is also underlined by a longitudinal stone parapet running the length of the building on that side (and decorated with spheres, pyramids, etc.) which preserves the difference in level between the Cathedral floor and that of the Plaza. Three attractive domes dressed in glazed green ceramic rise atop the transept, the high altar, and the Carondelet Arch. The transept dome is itself surmounted by an iron rooster weather vane, subject of several local legends. (These neo-classical domes, along with the neo-classical balustrade sculptures, various arches, Ionic pilasters, and the semi-circular Plaza staircase are modernizing 19th century additions.) Plaques on the exterior walls of the Cathedral commemorate the fourth centenary (1934) of the founding of the city: first, the site is celebrated as the launching point of the Amazon expedition of Francisco de Orellana (1511‚Äì1546). (\\"It is the glory of Quito to have discovered the great River of the Amazons.\\") The next five name the five founders of the city. Then: \\"Quito, Patrimony of Humankind\\". Finally, \\"Cathedral, Main church construction, 16th century (1545‚Äì1572); Restoration, 17th‚Äì18th & 20th centuries\\". Interior Inside, the three naves are supported by pointed arches, which in turn are supported by pillars with square bases. The central nave has cedar panelling betraying Moorish influences. An extraordinary wooden coffered ceiling is supported by a golden frieze and beautiful paintings hang among the arches. The right nave opens into several chapels along the wall, each surmounted by domes with skylights. The chapels, in order, are: All Souls; Calvary; The Denial of Peter; Saint Peter, First Pope of the Church; The Sacred Family. Here also is a large wooden carved door, in a semi-circular arch, leading to La Iglesia de El Sagrario [Church of the Sanctuary], a 17th-century chapel attached to the main buildingPeralta, Op. cit. which is usually locked. (El Sagrario is accessed from outside the Cathedral.) Works by artists of the Quito School of Art, based in the nearby Church and Convent of St. Francis, adorn the interior of the Cathedral. The side reredos, covered with goldleaf, were carved by the early masters of that school and in their niches are placed images of saints and martyrs. The large painting of the Assumption of the Virgin, located in the upper choir, is the work of Manuel de Samaniego (1767‚Äì1824). The altarpiece of the Chapel of All Souls has the notable sculptural group known as The Denial of St. Peter, attributed to Father Carlos. Other notable Cathedral artworks include the Altarpiece (Retablo) of Santa Ana (comprising images of Saint Joaqu√≠n, Saint Joseph, and Saint Ann and dating to the 18th century); Bernardo Rodr√≠guez‚Äôs Cure of the Lame by Saint Peter; the 1734 sculpture Inmaculada of Bernardo de Legarda (the replica of which watches over Quito from the top of El Panecillo); also, the Adoration of the Three Magi and the Cure of the Crippled (a mural). The high altar, said to be entirely of gold, shows both Baroque and Moorish patterns. The interior of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Quito in the 19th century ==History== Background Soon after the founding of the city of San Francisco de Quito (6 December 1534), the entire southern side of the future Plaza Grande was given over to the Church. The first temporary building, raised in the same year by Father Juan Rodriguez ‚Äî first pastor of the fledgling town ‚Äî was of adobe with wood frame and thatch roof.Peralta, Evelia (1991), Gu√≠a Arquitect√≥nica de Quito; Editorial Fraga, Direcci√≥n de Planificaci√≥n del Ilustre Municipio de Quito, pp 40‚Äì41.√Ålvarez Moyano, Franco (26 Jan 2013), La catedral, iglesia y museo de arte religioso , Agencia P√∫blica de Noticias de Quito [In Spanish]. With the establishment of a parish of Quito (January 1545), a Bishop ‚Äî Garc√≠a D√≠az Arias ‚Äî was named and reached the city on April 13 of the following year, along with Vicar General Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Aguayo and plans to build a more eminent edifice.√Ålvarez Moyano, Op. cit.. Construction From 1562 to 1565, the building rose from its limestone foundations under the leadership of now Archdeacon Rodr√≠guez de Aguayo, who served as acting bishop ‚Äî Diaz Arias having died.Virgen del Buen Suceso, La Catedral de Quito, Obispos de Quito [In Spanish]. The architect was Antonio Garc√≠a.Peralta, Op. cit.. Construction was of stone and the minga system (a local traditional practice of communal hauling, carving, and masonry) was utilized. Turning its flank broadside to the Plaza, the Church helped define its size and shape. The anomaly of the main entrance not fronting onto the Plaza is explained by the presence of a deep gorge (la quebrada de Sangu√±a or Zangu√±a) present at the time of construction, which precluded extending the building backwards (toward the southwest).Peralta, Op. cit.. (The site, adjacent to the ravine, had been selected for defensive purposes. The ravine was itself overtopped by the Iglesia de El Sagrario in the 17th century.) The Cathedral was consecrated by the second bishop of Quito ‚Äî Fray Pedro de la Pe√±a ‚Äî in 1572. 17th century After the eruption of Mount Pichincha, a local volcano which struck Quito in 1660, the damaged Cathedral was rebuilt by order of Bishop Alfonso de la Pe√±a y Montenegro. Much of its internal decor was reworked and it is from this period that Miguel de Santiago's painting of the Virgin Mary (Dormition of the Virgin), formerly in the main choir reredos, is dated. At this time the building was also lengthened toward the west, the aisles were connected behind the choir, and an opening made for a side doorway to the square. The sacristy was also extended and the separate chapter house (known as La Iglesia de El Sagrario) was built. Ort√≠z Crespo, Alfonso (1993), ‚ÄúSome historical data on the Plaza Grande and the surrounding buildings‚Äù ; Historical Museum [a magazine of the Quito municipal archives], number 60, year 1993. [Ort√≠z Crespo was deputy director of the Cultural Centers of the Directorate for Education and Culture of the Municipality of San Francisco de Quito.] 18th century A second reconstruction came in 1755 owing to an earthquake that struck the city in that year, although the work was relatively minor as the damage had not been significant. A more significant earthquake struck in 1797 at which time major changes were made to the interior decoration including a new choir. According to tradition, the artist known as Caspicara (Manuel Chili) participated in this and incorporated paintings of his teachers Manuel de Samaniego and Bernardo Rodr√≠guez, removing from the choir de Santiago's great 17th century canvas Dormition and replacing it with Samaniego's El Tr√°nsito de la Virgen.Ort√≠z Crespo, Op. cit. The present gilt wooden pulpit was re-surfaced at this time. 19th century The Cathedral was enhanced in 1806‚Äì07, during the administration of the 20th President of the Real Audiencia Baron H√©ctor de Carondelet, by the addition of the Carondelet Arch, a work of Spanish military engineer Antonio Garc√≠a. The early 19th century also saw the replacement of the original 16th-century Mudejar- style coffered ceiling with a copy. (This was itself replaced by another copy in the mid-20th century.) Earthquakes again damaged the building in 1858 and '59, this time destroying a large part of the belltower. (It ended up not being rebuilt until 1930 and then in a different style and context ‚Äî the so- called \\"Prussian helmet\\" of German architect and priest Pedro Bruning.)Ort√≠z Crespo, Op. cit. The catacombs of the Cathedral have served as a resting place for many important figures in Ecuador's history, such as independence leader Antonio Jos√© de Sucre (1795‚Äì1830), who is laid to rest in his own Mausoleum Chapel. On 13 January 1848 the Diocese of Quito was elevated to an archdiocese. The small altar of Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores (English: \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\") has a plaque showing where President Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno was shot in 1875. The murder of the Bishop of Quito, Jos√© Ignacio Checa y Barba, took place here during the mass of Good Friday, 30 March 1877, when he was poisoned with strychnine dissolved in the consecrated wine. The Cathedral is also the burial place of several other presidents of the Republic, as well as of bishops and priests who died in the diocese. 20th century Along with the early 19th century coffered ceilings, the transverse arches of the side naves were replaced in the mid-20th century. (The latter largely destroyed a curious mural painting which perhaps dated from the 17th century.) The tall campanario (belfry) was finally restored and received its peculiar \\"cap\\" in 1930. In the wake of a 1987 earthquake, the municipality of Quito has structurally restored the deep foundations of the Cathedral with micropile technology. In 1995 the Cathedral of Quito was elevated to the Cathedral of Ecuador, making it the seniormost Catholic church in the country. Restorations of the artium and the parapet were undertaken in 1997 and 1999 respectively. ==Gallery== Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 057.JPGThe campanario (belltower) of the Cathedral.

It was first published by the University of Queensland Press in Australia and Faber & Faber in the United Kingdom in 1994. Subsequent editions and translations have appeared in the United States, France, Germany, and elsewhere. ==Premise== The principal character and narrator is a boy (in later sections a young man), Tristan Smith, who has been born with malformations to his face and limbs so extensive that the physicians who perform the delivery recommend that he be given no care. His mother, an unmarried actress named Belinda Smith, rejects the doctors' advice and takes the infant home. Tristan is largely raised on the premises of the Feu Follet, an avant garde theatre collective of which his mother is the guiding force. His presumptive father is Lesley Smith, an actor in the troupe and Felicity's lover, but two other men also exercise paternal roles in his life to an extent. One is Vincent Theroux, a manufacturer and politician, who has also been Felicity's lover; the other is Wally Paccione, an ex-convict who is the production manager of the Feu Follet. Tristan can not walk normally and his speech is hard for others to understand, but in spite of his physical limitations, he discovers a vocation as a performer. ==Setting of the novel== The first of the novel's two sections takes place in Efica, an invented country occupying an archipelago in the Southern Hemisphere. The map published in the US edition suggests a version of New Zealand. Tristan is born in Chemin Rouge, Efica's capital, and visits other parts of the country during the Feu Follet's annual regional tours. His mother, however, is not a native Efican, having been born and raised in a distant and more powerful fictional nation, Voorstand, which on the map loosely resembles Australia. The second half of the novel follows Tristan's travels in Voorstand. Like Peter Carey's native Australia, Efica was founded, at least in part, as a penal settlement. It has its own calendar (Tristan is born in the year 371 EC), which begins with the archipelago's first discovery by one Captain Girard. Though Eficans speak English, their vocabulary retains an admixture of French slang, a legacy from French dyers who came to Efica in its early years. The country's principal products are dyestuffs, a fact memorialized in the nicknames of the two major political parties, the Reds and the Blues. Felicity Smith, Vincent Theroux, and the members of the Feu Follet are all supporters of the Efican Democratic Party, as the Blue party is formally known. The Reds favor Efica's unequal alliance with Voorstand, as a result of which a network of Efican caves has been threaded with cable in order to create a giant antenna used to communicate with submarines. The Blues are firmly opposed to the alliance. Parallels with New Zealand's 1980s dispute with the United States and Australia over nuclear weapons can be inferred. Voorstand is also largely English-speaking, but a substantial portion of its vocabulary is derived from Dutch. It occupies the bulk of a continent several thousand miles across, the fringes of which are occupied by three poorer nations, Zeelung, Morea, and the Republic of Bouke. Voorstand has its own national mythology, centered on several Disneyish animal characters, notably Bruder Mouse (\\"Brother Mouse\\") and Oncle Duck (\\"Uncle Duck\\"), in addition to a human national saint originally named Meneer Van Kraligan. According to a legend recorded in Tales of Bruder Mouse, Van Kraligan had raised Oncle Duck and was about to eat him when Bruder Mouse appeared and performed a comic routine of acrobatics. As Van Kraligan runs off to fetch the neighborhood children to witness the sight, Oncle Duck and Bruder Mouse escape. That and similar legends are the origin of both the Voorstand \\"Sirkus\\" (an elaborate‚Äîand not infrequently fatal‚Äîmultimedia extravaganza) and the Voorstanders' religious taboo against exploiting animals in circus performances. The US edition, published by Alfred A. Knopf, inc. in 1995, includes maps of both Efica and Voorstand. ==Themes and notes== The political and cultural dynamics of the relationship between Voorstand and Efica recall the relationship between the United States and third-world or peripheral countries. Some elements of Voorstand's history and culture are also reminiscent of the Boers. Almost the entire novel takes place within the worlds of the theatre or of the circus. Tristan's short stature and deformities place him in an equivocal position as both a serious actor (and devotee of Stanislavski) and as a circus \\"freak.\\" Tristan Smith's initials and first name suggest the hero of Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy. A group of islands in the southern portion of Efica bear the name of \\"the Madeleines,\\" apparently because their shape resembles the French cakes of that name. ==Awards== *The Age Book of the Year Award, Fiction Prize, 1994: winner *The Age Book of the Year Award, Book of the Year, 1994: winner Category:1994 Australian novels Category:Novels by Peter Carey Category:Novels about actors Category:Faber and Faber books Category:University of Queensland Press books ","title":"The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith"},{"id":"19336982","text":"The 2008 Nicholson McLaren Engines British Hill Climb Championship season was the 62nd British Hill Climb Championship (BHCC) season.

As a performer he is best known as the frontman of 1980s pop band Danny Wilson and mid-1990s rock band King L (as well as for being a member of Transister). Since the mid-1990s he has concentrated on songwriting and production. ==Career== Performer ‚Äì Danny Wilson, solo, King L, Transister During the early 1980s Clark worked with his long-time friend, Ged Grimes in a variety of London-based bands including Clark's Commandos and Dream Kitchen. Returning to Dundee, Clark and Grimes formed a trio with Gary's brother Kit Clark, initially under the name of Spencer Tracy. They signed to Virgin Records in 1986, and (after objections from the estate of Spencer Tracy) changed their name to Danny Wilson. The following year saw the release of the band's first album Meet Danny Wilson. The first single, \\"Mary's Prayer\\", written by Clark, was a worldwide hit, reaching number 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 23 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, earning him a BMI award, and a nomination for an Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. A second album Bebop Moptop was released in 1989, including hit single \\"Second Summer of Love\\" which reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. The band split in 1991. Following the break-up of Danny Wilson, Clark embarked on a solo career, releasing a 1991 single (\\"You Can't Turn Around Me\\") on Seven Records under the temporary project name of Eleven. Reverting to his own name, he released a 1993 solo album called Ten Short Songs About Love on Virgin Records subsidiary Circa Records, with the assistance of the other Danny Wilson members. Clark then formed a rock band called King L (with bass player Eric Pressly, former Bible guitarist Neill MacColl and drummer Matt Laug). The band released an album, A Great Day For Gravity, in 1995. Clark and Pressly then formed the pop trio Transister with Pressly's girlfriend Keely Hawkes. Transister's songs were featured on the films Nightwatch, Jawbreaker, Wild Things and Charlie's Angels. Songwriter and producer Around this time, Clark was increasingly working as a songwriter and record producer. He co-wrote and produced much of Lauren Christy's album Breed, the title track of which was a hit on the Billboard Alternative chart, and left Transister to devote more time to this. His collaboration with Natalie Imbruglia began when he and Eric Pressly re- mixed the single \\"Wishing I Was There\\" from her Left of the Middle album. He co-wrote and produced eight tracks on her subsequent album, White Lilies Island, and has contributed songs to all of her albums after that ‚Äì Counting Down The Days, Glorious: The Singles 1997-2007, and Come To Life. In 2007, Clark moved from London to Los Angeles, where he lived until 2014. Clark co- wrote and co-produced the Ferras record Aliens And Rainbows with The Matrix for Capitol Records, tracks for Clique Girlz and British Band McFly. He produced and co-wrote the song \\"Got Dynamite\\" for Demi Lovato on her number 1 album Here We Go Again. In 2012, he co-wrote and produced 10 songs on Delta Goodrem's Child of the Universe, including the single \\"Wish You Were Here\\", which reached No. 2 on the ARIA charts. In 2013, Clark co-wrote and produced Alex Hepburn's international hit single \\"Under\\". In the same year, Clark co- wrote and co-produced Kim Cesarion's album, Undressed, including the eponymous single, \\"Undressed\\". He co-wrote the song \\"Back To Life\\" on Lawson's Chapman Square ‚Äì Chapter II album, and co-wrote and co-produced \\"Summer Alive\\" on The Wanted's Word of Mouth album. Gin Wigmore's Gravel & Wine album was released in the US, including the Clark co-write \\"Kill of the Night\\". The song has had TV, film and commercial placements, including 666 Park Avenue, Underbelly: Badness, Teen Wolf, Pretty Little Liars and on AMC Halloween week. Other artists and writers Clark has worked with include Lloyd Cole, Liz Phair, Skin (Skunk Anansie), Melanie C, Emma Bunton, Cathy Dennis, Ashley Parker Angel, Nick Carter, Skye Edwards (Morcheeba), Lauren Christy, Julia Fordham, Shannon Noll, Mark Owen, Eddi Reader, The Veronicas, David McAlmont, Delta Goodrem, Lawson, The Wanted, Gin Wigmore and Reece Mastin. In 2014, Clark returned to live in his home town of Dundee. Since then he has co-written The Veronicas' song \\"Cold\\"., co-composed and co-performed the music on the 2016 film Sing Street, co-written songs on the forthcoming album by Irish band Little Hours, and co-written and co-produced the soon-to-be-released album by The Xcerts.

They were billed as \\"San Diego's Ultimate Metal Tribute Band.\\" ==Background== Monsters of Rock were a San Diego-based multi-metal tribute act dedicated to performing the songs of the well-known metal bands that dominated the 1970s, 1980's, and 1990's--especially bands that performed in England's \\"Monsters of Rock\\" festivals. The Monsters of Rock paid tribute to bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Queensryche, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne and many others. Monsters of Rock performed in venues within the Southern California area and received a third place award and a $4,000 cash prize in the \\"Ultimate Music Challenge 2: Battle of the Cover Bands\\" at Viejas CasinoViejas casino in Alpine, California on August 3, 2008. Ultimate Music Challenge 2 Monsters of Rock also competed the following year in the \\"Ultimate Music Challenge 3: Battle of the Cover Bands\\" at Viejas Casino in Alpine, California on July 8, 2009 winning second place and a $8,000 cash prize.http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2009/jul/08/bloodless/ Ultimate Music Challenge 3http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-10269-all-we-are-saying- is-give-cheese-a-chance.html ==History== Monsters of Rock originally formed in February 2005 by bassist Jeff Sheets (formerly of Hunter), lead guitarist Gavin O'Hara (formerly of Sabotage, Street Liegel,http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/street-liegel/ and Sinor), drummer A.J. Wolfe, and lead vocalist Ron Lerma (formerly of Piece of Mind, Deeper Purple, and Teabag). Jeff Sheets, Gavin O'Hara, and A.J. Wolfe were all formerly in the band Wolfgaard in 2004 playing originals and covers. The band name was changed from Wolfgaard to Monsters of Rock when Ron Lerma joined the group and suggested the name change. Ron was also involved in an original project with the band Sator Square at the time of Monsters of Rock's formation.http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/sator-square/# In April 2005, A.J. Wolfe accepted a job offer and relocated to Oregon. He was replaced by Tom Hogue (formerly of Cynical Man and Malady who are presently known as Benedictum and have since released three albums/CDs in Europe). Eventually the band decided that they would need a second guitarist to fill out their sound. After auditioning several candidates, they recruited lead guitarist Sergio Estrada (formerly of Sweet Vengeance) in mid-April 2005. The members of this line up all brought previous experience having played alongside acts such as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Great White, Mot√∂rhead, and others at such legendary San Diego venues as the Bacchanal, Rio's, Straita Head Sound,http://www.straitaheadsound.com 4th&B;, and Brick by Brick (formerly \\"The Spirit Club\\") to name a few. While they were playing original material at these venues in hopes of a recording contract, this time around the purpose of their band was to play heavy metal covers that influenced them to become musicians in the first place. In May 2006, due to musical differences, Jeff Sheets left the band. Bass player Dave Kendall (formerly of The Spoilers & The Late Edition) joined the band the same month. Dave was a friend of both Tom Hogue and Sergio Estrada dating back to high school. In May 2010, Tom Hogue also left the band. Tom Hogue was initially replaced by Jerry Fluery (formerly of 6one9 http://www.619rocks.com/Monday.htm and Black Diamond w/Gavin O'Hara back in 1983). Jerry had to quit the band due to work constraints and was replaced by Sergio's brother, Roger Estrada in September 2010. In May 2014, the band parted ways with lead vocalist, Ron Lerma. After unsuccessful attempts of finding a full-time replacement lead singer, the band decided to utilize other guest lead vocalists to fulfill their contractual obligations for the remainder of 2014. Since all four of the remaining members were currently in three different bands, the Monsters band scaled back to doing quarterly shows between 2015-2017. Since 2008, the band had been playing venues, such as House of Blues, The Belly Up Tavern,http://bellyup.com/ Paladinos,http://www.paladinosclub.com/ and were a house band at the Second Wind Bars in Santee http://www.sandiegoreader.com/places/second-wind---santee/ and San Carlos, CA. They prided themselves in filling a void not too many bands provide which is playing classic heavy metal covers. They shared the stage with many nationally and internationally known tribute and original music acts such as The Iron Maidens, The Atomic Punks, Wild Child,http://www.wildchild.info/ Damage Inc,http://www.damageinc.us/ ThundHerStruck,http://www.thundherstruck.com/content.html Lights, Steel Panther, and Pearl Aday to name a few.

In addition, significant flooding which was already underway due to heavy rain from the front to the north was worsened by rainfall brought on by Ike in parts of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana to the west of the center. The severe winds reported across the Midwest to the east of the center (although little or no rain fell in many of those areas) were as a result of a combination of factors, including the strength and size of Ike itself allowing for a strong pressure gradient and a well-defined structure, the location on the east side of the storm where the winds are usually stronger in a northward-moving system due to its forward motion, its fast forward motion of about , and the warm air ahead of the storm allowed the high winds aloft to reach the surface easier. Many areas reported wind gusts up to hurricane force. It was one of the largest power outages caused by a natural disaster in the history of the Midwest, with around 3.7 million customers losing power (well over 8 million people), including 2.6 million outages in the state of Ohio alone.http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/09/15/A1_wind_placeholder.ART_ART_09-15-08_A1_VOBB1TM.html?sid=101 26 people were killed in the interior states. Ohio alone sustained over $560 million in damage. ==Arkansas== A self-storage warehouse building was destroyed by a tornado southwest of Cabot, Arkansas In Arkansas, about 200,000 customers lost power as a result of the winds, the worst power loss in that state since an ice storm in 2000. Damage was widespread, with trees and power lines knocked down in many areas. At least five tornadoes‚Äîall rated EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale--were reported, in Garland, Hot Spring, Lonoke, Perry and Saline Counties. The Lonoke County tornado caused some structural damage near Cabot, including a storage unit and several metal buildings at a lumber mill that were destroyed, a strip mall that was heavily damaged and many signs blown down. Arkansas was spared the significant rainfall that areas farther north saw though. One person was killed when a tree fell onto a mobile home near Fisher, Arkansas. ==Tennessee and Missouri== Two deaths occurred when a tree fell onto two people on a golf course in Hermitage, Tennessee, just outside Nashville. Parts of Missouri, particularly around St. Louis, sustained major flooding. In St. Charles County, the Missouri River reached well above flood stage with forecasts as high as above flood stage, and seven private levees were threatened. Another hard-hit community was Arnold, where the Meramec River threatened to reach major flood stage for the third time in 2008, although sandbags were still up from the March flood there. The high winds in southeastern Missouri, particularly the Bootheel, also blew corn stalks down and caused severe damage to crops. The winds and rain knocked out power to about 85,000 customers in Missouri. A woman was also struck and killed by a large tree limb in Ladue, Missouri, and two bodies of a man and a woman who presumably drowned were found in University City, Missouri, outside of St. Louis. Another drowning took place in floodwaters in Columbia, Missouri. ==Kentucky== The Louisville area declared a state of emergency due to major damage, and the Louisville International Airport was closed temporarily. A LG&E; spokesperson said that this was the worst power outage in 30 years. Near Covington, the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport was also temporarily shut down, and the control tower was evacuated. Also in Covington, an apartment building lost its entire roof and the Renaissance Hotel also sustained damage. Later in the day, a statewide state of emergency was declared in Kentucky by Governor Steve Beshear. All school districts in the three northernmost counties in the state, except two (Southgate Independent Schools and Kenton County Schools) were closed or delayed in the first 3 days following the storm. In the Louisville area, over 300,000 customers were without power - the worst power outage in the utility's history. In western Kentucky, outside crews had to be brought in from as far away as Mississippi to restore power. Statewide, well over 600,000 customers lost electricity as a result of the winds. In Simpsonville, a boy was struck and killed by a blown tree limb while outdoors. ==Illinois and Indiana== Flooding near a pedestrian bridge in Shorewood, Illinois Much of Illinois suffered significant flooding. The hardest hit rivers were the DuPage, Des Plaines and Chicago Rivers. Many volunteers were called in to fill sandbags in an attempt to hold back the rising rivers. Dozens of people had to be rescued by boat. The corn and soybean crops were also threatened in many areas as a result of the heavy rainfall. In Riverside, several neighborhoods and much of the local forest preserve area were submerged in up to 2 to 4 feet of rapidly flowing water by the swollen Des Plaines River. A state of emergency was declared in Chicago and Cook County as a result of the floodwaters, and was later extended statewide by Governor Rod Blagojevich. About 49,000 customers lost power in Illinois. Effects were not limited to the state's northeastern corner; in the southwestern city of Chester, the Governor Bond State Memorial was severely damaged by the hurricane.http://www.randolphcountyheraldtribune.com/news/x877721571/Storm- damages-Bond-Monument \\"Storm damages Bond Monument\\", Randolph County Herald Tribune, September 19, 2008 The northwestern part of Indiana was hard hit by flooding, which was partially related to the frontal boundary and partially related to Ike. One of the hardest-hit communities was Munster, where 5,000 residents had to be evacuated as a result of the Little Calumet River overflowing in many spots and breaking through the levee near the Calumet Avenue bridge. Several people had to be rescued by boat and there was a garage fire and a massive house explosion in the flooded area that leveled one house and damaged others. Parts of Interstates 80 and 94 were closed due to flooding, slowing traffic greatly in the region. In Indiana, about 350,000 customers lost power statewide, mostly in the southern part. The fields of southern Indiana were heavily impacted, and a spokesman the state's Natural Resource Conservation Service described the situation as a \\"severe crop loss\\" and the \\"worst wind damage I have ever seen\\". A state of emergency was later declared by Governor Mitch Daniels. Strong winds blew off the steeple of St. Mary's Catholic Church in New Albany, Indiana. Seven deaths were reported in Indiana. Two deaths took place in Chesterton as a result of flooding, and five deaths due to fallen trees in other parts of Indiana - two in Clark County and one each in Crawford, Perry and Ohio Counties. Two deaths were reported in Illinois, both of which were drownings. ==Ohio and Michigan== A large tree down in front of a house in Wilmington, Ohio The Esquire Theater on Ludlow Avenue in Cincinnati during the blackout Ohio was hit extremely hard by the storm. Wind gusts of over were recorded in Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus, which is equivalent to sustained wind levels found in a Category 1 hurricane.http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/events/20080914/ The remnants of Ike caused a total of 2.6 million power outages in the state of Ohio, 330,000 of them for over a week. A state of emergency was declared on Monday by Governor Ted Strickland. On September 16 and 17, Governor Strickland took a tour of the heavily damaged areas, particularly in Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton to survey the damage. Ike caused $1.255 billion in damage in Ohio. The Cincinnati metropolitan area was hit extremely hard, with over 927,000 households losing power in that region (approximately 2.1 million people). A Duke Energy spokesperson said \\"We have never seen anything like this. Never. We're talking about 90 percent of our customers without power\\". On September 15, 16 and 17, most of the schools in Hamilton County and Butler County had classes cancelled because of power outages.The Business Courier of Cincinnati, September 16, 2008Krantz, Cindy, Cincinnati Enquirer, September 17, 2008 In Cincinnati, the effects of this storm have become known as The Cincinnati Blackout. A water emergency was also declared in Butler County as the water supply diminished due to the lack of power, and a \\"Level One\\" emergency was declared in the county to encourage people to remain at home, although stopping short of a curfew. In the Dayton, Ohio area 300,000 of 515,000 Dayton Power & Light Co. customers lost power at some point following severe wind storms on the afternoon of September 14, according to a company spokesperson. As of Thursday morning, September 18, 90,000 DP&L; customers remained without power. Also hard hit were central Ohio (with over 350,000 customers losing power) and northeastern Ohio (with over 310,000 customers losing power). A curfew was implemented on September 17 in Carlisle due to increased looting activity as a result of the lengthy power outage and damage. There were 370,000 outages in the state capital of Columbus. Many of the citizens in Columbus were without power for close to a week, because 25 percent of the AEP company's workers were in Texas helping crews there restore electricity to the millions who lost power because of Hurricane Ike. All the major school districts in Columbus were closed for at least two days. Agricultural damage was severe, with as much as 20% of the state's total corn crop lost as a result of winds blowing down corn stalks. Some fields were nearly flattened by the hurricane-force wind gusts. Tens of thousands of people also lost power in northwest Ohio where widespread outages and damage were reported in the Lima and Findlay areas as the center of the storm tracked just to the north and west. Some of the most significant damage there included a radio tower that collapsed and a church that was heavily damaged. In Mount Healthy, a tree crushing a house resulted in one fatality, and two others died when a tree crashed onto a motorcycle parade in Hueston Woods State Park near Oxford. A similar incident in Lorain County also resulted in the death of a young boy who was hit by a fallen tree limb. An indirect death in Hilliard was caused by electrocution while working on a generator, and another in St. Bernard was caused by a candle fire while power was out. The southern part of Michigan sustained heavy rainfall resulting in many houses being flooded, partially due to Ike and partially due to the frontal boundary.58 homes flooded in Livingston County Two deaths were reported in Michigan - both drownings, one in a ditch and one in a vehicle. Tornado warnings were also issued across Southern Michigan, for Van Buren, Kalamazoo, and Calhoun counties. A tornado was confirmed in Wayne County, resulting in localized damage associated with EF-2 force winds.http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/?n=plymouthTor ==Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York== In total, over 180,000 customers lost power as a result of the high winds in western Pennsylvania. The damage eventually resulted in a state of emergency declaration by Governor Ed Rendell. In Oil City, one death took place as a result of a fallen tree limb while outdoors. The Northern Panhandle of West Virginia also sustained high winds and hail as a result of the storm with widespread tree damage. About 32,000 customers in the region lost power, particularly around Wheeling. The high winds continued northward into Upstate New York late in the evening of September 14. Widespread damage, mostly to trees and power lines, was reported. In New York State, over 100,000 customers were reported without power. The hardest hit area was around Rochester, where over half of the outages were reported. ==Canada== Accumulations in Canada In Ontario, Ike's remnants brought a record amount of rain on Sunday, September 14, in the Windsor region. It was closely following a slow-moving frontal system that had drenched the city the day before, dumping of rain and breaking the old record of in 1979, according to Environment Canada. Most damage in the Windsor area with Ike was confined to downed power lines and toppled tree branches with the wind gusts reaching , with spotty street flooding that made driving completely treacherous in some areas. Highways were washed out in the Bruce Peninsula, and trees were uprooted in London, Ontario. The storm continued to cause wind and rain damage as it continues east along the St. Lawrence River leaving around 25,000 customers without electricity, especially in Belleville, Brockville, Bancroft, Peterborough, Bowmanville, Huntsville and Timmins. In the province of Quebec, regions to the north of the Saint Lawrence River received to of rainfall (Hautes-Laurentides, Haute-Mauricie, R√©serve faunique des Laurentides, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Charlevoix and C√¥te-Nord). Maximum rainfall was recorded between Lac-St-Jean and the R√©serve faunique des Laurentides with a station recording more than of rain Along the river, the amount were more in the and range, except in Quebec City area which received almost , most of it between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. This rain caused small inundations, storm drain overflows, and caused one major highway to close. In Montreal, high humidity levels pushed by the system caused electrical malfunction one of the lines of the subway, stranding commuters. High winds up to caused, at their worst, over 25,000 households to lose electricity in Montreal, Laval, Estrie and Mont√©r√©gie and when it reached the Magdalen Islands, it had enough strength to cause a sail boat, the Oc√©an, to sink. Its six passengers were rescued by a helicopter of the Canadian Coast Guard. The \\"Ike Spike\\" in gasoline prices was quite severe in Canada, with gas prices rising anywhere from 15 to 20 cents per liter. ==See also== *Hurricane Ike *Effects of Hurricane Ike in Texas ==References * Special section from WCPO Category:Hurricane Ike Ike Effects Ike Effects Ike Effects Ike Effects Category:2008 in North America Ike Ike inland North America ","title":"Effects of Hurricane Ike in inland North America"},{"id":"19337033","text":"Stonehaven Bay is a natural harbour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.Stonehaven History The town of Stonehaven is built along the shore of Stonehaven Bay.

He was a disciple of the third Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (also known as the Tzemach Tzedek). == Early life == Fradkin was born in Liadi, Vitebsk Region, Russian Empire (today Belarus), the city of the founder of the Chabad movement, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, after whom Rabbi Fradkin was named. The sixth Chabad Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, recalled that the local book dealer in Lubavitch would not let Fradkin see the books before purchasing them, because after flipping through the pages he had already memorized the whole book.Talk from 1931 After marrying, Fradkin traveled to study from Rabbi Eliyahu Yosef of Drivin, where he became a great scholar. He resolved not to be sustained from the position of rabbi, but after losing all his possessions, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn instructed him to apply for the position of rabbi in Polotzk, Poland, to which Fradkin was later appointed in 1855. == Rabbi Fradkin and the Rebbes of Chabad == Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn gave Fradkin an honored position among his followers, calling him a gaon, and having him take part in matters of the Beth din. He said that Rabbi Fradkin was so knowledgeable that he knew how many times the letter vav appears in the Talmud. The fifth Rebbe of Lubavitch, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, also held Fradkin in high esteem, and said of him, ‚Äúeven in the earlier generations he would have been considered a gaon!‚Äù == In Lublin == After staying in Polotzk for thirteen years, in 1868 Fradkin was appointed as rabbi of Lublin. This was a great honor, for only very few were allowed to be appointed as rabbis there. == Toras Chessed == Fradkin was a great posek, as can be seen from the testimony of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn: ‚ÄúI am busy and unable to respond ... pose the question to Rabbi Zalman of Polotzk (i.e., Rabbi Fradkin); you can rely on him.‚Äù Fradkin gathered the thousands of his responsa into his monumental work, Toras Chessed, published in two volumes (Warsaw, 1883, Jerusalem, 1909). == Demise == In the month of Adar, 5662, he declared to the astonishment of his students: ‚ÄúI can no longer tolerate this world of falsehood!‚Äù He died soon after, on 5 Nissan 5662 (1902), and is buried in the Chabad section of the Mount of Olives. == References == * ‚ÄùThe Gaon of Lublin‚Äù, Chananel, Kollel Chabad of Jerusalem. * Promoters of Torah in the World of Chassidus, vol. 2, Rabbi Aharon Soroski, Pe‚Äôer. * Chassidim Ha‚ÄôRishonim vol. 1, Yisrael Alfenbein, Kfar Chabad. == External links == * Toras Chessed Vol. 1 * Toras Chessed Vol. 2 Category:Chabad-Lubavitch rabbis Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis Category:Belarusian Orthodox rabbis Category:19th-century rabbis Category:Later Acharonim Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe Category:Hasidic rabbis in Israel Category:Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives Category:Belarusian Jews Category:1902 deaths Category:1830 births Category:Chabad-Lubavitch (Hasidic dynasty) ","title":"Shneur Zalman Fradkin"},{"id":"19337094","text":"Erzs√©bet Sz≈ënyi (2004) Erzs√©bet Sz≈ënyi (25 April 1924 ‚Äì 28 December 2019), also Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi, was a Hungarian composer and music teacher.

Bogan (1867‚Äì1936) and Katharine Nash-Bogan (1868‚Äì1958). He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1916. He served in World War I in convoy escort duty between the English Channel and Gibraltar. After the war he served on destroyers. In 1925 he trained to be a Naval Aviator. He was among the first aviators to land on an aircraft carrier. Bogan served in the Pacific during World War II and was awarded the Navy Cross, two Navy Distinguished Service Medals, and the Legion of Merit with combat V device for actions during World War II. Post‚Äìwar Bogan was promoted to vice admiral on February 2, 1946. Bogan later authored a confidential memorandum that was leaked by Captain John G. Crommelin during the Revolt of the Admirals in September 1949. His memo described the situation in the Navy as follows: \\"The morale of the Navy is lower today than at any time since I entered the commissioned ranks in 1916 ... The situation deteriorates with each press release.\\" The memorandum was endorsed in writing by Admiral Arthur W. Radford and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld. Bogan retired as a vice admiral in 1950 at age 55 rather than transfer from command of First Task Fleet in the Pacific to commander of Fleet Air at Jacksonville, a command normally filled by a Rear Admiral. Post-Navy In August 1963, Bogan was the captain of a 104-foot, $250,000, luxury yacht Freedom II when it sank in the Pacific Ocean 600 miles from California. The yacht was en route from Honolulu to San Diego. Bogan and six crew members were rescued by the submarine . According to the crew, the yacht lost a wooden plank in its hull, causing it to flood and sink, though it was unclear what caused the loss of the plank. Bogan died at Scripps Hospital in San Diego on June 8, 1973. He was survived by his wife Katherine, stepson Harold, his two sisters Eleanore and Dorothy and his brother, James.

The building is also recognized on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The neoclassical building that houses the Monongalia Arts Center was constructed in 1913 and federally owned until it was purchased in September 1975 by the Louis F. Tanner family. It was designed by Oscar Wenderoth in Classical Revival style. The building served historically as a post office, and it was known as Old Morgantown Post Office. Mabel Tanner, founder of the Morgantown Players and local art critic for over 40 years, had long since envisioned \\"a facility complete with theatre, art gallery, exhibit area, classrooms and workshop space, that would house the performing and creative arts and provide a central point from which to foster the arts and encourage their growth.\\" After her death in 1974, her family purchased the building and then established the Monongalia County Arts Association, Inc. in 1976 to begin work upon a community arts center, thus giving birth to Tanner's reverie.

It is the band's second album for Fat, following 2002's Situationist Comedy. Its recording and production took place over several years, and its release date was pushed back several times. An early internet leak of the album was the source of some controversy. ==Recording and delayed release== Dillinger Four had announced as early as June 2006 that Civil War would be released on October 31 of that year. However that August they amended the expected release date to March 2007. In November 2006 drummer Lane Pederson stated that the band were \\"working at D4 speed on a new record. About half of the songs are written.\\" A month later bassist Patrick Costello announced in an interview that the album would be released in the Spring of 2007, stating that it was being pushed back so that the band would be better prepared to tour in support of it: > We're aiming for the Spring but we‚Äôre not being that vague just because of > concerns of when the record's ready. It‚Äôs more to do with when we want to > tour. Right now it's more that Lane's having a baby and Billy might be > selling his house. Just all sorts of crazy shit like that. We're waiting to > see when would be the best time that we could leave for two and half months. The album went unreleased in the Spring and Summer of 2007, however, and guitarist Bill stated in September that the band were still working on it: > The new record is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are > gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three > vocals, which we used to do a bit more in the early days and works great, > and people always seem to want more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I > expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and > a couple songs on this one where it's a bit different than stuff we've done > before. In December 2007 guitarist Erik Funk remarked on the album's progress, stating in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Star Tribune that \\"We have a lot of stuff written and are gonna take the next few months to finish an album.\\" Months continued to pass with no release details, however, and on April 1, 2008 the music news website Punknews.org poked fun at Civil Wars long-delayed release by making a fake news post in celebration of April Fools' Day giving false cover artwork and song titles for the album. In July Dillinger Four announced that they were entering a recording studio to finish the album, and that it would be completed by August. This recording session took place at The Terrarium in Minneapolis with producer Dave Gardener. On August 19, 2008 Fat Wreck Chords posted the official cover artwork on their website and set a release date of October 14. The full track listing was subsequently listed on the band's official website and the Fat Wreck Chords website. On September 16 the band posted the song \\"Americaspremierfaithbasedinitiative\\" for listening on their Myspace profile, and on September 18 Fat Wreck Chords made the song available as a free download through their website. The full album was made available for listening in streaming media on the band's Myspace profile on October 8. In an interview with Chart magazine shortly before Civil Wars release, Funk reflected on the reasons for the long delay: > We weren't trying not to put out a record. It was just one thing after > another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, > you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you > don't put a deadline on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around > and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we > were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the > third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the > studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes > on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, we > thought it would be fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the > record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for > later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the > studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it > up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really > got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned > to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only > rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [Civil Wars songs > were written in] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were > sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these > songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together > surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy > with the results. Funk described the album as \\"all around slicker, occasionally heavier, more melodic, poppier and longer\\" than previous Dillinger Four albums. ==Internet leak controversy== An early internet leak of Civil War was a source of some controversy. Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: \\"He called me to tell me how good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews and saw that it was all over the place, so [I] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control.\\" Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil Wars recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called \\"illegal...immoral and immature.\\" He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation at about the same time as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak: > When I asked a friend who worked for Fat where they think the leak came > from, they pinpointed it to one specific person from a specific magazine > (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing > this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing > me incessantly for the past few weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I > found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly > wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so > I would not need his services. Yost subsequently fired Hale from Racket Magazine, explaining that \\"it was very obvious that this was a giant fuck up on our homeslice‚Äôs part. So...it was my decision to fire Aaron from Racket.\\" Hale responded with his version of events on his blog: > I'm sorry for whom I hurt [at Fat Wreck Chords], but the truth is...I did my > job, in a roundabout way. I got people, in a way, really hyperventilating > about a band that's been dormant for nearly a decade. In the terms of > underground music...that's nearly impossible, with so many bands worthy of > attention falling on and off the radar nearly daily. Not that this > particular band needs any help, but with years and years of taunting new > releases, new music, and then shooting them down, it became a game of \\"band > who cried album.\\" The webcomic Nothing Nice to Say satirized the internet leak of Civil War, prompting indignation from the album's producer Dave Gardener.In the wake of the controversy artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: \\"As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all.\\" Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that \\"It sucks that Mr. Hale‚Äôs decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can‚Äôt place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions.\\" Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that \\"Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; there are many people who work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you.\\" In an interview with Dillinger Four singer/guitarist Erik Funk for Alternative Press on the day before the album's release, Heisel asked what Funk thought of the controversy surrounding Civil Wars online leak. Funk replied that the band members do not have a strong stance on the issue and were surprised at the controversy: > We were surprised to see it become as big--I mean, the story became way > bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was > just about that circumstance. For us, none of us have a real strong position > against people sharing music. I mean, I think that's fine. We didn't feel > like we were getting ripped off or anything. Everything else related to it, > between that writer and his boss... [Laughs.]... Whatever else happened, I > feel like we're out of it. ==Critical reception== Critical response to Civil War was generally positive. Online retailer Interpunk.com called the album \\"worth every second of the interminable wait. From the opening note of the first track it's blatantly apparent that the guys in D4 haven‚Äôt lost a step\\". Reviewer Jason Lymangrover of Allmusic commented that the album \\"[holds] strong to their melodic punk roots, but [shows] a new, more mature side of the band. The fiery pep is still intact here, but the carefree days of 'He's a Shithead (Yeah, Yeah)' have been replaced with thoughtful lyrics dealing with social injustices...it's their most glossy, most consistent, most calm, and surprisingly, their most socially relevant album, despite their approach toward middle age on a teen-oriented punk playground.\\" Chris Fallon of Absolutepunk.net also praised the album, calling it \\"a new stitch in a damaged American flag; it's the healthy new dose of oxygen we are severely in need of in a crippled music industry starved of substance.\\" He particularly praised the band's songwriting and use of melody, stating that \\"The record is audibly more melodic than previous releases, with a focus on pop-infused choruses and hooks, all while still containing that raw focal point the band has continually reached for on past albums.\\" Maximum Rocknroll magazine coordinator Justin Briggs wrote in the December 2008 issue, \\"[...] While nothing they ever do will knock Midwestern Songs of the Americas from the position of 'DILLINGER FOUR's best album,' which is an impossible feat among impossibilities in itself, Civil War has tracks that I'd definitely put on a 'Best of DILLINGER FOUR' mixtape - quite a few, actually. [...] Just f**king buy it already.\\" Not all reviewers praised the album, however. Scott Heisel of Alternative Press gave it three out of five stars, noting that the band's extended period of inactivity did not allow them to test the new songs in front of an audience, and thus \\"the band's fourth proper full-length isn't the New Testament of beard-punk that so many Fest attendees want it to be.\\" He also remarked that their hiatus had distanced them from contemporary punk, and thus Civil War sounds dated and \\"lacks bite and innovation.\\" Heisel also felt that it did not measure up to the promise of the band's earlier work, stating that \\"While the album has bright spots, overall it feels a bit dull and without the spark that made 1998's Midwestern Songs of the Americas so fresh and exciting. With the albatross around their neck finally loosened, Dillinger Four have the talent to return with another truly great, defining punk album‚Äìhopefully it'll be before 2014.\\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club remarked that the album was \\"mostly interchangeable with its predecessors, right down to the silly samples that bookend the songs\\" and that \\"after six long years, it would've been nice for Dillinger Four to deliver something beyond more of the same\\". He did note, however, that the band's pop tendencies were more prominent than on previous releases, and that Funk's vocals were clearer, citing \\"Contemplate This on the Tree of Woe\\" and \\"Americaspremierefaithbasedinitiative\\" as strong tracks and saying that \\"Fruity Pebbles\\" \\"may be D4's most accessible song yet\\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Dillinger Four (Patrick Costello, Erik Funk, Bill , and Lane Pederson) #\\"A Jingle for the Product\\" - 3:47 #\\"'Contemplate This on the Tree of Woe.'\\" - 3:03 #\\"Parishiltonisametaphor\\" - 2:59 #\\"Gainesville\\" - 3:39 #\\"Ode to the North American Snake Oil Distributor\\" - 2:29 #\\"Minimum Wage is a Gateway Drug\\" - 2:24 #\\"The Classical Arrangement\\" - 2:24 #\\"Americaspremierefaithbasedinitiative\\" - 3:21 #\\"The Art of Whore\\" - 3:14 #\\"Fruity Pebbles\\" - 3:06 #\\"A Pyre Laid for Image and Frame\\" - 2:51 #\\"Like Eye Contact in an Elevator\\" - 3:10 #\\"Clown Cars on Cinder Blocks\\" - 3:18 ==Personnel== Performers *Patrick Costello - bass guitar, vocals *Erik Funk - vocals, guitar *Bill - guitar, vocals *Lane Pederson - drums *Jake Luck - piano intro on \\"Parishiltonisametaphor\\" Production *Produced by Dave Gardener. *Recorded and mixed by Eric Olsen and Dave Gardener at the Terrarium, Underwood and magento, Minneapolis, Minnesota. *Mastered by Dave Gardnener and Bruce Templeton at Magneto Mastering, Minneapolis, Minnesota Artwork and layout *Cover art and flags by John Grider *Layout design by Jason McShane Miller *Inside cover photo by Brian Kelleher *Live band photos by Brian Garrity ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Dillinger Four albums Category:Fat Wreck Chords albums ","title":"Civil War (album)"},{"id":"19337202","text":"Lene Marlin (born Lene Marlin Pedersen, 17 August 1980, Troms√∏, Norway) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter and musician. ==Biography== Playing My Game (1998‚Äì2002) Marlin made her Norwegian debut on 12 October 1998, with the single \\"Unforgivable Sinner\\", a number one hit for eight weeks.

It was written and directed by Jessie Nelson, in her feature film directing debut. It was the final film in which Don Ameche starred; he died shortly after filming was completed. ==Plot== The film opens in late 1950s Los Angeles at a quiet pot-luck wake for Annie Singer (Lynette Walden), who has died and left husband Manny (Ray Liotta) and daughter Molly (Tina Majorino). We meet Manny's mother Eva (Erica Yohn) and father Harry (Don Ameche) and the other characters. As friends and family leave, it is apparent that Manny is in for difficulty. Molly will no longer speak due to her mother's passing, and there is a need for a housekeeper/nanny so that Manny can return to a shaky job writing commercial jingles for his best friend and boss, Sid (Larry Miller). After one nanny washes out, Corrina Washington (Whoopi Goldberg) interviews for the position. Molly responds well to Corrina and Manny hires her. Very quickly a strong bond is formed between them. Corrina works out a system to \\"talk\\" with her without making her speak. Corrina sees the early struggles of life after Annie's passing, and Molly slowly begins to interact more with Corrina. Molly also begins to spend time with Corrina's sister and family, who take her to church and welcome her into their home. At an office party, Manny is introduced to Jenny (Wendy Crewson), a perky white divorcee with two sons. Manny is still struggling with losing Annie and is not ready to date. Corrina's sister Jevina encourages her to date a black man, Anthony, but Corrina isn't interested. A frightened Molly returns to school where she is mocked for adding Corrina to her family picture. She runs into Corrina's arms at the end of the day, desperate to go home. That night, Molly awakes from a nightmare, Corrina and Manny run to her side but she is scared and angry. Corrina tells her she is allowed to be mad. Manny admits to her how hurt he is about losing Annie and how much he misses her too. That night Jevina chastises Corrina for pretending to become a part of this family. A terrified Molly begs Corrina to let her stay home from school and she secretly agrees. Corrina spends more time with them, and she and Manny slowly discover they are more compatible with each other than anyone else. He confides in her about Annie and she talks about her long gone former husband. They share a love of music and she even assists him on his new jingle. After a successful advertising campaign, he comes home with flowers for Molly as well as Corrina. Their private celebration is interrupted by a visit from Jenny, which Corrina takes as a cue that she is not meant to stay. The next day, a flustered Corrina goes to work where Manny apologizes for Jenny's uninvited visit. As they say goodbye, they share a kiss on the cheek, which Manny's nosey neighbor sees. Corrina and Manny begin to fall in love and face prejudice as an interracial couple. Molly asks her grandfather Harry to make sure that Manny marries Corrina. That night, Corrina and Manny talk about their spouses and share a moonlight dance and kiss that is witnessed by Molly. After weeks of not attending school, Corrina thinks it's almost time for Molly to go back, but she says she's not yet ready, and Manny finds out that Corrina had been letting her skip school. In a fit of anger, he tells her that she is not Molly's mother and fires her, taking a heartbroken Molly home. Molly becomes withdrawn again, and Manny learns that Harry has died. After the funeral, he goes to visit Corrina at her house to tell her of Harry's passing and to properly apologize. After an unsuccessful talk, she overhears his not- so quiet prayers to God to help him out. She informs him that she quit and he assures her that she was replaced. They embrace and he begins to kiss her. She brings him inside to formally meet her family. The film ends with Molly singing \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" in order to cheer up Eva. Finally, she gives in and joins her in the joyful song. Soon Manny and Corrina show up and Molly joyfully runs to Corrina as the credits roll. ==Cast== * Whoopi Goldberg as Corrina Washington * Ray Liotta as Manny Singer * Tina Majorino as Molly Singer * Jenifer Lewis as Jevina Washington * Larry Miller as Sid * Joan Cusack as Jonesy * Wendy Crewson as Jenny Davis * Don Ameche as Harry Singer * Erica Yohn as Eva Singer * Lynette Walden as Annie Singer * Brent Spiner as Brent Witherspoon ==Reception== Reviews The film received mixed reviews from many film critics criticizing Nelson's failure to fully address the complications surrounding a romantic interracial relationship in the 1950s. Roger Ebert confessed that he enjoyed it but wrote, \\"...seems almost as shy as the characters about the charged issues of race and romance. After it was over I felt that, yes, it was warm and good-hearted, but there was more of a story there to be told.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the actors and actresses for their work on it but echoed a similar criticism regarding Manny and Corrina's relationship, \\"The affection between them is evident, but not even by the end of her story has Ms. Nelson decided what sort of affection it is. That may be true to life, but for an otherwise mainstream movie, it's trouble.\\" It currently holds a 39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

Typhoon Angela was the third storm in a row that struck the Philippines, following Yvette and Zack. Typhoon Angela was the twenty-ninth tropical cyclone, and the fifth super typhoon of the moderately active 1995 Pacific typhoon season. Angela caused 9.33 billion Philippine pesos in catastrophic damage across the Philippines, resulting in 882 fatalities. It was the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines in 25 years. ==Meteorological History== The monsoon trough that developed also Yvette and Zack spawned another tropical depression on October 25 in conjunction with a tropical disturbance that originated in the Marshall Islands. It moved to the west, organizing very slowly to become a tropical storm on October 26. Two days later Angela became a typhoon, and from the October 31 to November 1 Angela rapidly intensified to a super typhoon, while Japan Meteorological Agency reported that it had reached its peak wind speeds of . It maintained that intensity as it sliced westward, slamming the Philippines on November 2 as a slightly weaker typhoon. Angela continued to the west-northwest, where upper level winds caused it to dissipate on November 7 over the Gulf of Tonkin. ==Impact, records, and retirement== Angela to the east of the Philippines More than 900 people perished due to the catastrophic typhoon. It wreaked havoc over Metro Manila, Calabarzon Region and Bicol Region. Initially it caused 9.33 billion pesos of damage, but later on it grew into 10.829 billion pesos. Provinces that were under PSWS Signal #4 during the passage of Typhoon Rosing (Angela) Throughout the affected area, more than 96,000 houses were destroyed, along with bridges and roads. The worst impact was in the Southern Bicol Region. Angela passed almost right over Manila, causing a significant impact both there and in Catanduanes. In Calauag, storm surge and flooding from a dam failure killed 121 people. In nearby Paracale, mudslides killed more than a hundred people. Power outages affected one third of the country. Angela's 872 (910 according to the JMA) mbar pressure reading makes it one of the strongest typhoons on record. While this is low by the standards of any sea-level location, it is still behind Typhoon Tip, the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded. However, Angela is an unofficial contender for world's most intense tropical cyclone. In a study utilizing the Dvorak technique for analysis of post-1987 typhoons, the authors concluded that Angela and 1992's Gay were higher on the scale than Tip. The authors also thought that Angela might have been slightly more intense than Gay, and hence Tip. Angela was the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since 1970's Joan.

Leonatus' dam was the Daniel Swigert-bred Semper Felix, whose dam was by the great nineteenth- century American foundation stallion, Lexington, himself by Boston. Purchased by the partnership of Jack P. Chinn and George W. Morgan, and thereafter stabled in Mercer County, Kentucky, Leonatus was trained by African American horseman Raleigh Colston Sr. as well as by John McGinty. Leonatus raced in a new world of English \\"dash\\" races on the kind of racetracks we recognize today. ==Racing career== Racing only once as juvenile, Leonatus finished second. As a three-year-old, he won ten stakes, all in either Kentucky or Illinois, within the space of 49 days. Although there were no official awards given until 1936, Leonatus was retrospectively chosen the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse of 1883. Winning the 1883 Kentucky Derby was a major accomplishment. Carrying 105 pounds and the 2-1 favorite, Leonatus was piloted by Billy Donohue, the jockey who'd ridden Sligo in the 1881 Derby, coming in fourth. Running in mud on a clear, cold day, Leonatus was up against the colt Drake Carter, trained by Green B. Morris, who hoped to take his second consecutive Derby (he'd won with Apollo in 1882). Drake Carter leaped into the lead, but Leonatus caught him at a quarter of a mile. A quarter of a mile farther on, Leonatus was ahead by three lengths. In the homestretch, Lord Raglan made a strong bid, but though it carried him forward, he tired. Leonatus won over Drake Carter by three lengths, earning $3,760. Leonatus distinguished himself by eating the presentation roses. (Blankets of roses were not recorded being draped over the winning horse until 1896, when Ben Brush wore them.) ==Stud record== Leonatus was retired to stud at the Clay Brothers' Runnymede Farm near Paris, Kentucky. He remained there until he was eighteen years old, dying in 1898. He proved a fine sire, producing the 1898 American Derby winner Pink Coat and 1898 Suburban Handicap winner Tillo. Leonatus lies in an unmarked grave on a bend of the Elkhorn Creek that runs through Runnymeade Farm. Near him lie Hindoo, Billet, and Sir Dixon. ==References== Category:1880 racehorse births Category:1898 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Kentucky Derby winners Category:Thoroughbred family 12-b ","title":"Leonatus"},{"id":"19337307","text":"Kurt Reynolds (born 31 October 1986 in Basingstoke) is a British professional ice hockey defenceman currently without a club.

About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. Species can be arboreal, fossorial (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, chinchillas, porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils and capybaras. Rabbits, hares, and pikas, whose incisors also grow continually, were once included with them, but are now considered to be in a separate order, the Lagomorpha. Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups, sharing a single common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires. Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth. The rodent fossil record dates back to the Paleocene on the supercontinent of Laurasia. Rodents greatly diversified in the Eocene, as they spread across continents, sometimes even crossing oceans. Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa and were the only terrestrial placental mammals to reach and colonize Australia. Rodents have been used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as laboratory animals in research. Some species, in particular, the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators. == Characteristics == Drawing of typical rodent tooth system: The front surface of the incisors is hard enamel, whereas the rear is softer dentine. The act of chewing wears down the dentine, leaving a sharp, chisel-like edge. The distinguishing feature of the rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp, open-rooted incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel on the front and little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors. In many species, the molars are relatively large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups differ in the arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth to the front of the shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region. Volume rendering of a mouse skull (CT) using shear warp algorithm While the largest species, the capybara, can weigh as much as , most rodents weigh less than . The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, which averages only in head and body length, with adult females weighing only . Rodents have wide-ranging morphologies, but typically have squat bodies and short limbs. The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the forearms great flexibility. The majority of species are plantigrade, walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails. Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking, running, burrowing, climbing, bipedal hopping (kangaroo rats and hopping mice), swimming and even gliding. Scaly-tailed squirrels and flying squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide from tree to tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off. Chinchilla with its long whiskers Rodents generally have well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and vision. Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to ultraviolet light. Many species have long, sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or \\"whisking\\". Some rodents have cheek pouches, which may be lined with fur. These can be turned inside out for cleaning. In many species, the tongue cannot reach past the incisors. Rodents have efficient digestive systems, absorbing nearly 80% of ingested energy. When eating cellulose, the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum, where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements. The rodent then practices coprophagy, eating its own fecal pellets, so the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut. Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet. In many species, the penis contains a bone, the baculum; the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin. Sexual dimorphism occurs in many rodent species. In some rodents, males are larger than females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, but in the case of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males. ==Distribution and habitat== Brown rat in a flowerbox: Some rodents thrive in human habitats. One of the most widespread groups of mammals, rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat). Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts. Some species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell on the surface of the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas. Some rodents, like this North American beaver with its dam of gnawed tree trunks and the lake it has created, are considered ecosystem engineers. Though some species are common pests for humans, rodents also play important ecological roles. Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers in their respective habitats. In the Great Plains of North America, the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution, raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water. They maintain these grassland habitats, and some large herbivores such as bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage. Extirpation of prairie dogs can also contribute to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests. In many temperate regions, beavers play an essential hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers and allow for the creation of extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent increase in the number of herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations. ==Behavior and life history== Feeding Eastern chipmunk carrying food in cheek pouches Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous and a few are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers. The Texas pocket gopher avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items. Agouti species are one of the few animal groups that can break open the large capsules of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow. Capybara grazing A strategy for dealing with seasonal plenty is to eat as much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over. Although rodents have been regarded traditionally as herbivores, a number of species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and a few members of the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter. More specialized carnivores include the shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, and other small mice, and only a small part of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself. Social behavior Prairie dog \\"town\\" Rodents exhibit a wide range of types of social behavior ranging from the mammalian caste system of the naked mole-rat, the extensive \\"town\\" of the colonial prairie dog, through family groups to the independent, solitary life of the edible dormouse. Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in individual nests and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory. Larger rodents tend to live in family units where parents and their offspring live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically with a pair of adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities. A nest of naked mole rats Among the most social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which typically form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The black-tailed prairie dog forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders. Perhaps the most extreme examples of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, while the rest of the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own. Communication Olfactory Nepotistic species such as house mice rely on urine, feces and glandular secretions to recognize their kin. Rodents use scent marking in many social contexts including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails and the establishment of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent- marking behavior. Rodents are able to recognize close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs. House mice deposit urine, which contains pheromones, for territorial marking, individual and group recognition, and social organization. Territorial beavers and red squirrels investigate and become familiar with the scents of their neighbors and respond less aggressively to intrusions by them than to those made by non-territorial \\"floaters\\" or strangers. This is known as the \\"dear enemy effect\\". Auditory Common degus have a complex vocal repertoire. Many rodent species, particularly those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call. Social rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen different call- types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles. Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other. House mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest. Marmot whistling Laboratory rats (which are brown rats, Rattus norvegicus) emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine doses of morphine, during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct \\"chirping\\", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so bat detectors have been used for this purpose. Visual Rodents, like all placental mammals except primates, have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina, a short wavelength \\"blue- UV\\" type and a middle wavelength \\"green\\" type. They are therefore classified as dichromats; however, they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not. The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear. In degus, for example, the belly reflects more UV light than the back. Therefore, when a degu stands up on its hind legs, which it does when alarmed, it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm. When it stands on all fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators. Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night. There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours. Many rodents are active during twilight hours (crepuscular activity), and UV-sensitivity would be advantageous at these times. Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents. The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) strongly reflects UV light and this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes. Tactile Middle East blind mole rat uses seismic communication. Vibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviors being performed, predator warning and avoidance, herd or group maintenance, and courtship. The Middle East blind mole rat was the first mammal for which seismic communication was documented. These fossorial rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels. This behavior was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behavior, but it was eventually realized that they generate temporally patterned seismic signals for long-distance communication with neighboring mole rats. Footdrumming is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat. Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals. Mating strategies The Cape ground squirrel is an example of a promiscuous rodent. Some species of rodent are monogamous, with an adult male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity. In polygynous species, males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots, California ground squirrels, Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels. Males with territories are known as \\"resident\\" males and the females that live within the territories are known as \\"resident\\" females. In the case of marmots, resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species. A mating plug in a female Richardson's ground squirrel Promiscuity, in which both males and females mate with multiple partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity. Female rodents play an active role in choosing their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males. In most rodent species, such as brown rats and house mice, ovulation occurs on a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours. Birth and parenting Young bank voles in their nest beneath a wood pile Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and relatively underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, eyes open and fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned. In precocial species, the mothers invest little in nest building and some do not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time in the nest than those with larger litters. Two Patagonian maras with young, an example of a monogamous and communal nesting species Mother rodents provide both direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, retrieving and huddling, and indirect parenting, such as food caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse. Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort. Intelligence Kangaroo rats can locate food caches by spatial memory. Rodents have advanced cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, which makes them difficult pests to deal with. Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food. Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by spatial memory, rather than just by smell. Because laboratory mice (house mice) and rats (brown rats) are widely used as scientific models to further our understanding of biology, a great deal has come to be known about their cognitive capacities. Brown rats exhibit cognitive bias, where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state. For example, laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward, and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock, are more likely to respond to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled (something they enjoy), indicating \\"a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model.\\" Laboratory (brown) rats may have the capacity for metacognition‚Äîto consider their own learning and then make decisions based on what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates known to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model. Brown rats use social learning in a wide range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences. == Classification and evolution == Evolutionary history Masillamys sp. fossil from the Eocene Messel Pit fossil site, Germany Dentition is the key feature by which fossil rodents are recognized and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record. Rodents are thought to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were severely affected by the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were able to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years. The history of the colonization of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The movements of the large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia. The horned gopher Ceratogaulus hatcheri, a burrowing mammal of the late Miocene to early Pleistocene, is the only known horned rodent. During the Eocene, rodents began to diversify. Beavers appeared in Eurasia in the late Eocene before spreading to North America in the late Miocene. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) colonized South America, which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least as early as this for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America. Nesomyid rodents are thought to have rafted from Africa to Madagascar 20‚Äì24 million years ago. All 27 species of native Malagasy rodents appear to be descendants of a single colonization event. By 20 million years ago, fossils recognizably belonging to the current families such as Muridae had emerged. By the Miocene, when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia. Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, which grew to a length of and weight of . The largest known rodent was Josephoartigasia monesi, a pacarana with an estimated body length of 3 m (10 ft). The first rodents arrived in Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago. Although marsupials are the most prominent mammals in Australia, many rodents, all belonging to the subfamily Murinae, are among the continent's mammal species. There are about fifty species of 'old endemics', the first wave of rodents to colonize the country in the Miocene and early Pliocene, and eight true rat (Rattus) species of 'new endemics', arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The earliest fossil rodents in Australia have a maximum age of 4.5 million years, and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification. A further wave of adaptive radiation occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later. Rodents participated in the Great American Interchange that resulted from the joining of the Americas by formation of the Isthmus of Panama, around 3 million years ago in the Piacenzian age. In this exchange, a small number of species such as the New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) headed north. However, the main southward invasion of sigmodontines preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years, probably occurring via rafting. Sigmodontines diversified explosively once in South America, although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization. Their \\"head start\\" has relegated other North American rodent groups (sciurids, geomyids, heteromyids and nonsigmodontine cricetids) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna.  Standard classification  The use of the order name \\"Rodentia\\" is attributed to the English traveler and naturalist Thomas Edward Bowdich (1821). The Modern Latin word is derived from , present participle of ‚Äì \\"to gnaw\\", \\"eat away\\". The hares, rabbits and pikas (order Lagomorpha) have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order. However, they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories. The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the clades Glires, Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria. The cladogram below shows the inner and outer relations of Rodentia based on a 2012 attempt by Wu et al. to align the molecular clock with paleontological data: The living rodent families based on the study done by Fabre et al. 2012. { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%; border:solid 1px #aaa\\" - ! F0F2F5\\"  Rodentia classification -  } The order Rodentia may be divided into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There is a great deal of parallelism and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders. These disagreements remain unresolved, nor have molecular studies fully resolved the situation though they have confirmed the monophyly of the group and that the clade has descended from a common Paleocene ancestor. Carleton and Musser (2005) in Mammal Species of the World have provisionally adopted a five suborder system: Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha, and Hystricomorpha. These include 33 families, 481 genera and 2277 species.

Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots. Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species. In Colombia, the brown hairy dwarf porcupine was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the red crested soft-furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable. The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes \\"We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened, mainly by environmental disturbance and intensive hunting\\". The \\"three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species\\" 3‚Äì5 March 1992 (the brown rat, the black rat and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum. This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.  Exploitation  Chinchilla fur coat, exhibited at the 1900 Exposition Universelle, Paris Humanity has long used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur provides extra insulation. The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them together to make robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as \\"beaver wool\\" was found to be ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. Later, the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the Native American \\"porky roach\\" headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.  Consumption  At least 89 species of rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, there were at least 42 different societies in which people eat rats. Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire. Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called \\"gliraria\\", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns. The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take. Guinea pigs are used in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The traditional Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fog√≥n, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and groundhogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.  Animal testing  Laboratory house mouse Rodents are used widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for research in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is the most commonly used laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, √âmile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times‚Äîfirst by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain. Rodents have sensitive olfactory abilities, which have been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.  As pets  Rodents including guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets able to live in small spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.  As pests and disease vectors  Rodents cause significant losses to crops, such as these potatoes damaged by voles. Some rodent species are serious agricultural pests, eating large quantities of food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated to be enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by a relatively small number of species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers. Rodents are also significant vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents also help to transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus. Rodent Bait Station, Chennai, India Because rodents are a nuisance and endanger public health, human societies often attempt to control them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law. ==See also== * Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, mice who orbited the Moon on Apollo 17 * Mouse models of breast cancer metastasis == References  Further reading == * * ** Carleton, M.

It is most often rendered as \\"ladyboy\\" in English conversation, an expression that has become popular across Southeast Asia. == General description == Although kathoey is often translated as 'transgender woman' in English, this term is not correct in Thailand. As well as transgender people, the term can refer to gay men, and was originally used to refer to intersex people. Before the 1960s, the use of kathoey included anyone who deviated from the dominant sexual norms. Because of this confusion in translation, the English translation of kathoey is usually 'ladyboy' (or variants of the term). Use of the term kathoey suggests that the person self-identifies as a type of male, in contrast to sao praphet song (which, like \\"trans woman\\", suggests a \\"female\\" (sao) identity), and in contrast to phet thi sam ('third sex'). The term phu ying praphet song, which can be translated as 'second-type female', is also used to refer to kathoey. Australian scholar of sexual politics in Thailand Peter Jackson claims that the term kathoey was used in antiquity to refer to intersex people, and that the connotation changed in the mid-20th century to cover cross-dressing males.Jackson, Peter (2003). Performative Genders, Perverse Desires: A Bio- History of Thailand's Same-Sex and Transgender Cultures in \\"Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context,\\" Issue 9, August 2003. See paragraph \\"The Homosexualisation of Cross-Dressing.\\" Kathoey became an iconic symbol of modern Thai culture.Winter, Sam. Queer Bangkok: Twenty-first Century Markets, Media, and Rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011 The term can refer to males who exhibit varying degrees of femininity. Many dress as women and undergo \\"feminising\\" medical procedures such as breast implants, hormones, silicone injections, or Adam's apple reductions. Others may wear make-up and use feminine pronouns, but dress masculinely, and are closer to the Western category of effeminate gay man than transgender. The term kathoey may be considered pejorative, especially in the form kathoey-saloey. It has a meaning similar to the English language 'fairy' or 'queen'.CPAmedia.com: Thailand's Women of the Second Kind (archive) Kathoey can also be seen as a derogatory word for those who self-identify as gay.  Religion  Bunmi, a Thai Buddhist author, believes that homosexuality stems from \\"lower level spirits\\" (phi-sang-thewada), a factor that is influenced by one's past life. Some Buddhists view kathoeys as persons born with a disability as a consequence of past sins.. == Requirements to confirm eligibility for gender- affirming surgery == In 1965, Johns Hopkins Hospital in the US became the first institution to perform sex-reassignment surgery.News-Letter, The. \\"The News-Letter.\\" Since 1896. N.p., 1 May 2014. 15 March 2017. Today, in cities such as Bangkok, there are two to three gender-affirming surgery (GAS) operations per week, more than 3,500 over the past thirty years. With the massive increase in GASs, there has also been an increase in prerequisites, measures that must be taken in order to be eligible for the operation. Patients must be at least 18 years old with permission from parents if under 20 years old.Duncan, Debbie. \\"Prerequisites - The Transgender Center.\\" Prerequisites - The Transgender Center. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 March 2017. One must provide evidence of diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychologist or psychiatrist. Before going through gender reassignment surgery, one must be on hormones/antiandrogens for at least one year. Patients must have a note from the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. Two months prior to the surgery, patients are required to see a psychiatrist in Thailand to confirm eligibility for gender-affirming surgery. == Social context == Many kathoey work in predominately female occupations, such as in shops, restaurants, and beauty salons, but also in factories (a reflection of Thailand's high proportion of female industrial workers).Winter S, Udomsak N (2002). Male, Female and Transgender: Stereotypes and Self in Thailand . International Journal of Transgenderism. 6,1 Kathoey also work in entertainment and tourist centres, in cabarets, and as prostitutes. Sadly, Kathoey prostitutes have high rates of H.I.V. Kathoeys are more visible and more accepted in Thai culture than transgender people are in other countries in the world. Several popular Thai models, singers and movie stars are kathoeys, and Thai newspapers often print photographs of the winners of female and kathoey beauty contests side by side. The phenomenon is not restricted to urban areas; there are kathoeys in most villages, and kathoey beauty contests are commonly held as part of local fairs. Using the notion of karma, some Thais believe that being a kathoey is the result of transgressions in past lives, concluding that kathoey deserve pity rather than blame. A common stereotype is that older, well-off kathoey provide financial support to young men with whom they are in romantic relationships.Thailand , in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, Volume I‚ÄìIV 1997‚Äì2001, edited by Robert T. Francoeur Kathoeys currently face many social and legal impediments. Families (and especially fathers) are typically disappointed if a child becomes a kathoey, and kathoeys often have to face the prospect of disclosing their birth gender. However, kathoey generally have greater acceptance in Thailand than most other East Asian countries..

Findings, Controversies, and Perspectives. De Gruyter, Berlin and Boston 2016, pp. 219‚Äì232. Legal recognition of kathoeys and transgender people is nonexistent in Thailand: even if a transgender person has had genital reassignment surgery, they are not allowed to change their legal sex. Discrimination in employment also remains rampant.Are you man enough to be a woman? Bangkok Post, 1 October 2007 Problems can also arise in regards to access to amenities and gender allocation; for example, a kathoey and a person who has undergone sexual reassignment surgery would still have to stay in an all-male prison. == Performance ==  Representation in cinema  Kathoeys began to gain prominence in the cinema of Thailand during the late-1980s. The depiction at first was negative by showing kathoeys suffering bad karma, suicide, and abandoned by straight lovers.√únaldim Serhat. Queer Bangkok: twenty-first- century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print. Independent and experimental films contributed to defying sexual norms in gay cinema in the 1990s. The 2000 film, The Iron Ladies, directed by Yongyoot Thongkongtoon, depicted a positive portrayal of an almost entirely kathoey volleyball team by displaying their confidence. The rising middle- class in Bangkok and vernacular queer culture made the mainstream portrayal of kathoeys more popular on television and in art house cinemas.  Miss Tiffany's Universe  Feminine beauty in Thailand allowed transgender people to have their own platform where they are able to challenge stereotypes and claim cultural recognition.Jackson, Peter A. Queer Bangkok: twenty-first- century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011 Miss Tiffany's Universe is a beauty contest that is opened to all transgender women.Mailonline, Flora Drury For. \\"Sequins, spangles and tiaras: The beauty pageant full of gorgeous women with a shocking surprise ‚Äì they were all born men.\\" Daily Mail Online. Associated Newspapers, 13 January 2016. Web. 18 March 2017. Beginning in 1998, the pageant takes place every year in Pattaya, Thailand during May. With over 100 applicants, the pageant is considered to be one of the most popular transgender pageants in the world. Through beauty pageants, Thailand has been able to promote the country's cosmetic surgery industry, which has had a massive increase in medical tourism for sex reassignment surgery. According to the Miss Tiffany's Universe website, the live broadcast attracts record of fifteen million viewers. The winner of the pageant receives a tiara, sash, car, grand prize of 100,000 baht (US$3,000), equivalent to an annual wage for a Thai factory worker.\\"How starring in Miss Tiffany's pageant show can change a Thai trans beauty queen's life.\\" South China Morning Post. N.p., 28 April 2016. Web. 5 March 2017. The assistant manager director, Alisa Phanthusak, stated that the pageant wants kathoeys to be visible and to treat them as normal.Yeung, Isobel. \\"Trans in Thailand (Part 1).\\" VICE Video. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 April 2017. It is the biggest annual event in Pattaya.Yeung, Isobel. \\"Trans in Thailand (Part 2).\\" VICE Video. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 April 2017. Transgender beauty contests are found in the countryside at village fairs or festivals. All-male revues are common in gay bars in Bangkok and as drag shows in the tourist resort of Pattaya. == Recent developments == Kathoey working in a go-go bar in Bangkok's Nana Plaza entertainment area In 1993, Thailand's teacher training colleges implemented a semi-formal ban on allowing homosexual (which included kathoey) students enrolling in courses leading to qualification for positions in kindergartens and primary schools. In January 1997, the Rajabhat Institutes (the governing body of the colleges) announced it would formalize the ban, which would extend to all campuses at the start of the 1997 academic year. The ban was quietly rescinded later in the year, following the replacement of the Minister of Education. In 1996, a volleyball team composed mostly of gays and kathoeys, known as The Iron Ladies (, satree lek), later portrayed in two Thai movies, won the Thai national championship. The Thai government, concerned with the country's image, barred two of the kathoeys from joining the national team and competing internationally. Among the most famous kathoeys in Thailand is Nong Tum, a former champion Thai boxer who emerged into the public eye in 1998. She would present in a feminine manner and had commenced hormone therapy while still a popular boxer; she would enter the ring with long hair and make- up, occasionally kissing a defeated opponent. She announced her retirement from professional boxing in 1999 ‚Äì undergoing genital reassignment surgery, while continuing to work as a coach, and taking up acting and modeling. She returned to boxing in 2006. In 2004, the Chiang Mai Technology School allocated a separate restroom for kathoeys, with an intertwined male and female symbol on the door. The fifteen kathoey students are required to wear male clothing at school but are allowed to sport feminine hairdos. The restroom features four stalls, but no urinals.\\"Transvestites Get Their Own School Bathroom\\", Associated Press, 22 June 2004. Following the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat, kathoeys are hoping for a new third sex to be added to passports and other official documents in a proposed new constitution.\\"Thailand's 'third sex' seeks legal recognition\\" . The First Post. 17 May 2007. In 2007, legislative efforts have begun to allow kathoeys to change their legal sex if they have undergone genital reassignment surgery; this latter restriction was controversially discussed in the community. Bell Nuntita, a contestant of the Thailand's Got Talent TV show, became a YouTube hit when she first performed singing as a girl and then switched to a masculine voice. It is estimated that as many as six in every thousand native males later present themselves as transgender women or phu ying kham phet. == Advocacy ==  Activism  Thai activists have mobilized for over two decades to secure sexual diversity rights. Beauty pageant winner Yollada Suanyot, known as Nok, founded the Trans Female Association of Thailand on the basis of changing sex-designation on identification cards for post-operative transsexual women. Nok promoted the term phuying kham-phet instead of kathoey but was controversial because of its connotation with gender identity disease. The goal of the Thai Transgender Alliance is to delist gender dysphoria from international psychological diagnostic criteria and uses the term kathoey to advocate for transgender identity. A common protest sign during sexual rights marches is Kathoey mai chai rok-jit meaning \\"Kathoey are not mentally ill\\". Activism in Thailand is discouraged if it interferes with official policy.Cameron, Liz. \\"Sexual Health and Rights Sex Workers, Transgender People & Men Who have Sex with Men.\\" OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE Public Health Program(2006): n. page. Web. 24 March 2017. In January 2006, the Thai Network of People Living With HIV/AIDS had their offices raided after demonstrations against Thai-US foreign trade agreements. Under the Thai Constitution of 1997, the right to be free of discrimination based on health conditions helped to minimize the stigma against communities living with HIV/AIDS. In most cases, governments and their agencies fail to protect transgender people against these exclusions. There is a lack of HIV/AIDS services for specifically transgender people and feminizing hormones largely go without any medical monitoring. Trans prejudice has produced discriminatory behaviors that have led to the exclusion of transgender people from economic and social activity.Sam Winter. Queer Bangkok: twenty-first- century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print. World-wide, transgender people face discrimination amongst family members, religious settings, education, and the work-place. Accepted mainly in fashion-related jobs or show business, people who are transgender are discriminated against in the job market and have limited job opportunities. Kathoeys have also experienced ridicule from coworkers and tend to have lower salaries. Long-term unemployment reduces the chances of contributing to welfare for the family and lowers self-esteem, causing a higher likelihood of prostitution in specialized ladyboy bars. \\"Ladyboy\\" bars also can provide a sense of community and reinforces a female sense of identity for kathoeys. Harassment from the police is evident especially for kathoeys who work on the streets. Kathoeys may be rejected in official contexts being rejected entry or services. Based on a study by AIDS Care participants who identified as a girl or kathoey at an early age were more likely to be exposed to prejudice or violence from men in their families. Kathoeys are more subjected to sexual attacks from men than are other homosexuals. Anjaree is one of Thailand's gay feminist organizations, established in mid-1986 by women's right activists.Megan Sinnott. Queer Bangkok: twenty-first-century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print. The organization advocated wider public understanding of homosexuality based on the principles of human rights. The first public campaign opposing sexual irregularity was launched in 1996.Douglas Sanders. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print. Social spaces are often limited for kathoeys even if Thai society does not actively persecute them. Indigenous Thai cultural traditions have given a social space for sexual minorities. In January 2015, the Thai government announced it would recognize the third sex in its constitution in order to ensure all sexes be treated equally under the law.  Privacy issues  Identity cards are particularly important in Thailand. The vast majority of transgender people in the country were unable to change their documents at all, and those who are able to were held to rather severe standards. Identity cards facilitate many daily activities such as interface with businesses, bureaucratic agencies (i.e., signing up for educational courses or medical care), law enforcement, etc. Impeded by these identity cards on a daily basis, transsexuals are \\"outed\\" by society. The requirement facilitated by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (I.C.C.P.R.) that does not offer transgender people the opportunity to change their personal documentation remains as a threat to privacy for the transgender community in Thailand. There is no question that the country's rigid bureaucratic rules are still adjusting to incorporate transgender rights.  Military draft  Transgender individuals were automatically exempted from compulsory military service in Thailand. Kathoeys were deemed to suffer from \\"mental illness\\" or \\"permanent mental disorder\\".Douglas Sanders. Queer Bangkok: twenty-first-century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print. These mental disorders were required to appear on their military service documents, which are accessible to future employers. In 2006, the Thai National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) overturned the use of discriminatory phraseology in Thailand's military service exemption documents. With Thai law banning citizens from changing their sex on their identification documents, everyone under the male category must attend a \\"lottery day\\" where they are randomly selected to enlist in the army for two years.Mailonline, Kelly Mclaughlin For. \\"Transsexuals are forced to stand in line for army conscription in dresses and skirts as 100,000 21-year-old men are drafted into the Thai military.\\" Daily Mail Online. Associated Newspapers, 5 April 2017. Web. 1 April 2017. In March 2008, the military added a \\"third category\\" for transgender people that dismissed them from service due to \\"illness that cannot be cured within 30 days\\". == In popular culture == The first all-kathoey music group in Thailand was formed in 2006. It is named \\"Venus Flytrap\\" and was selected and promoted by Sony BMG Music Entertainment.\\"'Katoeys' hit the music scene\\" , The Star, 3 February 2007. \\"The Lady Boys of Bangkok\\" is a kathoey revue that has been performed in the UK since 1998, touring the country in both theatres and the famous \\"Sabai Pavilion\\" for nine months each year. Ladyboys, also a popular term used in Thailand when referring to transgender women, was the title of a popular documentary in the United Kingdom, where it was aired on Channel 4 TV in 1992 and was directed by Jeremy Marre. Marre aimed to portray the life of two adolescent kathoeys living in rural Thailand, as they strove to land a job at a cabaret revue in Pattaya. The German-Swedish band Lindemann wrote the song \\"Ladyboy\\", on their first studio album Skills in Pills, about a man's preference for kathoeys. In the TV series I'm Alan Partridge, the protagonist regularly mentions ladyboys, seemingly expressing a sexual interest in them. Thai kathoey style and fashion has largely borrowed from Korean popular culture.  \\"Uncle Go Paknam\\"  \\"Uncle Go Paknam\\", created by Pratchaya Phanthathorn, is a popular non-heterosexual advice column that first appeared in 1975 in a magazine titled Plaek, meaning 'strange'.Jackson, Peter A. First Queer Voices from Thailand: Uncle Go's Advice Columns for Gays, Lesbians and Kathoeys. Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2016. Print. Through letters and responses it became an outlet to express the desires and necessities of the non-heterosexual community in Thailand. The magazine achieved national popularity because of its bizarre and often gay content. It portrayed positive accounts of kathoeys and men called \\"sharks\\" to view transgender people as legitimate or even preferred sexual partners and started a more accepting public discourse in Thailand. Under the pen name of Phan Thathron he wrote the column \\"Girls to the Power of 2\\" that included profiles of kathoeys in a glamorous or erotic pose. \\"Girls to the Power of 2\\" were the first accounts of kathoey lives based on interviews that allowed their voices to be published in the mainstream press of Thailand. The heterosexual public became more inclined to read about transgender communities that were previously given negative press in Thai newspapers. Go Paknam's philosophy was \\"kathoeys are good (for men).\\"  Inside Thailand's Third Gender  A documentary entitled Inside Thailand's Third Gender examines the lives of ladyboys in Thailand and features interviews with various transgender women, the obstacles these people face with their family and lovers, but moreover on a larger societal aspect where they feel ostracized by the religious Thai culture. Following contestants participating in one of the largest transgender beauty pageants, known as Miss Tiffany's Universe, the film not only illustrates the process and competition that takes place during the beauty pageant, but also highlights the systems of oppression that take place to target the transgender community in Thailand. == See also == * Bakla - equivalent of Homosexual in Philippines * Kothi (gender) * Bahasa Binan * Femminiello * Gender Identities in Thailand * Hijra (South Asia) * Muxe * Tamil Sexual Minorities * Pandaka * Travesti * Waria * List of transgender-related topics *LGBT rights in Thailand *Miss Gay Philippines *Anjaree *MƒÅh≈´ *Two-spirit ==References * Andrew Matzner, In Legal Limbo: Thailand, Transgender Men, and the Law, 1999.

She was also the Deputy Prime Minister of Romania. ==Background== She was born Lenu»õa Petrescu into a peasant family in Petre»ôti commune, D√¢mbovi»õa County, in the historical region of Wallachia. Her father worked as a ploughman. She was able to acquire only an elementary school level education. After elementary school, she moved along with her brother to Bucharest, where she worked as a laboratory assistant before finding employment in a textile factory. She joined the Bucharest branch of the Romanian Communist Party in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Ceau»ôescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him never look at another woman in a romantic manner. Their relationship was interrupted by Ceau»ôescu's frequent stints in prison, and they married on 23 December 1947. ==Career in government== Elena Ceau»ôescu receiving an honorary doctorate in Manila (1975). After the Communists took power, Elena Ceau»ôescu worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was an unimportant figure until her husband became Communist Party General Secretary. Starting in July 1972, Elena Ceau»ôescu was given various offices at senior levels in the Romanian Communist Party. In June 1973, she became a member of the Politburo of the Romanian Communist Party, becoming the second most important and influential person after her husband. She was deeply involved in party administration alongside her husband, and was one of the few spouses of a Communist Party leader to have a high political profile of her own. Elena Ceau»ôescu frequently accompanied her husband on official visits abroad. During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in June 1971, she took note of how Jiang Qing, Chairman Mao Zedong's wife, maintained a position of power. Most likely inspired by this, she began to engineer her own political rise in Romania. In July 1971, after a mini-cultural revolution launched by her husband, she was elected a member of the Central Commission on Socio-Economic Forecasting, and in July 1972, she became a full member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee. In June 1973, after having been nominated by Emil BodnƒÉra»ô, she was elected to the party's executive committee. In November 1974, at the 11th Party Congress, she was made a member of the (renamed) political executive committee, and in January 1977, she became a member of the highest party body, the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee. In March 1975, she was elected to the Great National Assembly, the country's national legislature, holding the seat for Pite»ôti, Arges County, the most important industrial region of the country, until her death in 1989. In March 1980, she was made a First Deputy Prime Minister, a state title she held until she was executed in the Romanian Revolution.Enhanced Personality Cult for Elena Ceausescu 1986-1-8 Elena and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu with Emperor Hirohito during a visit in Tokyo in 1975 From the early 1980s onward, Elena was the object of a personality cult as intense as that of her husband, which exalted her as the \\"Mother of the Nation\\". By all accounts, her vanity and desire for honours exceeded that of her husband. As with her husband, Romanian Television was under strict orders to take great care portraying her on screen. For instance, she was never supposed to be shown in profile because of her large nose and overall homely appearance. ==Fall from power== Ceau»ôescu fled with her husband on 22 December 1989, after the events in Timi»ôoara led to the Romanian Revolution, but she and her husband were captured in the town of T√¢rgovi»ôte. At the show trial that took place, she answered only a few questions since her husband took a protective role, asked her to calm down and shook his head each time her mouth opened to reply in anger. ==Execution== On the afternoon of 25 December 1989 in T√¢rgovi»ôte, they were turned over to a firing squad and executed. Her arms, and those of her husband, were tied behind their backs. Their actual execution was not filmed in time ‚Äì the firing squad was in a hurry to carry out the sentence ‚Äì but the aftermath, including echoes of the final volley, the pall of smoke, and the bodies immediately afterward, were caught on camera. She was 73 years old.Juan J.

Elena Ceau»ôescu was buried in Ghencea Cemetery. ==Reputation as a chemistry researcher== After graduating from primary school in her village and moving to Bucharest, Ceau»ôescu attempted to continue her education through night courses, but allegedly was expelled after being caught cheating. During the communist period she was promoted as a scientist, and was also awarded a PhD in chemistry. PiesƒÉ rarƒÉ: teza de doctorat a Elenei Ceau≈üescu (\\"Unique: the PhD Thesis of Elena Ceau≈üescu\\") , in G√¢ndul, 26 March 2007 In 1957, she was a research scientist at ICECHIM (National Institute for Chemical Research). In the early 1960s, she was reported to be secretary of the party committee of the Bucharest Central Institute of Chemical Researches, and when her husband took over the party leadership in March 1965, she was listed as the institute's director. In December of the same year, she was elected a member of the newly established National Council of Scientific Research, and in September 1966, she was awarded the Order of Scientific Merit First Class.Ren√© de Flers, \\"Biographical Sketches of the Ceausescu Clan.\\" (RAD Background Report/135 (Romania); 27 July 1984) Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Background Reports, p.4. Open Society Archives of Central European University . In March 1974, she was made a member of the Romanian Academy's Section for Chemical Sciences. Ceau»ôescu was given many honorary awards for scientific achievement in the field of polymer chemistry during the period when her husband ruled Romania. She is named as co-inventor on a number of patents. After the Revolutions of 1989, several scientists have claimed that Ceau»ôescu had forced them to write papers in her name.https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22E.+Ceau%C8%99escu%22&btnG;=&hl;=en&as;_sdt=0%2C44 Elena Ceau»ôescu on Google Scholar Claims also have arisen that the university gave her the honour of the doctorate solely because of her political position. According to a 1984 report by Radio Free Europe: \\"It is rumored that, at the time when she wanted to receive her doctorate from the Bucharest Faculty of Chemistry, she met with strong opposition from the Romanian chemist Costin D. Nenitescu, the dean of the faculty. She was forced instead to present her thesis to Cristofor Simionescu and Ioan Ursu at the University of Iasi, where she met with complete success.\\" In summary, to quote from an article on plagiarism in the leading scientific journal Nature: She was sometimes nicknamed Codoi, referring to her alleged mispronunciation of the name of the chemical compound CO (C for carbon, O for oxygen, and \\"\\" being Romanian for \\"two\\"). She was mocked by many, including an official who called her by this nickname during her show trial.Trecutul de langa noi, Lumea. nr. 10 Jela, Doina.

She is sly, rebellious, outgoing, and usually underachieves when it comes to school. She often gets into trouble because of her constant schemes (usually involving magic). She is part Latina and part Italian. Even though she is infamously known for doing the worst in wizard studies and school, and relentlessly torments her older brother Justin, Alex becomes much more mature throughout the series. Although she's somewhat lazy, Alex is smart, loyal, and caring. She goes through a long-term relationship with Mason Greyback, a purebred werewolf. She becomes the Russo family wizard at the end of the series. Usually, her mom calls her \\"m'ija\\", which is Spanish for \\"my daughter\\", and Alex cannot stand it. Justin Russo Justin Vincenzo Pep√© Russo (David Henrie) is Alex's and Max's brother, and the oldest of the three Russo siblings. He is very smart, and is often considered a nerd. He is in numerous clubs and has learned over 5000 spells. He continues his wizard studies in a Monster Hunting course. For his knowledge in wizardry, he takes after his father Jerry, who originally won the Wizard Family Competition against Kelbo and Megan. Unlike Alex, he is an overachiever when it comes to school. He is fairly athletic, and very respectful to his parents and other adults. Justin is responsible, sensible, kindhearted and hardworking, but can be a little sarcastic to Alex and Max. He revealed to Alex that he is jealous of her because he felt she is blessed with magic skills that he can't live up to, and it's reinforced when he refers to Alex as \\"daddy's little princess\\" (a unique, and often favoring, bond between a father and daughter). This is what drives him to be a better wizard. Alex consoles him by stating that he is her rock and foundation, and that she is actually jealous of his academic achievements, even though she openly admits to not caring about school. He has a long-term relationship with Juliet Van Heusen, a teenage vampire whose family runs the \\"Late Night Bite\\" (local competition for the Waverly Sub Station), which prompted a feud between the Russos and the Van Heusens. At first, their love is a forbidden romance, which Alex points out by referencing William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but then they eventually start dating openly. Justin reveals to Alex that Juliet is his true love, after he felt heartbroken about being unable to see her due to the feuding families. Justin gets heartbroken again when Juliet was forced to break up with him due to her getting scratched by Mason the werewolf, as she stated that when that happens a vampire's appearance will revert to their true age. Later in the series, Alex tells the world that they are wizards and her and Justin's levels move down, so he makes a class with students who got kicked out of WizTech and later falls in love with an angel named Rosie. At first, it seems that Justin won the Wizard Competition after being the first to cross the finish line, and he was about to be granted his full powers, when he says that he can't accept it because he didn't really win; Alex would have won if she hadn't come to back to help him, and he says that she deserves to be the Russo family wizard. Because of his honesty, Professor Crumbs allows both Justin and Alex to keep their powers and for Justin to take over as Headmaster of Wiz Tech. Later in the series he reconciles with Juliet after she regains her youthful appearance. Max Russo Maximilian Alonzo Ernesto \\"Max\\" Russo (Jake T. Austin) is the youngest of the three Russo siblings. Alex and Justin's magic are more advanced than Max's (as shown by the wands). Although he is an underachiever in the beginning, he advances more during the series. At first, he does not seem to be very bright, but this is later revealed to be due to a lack of focus and a short attention span, as he becomes an A+ model student when their school introduces uniforms, claiming it helps him focus. Alex and Justin are embarrassed and annoyed by his lack of intelligence, but they do occasionally take advantage of it, for example: When they tried to lure in a Genie back to her lamp, Alex suggested that after the Genie outsmarted them, they might be able to out-dumb her, and immediately asked Max what he'd do to get her back to grant him a wish. The Genie eventually allows him a wish, to which he responded with describing his appearance, which prompted the Genie to unintentionally reveal that there is a reset-button. He once revealed to Juliet, that he uses \\"randomness\\" to allow others to inadvertently reveal their true thoughts and feelings to him, though he later admitted that he still has no idea what is going on around him. He is very fond of skateboards. In the episode \\"Three Maxes and a Little Lady\\", Justin and Alex fall behind in the Wizard Competition, and Max gets a wish, which he uses to wish for the Wizard Competition to begin that day. However, both Alex and Justin use magic to turn into Max and reverse The Wish, to no avail. Max eventually decides to bump back the Wizard Competition; however, Alex and Justin cross spells and turn Max into Maxine, a girl version of him. In \\"Who Will be the Family Wizard\\", Max's powers are taken away, but Jerry and Teresa decide to give him The Sub Station, much to his happiness. Personality wise, Max takes after his Uncle Kelbo. Max is played by Jake T. Austin (also Bailee Madison as Maxine in season four). Harper Finkle Harper Rosanne Evans Finkle (Jennifer Stone) is best friends with Alex Russo, and always used to have a crush on her brother, Justin Russo, but now is in a relationship with Zeke Beakerman, Justin's nerdy best friend. Harper is a typical teenager, being self- expressive, but a little insecure at times. Unlike Alex, she is a hard-working student and a fairly positive person, but still connects well with Alex. Jennifer Stone does not appear as Harper in \\"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\\" (which was actually the first episode produced, but the sixth episode broadcast‚Äîthe episode was aired out of production order). Harper is known for her outrageous fashion ensembles that she designs herself, most of which are \\"food-themed\\", such as one outfit seen in the season one episode \\"Credit Check\\" which resembled a cupcake. No one ever tells her that her fashion designs are (for the most part) ridiculous, but it is implied that everyone else thinks it. Not only does she create her own clothes, but she also makes her own jewelry as seen in the episode \\"Art Museum Piece\\", when she starts a booth selling her necklaces made of macaroni, glitter, and knobs from Alex's room. Despite her unseemly fashion choices, she believes it is better to stand out as an individual, and is confident that she will excel at whatever she tries, no matter what people think, and has a habit of laughing out loud when the atmosphere gets tense. She was oblivious of the fact that Alex, Max and Justin are wizards until the episode \\"Harper Knows\\" when Alex finally told her because she felt guilty for not telling the truth to her best friend. This was also the first time Harper experienced the use of magic when Alex gave her a charmed costume with super powers. She is often paranoid of Alex's schemes, especially after she finds out about magic, but reluctantly gets involved anyway. Despite Alex's controlling and manipulative behavior, Harper always sees the good side in Alex and is willing to be accepting of her due to their friendship, to the point where she was the only person who believed that Alex wouldn't participate in a plot that, if successful, would prevent young wizards losing their powers in the Competition. She has known Alex since kindergarten and is always there when Alex needs support. In season three it is revealed that Harper is a cheerleader, which is the only secret Harper has ever kept from Alex, largely due to Alex's typical disdain and mocking attitude towards cheerleaders. Harper's parents are featured in \\"Wizards vs Finkles\\" as traveling showpeople from Romania. They ask Harper to rejoin them for shows but Harper refuses, happy with her life with the Russos while Alex, fascinated with their lifestyle, accept in Harper's place. In the end the commitment and hard work drives Alex away, with Harper's parents leaving for Youngstown, Ohio, for a new gig on good terms with Harper and the rest of the Russos. In \\"Meet the Werewolves\\" it is revealed that Harper was born in Nebraska, backstage in a night club, most likely at one of her parent's shows. In \\"Wizards vs. Vampires: Tasty Bites\\", when Alex is so fed up with her family's new healthy living, she says, \\"I'm so desperate, I'm thinking about going to Harper's house\\", meaning that Harper's house is wild. In \\"Alex Does Good\\", Harper blurts out, \\"It's about time I got some appreciation, Mom!\\", claiming that her mom doesn't appreciate her. Harper moves in with Alex and the Russos in season three, most likely because of her home. (Although it was also motivated by her father's recent transfer to Pittsburgh and her unwillingness to leave Alex). In the episode \\"Future Harper\\", it's revealed that Harper becomes a famous author, who writes books based on the Russos' wizard adventures, and writes under the name \\"H.J. Darling\\" (parody of J. K. Rowling). Alex, Justin, and Max find this out when they go to confront the author of the books (seven books in the series Charmed and Dangerous) that mysteriously mimic their lives. As the older Harper (Rachel Dratch) tells them, she writes her books in the present day because in the future, wizards and magic in general have been outed, and books about magic are no longer so interesting. She doesn't tell the Russo kids who it was that revealed the existence of wizards, other than it happens to be one of the three; the Alex and Justin suspect it to be Max, to which he is first appalled but then agrees (though in a later episode the Russos are questioned by the government and they trick Justin into revealing that wizards exist, though this turned out to be a false exposure); and that she came back in time with the aid of one of the most powerful wizards of all time. It is unknown if she ever marries someone with the last name Darling, or if she just uses the name H.J. Darling as a way to keep her identity safe in the present day. In the episode \\"Third Wheel\\", after it is discovered Stevie is a wizard, Alex starts hanging out with her more, neglecting Harper. Later in the episode, Harper confronts Alex on how she has been feeling left out. This leads to a heated argument, where Harper reveals her insecurities about how Alex is always taking her for granted and yet she never holds it against her. During this argument, they end up destroying the Homecoming float, which Justin tricked Harper into helping him build by disguising himself as Alex. Mr. Laritate witnesses this and threatens to have Alex expelled. For the sake of their friendship, Harper takes all the blame. Mr. Laritate believes her, considering that Alex never tells the truth, and punishes Harper with one week of detention. Later, Alex somehow sneaks into the detention room and apologizes for what happened. Forgiving her, Harper explains that she only did it because even if Stevie is Alex's new best friend, it's not going to keep her from being a friend to Alex. Alex compassionately says that her relationship with Harper is much stronger than it is with Stevie, by saying that Stevie is her friend, but Harper is her sister. When Stevie later appears to recruit Alex to aid her in a plot to destroy the power transference technology and thus prevent any younger wizards from losing their powers in the competition, Harper continues to believe that Alex will come through and do the right thing even when Justin is convinced that Alex has gone evil. Alex warmly thanks Harper for her faith in her after her true agenda is revealed when she freezes Stevie and allows Stevie's brother Warren to inherit his full powers. At times, Jerry and Theresa like to take credit for Harper being their daughter, as in the episode \\"Marathoner Helper\\". Justin then says, \\"C'mon, she's not your daughter.\\" And as Alex walks in eating a hot dog with cereal he says, \\"That's your daughter.\\" She usually shouts \\"See ya in PE\\" and screams when she is scared or nervous. In \\"Helping Hand\\", she screams while laughing stating she is scared and happy. Theresa Russo Theresa Magdalena Margarita Russo (n√©e Larkin), played by Maria Canals Barrera, is the mother of Alex, Justin and Max Russo and co-owner of the Waverly Sub Station, with her husband Jerry; and is also the slightly more serious one of the couple. Theresa is Mexican American (as a Latina, Canals Barrera has Spanish ancestry through her Cuban parents).Wizards of Waverly Place episode: \\"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\\" Theresa Russo is a typical mother. She's fussy, caring and can be pretty embarrassing. Unlike her children, she is a mortal. She dislikes magic, probably because she was once possessed by a wizard's love spell for twelve years. Theresa lives on Waverly Place in Manhattan with her husband (and former wizard) Jerry Russo (David DeLuise) and her children: middle daughter Alex Russo (Selena Gomez), eldest son Justin Russo (David Henrie), and youngest child Max Russo (Jake T. Austin). She owns a sandwich shop called the Waverly Sub Station with her husband in which her children work. She is overprotective of Justin and Max, but Max especially. She tries to relate with her kids but it doesn't always work. Theresa stated that she is a \\"Proud Latina\\" and tries to get her children to learn about her and their Mexican heritage. In season one's \\"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\\", Theresa states that she once played guitar in an all-girl mariachi band ‚Äî though when Justin says \\"I didn't know you played the guitar\\", Jerry says \\"she doesn't\\" ‚Äì implying that Theresa is not a very good guitar player. This is shown in season 3. At times, Theresa can be controlling of her kids and their lives; for example, in \\"Quincea√±era\\", she completely takes control of the plans for Alex's Quincea√±era fifteenth birthday party and turns it into the party that she wants, attempting to manipulate Alex into letting her. She refuses to listen to Alex's objections all because she herself never got to have a Quincea√±era of her own. This eventually gets so irritating to Alex that she casts a spell to switch bodies with her mother, partially so Theresa would be able to have the Quincea√±era that she never got to have. Theresa is the reason why Jerry could not keep his wizard powers. Since wizards are not allowed to marry non-wizards, Jerry chose to give up his powers to his younger brother Kelbo in order to marry Theresa, as was revealed in season one's \\"Alex in the Middle\\" ‚Äì previously unbeknownst to Justin, Alex and Max. However, Jerry says he does not regret marrying her. It has been mentioned several times that Theresa doesn't like magic, and that she feels left out due to the rest of her family all being wizards at some point. She also finds it difficult to live in a house full of wizards, especially when her children (and sometimes, Jerry) misuse magic in the house, most notably when the boys of the family want to play indoors and either directly or indirectly end up destroying a prized lamp she owns. An example of this is in season one's \\"Art Museum Piece\\", when a spell which causes Theresa to go through objects wears off‚Äîand she accidentally walks into the front door and she exclaims \\"I hate living with wizards!\\". She has also been shown to have very little concern for major issues in the magical world, which don't concern her. She also can be annoyed by the magic futility, was visible in \\"All bout You-niverse\\", when Alex broken a magical mirror (and thus trapping herself in a parallel universe), Theresa find out that fixing a magical mirror is no different from fixing a normal mirror, and she remarks \\"Magic is lame\\". Despite this, when Alex and Justin's antics cause Max to fail the wand quiz in \\"My Tutor, Tutor\\", Theresa lends a sympathetic ear to his problem (even supporting his plans to get revenge), and even told Alex to use her magic to make their haunted house scarier in \\"Halloween\\". In \\"Positive Alex\\", Theresa and Jerry realized that Alex had put a spell on herself to become positive, and they agree to do nothing against it, because they believe that there's nothing wrong in being positive, though they quickly change their minds when the newly optimistic Alex turns out to be unbearably annoying. Though normally, Theresa is a kind and caring mother, but she has a prevalent selfish side. For example, in \\"Retest\\", when Alex, Max, and Justin were upset over the possibility of losing their powers, Theresa relished the thought of having a normal family, going so far as to suggest turning the wizard lair into a den and, although she has no intention in hurting them, Theresa often hints this fact in a very unkind form. Similarly, in \\"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place\\", she openly refused to let Justin date Juliet at first and freely stated she cared more about her business than her children's happiness, which even Alex was appalled and disgusted by. Alex then cut into the argument as Justin was losing it badly against their parents and fixed everything up, ending with Justin able to date Juliet and their parents happy. In \\"Marathon Helper\\", Theresa was too shamed and upset with her family's lack of physical attributes that she said none of her own children are members of her family, openly added Harper is her only daughter, since Harper had taken it on herself to be involved in healthy activities, and later, she goes farther, hurting Justin's feelings by her saying she was not proud of his academic success. Both in \\"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place 2\\" and in \\"Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie,\\" she openly remarks since she is the Russos' mother, she doesn't need to care about their opinions and in more than one occasion, she arrogantly expressed the belief that she is immune to the Wizard Rules, since that she isn't (unfortunately, the \\"Wizard\\" Rules apply to all normal and supernatural beings that is aware of the Wizard World.). In the episode \\"Alex's Logo\\", she was referred to as popular in school, though it turns out she was the first girl admitted to a formerly all-boys school. In \\"Uncle Ernesto,\\" Alex encourages her to invite her brother on her birthday, however, it goes wrong and she ends up with a crashed birthday party. Jerry Russo Geraldo Pep√© \\"Jerry\\" RussoWizards of Waverly Place episode: \\"The Crazy 10 Minute Sale\\" is the father of Alex, Justin and Max Russo and co-owner of the Waverly Sub Station, with his wife Theresa (whom he accidentally insults on occasion). He is also a former wizard, who chose to give up his powers to marry his wife Theresa, a mortal, due to a rule forbidding wizards to marry mortals. Jerry is Italian American (DeLuise also has Italian ancestry).Wizards of Waverly Place episode: \\"Quincea√±era\\" Jerry Russo is the average father. He is stern, protective and is annoyed by Alex and Max constantly, and even by Justin occasionally. Unlike his children, he does not have powers any more; nonetheless, his children inherited their powers from him, with Max having a fascination of the magic normal humans can do such as microwave popcorn, Alex being a natural at magic yet using it recklessly, and Justin continually trying to improve his magic through knowledge. Jerry lives on Waverly Place, a street in downtown Manhattan with his mortal wife Theresa Russo (Maria Canals Barrera) and his children: middle daughter Alex Russo (Selena Gomez), eldest son Justin Russo (David Henrie), and youngest child Max Russo (Jake T. Austin). He owns a sandwich shop called the Waverly Sub Station with Theresa, where his children work, and, in the season one episode \\"New Employee\\" so did Alex's best friend Harper Finkle (Jennifer Stone), although they only did it so they could be together more often. It is mentioned in the season two episode \\"Make It Happen\\", that Jerry's original career plan was to be a bull rider. His most popular catchphrase is \\"But-he-you-she-ALEX!\\" Jerry is the typical over-protective father towards his daughter. It was first shown in season one's \\"First Kiss\\" when Alex claimed to have had her first kiss. He said \\"No! She's my little girl! What's his name? I'll make him cry!\\" (it is almost immediately revealed that Alex lied about having had her first kiss, and when Justin teased her for it, she kissed the first random boy she deemed good enough to kiss in school the next day, who was Matt, giving him a kiss that lasted a few seconds long and catching him off guard by her blunt, surprising way ‚Äì she had slammed his locker shut when he was using it, right before pulling him by the shirt to direct his face towards hers to be able to kiss ‚Äì and when he finally recovered from it, he turned around and ran in the direction of Alex, calling out her name to presumably ask her on a date), and continued in \\"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\\" from that same season, when he didn't want to teach her how to ride the carpet because he was afraid she would grow up and leave home. He also was seen putting babyish wallpaper on her walls. When Max is accidentally transformed into a little girl in \\"Daddy's Little Girl,\\" Jerry calls the new Max \\"Maxine\\" and dotes on her, which does not go unnoticed by a jealous Alex, who tries to get her father's attention to no avail. However, when he becomes aware of Alex's jealousy and sadness, Jerry apologizes to her, explaining that he only did so because Maxine reminds him of Alex when she was little and reassuring her that she will always be his little girl. He normally isn't okay with her dating, such as in the first-season episode \\"Potion Commotion\\" when Alex said \\"That's my new boyfriend!\\" about her crush Brad Sherwood (Shane Lyons), he said \\"I'll pick your new boyfriend!\\" But later on when Brad complimented Jerry, he said \\"I like your new boyfriend!\\" When Alex began dating Dean (Daniel Samonas), he liked him at first until Alex revealed Dean wanted to kiss her in season two's \\"Alex's Brother, Maximan\\". Jerry said \\"I never cared for that boy!,\\" when he had just said the other day he liked Dean. When Alex pointed that out he said \\"That's before I knew he wanted to kiss you! He was using me to get to you! And I fell for it!\\" In \\"Alex Charms a Boy\\" Jerry is no longer overprotective because when he saw Alex and Mason kiss he smiled instead of freaking out, because he knew it was an honest and true relationship. He can be somewhat of a cheapskate; for example, in \\"Taxi Dance\\", he is unable to remember the number of the hospital room where Justin was born when he remembers his own lottery ticket number from that same day, and being so cheap that his antics resulted in Theresa giving birth to Alex in a taxicab instead of in a hospital. Notably, before this, Theresa told the kids that Jerry had tried to make her walk to the hospital while she was in labor, to which Jerry replied, \\"I offered to push you in a shopping cart!\\". More notable, in \\"Western Show\\", when Max's increase of intelligence and maturity make him apply for various colleges, instead of showing happiness for the success of his son, he was upset with the possibility of having to pay for his learning. Additionally, in \\"Quincea√±era,\\" he is reduced to tears when Alex offers to tell him how much her Quincea√±era cost. Jerry is proud of his magical ancestry and teaches his children about the proper uses of magic in \\"Wizard Training Class\\" on Tuesdays and Thursdays, in the lair magically disguised as a food locker in the restaurant. However, his children often disobey his magic rules (Alex, most often being the case), and he has to punish them. He wants his kids to be great wizards, but also wants them to be able to live a life without using their powers since they may not have them in the future, as only one of them will get to keep his/her powers as an adult. Jerry has an younger brother named Kelbo (Jeff Garlin), who is seen in the season one episode \\"Alex in the Middle\\", who is the wizard in Jerry's family because Jerry had to give him the powers to marry Theresa. Jerry's children consider Kelbo to be more fun than Jerry, and Alex even decides to have Kelbo be her magic teacher, and is revealed to be irresponsible with magic (almost as much as Alex is sometimes) as is shown when Kelbo fails to stop a package of sea chimps that spouts a huge gush of water eventually flooding the wizard lair and turning Kelbo and Alex into sea chimps. Jerry ends up being the one who saves them both, and he reveals a secret that he has kept from Alex, Max and Justin: that he gave up his powers in order to marry Theresa, due to a rule forbidding wizards and mortals from marrying, thus relinquishing his powers to Kelbo in order to marry her. In \\"Retest\\" it is revealed that Jerry and Kelbo have a sister, Megan. Megan holds a grudge against Jerry for giving Kelbo his powers instead of her. She lives in an art studio in Paris where she paints pictures. She is similar to Alex because she, like Alex, loves Art and hates hard work, though, unlike Alex, she is unwilling or unable to apologize for her actions. It is most likely their parents are still alive because of references from Alex and Max. Such as in \\"Future Harper\\", when Alex is telling Harper about a wizard adventure about her and her brothers, Harper already knows the ending and tells Alex she already told her the story. Alex replies \\"Oh my gosh I'm starting to sound like Grandma\\". Jerry also is a fan of the New York Mets and New York Jets, he and Theresa accidentally made fools of themselves in front of Max's date's parents, because Max got confused between the New York Mets and the New York Metropolitan Opera (The Met) while trying to find common interest between them and his date's parents, not realizing that they keep forgetting about the Intermission they usually believed the stories to \\"end abruptly in the middle\\". In several episodes of the series (more so in season one, than in other seasons), Jerry often makes a remark that accidentally insults Theresa, and quickly tries to correct his statement. Such an example is in season one's \\"Movies\\", in which Theresa tells Alex that no matter how old she gets that she is not too old to spend time with her family, Jerry responds \\"Exactly, just look at your mother\\". Alex then points out that Jerry accidentally called Theresa \\"old\\", and he attempts and fails to change the subject. In Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, Jerry gives Justin the family wand and the spell book which Alex steals accidentally wishing her parents never met or fell in love, but it was resolved ‚Äì ironically by Alex herself, the reckless one out of his three children, who also surprisingly won the Premature Family Wizard competition against Justin, as Justin was the favorite out of the three to win it but lost to Alex, who then gives up her powers so they could compete for their powers when they are old enough. Jerry has made more than one mention of past friends of his youth, including \\"Ponyboy\\" and John Bender; both names of rebellious teen characters in classic 80's pop- culture films, The Outsiders and The Breakfast Club, respectively. Aside from the names, no other specific connections or further implications seem to have been made connecting Jerry's youth and the events in these stories. It is revealed in \\"Wizard for a Day\\", that he does not need his magic powers anymore, because when Alex gave him Merlin's hat for his birthday, granting the wearer magic powers for 24 hours, all he wished for was a sandwich, whereas he could've just as easily went downstairs to make a sandwich himself in the Sub Station. Feeling underwhelmed, Alex used the hat to convert the Sub Station into a milkshake bar from Jerry's youth. After seeing this, he reminisced about it for a few moments before asking Alex to change it back, though he changed his mind when he saw how many customers it attracted. He later told Alex that he doesn't need big exciting gifts, as he his satisfied enough with small and simple ones (referring to Justin's gift, a magic pencil sharpener made from a soup-can). ==Recurring characters== The following is a list of recurring characters in the Disney Channel sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place. Zeke Beakerman Ezekiel 'Zeke' Beakerman\\"Smarty Pants\\", season 2, episode 1 has Zeke in the credits; in \\"Movies\\", season 1, episode 9 he is called \\"Zack\\". (Dan Benson) is Justin's best friend. Zeke is in the same grade as Justin. He attends Tribeca Prep and is in advanced chemistry along with Justin. He is also part of an Alien Language League; he and Justin often \\"speak alien\\" to each other. Zeke's first appearance was in \\"Movies\\", but strangely he was known as Zack Rosenblack. They later changed his name to Zeke. He is very impulsive and easygoing. He and Justin are also on the same Quiz Bowl team in \\"Smarty Pants\\". Zeke and Justin have tried out for several sports teams, but have apparently failed at all of them. In \\"Fashion Week\\", they somehow succeed at talking to models. Zeke got the role of Peter Pan in the school play in \\"Fairy Tale\\". In the episode \\"Wizard For a Day\\", he is upset when the real aliens do not understand his \\"alien speak\\". Zeke and Harper go to \\"Zombie Prom\\" together. He is also on the cheer squad, as revealed in \\"Positive Alex\\". He runs against Justin in the campaign for student body president in \\"Detention Election\\", but later he votes for Justin. He continues to assist Justin as student body president. Zeke continues his relationship with Harper in \\"Alex Russo, Matchmaker?\\" In \\"Wizards Unleashed\\", Zeke and Harper take care of the sub station and share their first kiss. In \\"Alex Russo, Matchmaker\\", Zeke is revealed to have hydrophobia and in season 4 he finds out the Russos are wizards. He assists the Russos when possible, though his assistance usually turns more troublesome than helpful. He is present during the Russo siblings' competition and ceremony at the series finale. Mr. Laritate Mr. Herschel Laritate (Bill Chott) is the principal of Tribeca Prep High School, which is mentioned when he calls Alex Russo into the principal's office in \\"Alex Does Good\\". Humorously, it is shown in the same episode that Alex has been sent to the principal's office way too often (implying Alex is a delinquent student) to the point that the two have somewhat of regular routines down, such as serving drink and snacks to each other and complementing the office's new mural of horses. His last name, Laritate, is a pun of Larry Tate from Bewitched. He loves anything related to the Old West, as seen in his daily life, such as wears cowboy hat and bolo tie, uses terms from that era when speaking, and even decorates his office in that theme. When he was relieved from his position as principal in \\"Western Show\\", he choose to work as part-time employee in 'Wild Billy's Western Roundup'. He teaches History class, Marriage and Family class, and taught the Art class once as temporary teacher. Mr. Laritate also acts as the adviser of several activities at the school including the World School Summit at the U.N., Happy Helpers Club, Quiz Bowl, sport activities, and school plays. His alma mater is Clementine College as mentioned in \\"Fairy Tale\\", but later on he confessed that he does not have a college degree in \\"Franken-Girl\\". Nevertheless, he claimed to be able to provide a strong recommendation letter for Justin Russo to the said college. Mr. Laritate considers Justin as a model student. On the contrary, he has an on-and-off relationship with Justin's sister, Alex, in that he is often disappointed in Alex's lack of work ethic and unwillingness to do well in school. In season two's \\"Don't Rain on Justin's Parade\\", Mr. Laritate calls Alex an evil genius, much to Alex's pleasure. However, it is evident that he cares about her through his many efforts to reach out to her. In \\"Alex's Logo\\", he is basically Alex's only friend because everybody became mad at Alex after she said what she really thought of them while giving a speech under truth spell. After Alex complains about everybody still being mad at her, even though it has been a week since the speech, Mr. Laritate then tries to help Alex by doing more embarrassing acts in the hope that everybody will turn their attention to him and forget what Alex has done. Unfortunately, he also incidentally embarrasses Alex on the microphone while doing so, resulting other students calling her the principal's BFF (Best Friend Forever). He gives all the students that then threw T-shirts at him detention. He also gave Alex, who did not throw a T-shirt, detention, in order to justify his \\"student to principal\\" relationship. However, she smiles at Mr. Laritate's and says \\"thank you\\", because she knows its just his another attempt to defuse tension between her and other students. It was also revealed in this episode that Mr. Laritate has somewhat a difficult relationship with his mother. In season 4, Alex crashes Mr. Laritate's car during her driving lesson and he sees how grown up she has become when she confesses the truth to him. Mr. Laritate personally hands high school diploma to Alex and Harper Finkle during a makeshift graduation ceremony of Tribeca Prep class of 2011 in \\"Wizards vs Asteroids\\". He appeared last time in \\"Get Along Little Zombie\\" in which he was temporarily turned into a zombie after he got bitten by one during his visit to Alex and Harper's apartment. Alex and Mason Greyback turned him back into human again using 'Zombie bites treatment' lotion. It is shown at the end of the episode that he is, apparently, willing to keep a close relationship to the Russo family. Mason Greyback Mason Greyback (Gregg Sulkin; seasons 3-4) is first mentioned in Season 2 episode Future Harper when Future Harper tells Alex that she seems irritable and asks if she broke up with Mason yet, implying that she will date a boy named Mason in the future. Mason is first fully introduced as a student in Alex's art class, and as an English boy who has a crush on Alex. They later begin to date. Mason loves to paint. He gives Alex a necklace that lights up when the person who wears it is in love with the person who put it on them. It is revealed that he in fact is a werewolf but doesn't turn Alex into a werewolf when they kiss, because he is a purebred and only mutts turn people into werewolves when they kiss, referencing Justin's werewolf Wizface- date from the season 2 episode \\"Beware Wolf\\". He helps in the search for Juliet after picking up her scent from her dental floss. It is revealed that he and Juliet used to date (which also reveals Mason doesn't age) and he admits impulsively that he never stopped loving her, which breaks Alex's heart. She throws away the magic necklace he gave her (which lights up if the wearer is in love with the person who put it on them). He later tells Max that, like dogs, werewolves are incredibly loyal and impulsive, which explains why he couldn't contain himself when he saw Juliet, though his feelings for Alex are still present. He tries to prove his love for Alex by going back to the mummy's tomb to find the necklace. Justin, Max, and Juliet come to rescue Alex, even though Alex volunteered to go and wasn't in any real danger. Max likes Mason, but Justin hates him for breaking Alex's heart. When Justin tries to make Alex forcedly leave the tomb, Mason, being fiercely protective, turns into a werewolf, and starts fighting Justin and Juliet. He is attacking Justin when Juliet bites him, causing him to turn into a wolf permanently. Before his transformation, Alex puts the necklace on him and it lights up. Alex knows now that he truly loves her, but he leaves because as a wolf, he has no control. He leaves the mummy's tomb as he transforms into a wolf. In Wizards Unleashed, it is discovered that Mason has been captured by wizards and is being used in TV advertisements. Upon discovering this, Alex manages to retrieve him, and uses magic to revert the transformation, but only succeeds in leaving him with pointy ears, claws, and mass abounds of fur. Though Alex initially has trouble accepting Mason in this new state, she eventually gets over it and Justin manages to fully restore his humanity by playing a magical jawharp at the end of the episode. In \\"Wizards Exposed,\\" the wizards get caught, and Mason gets caught while he was \\"admiring his hat.\\" In \\"Alex Gives Up,\\" they are forced to break up due to a rule that says that werewolves and non-wizards cannot date because the werewolf always ends up eating the human due to their anger management issues. At first, Chancellor Rootie Tootie Tootie appealed the rule, but then Alex, jealous of Lisa Cucuy, who was hitting on Mason, and makes Mason extremely angry by embarrassing him in front of her brother, her parents, and the Cucuy's. Mason then transforms into his half-werewolf form and Chancellor Tootie Tootie, seeing he is incapable of controlling his anger, takes back his appeal, therefore forcing Alex and Mason to break up. In \\"Journey to the Center of Mason\\", Mason eats Dean Moriarty (Alex's ex- boyfriend; they broke up when Dean had to move to Ohio) because he is jealous that Alex is spending time with Dean and not him. Alex, Justin, and Max go inside of Mason. While in Mason, Alex, Justin, and Max go into his brain. Alex sees that all Mason does is think about her. When Alex, Justin, and Max come out of him with Dean, Dean leaves because Alex doesn't want him back. After he leaves, Alex and Mason get back together because Alex decided to rejoin the Wizard Competition so she and Mason could be together. In the episode, Dean only refers to Mason as \\"London Bridges\\". Mason has the deepest love for Alex and has nicknamed her 'Brown Eyes', 'Little Meatball', and 'Love'. In \\"Wizard of the Year\\", Alex breaks up with him for the third time because of his mistrust of her and a monster tamer named Chase. In the episodes of \\"Wizards of Apartment 13B\\", Alex and Harper move into an apartment on the thirteenth floor where coincidentally Mason is living at. Mason stops at nothing to win Alex back; using Harper's training wand to open Alex's heart to him. Though this turns out for the worse as Alex begins to flirt with an ugly ogre and Felix. In \\"Ghost Roommate\\", Mason goes on a date with Lucy, a ghost who is living with Alex and Harper. Alex is jealous that Mason and Lucy went on a date and proceed to find Lucy's long lost true love. Alex is then stuck on the Bermuda Triangle, where magic can't be used. Mason comes to her rescue using Justin's hideous Bermuda shorts. In \\"Get Along, Little Zombie\\", Mason is still determined to ask Alex out on a date and even breaking the elevator to spend some time with Alex; exposing the magical thirteenth floor to non-magical residents. Soon, Mr. Laritate discovers the thirteenth floor and gets bitten by a zombie; subsequently gets turned into a zombie. Mason and Alex go on a wild goose chase trying to find Mr. Laritate and end up in a square dance. Alex then realizes that she wants Mason back while Mason was trying to say that maybe he and Alex should just be friends. At the end of the episode, it is shown that Mason and Alex do get back together. In \\"Who Will be the Family Wizard\\", Mason comes to the wizard competition to cheer on Alex. He and Juliet meet once again and tell each other no hard feelings from the events that took place in \\"Wizards vs. Werewolves\\". Also when Alex loses the competition, he and Alex look deeply saddened due to her losing and ponder breaking up. However, Justin realizes how much Alex needs to win to be happy, and so reveals she would have won if she hadn't gone back for him and he didn't really win like everyone thought he did. Alex becomes the Russo family wizard and is able to stay with Mason. In \\"The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex\\", Mason gets jealous over the evil wizard, Dominic, who flirts with Alex. Mason breaks Alex out of jail before she can be exiled, and he throws Dominic off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Juliet van Heusen Juliet van Heusen (Bridgit Mendler; seasons 2-4) is a teenage vampire who is Justin Russo's main love interest. When she was born, her parents let her have a soul so she could socialize in the human world. This also makes her more compassionate than most vampires, who are usually heartless and cunning. She is characterized as a beautiful girl with blonde hair and rather pale skin. She wears vanilla- scented perfume to hide her true vampire scent of death and decay in an attempt to avoid detection by monster hunters. She is also a health-conscious girl who has certain diet on her menu. Juliet's development as a vampire is very slow, as her fangs have just started to grow at a late age for a vampire. She is also shown to not want to drink blood, and even tries to persuade her parents to abstain from drinking blood. As a very unusual character for a vampire, this trait is used for comic effect, especially when she empties a berliner with her fangs. At first, Juliet and Justin were not allowed to date by their respective parents due to their restaurants' rivalry. However, the two fight for their love and soon are allowed to date. In \\"Night at the Lazerama\\", Juliet accompanies Justin on his monster-hunt for a mummy. Unfortunately, they become trapped in a glass display near a glass roof, which would cause Juliet to burn up in the morning. Since the mummy is the only one that is able to take Juliet out from the glass display, Justin decides that the only way to save Juliet's life is to turn her into the mummy's slave. Nevertheless, he promises to save her one day. The mummy then takes Juliet to Transylvania, where she is forcibly imprisoned in suspended animation behind Hieroglyphics, though she never gives up hope that Justin will save her. In \\"Wizards vs. Werewolves\\", Justin indeed saves her, and then it is revealed that she once dated Mason Greyback, Alex's werewolf boyfriend, 300 years ago. This fact makes Justin rather jealous towards Mason, leads to a fight between the two. Juliet intervenes when Justin and Mason fight, and Mason scratches Juliet and, in turn, Juliet bites Mason, resulting in Mason turning into a wolf and Juliet is stripped of her vampire powers. This causes her to rapidly age into an old woman, since she is truly 2,193 years old. Because of this, Justin and Juliet are forced to end their relationship, both of them heartbroken. In \\"Moving On\\", Juliet appears again, happy to witness that Justin apparently has forgotten her and moved on. However, Justin and Juliet reunite towards the end of season 4, since, actually, none of them has stopped loving each other. Juliet gets her vampire powers and youth back when Gorog (the leader of dark angels) gives them to her in an effort to tempt Justin to join the Dark Side. However, the Russos defeat Gorog, releasing Juliet from his influence. Juliet comes to support Justin at the Russo family's wizard competition, where she and Mason meet and both acknowledge that no hard feelings left from the events that took place in \\"Wizards vs. Werewolves\\". When Justin takes Professor Crumbs' place as headmaster of WizTech, Juliet says she's even happier about that. Dean Moriarty Dean Moriarty (Daniel Samonas; seasons 2 and 4) is Alex's boyfriend in the second season. He makes temporary tattoos in the boys bathroom and is interested in cars. In episode \\"Racing\\" he charmed Alex's parents with his car skills, though he revealed to Alex that he only did it to make a good first impression by being polite. It is also revealed in that episode, that he was raised by his Uncle, as he exclaimed proudly \\"my Uncle raised me with manners\\". Harper and Justin aren't too fond of him and Jerry seems the same way later on, though this is partly due to Jerry being an overprotective father after learning that he is dating Alex. He can never remember Harper's name. In the episode \\"Alex's Brother Maximan\\" it was shown he likes roller skating and playing with the claw game and winning stuffed animals. The only thing Alex doesn't like about him is that he's horrible at showing his feelings, as shown in \\"Saving Wiz Tech Part 1\\", but it changed in \\"Saving Wiz Tech Part 2\\". He does not appear to be academically inclined, as Alex noticed a false good grade on his wooden assignment/gift for her (it was a D changed to a B), and he also stated that he does not \\"test well\\", meaning he doesn't see himself as book-smart. He moved away sometime after that, so Alex visited him in his dreams in \\"Wizards vs Vampires: Dream Date\\"; she then saw how they were growing apart, so they broke up. But he returned in Season 4 \\"Journey to the Center of Mason\\" because he wanted to get back together, though she denied it because she likes Mason, and Mason eats him out of jealousy. Dean is later rescued by Alex, Justin, and Max, and learns that Alex has chosen Mason and agrees to back off. Professor Crumbs Professor Crumbs (Ian Abercrombie) is the headmaster of WizTech (a reference to Albus Dumbledore). In \\"Wizard School\\", he is often seen holding a muffin. (The muffin's crumbs fall into his beard, hence the name \\"Crumbs\\".) Professor Crumbs is never seen without his incredibly long beard, even when he was turned into a guinea pig in the episode \\"Report Card\\". The only episode where he has been seen without his beard is in part two of season two's \\"Saving WizTech\\" when Ronald Longcape, Jr. (Chad Duell) took the beard from him, revealing that it was a fake beard all this time. After he was defeated, Crumbs took his beard back. Crumbs is shown how to socialize by Max in \\"Saving WizTech\\" and has done some childish things, such as spitting over the edge of the Tower of Evil. In season two's \\"Saving WizTech\\", he states that he is 850 years old. He speaks with a British accent, which Alex sometimes makes fun of. Another thing that Alex makes fun of is the fact that he has a smelly beard revealed in Wizards Exposed. In the season 3 finale, he appears to be captured by a government agency with the rest of the wizard elite. However, the season 4 premiere reveals it was all an illusion Crumbs created to \\"test\\" Justin and Alex. As each broke it by revealing to government agents and reporters (all also illusions), Crumbs forces them both to start at level 1 of their wizard lessons; however, after seeing how remarkably unintelligent Max was, he regretted his choice. When Justin and Max change him back into a kid, in their attempt to trick him into revealing how to undo a mutant spell they cast on Max that turned him into a little girl, it's revealed that everyone in Crumbs' family has a beard even as a kid. In the four-part episode revolving around Floor 13B, Professor Crumbs was surprised about a wizard floor that he did not know of and ended up discovering that Gorog was behind it. Professor Crumbs was captured by Gorog alongside the other inhabitants and was later rescued by the Russos upon Gorog's defeat. In the end of the series finale, Crumbs announces Alex as the Family Wizard and that he is retiring, and makes Justin Russo (David Henrie) the new headmaster of WizTech, thus also granting Justin his full magic powers. Hugh Normous Hugh Normous (Josh Sussman; seasons 1-2 and 4) was Alex's Wiz Tech friend he first appeared in \\"Wizard School.\\" His name is a pun of the word \\"enormous\\", it is also an irony considering that he isn't a real giant, as pointed out by Alex when he introduced himself and she responded with \\"Not Really\\". At first, he believed himself to be a giant, since his parents are giants, but that he's the runt of the litter, so he carries around miniature everyday objects to boost his self-esteem; humorously, he also wears underpants and glasses too small for himself. He later appeared in season 2 episode Saving Wiz Tech where he showed Alex his friend Ronald Longcape Jr he later appears in Harper Knows and Hugh's not Normous where he discovers that he is adopted and that he is not a real giant. He eventually meets his birth parents and goes to live with them, but he doesn't resent his adoptive parents. Hugh is a giant in the sense of, when he met his birth parents, he was markedly taller than both of them, with both of them commenting on his larger size. Presumably, after discovering this, he stopped his habit of carrying miniature objects and started wearing regular-sized clothes. He does not appear in season 3 or the movie. He returned in Ghost Roommate, still thinking he is a giant. Kelbo Russo Kelbo Russo (Jeff Garlin; seasons 1-3) is the uncle of Alex, Justin and Max, brother of Jerry and Megan and brother-in-law of Theresa. Unlike Jerry, he is very fun and carefree. Kelbo is a full wizard (Jerry had originally won the competition, but gave up his powers to marry a mortal) who often uses his powers very childishly, and often seems just as irresponsible with them as Alex is with her own. As a recurring gag, in every episode he appears in during the post credits scenes, he makes a prank call to someone. He first appears in \\"Alex In the Middle\\", and temporarily becomes Alex's wizard tutor. He reappears in \\"Retest\\", it is requested that he, Jerry and their sister Megan re-do their wizard competition, but when Megan refuses, Kelbo hires a magical fish-lawyer to help them, but after he informs that there is nothing that he can do, Kelbo decides to move to Atlantis for good. He appears once again in \\"Dude Looks Like Shakira\\", and reveals that he is Shakira, but also added that what he has been doing is against the wizard rules, and can no longer control his transformations. The Russos eventually cure him of his illness (though Shakira's career-end isn't mentioned afterwards). Despite his immaturity, naivety and clueless behavior, Kelbo proves to be a very loving and caring uncle, which was visible in his second appearing, and he, unlike Jerry, has no hard feelings for Megan, in fact, he was genuinely happy to see her again. Also in \\"Dude Looks Like Shakira\\", Kelbo, in a rare moment of maturity, attempts to confess his crime to the wizard council, even knowing the consequences, in order to free his family from legal issues. Prank calls include: Is your refrigerator running (to Theresa in \\"Alex in the Middle\\"), Is your refrigerator running (to Megan in \\"Retest\\"), This is the wizards council. We'll be over to break you hands for breaking wizard rules, etc. (to Justin in \\"Dude looks like Shakira\\"). It's also shown that he really hates the taste of cinnamon. He did not appear in season 4. Monotone Woman Monotone Woman (Amanda Tepe; seasons 1-2) has played numerous characters during the show's first season, as well as one guest appearance in season two. She appears as a random character who speaks with a monotone voice. Jobs she has held include department store manager, waitress, frozen yogurt store manager, hotel maitre'd, dog show security guard, the information desk lady at Volcano Land (only job in the magic world), art museum security guard, and hot dog vendor. Tepe's only appearance on the show during the second season is in the episode \\"Wizards vs. Vampires: Dream Date\\" as the hot dog vendor person. Her name in \\"New Employee\\" is Amanda, according to her name tag, but in \\"Art Museum Piece\\", her name is Elaine according to Blue Boy. She does not appear in the third and fourth season. Other recurring characters * ' (Hayley Kiyoko; season 3) ‚Äì Stevie is the new trouble maker at school. She was first seen in episode Detention Election where she competes with Alex to see who is the baddest girl in school when it turns out to be her Alex and Stevie form a close friendship. In Eat to the Beat it turns out that Stevie's a wizard. Harper was first to find out, but Stevie makes Harper forget in the episode Third Wheel (not knowing that Harper already knows about magic). Then Alex then uses the jog your memory spell on Harper (seeing that Harper is trying to tell her something important) and she finds out, which brings Stevie and Alex's friendship closer. It is revealed in \\"The Good the Bad and the Alex\\" that Stevie was forming a wizard revolution that prevents the other siblings of a wizard competition from losing their powers. She recruits Alex and Max, to the dismay of Harper, Justin, and Stevie's brother, Warren. As Max takes a picture of Alex and Stevie, Alex freezes Stevie, enabling Warren to get his full powers. However, Max accidentally taps Stevie and shattered her to pieces, although she didn't die and was mysteriously sent away to an island in the Wizard World. * ' (Leven Rambin; season 4) ‚Äì Rosie is Justin' angel girlfriend throughout the Wizards vs. Angels trilogy. In the first part, she pretends to be a wizard so she can join Justin's delinquent wizard class, but does terrible. A wizarding test for the class is coming up, and the class (besides Rosie) is doing exceptionally well, so Justin has to kick Rosie out because of her poor magical skills. Justin has an obvious crush on her, as he barely notices the rest of the class. She later reveals to Alex that she really likes Justin, so Alex puts the copycat spell on Rosie so she'll do everything Alex does. Her wizard robe comes off, revealing her wings, and everyone realizes she is an angel. In the second part, Rosie and Justin have their first date, but Jerry, Theresa, Alex, Harper and Max ruin it, so Rosie takes Justin, Alex and Harper to an angel dance club, for a second chance at their first date. During the angel slide, the club manager, Zeedrik, realizes that Alex and Harper aren't real angels. The foursome flee the club after Justin, Alex and Harper (barely) convince everyone they're real angels. At the end, Rosie's wings turn black, revealing that she is an angel of darkness. In the third part, Justin starts doing bad stuff, because Rosie, who's a dark angel, is influencing him without anyone (except for her) realizing it. Alex gets worried, so she goes to the guardian angel headquarters. There she meets Tina (China Anne McClain), a guardian angel in training, who desperately wants her wings, so she is always trying to help Alex. Alex gets a guardian angel for Justin, and goes back to Waverly Place with Tina. Tina recognizes Rosie, and reveals that she used to be her guardian angel teacher, but is now an angel of darkness. Alex tells Justin this, and Rosie admits it, but also says that she still cares about him and hopes he'll still care about her. Justin decides to stay with Rosie, infuriating Alex. Alex and Tina find Justin's guardian angel, Monti, tied up by Rosie, and they find her to-do-list. The list reveals that she is using Justin to steal the moral compass, which controls the morality of the world, from the guardian angels for the angels of darkness. Justin successfully steals the compass and Gorog (the leader of dark angels) rewards Justin with dark angel wings. The dark angels use the moral compass to turn everyone good to evil (with the exception of angels). Rosie realizes that Gorog plans on destroying Justin and tries to warn him, but he refuses to listen. Rosie realizes how much she really loves Justin, and goes to the Russos house to convince Alex to save her brother. Her sheer honesty convinces Alex to agree, and Alex and Tina go to the dark world, trying to get the moral compass back. However, Justin tries to prove his loyalty to Gorog by fighting Alex and Tina. Rosie professes her love to Justin, and with that love persuades Justin to fight evil and return to good. They escape, along with Alex and Tina, and they return the compass to the guardian angels. Rosie's good deed and love for Justin make her a guardian angel again. They both want to continue dating, but Justin decides against it because the world needs as many guardian angels as possible, so they go their separate ways. In the end, Rosie promotes Tina to full guardian angel. Also, Rosie tells Justin to do some bad things sometimes so that she can visit him in the future, but it has never been revealed whether she has visited him. * ' (John Rubinstein; season 4) was an Angel of Darkness. He was the leader of the Dark Angels, who debuts in the episode \\"Wizards vs. Angels.\\" His pawn, Rosie, tried to get Justin on his side in order to obtain the Moral Compass from the Guardian Angels, only to learn that Gorog tricked her. Alex managed to rescue Justin and they got away from Gorog. In \\"Wizards of 13B,\\" Gorog set up a secret Wizard Floor in an apartment building while disguised as the floor's manager Dexter' (Fred Stoller). In \\"Wizards vs. Everything,\\" Gorog's ruse was revealed when Professor Crumbs investigated the Wizard Floor that he never knew existed. Gorog revealed that he was plotting to gather inhabitants of Floor 13 in order to rebuild his army. Under the control of Gorog, Felix used a spell that made the whole floor go with them to the basement, where they will dig a hole into the Wizard World. Gorog and his brainwashed servants left the floor while Alex, Harper, and Justin were left trapped in the floor. Gorog takes the kidnapped wizards to his evil lair, where he plans to make them evil. He tricks Hugh Normous into becoming one of the evil wizards in his army. Professor Crumbs fakes becoming evil when Gorog plans on making him evil. Gorog then makes the wizard army dig a hole to the atmosphere to the wizard world, so they can take over it. Gorog also tries to trick Mason into being one of the members in his army, but Mason refuses. Gorog tricks him into joining however. Gorog then makes Felix send a black hole to suck Alex and Justin in it. Gorog gives the kidnapped wizards their wands so they can take over the wizard world, but Crumbs refuses to let them. On Gorog's order, Felix then gets rid of Crumbs. When Alex, Justin, and Max arrive at Gorog's lair and attempt to destroy him, Mason tries to convince Alex to join them. Gorog also reveals Justin's ex- girlfriend Juliet (who is young again thanks to Gorog restoring her powers) and she convinces Justin to join. Alex also surrenders and Max is forced to as well. The three then use their magics to get rid of Gorog freeing those Gorog has brainwashed. In \\"The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex\\", Dominic reveals to Alex that Gorog is his uncle. This could mean that Gorog may have had a wizard brother or sister. He appears to be based on Satan. * ' (JD Cullum and Anne Ramsay; season 2) ‚Äì Alucard and Cindy are Juliet's full vampire parents and the owners of the competing sandwich shop on Waverly Place, the Late Nite Bite, appearing in the four-part \\"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place\\" story arc at the end of season two. At first, they are opposed to the relationship between Juliet and Justin, but they eventually allow them to date each other. They didn't appear in the last 2 four-part episodes. They also called Alex \\"Oprah\\" in \\"Wizards vs. vampires on Waverly place\\" making every customer at \\"The late night bite\\" turn their heads to only see her. Alucard loves to scare people, although he is not very good at it. He often \\"unleashes his wrath,\\" and, as Cindy puts it, if his victims don't appear scared, she \\"has to hear about it all night.\\" Although they have been mentioned numerous times throughout the series (especially when Juliet is around) they are never seen in more than those two episodes. It is unknown if they will appear again, or if they know of their daughter's recent enslavement at the hands of a mummy. Also it is unknown if they know that Juliet loses her immortality in Wizards Vs. Werewolves. Running Gag: Alucard acts very mysterious like a stereotypical vampire while Cindy acts like a normal woman. Also of note the name Alucard is the reverse spelling of Dracula. * ' (Brian Kubach; season 1) ‚Äì Riley is Alex's crush in \\"I Almost Drowned in a Chocolate Fountain\\" and \\"The Supernatural\\", and her boyfriend in \\"Alex's Spring Fling\\". He is on the baseball team, and obviously likes Alex just as much as she does him. He appears to be at Alex's level in most school subjects, such as Spanish. He also appears to be one of Justin's friends, and is on the baseball team with him. His hair styles such as curly and straight differ between episodes. In \\"Alex's Spring Fling\\", Alex breaks up with Riley for a short time and starts to date \\"Manny Kin\\", who is a mannequin that she has brought to life just to make Riley jealous. Then Riley soon tells Alex that he is jealous and they continue to date. But, he is not mentioned at all in any other episodes (besides \\"I Almost Drowned in a Chocolate Fountain\\" and \\"The Supernatural\\"). * ' (McKaley Miller; season 4) ‚Äì Talia is Max's girlfriend. Her first appearance is in \\"Back to Max\\". She obviously likes Max. Max (as Maxine) first met Talia during the rehearsals for Tribeca Prep's \\"The Spirit of America Play\\". Maxine said that if she'll change back to Max, Talia will like him. After Maxine changed back to Max, he asks Talia to go out and she agrees, so she became Max's girlfriend. In the episode \\"Magic Unmasked\\", Max pretends to like Talia's hobbies. Then, Max tells Talia that they don't have anything in common and breaks up with her. Later, when Max is at Lucho wrestling match, Talia comes and she and Max get back together. Talia returned in \\"Alex, the Puppermaster\\", where her parents were introduced. Her parents do not like the Russo family, so Max put a spell on them, so they can meet all over again and end up liking each other. * ' (Skyler Samuels; seasons 1-2) ‚Äì Gertrude is Alex's rival. She has tried to embarrass Alex ever since they were in kindergarten when Gigi spilled juice on Alex's mat during naptime and said Alex had an \\"accident\\", and will often go entirely out of her way to do so. Another one of Gigi's targets is Alex's best friend, Harper. Gigi invited Harper to her annual tea party with the purpose of crowning her as the biggest loser at the tea party. Gigi seems to have complete control over most of the student body: in one episode, all of the other kids immediately cleared the halls at her command. Gigi hangs out with two girls who Alex and Harper refer to as the \\"Wannabes\\". The girls dress similar to Gigi and underwent plastic surgery of their noses to look more like her. Typical episodes involving Gigi depict her trying to humiliate Alex and/or Harper, and receiving poetic justice. So far Gigi has appeared in the episodes \\"Crazy Ten Minute Sale\\" and \\"Alex's Choice\\" from season one and \\"Graphic Novel\\" from season two. She doesn't appear in Seasons 3 and 4 because she was possibly expelled for bullying Alex and Harper. It is also implied that Gigi is wealthy, as mentioned by one of the girls at \\"Alex's Choice\\", where she said she \\"would be prettier if she could afford the same dermatologist as Gigi.\\". * ' (Kelsey Sanders and Heather Trzyna; seasons 1-2) ‚Äì The Wannabes are called \\"the wannabes\\" because they want to be as pretty as Gigi. They usually have strange looks, but that is only because it is part of a process to make them look prettier, and to make them look more like Gigi. They appear as Gigi's posse. They are also not very bright and rely on Gigi so often, they have no will of their own. They have appeared in every episode Gigi is in. They are also Alex's worst enemies in school. * ' (Frank Pacheco; season 4) ‚Äì He appears as recurring throughout season 4. His first appearance is in the subplot of \\"Alex Gives Up\\", a student in Justin's class of delinquents, who shows up late to class and doesn't hesitate to insult him repeatedly, rip the sleeves off Justin's shirt twice, and to dismiss the class by drawing a bell on the AbracaDoodler, which materials and then rings. When Alex joins Justin's class, he may have a crush on her, as he calls her pretty, etc. on more than one occasion. It is also revealed that Felix is a descendant of a very powerful wizard and is the only one who can pull out the most powerful wand in the Wizard World. Felix also lived on the secret wizard floor in Apt. 13B. He ends up brainwashed into serving Gorog until Alex, Justin, and Max defeat Gorog. He is last seen flashing himself, Hugh and Abercrombie Zombie back to the Wizard World. * ' (Andy Kindler; seasons 3-4) ‚Äì He is the head of the monster hunting council. He first appeared in \\"Three Monsters\\" when Justin reported Juliet and her parents as three monsters. Then he appears in \\"Night at the Lazerama\\" and again in \\"Wizards Exposed\\" when him, Professor Crumbs, and all the other wizards are kept captive in the secret government. He has also appeared in \\"Alex Gives Up\\" when he told Alex and Mason they have to break up because the werewolf always end up eating the mortal. His final appearance was the host of Alex, Justin, and Max's game-show style wizard competition in the series finale, \\"Who Will Be the Family Wizard\\". * ' (Moises Arias; season 3) ‚Äì The Conscience is Max's inner thoughts of right and wrong. He appeared in \\"The Chronicles of Moises Voice of Reason\\". Theresa and Harper were big fans of him but Alex wanted him gone. He always wore what Max wore accept he wore a tie and was smarter. He explained to Max that he was supposed to do the spell in front of a mirror, so that his mirror reflection becomes his conscience. He really helped Max out with his magic and school work. In part 3 of the saga Alex turned Conscience into a pair of socks and Max into a wash tub so now Conscience is in Max again. Also, when Conscience was separated from Max, his own \\"conscience\\" appeared for a short time. Max called him Roy, cause he didn't want anyone to know that he's his conscience, however, confusingly he gave him another alias to live under. * ' (Paulie Litt; seasons 1 and 3) ‚Äì Frankie/Joey is Justin's enemy in the first season. He is shown to like Alex. He once hated Justin so much that he hired a kid to beat him up but Justin got revenge. He once nearly found out about magic when he saw Dragon (their magical dog) that they had for sometime. He returned in season 3 with his name changed to Joey. So Justin hired him to serve crepes at a party except he quit when he saw Jerry as a bug. ==Minor characters== * ' (Lucy Hale) ‚Äì She is Justin's goth girlfriend in two episodes of season one. She is a new kid in school \\"Pop Me and We Both Go Down\\" and starts dating Justin in that episode but in \\"First Kiss\\" which was aired before \\"Pop Me and We Both Go Down\\" she isn't new and is already dating Justin (this is due to episodes being broadcast out of order, as based on the production codes for both episodes, \\"First Kiss\\" comes immediately after \\"Pop Me and We Both Go Down\\"). She is hated by Harper (due to her crush on Justin) and dresses in a goth fashion. She likes the color black and hates corporate America and \\"cool guys\\". It is said once that she's the new girl, but it is also said that in fifth grade she passed a note to Matt saying she liked him. She was also mentioned in the second season. In \\"First Kiss\\", Alex gets into a lot of trouble with her dad for trying to make Justin and Miranda's first kiss perfect because she overused a time-rewinding spell that is only supposed to be used for emergencies. Her last name is revealed to be Hampson in \\"Pop Me and We Both Go Down\\". * Mr. Stuffleby (Fred Willard) ‚Äì The character first appears in the episode \\"Make it Happen\\". His job is to make sure that the Russo children who do not win the family wizard competition know how to earn a living after the loss of their powers, i.e. he ensures they have a career- plan. He has an unusually large mouth. When asked, he reveals that his mother is one quarter gargoyle. As a result of this facial feature, he frequently swallows many bugs (which he does not mind, as he finds them tasty). The second time he appears is in the episode \\"Monster Hunter\\" after Justin casts his five thousandth spell, marking the end of his wizard training. * T.J. Taylor (Daryl Sabara) ‚Äì T.J. is another teenage wizard that attends Tribeca Prep with Alex, Justin, and Max. He was once friends with Alex until she took a charm off of his parents, which ended their friendship. He returned in season 2 when Alex takes another spell he cast off his ex-girlfriend Jenny Majorheely, who of which he turned into a 40-year-old woman. He does not appear in Season 3, possibly because he could have gotten expelled for what he did to the principal in Season 2 episode \\"Art Teacher\\", or it's possible he just left. His catchphrase is \\"I'll show you...\\" followed by a challenge he brags about, which usually backfires on him. * Officer Lamp (Michael A. Shepperd) ‚Äì Officer Lamp is a wizard police officer who partners with Officer Goblin. He says Max is a cute kid and that nobody can pronounce Goblin's name. * Officer Goblin (Brian Scolaro) ‚Äì Officer Goblin is a goblin/wizard police officer.

He is once seen by Harper in that episode, so he pretends to be \\"Jeremy from Science\\". He is first seen to have 4 legs in the Season 1 episode \\"Alex's Choice\\", but in the subsequent episodes, he has 2 legs. * The Mummy (John Eric Bentley) ‚Äì A mummy who kidnapped and bewitched Juliet to be his servant. He has an immense supernatural power, being able to hypnotize, levitate and make others intangible with his eye-beams, even if this person is behind a plasticine structure (and thus showing that all the supernatural beings has their own kind of magic that is distinct of human wizardry). When Justin, Alex, Max, and Mason track down Juliet, the Russos unwrap the Mummy's cloth and he turns into dust, leaving only his red glowing eyes (that no longer work). * Conscience's Conscience (Adam Irigoyen) ‚Äì He is Conscience's conscience when Conscience and Max get separated in Season 3 episode \\"Night at the Lazerama\\" and Conscience begins to develop his own conscience. * Joey (Zack Shada) ‚Äì Joey is in Dean's posse. He is the only who talks in the posse besides Dean. He seems to be Dean's right-hand man. He has all of Dean's (temporary) tattoos on his arm for inventory, except he doesn't have the unicorn. He complained when Dean gave Harper the unicorn first. He sometimes repeats what Dean says. In one episode, Alex reads Dean's mind and he says that he has to get Joey a date. * Ronald Longcape Jr. (Chad Duell) ‚Äì Ronald is an evil kid at WizTech. He was a love interest for Alex in season two's \\"Saving WizTech\\", while Alex was still in a relationship with Dean. Ronald shape-shifted into Dean and broke up with Alex so he could convince Alex into coming to WizTech with him; he froze the real Dean inside gelatin. Ronald then used Alex as part of his evil plan, to become the most powerful evil wizard at WizTech. His plan was foiled by Alex's love for Dean. * Ronald Longcape Sr. (Maurice Godin) ‚Äì Ronald Longcape Sr. is Ronald Longcape Jr.'s father. He only pretends to be evil. Justin tricks him into revealing who his evil son is, by asking his name, to which he stupidly answers by giving his name, not realizing how obvious his name is. * Dr. Mary- Beth Evilini (Octavia Spencer) ‚Äì Dr. Evilini was an evil teacher at WizTech. She got Justin to participate in the 12-Ball tournament (a wizard's version of ping pong), which could tell who is the most powerful young wizard. Her plan was to suck Justin's powers away at Volcano Land and take them for herself. Alex then found out about the plan from Evilini's messenger fish. Evilini's plan was later revealed after Alex used a truth spell on her. * Frankengirl/Frankie Stein (Perry Mattfeld) -Frankengirl is a female monster Justin created to guard his room from Alex in the season 3 episode \\"Franken Girl\\". Her brain is the motherboard from Justin's laptop, which Alex then shuts down. Justin later uses magic on Frankie into wanting to be Alex's friend, and Frankie gets Alex to join the cheer leading squad with her. She is based on Frankenstein's monster. She reappears in \\"Three Monsters\\", and was accidentally sent to monster prison along with one of Justin's robots. * Megan Russo (Carrie Genzel) ‚Äì Megan is the embittered aunt of Alex, Justin and Max, and sister of Jerry and Kelbo and sister-in-law of Theresa. She despises Jerry, because he opted to give his powers to Kelbo instead of her. She was introduced in \\"Retest\\" where the Russo's try to convince her to re-enter the wizard competition against her brothers; but her grudge against Jerry is ongoing and as a result she refuses to compete. Her personality is similar to Alex, as she is characterized as lazy, sarcastic, artistic and selfish. As punishment for her behavior, she is no longer considered a member of the Russo family. She lives in Paris, France and earns a living as an artist. Max thought she lived in Paris, Texas, so he teleported him, Alex and Justin there. * Susan (Tiffany Thornton) ‚Äì Susan is another one of Justin's academic friends. Alex grows fond of Zach (his name changed to Zeke later on)and Susan and tries to be their friend, making Justin jealous because he was friends with them first. When Susan invites Alex to watch a movie with them, Alex finds out that she is under the age restriction and uses magic to get into the movie, literally. Though she is Justin's friend, she doesn't seem to be very bright, as she told Alex she's gonna follow in a celebrity's footsteps of growing up on a farm, not realizing she is a little too late for that (as she's already a teenager). She also failed to realize Alex was physically in the movie, as she and Zeke (then known as Zack) came out of the movie telling Justin, weirded out, that there's a girl in the movie who looks and sounds just like Alex and was even wearing the same clothes as her. * MacGruder (Michael Monken) ‚Äì MacGruder is a popular kid at Tribeca Prep who gets everyone to do what he does.

Stevie mentions how despite their frequent arguments, and pranks she pulled on him, that they genuinely cared about each other. However, Stevie also tells Alex this is what led to them never talking again, as in concern about Alex having a similar relationship with Justin, hoping the same thing doesn't happen to them. Warren also appears to have a fainting problem, as he is often seen passing out in \\"The Good, The Bad, and the Alex,\\" where he later got his full powers from Stevie after Alex froze her into a gray colored ice. * Alfred (Andy Pessoa) ‚Äì Alfred is Max's best friend. He was only in two episodes of season 2 and that was Smarty Pants and Beware Wolf. He is shown to be much smarter than Max, and is also similar to the character William in That's So Raven. * Tutor Hatchback (Paulina Olszynski) - As her name describes, she is Max's magical tutor. Justin and Alex immediately take a liking to her, while Justin asks her out on a date, Alex starts hanging out with her as a new friend. Weirded out by realizing they both like the same person, who also likes them back, Justin and Alex start fighting for Tutor's attention and intentionally sabotaged Max's test after finding out that Tutor will have to leave if Max passes the test. Tutor eventually reveals that she is part-Elf, which explains why both Justin and Alex liked her so much, cause \\"Everybody loves Elves, you can't help it\\", Justin further explains that Elves have that magical quality that makes you love them. ==Film characters== Characters only appear in Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie. * Archie (Steve Valentine) ‚Äì Archie is a skilled, but unlucky and sardonic illusionist and con artist, and serves as the comical foil and anti-hero of the movie. He was a wizard until his brother defeated him in a wizard contest. He and Giselle constantly get in trouble with local authorities and try to convince the Russos in the search for \\"The Stone of Dreams\\", but fail due to Jerry and Theresa's distrust of them. However, after a time paradox caused by Alex that could destroy the entire family, she and Justin have no choice other than to find the object. During the movie, Archie serves as an assistant of Giselle, helping her due both to his crush on her and his own personal desire to get the Stone. Archie is shown to feel remorseful, however, when he secures the Stone from Giselle and gives it to Theresa ‚Äì after having used his wish to undo Giselle's. Despite his antagonistic nature for half of the course of the movie, he has shown a much kind and caring side, as he worried about Alex and Justin could possibly fall down and how he gave back the Stone of Dreams back to Theresa. * Giselle (Jennifer Alden) ‚Äì Giselle is a female wizard. She was turned into a parrot and is the driving force for the search of The Stone of Dreams through the manipulation of Archie and the Russos. When the Russos have secured the Stone, Giselle steals it in order to return to her human form. Throughout the movie, Archie is not aware of her cruelty, despite all her physical and emotional abuse, until she informs him that she is only using him. Unfortunately for her, Archie turns the tables by stealing the Stone from her and wishing her into a parrot again. It remains a mystery why she was originally turned into a parrot but it is suggested that this was a punishment for abusing her magic. Giselle is highly selfish, only caring for her own well being, not concerned with other people's problems. * Javier (Xavier Enrique Torres) ‚Äì seen in Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie. He was a host at the hotel the Russos were staying at in the Caribbean. Alex had a small crush on him, but soon turned him down once she realized how she would rather spend time with her family, and how little he really cares for her. ==TV special characters== Characters only appear in The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex. * Dominic (Beau Mirchoff) - Dominic is an evil, manipulative, self-absorbed wizard.

Dominic comforts Alex when she's depressed over her parents thinking she's not mature enough to be the family wizard. Dominic gives Alex a friendship bracelet, which is later revealed to be an enchanted bracelet which is used to hold Max, Theresa, Jerry, Harper, and Mason captive. When Alex divides herself into a Good Alex and Evil Alex, Dominic joins forces with Evil Alex to take over the world. After Alex destroys the Evil Alex (so she thinks), Dominic tries to flirt with Alex one last time in order to get her to join forces with him. Mason is furious and pushes Dominic over the Leaning Tower of Pisa, sending him to his death. Dominic reveals to Alex that he is the nephew of her former enemy, the Angel of Darkness, Gorog, because of this, he may not be a full wizard and may be an angel of darkness himself, or Gorog may have had a wizard brother or sister. * Carmela (Natalia Nogulich) - Carmela is an Italian cousin of Jerry Russo, and was a wizard in training with him. Carmela is the mother of two wizard in training kids, Bianca and Gino. A running gag throughout the film is that Carmela tickles Jerry every time she wants him to do something. Carmela and her family are rich and live in a huge villa in Italy with many servants and house workers. Carmela and the other Russo's are big fans of Jerry's daughter Alex, the family wizard and most powerful wizard of her generation.

When Max first sees her, he tries to pursue her, but when he tries to kiss her, she smacks him.

At the end of the film, Max tells Francesca that he hopes to see her again and hopes she'll wait for him to return, Francesca tries to tell him that they're cousins and he's stupid, but Max just thinks he's wearing her down. ==Guest characters== * Heidi Swedberg as Miss Majorheely (\\"Art Teacher\\") 2.15 (2009) * Austin Butler as George (\\"Positive Alex\\") 3.10 (2010) * Cindy Crawford as Bebe Rockford (\\"Fashion Week\\") 2.13 (2009) * Rachel Dratch as Future Harper/\\"H.J.

At the age of 22, and with no connections in the music industry, she was signed in 1991 to Sony 550 when her boyfriend sent a demo to the label, and they quickly contacted her. == Career == Des'ree's debut single, \\"Feel So High\\", was released in August 1991, a mere 12 weeks after her signing. The single did not initially reach the UK top 40, but hit #13 when it was re-released in January 1992. Her debut album Mind Adventures was released in February 1992. It received good reviews and hit the top 30 in the UK. She spent 1992 touring as the opening act to Simply Red. In 1993, Des'ree collaborated with Terence Trent D'Arby on the song \\"Delicate\\", which was released as a single and hit the UK top 20 and the US top 100. She ended the year singing with a host of other artists at the first concert of secular music at the Vatican City, on 23 December 1993, which was aired on Italian TV. The concert, named Concerto di Natale, has been held with different artists every Christmas in the years since. In 1994, her single \\"You Gotta Be\\" hit the Billboard Hot 100 Top 5, peaking at number 5, and was a hit in the UK three times. \\"You Gotta Be\\" became the most played music video on VH1 and remained on the Billboard Recurrent Airplay Chart for 80 weeks. Following the single's success, Des'ree's second album, I Ain't Movin', sold in excess of 2.5 million copies worldwide. Her success led to an American tour with Seal in 1995. The following year, she contributed the song \\"Kissing You\\" to the soundtrack of the film William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. She appears in the film singing the song. In 1997, her song \\"Crazy Maze\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and Tim Robbins. In the same year she provided vocals on \\"Plenty Lovin'\\" on Steve Winwood's album Junction Seven. In 1998, her single \\"Life\\" became a hit in Europe, reaching number 1 in many countries, as well as in Japan. In 1999, she won a Brit Award for the British Female Solo Artist category. The album from which the single was taken, Supernatural, was also released in 1998 to mostly positive reviews. It was somewhat successful in the UK, but was a commercial flop in the United States. In 2007, Des'ree also notably won a BBC poll for the \\"worst lyrics ever\\" for the single, the offending lyrics being \\"I don't want to see a ghost/it's the sight that I fear most/I'd rather have a piece of toast/watch the evening news\\". In 1999, she sang The Beatles' song \\"Blackbird\\" at a concert in honour of Linda McCartney. At the concert, she met the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo and she collaborated with them on a cover of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\", which was released in late 1999. After that, Des'ree put her music career on hold to focus on her private life and disappeared from the public eye. A compilation of rare songs and live tracks, Endangered Species, was released in 2000. In 2001 she contributed vocals to the charity single \\"Wake Up The Morning\\", which was released in honour of the death of Damilola Taylor. Billed as Together As One, other contributors to the song were Gabrielle, Andrew Roachford and Courtney Pine. In 2002, she contributed a sung sonnet from William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice to the various artists album When Love Speaks. Sony released Dream Soldier in 2003. Only one track from the album was released as a single, \\"It's Okay\\", which peaked in the UK at number 69. The single did not chart in the US. The video, directed by Jake Nava, was shot in London's Notting Hill. \\"Dream Soldier\\" was not a critical or commercial success. Des'ree was subsequently dropped by her label, Sony/550 Music, following the release of the album in March 2003. Shortly afterwards, she took a hiatus from music to focus on her interest in naturopathy, also training as a nutritionist. In 2008 she came out of her hiatus to perform at the O2 Arena for Young Voices' \\"The Big Sing\\" charity concert. She helped break the record for \\"most people simultaneously singing the same song\\" by leading 600,000 schoolchildren across the United Kingdom in singing \\"You Gotta Be\\". In 2011, she performed \\"You Gotta Be\\" at the wedding for George Medal recipient Paul Jacobs. That same year, she sung a lullaby on naturopath Julie Langton-Smith's sleep therapy CD Sleep Talk Lullaby. In September 2019, it was revealed that her fifth album, her first in sixteen years, would be titled A Love Story and be released by her own label Stargazer Records on October 11. She had begun work on the album in 2012, but took a break to care for her mother. ==Other work== \\"Silent Hero\\", written by Des'ree and Prince Sampson, featured in Spike Lee's 1995 film Clockers, \\"Feel So High\\", written by Des'ree and Michael Graves, featured in the 1996 film Set It Off, and \\"You Gotta Be\\" featured in The Object of My Affection and The Next Karate Kid. In 1997, Des'ree's hit \\"Feel So High\\" was interpolated into the Janet Jackson song \\"Got 'Til It's Gone\\" from Jackson's CD The Velvet Rope without due credit to Des'ree as a contributor. The maxi single, however, lists Des'ree and Michael Graves as two of the song's writers,Q Magazine, July 1998. after winning a lawsuit against Jackson.Ian Hyland, \\"Des'ree wins pounds 2m in Janet Jackson song copying war.\\", Sunday Mirror, 31 May 1998 She also considered suing Robyn and Cleopatra due to the similarities between their songs (\\"Show Me Love\\" and \\"Life Ain't Easy\\" respectively) and \\"Feel So High\\"; however, nothing came of it. In 1999 she recorded a duet with Ladysmith Black Mambazo on a cover of the Bill Withers song \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\". == Awards == Des'ree has won several awards, including a Brit Award, an Ivor Novello Award, World Music Award, Urban Music Award and a BMI Award for over five million plays of \\"You Gotta Be\\" in America alone. Des'ree also won a BBC poll for \\"Worst Pop Lyricist\\" for the 1998 single \\"Life\\", though it went to number 1 in Japan, Spain and several other European countries. ==Personal life== Des'ree is a vegetarian.

An animal lover, she ran a small entrepreneurial farm and animal husbandry business, and enjoyed celebrity status from her many pornographic films in which she engaged in sex acts with animals. An icon and celebrity for a time, with her own successful business, she failed to make the transition to more mainstream movies when market sentiment changed and she became impoverished and could no longer care for her animals. She became an alcoholic and died several years later. ==Early life== The daughter of a devout Christian mother and an absentee military father, Joensen grew up in the Copenhagen suburb of Hundige. Her mother was often physically abusive, sometimes violently so, and would whip her. At the age of 12, her mother suspected her of having been raped by a stranger in a railway stationThe source for information on her pre- porn career is the Channel 4 documentary Dark Side of Porn, in its study of Animal Farm. ‚Äî her Danish biography and 1980s interview say that they \\"just talked\\" or that she was \\"nearly raped\\", but her mother believed that she had actually been raped.Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201341/http://alldogs.xtremebeast.com/bodil/bio.html. On returning home to tell her mother, she was beaten and blamed for the incident. Seeking a means to retaliate, she vowed to her mother that when she grew up she would have sex with boars, commenting in an interview that her mother was \\"so shocked, she thought I was allied to the Devil\\". Turning to animals for affection, her dog became her best friend, companion and lover, and she wore a locket containing his picture for the rest of her life. Initially, after leaving home at 15, Joensen found work on a farm in a conservative area of Denmark. Her landlord, the farmer Gunnar Nielsen, commented, \\"She was passionate about animals.\\" He added that she was entranced by the sight of animals breeding, an activity she stated she found \\"wonderful\\" to help with. She later left to set up her own breeding farm, \\"Insemination Central,\\" which became popular for her ability to handle aggressive animals such as boars, and was then ruined by country gossip, spread principally by farmers' wives who were unhappy at the prospect of their husbands working with a young single girl on farm business. Friends, such as Johan Kirk, commented that she \\"was never given much of a chance\\" by such people. She commented later, \\"Nine out of ten men wanted to fuck me, and their wives hated me.\\" ==Pornography career== Launched in the context of a failing business and attempts to remain solvent in order to keep her livestock and home, her career in pornography began in 1962 at age 17, when she appeared in \\"light fetish\\" pornography, before establishing herself in the bestiality subgenre in 1969 at around age 25. She starred in a number of feature films and shorts for companies such as Color Climax Corporation, as well as for the pornographer Ole Ege, in which she and other actors had sex with various animal species. Between 1969 and 1972, she starred with animals in over 40 movies. The movie A Summer's Day (1971) was released in the U.S. as Animal Lover (1970). She wrote a column answering readers' letters in SCREW magazine.\\"Ask Bodil,\\" SCREW, March 11, 1974. . Retrieved on 2015-01-15 from https://40.media.tumblr.com/bbb021113e86cde0667c07fbb18ffe87/tumblr_n8etq1FEdc1sbtct0o2_1280.jpg. In this genre, Joensen drew special attention worldwide as the Boar Girl, a reputation earned from her live performances with swine, as well as her participation in films shot with pigs on her own breeding centre. The movies she appeared in combined a peculiar blend of the \\"tolerant contemporary Danish society\\" image and Scandinavian rustic nostalgia. Her Danish biography comments of her domestic life: > \\"The scene is classic Rabelaisian more than anything else, harkening back to > the Middle Ages when people and their animals often did live in the same > house.\\" The award-winning documentary Bodil Joensen - en sommerdag juli 1970 (1970), by Shinkichi Tajiri, shows her living with her animals on her farm during this era, including their care, her affection for them, and her sexual life, entirely to the tune of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony (Pastoral)‚Äîan involuntary artistic choice that became necessary when the original soundtrack recordings became unavailable through a gaffe. At the time, she lived with \\"two rabbits, seven dogs, a dozen pigs, some cats, a guinea pig, a mare and a beautiful black stallion named Dreamlight\\". Her Danish biographer commented later that she seemed to be a very open, warm-hearted person, \\"very at home with nature\\": > \\"When she plays her erotic game with the dog or horse, it is not only a > sexual curiosity, it is an erotic play with animals she loves and who are > devoted to her.\\" The documentary was the surprising winner of the Grand Prize of the Wet Dream Film Festival, held in Amsterdam from 26-29 November 1970, where it premiered. Joensen immediately became an underground celebrity, and drew attention from other documentary makers as well as tourists towards her expanding farm. ==Later life and death== By the early 1970s, Joensen had managed to achieve her goal of living on her own farm with her daughter (born c. 1972),In her 1980 interview, she stated, \\"I live with my ... eight year old daughter\\". as well with her companion/partner. Reference material suggests various relationship roles, varying from companionship to partner. Some refer to Knud P. Andersen as a companion, some as a partner; one suggests platonic friendship. The source material is ambiguous. In The Dark Side of Porn: The Real Animal Farm, Joensen is quoted as saying \\"...I'm bored when I'm alone, and so is he, so we're good company for each other.\\" In her 1980 interview Joensen stated, \\"I live with my man for 10 years\\". Joensen helped finance the farm by allowing sex tourists to visit it and make private films with her animals. Friends comment about that time that she was \\"easily exploited by almost anyone with a camera\\" and that the visitors \\"just wanted pornography; they didn't care about knowing her\\". Neighbours, once friendly, turned dark and hostile, forcing her to move repeatedly. As the Danish adult industry began looking to other content, Joensen failed to make the transition from porn to other movies, and her financial stability and life began to fall apart. After 1972, she experienced a sharp deterioration, undergoing very obvious physical and psychological changes, including depression, first working as a \\"live show\\" and \\"sexual roleplay\\" girl. By 1980, with little remaining means of income and spiralling debt, the only work she was able to retain was a hectic routine of small scale live shows most evenings. Tajiri commented, sadly: \\"Accepting the 'Grand Prix' at the first Wet Dream Film Festival was the worst mistake we made with our film, but we were too flattered by the response at the time to realize it\\". Joensen commented in a 1980 interview: Her life falling apart, Joensen became dependent on alcohol, and progressively less able to care for her animals. In 1981, following a change in Denmark's laws, she was raided for \\"sickening\\" animal neglect,This included, according to \\"The Dark Side of Porn,\\" animals in a metre of excrement, and rotting animal carcasses. and went to prison for 30 days. None of her animals ultimately survived, and Bodil herself did not recover after they were euthanised. With little left, she turned to street prostitution to support herself, her partner (an alcoholic himself) and daughter, although friends comment that even then, she did not want to be with people this way ‚Äì all she wanted was her animals, as it once had been. Resorting to exchanging any sexual favour for alcohol and tranquilizers, she stated in her final interview that \\"in my position it is hard to turn down anything, no matter how disgusting... for me, staying alive in the hooking business is hell\\". Joensen gave her last interview in 1980 and died in 1985. Many believed her to have committed suicide. However, the April 2006 UK documentary titled The Dark Side of Porn: The Real Animal Farm traced the production of the notorious underground film known as Animal Farm from excerpts of her many bestiality films. In this documentary, it was stated, by a close friend of Joensen's, that she died on 3 January 1985 from cirrhosis of the liver. She was 40 years of age at the time of her death. ==ReferencesBodil Joensen on Find A Grave Category:1944 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Deaths from cirrhosis Category:Danish female adult models Category:Danish pornographic film actresses Category:Zoophilia Category:Animal pornography Category:20th-century Danish actresses Category:Alcohol-related deaths in Denmark ","title":"Bodil Joensen"},{"id":"19337621","text":"The British grave of The Unknown Warrior (often known as 'The Tomb of The Unknown Warrior') holds an unidentified British soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War.Hanson, Chapters 23 & 24 He was buried in Westminster Abbey, London on 11 November 1920, simultaneously with a similar interment of a French unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in France, making both graves the first to honour the unknown dead of the First World War. It is the first example of a tomb of the Unknown Soldier. ==History of the Unknown Warrior== Origins The coffin of the Unknown Warrior in state in the Abbey in 1920, before burial. The idea of a Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was first conceived in 1916 by the Reverend David Railton, who, while serving as an army chaplain on the Western Front, had seen a grave marked by a rough cross, which bore the pencil-written legend 'An Unknown British Soldier'. He wrote to the Dean of Westminster in 1920 proposing that an unidentified British soldier from the battlefields in France be buried with due ceremony in Westminster Abbey \\"amongst the kings\\" to represent the many hundreds of thousands of Empire dead. The idea was strongly supported by the Dean and the Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Selection, arrival and ceremony Burial of The Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey, with King George V in attendance, 1920. Arrangements were placed in the hands of Lord Curzon of Kedleston who prepared in committee the service and location. Suitable remains were exhumed from various battlefields and brought to the chapel at Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise near Arras, France on the night of 7 November 1920. The bodies were received by the Reverend George Kendall OBE. Brigadier L.J. Wyatt and Lieutenant Colonel E.A.S. Gell of the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries went into the chapel alone. The remains were then placed in four plain coffins each covered by Union Flags: the two officers did not know from which battlefield any individual soldier had come. Brigadier Wyatt with closed eyes rested his hand on one of the coffins. The other soldiers were then taken away for reburial by Kendall. The coffin of the unknown warrior then stayed at the chapel overnight and on the afternoon of 8 November, it was transferred under guard and escorted by Kendall, with troops lining the route, from Ste Pol to the medieval castle within the ancient citadel at Boulogne. For the occasion, the castle library was transformed into a chapelle ardente: a company from the French 8th Infantry Regiment, recently awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur en masse, stood vigil overnight. The following morning, two undertakers entered the castle library and placed the coffin into a casket of the oak timbers of trees from Hampton Court Palace. The casket was banded with iron, and a medieval crusader's sword chosen by King George V personally from the Royal Collection was affixed to the top and surmounted by an iron shield bearing the inscription 'A British Warrior who fell in the Great War 1914‚Äì1918 for King and Country'. The casket was then placed onto a French military wagon, drawn by six black horses. At 10:30 a.m., all the church bells of Boulogne tolled; the massed trumpets of the French cavalry and the bugles of the French infantry played Aux Champs (the French \\"Last Post\\"). Then, the mile-long procession‚Äîled by one thousand local schoolchildren and escorted by a division of French troops‚Äîmade its way down to the harbour. At the quayside, Marshal Foch saluted the casket before it was carried up the gangway of the destroyer, , and piped aboard with an admiral's call. The Verdun slipped anchor just before noon and was joined by an escort of six battleships. As the flotilla carrying the casket closed on Dover Castle it received a 19-gun Field Marshal's salute. It was landed at Dover Marine Railway Station at the Western Docks on 10 November. The body of the Unknown Warrior was carried to London in South Eastern and Chatham Railway General Utility Van No.132, which had previously carried the bodies of Edith Cavell and Charles Fryatt. The van has been preserved by the Kent and East Sussex Railway. The train went to Victoria Station, where it arrived at platform 8 at 8:32 p.m. that evening and remained overnight. (A plaque at Victoria Station marks the site: every year on 10 November, a small Remembrance service, organised by The Western Front Association, takes place between platforms 8 and 9.) On the morning of 11 November 1920, the casket was placed onto a gun carriage of the Royal Horse Artillery (N Battery RHA) and drawn by six horses through immense and silent crowds. As the cortege set off, a further Field Marshal's salute was fired in Hyde Park.Memorial Services (November 11th) Committee, Maurice Hankey, Cabinet Office Papers, 1915‚Äì1978, The National Archives. (CAB 24/114). The route followed was Hyde Park Corner, The Mall, and to Whitehall where the Cenotaph, a \\"symbolic empty tomb\\",Holmes, p. 630 was unveiled by King-Emperor George V. The cort√®ge was then followed by The King, the Royal Family and ministers of state to Westminster Abbey, where the casket was borne into the West Nave of the Abbey flanked by a guard of honour of one hundred recipients of the Victoria Cross. The guests of honour were a group of about one hundred women. They had been chosen because they had each lost their husband and all their sons in the war. \\"Every woman so bereft who applied for a place got it\\". The coffin was then interred in the far western end of the Nave, only a few feet from the entrance, in soil brought from each of the main battlefields, and covered with a silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of thousands of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of catharsis for collective mourning on a scale not previously known. The grave was then capped with a black Belgian marble stone (the only tombstone in the Abbey on which it is forbidden to walk) featuring this inscription, composed by Herbert Edward Ryle, Dean of Westminster, engraved with brass from melted down wartime ammunition. Beneath this stone rests the body Of a British warrior Unknown by name or rank Brought from France to lie among The most illustrious of the land And buried here on Armistice Day 11 Nov: 1920, in the presence of His Majesty King George V His Ministers of State The Chiefs of his forces And a vast concourse of the nation Thus are commemorated the many Multitudes who during the Great War of 1914 - 1918 gave the most that Man can give life itself For God For King and country For loved ones home and empire For the sacred cause of justice and The freedom of the world They buried him among the kings because he Had done good toward God and toward His house Around the main inscription are four New Testament quotations: The Lord knoweth them that are his (top; ) Unknown and yet well known, dying and behold we live (side; ) Greater love hath no man than this (side; ) In Christ shall all be made alive (base; ) Later history The van in which the body of the Unknown Warrior was carried, before restoration in 2010. A year later, on 17 October 1921, the unknown warrior was given the United States' highest award for valour, the Medal of Honor, from the hand of General John Pershing; it hangs on a pillar close to the tomb. On 11 November 1921, the American Unknown Soldier was reciprocally awarded the Victoria Cross. When Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married the future King George VI on 26 April 1923, she laid her bouquet at the Tomb on her way into the Abbey, as a tribute to her brother Fergus who had died at the Battle of Loos in 1915 (and whose name was then listed among those of the missing on the Loos Memorial, although in 2012 a new headstone was erected in the Quarry Cemetery, Vermelles). Royal brides married at the Abbey now have their bouquets laid on the tomb the day after the wedding and all of the official wedding photographs have been taken. It is also the only tomb not to have been covered by a special red carpet for the wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Before she died in 2002, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (the same aforementioned Elizabeth (Bowes-Lyon) who first laid her wedding bouquet at the tomb) expressed the wish for her wreath to be placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. Her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, laid the wreath the day after the funeral. The British Unknown Warrior came 76th in the 100 Great Britons poll. The LMS-Patriot Project a charitable organisation, is building a new steam locomotive that will carry the name The Unknown Warrior. The new loco has been endorsed by the Royal British Legion as the new National Memorial Engine. A public appeal to build the locomotive was launched in 2008. The Unknown Warrior was expected to be complete by January 2019‚Äîone year late of the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice.Replica Coffin of the Unknown Warrior; interior of the Cavell Van, BodiamHeads of state from over 70 countries have lain wreaths in memoriam of the Unknown Warrior. ==Related memorials== There have been three related memorials erected since 1920 for the Unknown Warrior: * St. Pol where the Unknown Warrior was selected * Dover harbour at the cruise terminal where the Unknown Warrior was brought ashore * Victoria Station, London, where the Unknown Warrior rested before his burial on 11 November ==See also== * Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ‚Äì includes a listing of unknown soldier memorials around the world * Tower Hill Memorial * World War I memorials ==References==  Citations   Works cited  * * ==Further reading== * The Story of the British Unknown Warrior, M.

It is currently housed in Martin Hall. ==History== The WVU Reed College of Media was formerly known as the WVU P.I. Reed School of Journalism until July 1, 2014. It was created by Dr. Perley Isaac Reed. Dr. Reed arrived at West Virginia University in 1920 and was assigned to teach English and Journalism courses at the College of the Arts and Sciences. Soon, Reed made it his personal mission to expand the course load, which also included journalism history, editing, advertisement writing and trade and industrial journalism, in just a few years. To gain further momentum, Reed used his involvement in the West Virginia State Newspaper Council to improve the press and its profitability. Using their political power they applied pressure and in the year 1927, Journalism became a department and later became a school in 1939. The school did not have a building to call its home until 1953 when Martin Hall was given to the Journalism school. Prior to that, it had occupied only several rooms nearby in Woodburn Hall. ==Location== West Virginia University's Reed College of Media, has been located in Martin Hall since 1954. Although the College only began its stay at Martin Hall fifty four years ago, Martin Hall has been part of Woodburn Circle for decades longer. On June 16, 1869, an assembly of people gathered on the property that would ultimately be used to build West Virginia University's first new building. It took only $16,000 that was raised through the sale of the Monongalia Academy building, to build Martin Hall. Martin Hall home of the WVU College of Media In 1870, Martin Hall was erected by West Virginia University specifically for the use of students and faculty. It holds the distinction of being the oldest academic building on the West Virginia University campus. Martin was modeled after French architecture. The roof slopes down at the sides and is flattened at the top which comes from the idea of a ‚ÄúMansard roof‚Äù which is a style that originated in Paris, France. The original hall built in 1870 looks much like it does today with only minor rehabilitation to improve the inside. In 1911, the clock that was located in a tower at the top of Martin was removed and placed on top of Woodburn hall, where it has remained the focal point of Woodburn Circle for almost one hundred years. Throughout 1977-1978, Martin Hall underwent rehabilitation and a large addition was built onto the side of the building. ==Clubs== The WVU Reed College of Media offers a variety of clubs. Each club is student-run and is sponsored by a faculty member from the College of Media.

His spiritual life and work centered on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola. He was also renowned for challenging Jansenism by distributing books and other publications that promoted the moral theology of St. Alphonsus Liguori, as well as establishing societies to continue this work. Lanteri's cause for canonization was begun in 1920 and he was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI in 1965. ==Personal charism== Asceticism Lanteri's life was marked by physical suffering from his pulmonary conditions that restricted his public speaking ability and his poor eyesight, because of which he often sought an assistant to read aloud to him. At age seventeen he sought the quiet and prayer of Carthusian monastic life and, although his entry was prevented by fragile health, he maintained this desire for silence and solitude throughout his life. Witnesses of his life suggest that he reached the heights of mystical prayer during his years of house-arrest under Napoleon (1811‚Äì14). Devotion to Mary At the death of Lanteri's mother in 1763, his father presented the four-year-old boy to a statue of Mary in their parish church, telling him, \\"She is your mother now.\\" From this time, Lanteri maintained a deep and persistent devotion to Mary and communicated it to his colleagues and disciples, going so far as to declare that the religious institute he founded was principally the work of Mary and not his own.Gallagher pp. 173, 220. ==Good books== After meeting Nicolas Joseph Albert von Diessbach (25 February 1732 ‚Äì 22 December 1798) in Torino in 1779,Gallagher p. 25. Lanteri adopted Diessbach's passion for distributing good books as a remedy with both spiritual and human dimensions. Diessbach himself was converted from the Calvinism of his youth and the agnosticism of his military years by the chance reading of a good book that passionately expounded the truths of Catholicism. With Lanteri he established a close-knit group of laypeople and clergy called the (Christian Friendship), who worked together to disseminate well-written, edifying books that inspired people to grow in their faith, contribute to society and cope with the unwelcome changes in their lives at the dawn of the French Revolution. The Amicizia maintained catalogues of such books and managed a covert lending library in support of this work. Lanteri also communicated this passion for good literature to the Oblates of the Virgin Mary.Gallagher p. 173. Spirituality of discernment Diessbach, a former Jesuit (the Society of Jesus having been suppressed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773) also introduced Lanteri to the spiritual patrimony of St. Ignatius of Loyola, particularly his Spiritual Exercises. In this series of guided meditations through which one becomes more attentive to the movements of the heart (discernment) and the accompanying rules for adapting them to individuals' particular spiritual needs, Lanteri recognized a powerful instrument for pastoral ministry, especially for conversion. He applied them continuously in his own life and prayer, recommended them to others, and established groups of people whom he trained to do the same. These groups eventually yielded to the formation of the (Priestly Residence)Gallagher p. 32. and the Oblates of the Virgin Mary, whom he charged to continue this work. == Contribution to moral theology == Lanteri worked to turn the tide of Jansenism, which had become popular in Europe in the preceding centuries and retained many adherents in his time, though formally condemned by the Catholic Church. He himself held certain Jansenistic tenets at age 20, but through the influence of Jesuit Diessbach he encountered the moral theology of Alphonsus Liguori and definitively rejected Jansenism.Gallagher pp. 23‚Äì25. Lanteri subsequently promoted Liguorian moral theology, which is based on mercy and hope in contrast with a condemning and rigoristic Jansenism, both personally as he counseled people and young priests and institutionally through various publications. Of particular note is his 1823 book, published anonymously in French, entitled (Reflections on the Holiness and Teaching of Blessed Liguori). It was soon translated into Italian and then Spanish. In this prose work, Lanteri describes the character of Liguori and his doctrinal teaching, particularly his moral theology. The book includes an exhaustive catalogue of Liguori's written works, which was a substantial aid to the Vatican committee reviewing Alphonsus' life and works. Scholars such as Guerber have shown that Lanteri, together with Diessbach and their associates in Northern Italy and France, was in large part responsible for the widespread familiarity among clergy with the moral theology of Alphonsus Liguori and its usefulness to both combat Jansenism and accomplish their evangelical mission. One persistent point of Lanteri's teaching was to always follow the magisterium of the Church; the writings of Alphonsus Liguori had been officially declared \\"free of anything worthy of censure\\", and Lanteri always used this fact in support of his own promotion of Liguori's teaching.Gallagher p. 159. ==Writings== * * ==References * PioBrunoLanteri.org, an online archive of his writings * BrunoLanteri.org, the website promoting awareness of his process for canonization Category:1759 births Category:1830 deaths Category:18th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities ","title":"Bruno Lanteri"},{"id":"19337804","text":"The is a commuter electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu) in Japan since 2008. ==Formation== Trains are formed as follows. {  - !

It served as the third and final single from her second studio album Fear of Flying (2000). Originally featured on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Bait, the song was one of the two tracks added to the re-release edition of Fear of Flying on November 7, 2000. It was written and composed by Jimmy Jam, Harrison, Terry Lewis, Alexander Richbourg, and Tony Tolbert. Lyrically, \\"Free\\" addresses on independence. The song received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, musically comparing it to Janet Jackson‚Äôs third studio album Control (1986). \\"Free\\" underperformed on Billboards US Hot 100; peaking and spending two non- consecutive weeks at number forty-two. It was the second single by Harrison that failed to reach the coveted Top 40. It performed even worse on Billboards component Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart peaking at a moderately low number fifty-two. Internationally, the single reached the Top Five in Australia and Top 20 in the UK. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by director Dave Meyers. Harrison incorporates various dance routines throughout the video, choreographed by Brian \\"Footwork\\" Green, which won him an ACA (American Choreographer's Award) in 2001. ==Background and composition== Before being added to the re-release edition of Fear of Flying, \\"Free\\" was initially released as the first single to feature film Bait (2000) starring Jamie Foxx. Co-written by M√Ωa, \\"Free\\" is in the key of B minor. The song's tempo is set at a moderate dance beat at 112 beats per minute in common time. Harrison's vocal range span from a F3 to D5. The lyrics of \\"Free\\" are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. M√Ωa opens the song with brief spoken lyrics. She begins the first verse, followed by the chorus leading her into the second verse. The song continues to the bridge, chorus, then fades out with M√Ωa's chant. ==Critical reception== Free garnered mixed to positive reviews. Billboard compared the song to production duo Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis earlier work with Janet Jackson and added: \\"Free\\" is all about being a strong, self-sufficient, independent woman‚Äîa nearly ubiquitous theme these days among female artists (check out currents songs by Destiny‚Äôs Child, Kandi, and Chant√© Moore). But what comes across strongest in this song is the trademark Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis sound. As a matter of fact, the track practically rips off what we know as the Janet Jackson style, with M√Ωa‚Äôs fragile voice possessing many of the same qualities as Janet‚Äôs. Acknowledging, \\"Free\\" is just a little too girly pop-sounding, even for the pop audience out there today.\\" NME gave the song a mixed review and rated the single four out of ten stars writing, \\"R&B;'s enduring (annoying?) cutesy pie has done the double. Released a single that ties in with her butter wouldn't melt image -how else to you explain the lyrics, \\"I'm me/single, sexy and free\\"? Yes, make no mistake, this is M√Ωa trapped in Lolita land (check out the video below) not sure if she's the insolent girlfriend ('Case of the Ex') or, as this track would paint her, a pre-teen with no idea of her temptation, but aware that she has 'something about her'. Musically, this is right up Janet Jackson's old alley - more so before Janet found 'Control' and became obsessed with sex. So, if you're a chick who's so cute you turn yourself on, but still a virgin, this is your anthem. But of course, you'll be singing it to yourself, cos you love yourself so darn much, won't ya?! Writing for Yahoo! Music UK, Cyd Jaymes described \\"Free\\" as a mighty, bass-laden funky R&B; groove with hints of Janet Jackson, Destiny's Child and J.Lo which should steam up many a window. ==Chart performance== In the United States, for the issue dated week of February 3, 2001, \\"Free\\" was Billboard's Hot 100 ‚ÄúHot Shot Debut‚Äù of the week debuting at number seventy-six. In its third week it ascended from 74-61 issue dated week of February 17, 2001. The song reached its peak at number forty-one in its fourth week ascending from 61-41 issue dated week of February 24, 2001. It spent a total of 17 consecutive weeks on the chart. It was the second single released by Harrison to miss the coveted pop Top 40. On Billboards Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart the song failed to achieve success; peaking at a moderately low fifty-two issue dated week of December 28, 2000. Despite its chart placements in the U.S., \\"Free\\" was moderately successful in international territories. In Australia, \\"Free\\" became her second Top Ten (solo) third overall, it debuted at number eleven during the week of June 3, 2001. It reached its peak at number four in its sixth week during the week of July 8, 2001. It spent a total of 21 consecutive weeks altogether on the chart and was certified platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 70,000 units sold. It found success in the UK where it became her fifth Top 20 hit, it debuted and peaked at number eleven during the week of June 9, 2001. It spent a total of 6 consecutive weeks on the chart. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Free\\" was directed by Dave Meyers. Harrison explained to LAUNCH how involved she was in the making of \\"Free\\" speaking on following: the roller-skating, party dances, locking and Waacking were actually of all her concepts. Harrison got together with an underground dancer/choreographer named Brian Green (a.k.a. Brian \\" Footwork \\" Green ), and they put it together on their own. M√Ωa revealed it was a struggle and a fight working with someone underground because he's not established, but continued by saying that was the best thing about making \\"Free\\" because I knew him and what he had to offer and it was great. \\"Free\\" premiered on MTV's TRL and BET's 106 & Park on November 16, 2000. ==Track listings== ;Germany CD Single # Free (Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Video Edit) ‚Äì 4:08 # Free (Milk & Sugar Club Mix) ‚Äì 7:38 ;Germany Free Remixes 12\\" Single & Vinyl Single :A1 Free (Milk & Sugar Club Remix) ‚Äì 7:38 :A2 Free (Milk & Sugar Club Instrumental) ‚Äì 7:38 :B1 Free (Milk & Sugar Vocal Dub) ‚Äì 5:52 :B2 Free (Milk & Sugar Dub Instrumental) ‚Äì 5:52 ;Germany 12\\" Single :A1 Free (Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Version) ‚Äì 5:21 :A2 Free (Ricco Version) ‚Äì 4:11 :B1 Free (Howard Cross Version) ‚Äì 3:14 :B2 Free (Instrumental) ‚Äì 4:11 ;Germany Maxi-Single # Free (Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Video Edit) ‚Äì 4:08 # Free (Ricco Version) ‚Äì 4:11 # Free (Milk & Sugar Radio Mix) ‚Äì 3:23 # Free (Howard & Cross Version) ‚Äì 3:14 # Free (Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Version) ‚Äì 5:21 # Free (Milk & Sugar Club Mix) ‚Äì 7:38 ;U.S. 12\\" Single & Vinyl Single :A1 Free (Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Version) ‚Äì 5:21 :A2 Free (Ricco Version) ‚Äì 4:11 :B1 Free (Howard Cross Version) ‚Äì 3:14 :B2 Free (Instrumental) ‚Äì 4:11 ;European Maxi-Single # Free ‚Äì 5:21 # Free (X.Men Vocal Mix) ‚Äì 4:19 # Free (Ricco Version) ‚Äì 4:11 # Free (Video CD-ROM) ;UK 12\\" Single & Vinyl Single :A1 Free (X.Men Vocal Mix) ‚Äì 4:19 :A2 Free (Milk & Sugar Club Mix) ‚Äì 7:38 :B1 Free (X.Men Dub) ‚Äì 4:56 :B2 Free (Milk & Sugar Dub) ;UK 12\\" Single & Vinyl Single :A1 Free (Original Mix) :A2 Free (Ricco Version) :B Free (X-Men Vocal Mix) ;Australia Maxi-Single & Enhanced CD # Free (Album Version) ‚Äì 5:16 # Free (Milk & Sugar Mix) ‚Äì 3:23 # Free (Howard & Cross Version) ‚Äì 4:20 # Case Of The Ex (M√Ωa Remix) ‚Äì 3:31 # Free (Milk & Sugar Club Mix) ‚Äì 7:28 # Free (Milk & Sugar Club Mix Instrumental) ‚Äì 7:28 # Video Free ==Credits and personnel== *Produced by: Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis *Co-produced by: 'Big Jim' Wright *Engineered & Mixed by: Steve Hodge *Assistant Engineers: Brad Yost, Xavier Smith ==Charts== Weekly charts {class=\\" sort\\" !align=\\"left\\"Chart (2000‚Äì2001) !align=\\"center\\"Peak position - - - - Canada (Canada Airplay Charts) align=\\"center\\"25 - align=\\"left\\"Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) align=\\"center\\"46 - - - - Netherlands (Tipparade) align=\\"center\\"2 - Poland (Polish Airplay Charts) align=\\"center\\"12 - - - - - - - - - } Year-end charts { !Chart (2001) !Position - Australia (ARIA) align=\\"center\\"32 } Certifications == Release history == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Release date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" Ref. - rowspan=\\"2\\"United States  November 21, 2000  Urban rowspan=\\"2\\" Interscope  -  January 23, 2001  CHR/Pop  -  Australia  May 15, 2001  CD single  Universal Music  } ==References * Category:2000 songs Category:M√Ωa songs Category:Songs written by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis Category:Songs written by M√Ωa Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis Category:2001 songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Alexander Richbourg ","title":"Free (M√Ωa song)"},{"id":"19337827","text":"\\"Chimera\\" is the sixteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network in the United States, on April 2, 2000, was written by David Amann, and directed by Cliff Bole. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Chimera\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.5, being watched by 12.89 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder investigates what appears to be the case of a missing woman from a small town, but soon turns out to be a murder by a spirit summoned from the underworld. Scully, meanwhile, must endure an uncomfortable stakeout. Similar to the sixth season episode, \\"Arcadia\\", \\"Chimera\\" was written as \\"a suburban parable about perfection\\" that examined \\"the evil that lies beneath a prototypical white-bread suburban existence.\\" The episode was produced at a time when both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were directing their own episodes, and in order to compensate, Anderson's role was drastically reduced in the episode. ==Plot== In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens a little girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then attacked and killed by a monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking for a woman who is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a federal judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face. Ellen tells Mulder that she saw a reflection in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes that glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature. Phil explains to Mulder that he wanted a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes that he is the reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring. ==Production== The episode takes its title from the legendary Chimera, which was composed of the body of a right Writing The premise behind \\"Chimera\\" was to explore \\"the evil that [might lie] beneath a prototypical white-bread suburban existence.\\" While these themes had previously been explored in the sixth-season episode, \\"Arcadia\\", the show's producers hoped to explore the same ideas in a more \\"straight-ahead scare\\" style, rather than supplementing the horror with humor (as was done in \\"Arcadia\\").Shapiro p. 202 Series creator Chris Carter, in particular, saw the episode as \\"a chance to do something bold and new.\\" Carter wanted the story to revolve around a crow, an image that he described simply as \\"scary\\". Originally, the episode was going to feature a \\"subterranean monster\\" and was aptly going to be titled \\"Subterranean Monster Blues\\". The episode was written in \\"a burst of twenty-hour days\\". Greg Walker, who assisted David Amann, called the episode's script \\"a suburban parable about perfection.\\" Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book, The Complete X-Files, that \\"David Amman's script is an insightful commentary on suburban repression and self-delusion, which made a major comeback in the conservative late '90s.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 179 While the episode was being written, the production crew dealt with a number of issues, notably the fact that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were busy directing their own episodes‚Äî\\"Hollywood A.D.\\" and \\"all things\\", respectively. To cope with their limited schedules, the producers planned out the filming of \\"Chimera\\" in a way that required Duchovny and Anderson to shoot only a limited number of scenes together.Shapiro p. 203 Anderson, in fact, was only needed for one day of filming for her auxiliary sub-plot involving the prostitute murderer. Casting and filming Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, was tasked with finding \\"normal-looking suburban people\\" to play the episode's various characters. Millikan later noted that \\"the show necessitated casting perfect people. But it's not that easy to find [...] normal-looking people. We've used so many people over the years that it's gotten harder and harder to find them.\\" Several of the individuals cast had had roles in \\"obscure genre films\\": Wendy Schaal had appeared in the 1985 film Creature (1985), Gina Mastrogiacomo first was noted for her movie Alien Space Avenger (1989), Michelle Joyner first appeared in the anthology film Grim Prairie Tales (1990), and finally John Mese had a part in the movie Night of the Scarecrow (1995). Most of the opening scene was shot in an actual Los Angeles backyard. However, because the producers felt that the locale was not suitable for the \\"tree-lined elements\\", they supplemented the scenes shot by also filming on the grounds of a nearby museum in Hollywood. The episode ran into several snags during filming. Director Cliff Bole had trouble getting the crows to \\"act on cue\\" and so several ravens were brought in as doubles. Bole later noted, \\"We got two ravens. One was very good at cawing and one was good at hopping.\\" The ending sequence had to be re-shot several times. Producer Paul Rabwin explained, \\"Originally, we wanted to show a mirror image of the woman being attacked by the monster, but it didn't really sell.\\" Eventually, the crew \\"glued candy glass onto a piece of plywood, angled the wood, and set the camera on that angle and so [they could film] the attack through the shattered fragments.\\" ==Broadcast and reception== \\"Chimera\\" first aired in the United States on April 2, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 7.5, with an 11 share, meaning that roughly 7.5 percent of all television-equipped households, and 11 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 12.89 million viewers.Shapiro, p. 281 The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on May 7, 2000, and received 0.56 million viewers, making it the third most watched episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 26-July 2, 2000\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"American Beauty? Tonight, in a perfect small town, with perfect neighbors and perfect families... lies an evil just waiting to show it's 'perfect' face.\\" The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script \\"very stylish\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 220 The two noted that \\"[David] Duchovny is very good here [‚Ä¶] and, as a counterbalance, [Gillian] Anderson provides some great comic relief.\\" Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was \\"a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [which makes it] a rewarding stand-out.\\" Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that \\"Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are the order of the day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode \\"gets off to an awkward start\\", Vitaris concluded that \\"'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", noting that, while the episode was good, it \\"falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding.\\" Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, \\"If we had a sense of where her need comes from, if there was some hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress‚Äôs performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote a neutral review, saying, \\"Beyond that, there is little to be said, pro or con, for 'Chimera.' The episode is mildly interesting and avoids the puerility of recent episodes.\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a relatively negative review. He derided the lack of Anderson's character, summing up his feelings in the simple sentence, \\"No Dana Scully.\\"Kessenich, p. 123 ==FootnotesBibliography== * * * == External links == * * \\"Chimera\\" at TV.com Category:2000 American television episodes Category:The X-Files (season 7) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Vermont Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

The U.S. Forest Service names others. * The type variety (and autonym), is C. c. var. canadensis. This is the name for C. canadensis after varieties of it were named, and is used only to differentiate it from the other, newer varieties. The common name is bluejoint * C. c. var. langsdorffii. It is also called bluejoint. * C. c. var. macouniana. It is known as Macoun's reedgrass. It was named for Canadian Botanist James Melville Macoun.George Vasey. A new Grass. 1885.

It is the most common and widespread Calamagrostis species on the continent. ==Description== It is a perennial grass with a branching stem reaching heights between 60 centimeters and 1.5 meters. The flat, drooping leaves are rough with tiny hairs. The inflorescence is up to 25 centimeters long and may be open and loose or narrow and densely packed with spikelets. Each spikelet is about half a centimeter long and purplish in color. It is a palatable food plant for livestock and wild grazing animals. It is a tough rhizomatous grass that provides soil stability in wet areas and is one of the first plants to reestablish on sites of recent oil spills. It can be a nuisance on sites of forest restoration, because it can outcompete conifer seedlings. ==References *Jepson Manual Treatment * canadensis Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1803 ","title":"Calamagrostis canadensis"},{"id":"19337863","text":"Alexicrates () was a Pythagorean philosopher who lived at the time of Plutarch (that is, around the turn of the 1st century AD), and whose disciples continued to observe the ancient diet of the Pythagoreans, abstaining from fish altogether.Plutarch, Sympos. viii. p. 728 Another person of this name occurs in Plutarch.Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus 5 ==References== * Category:1st- century philosophers Category:Neo-Pythagoreans Category:Roman-era philosophers ","title":"Alexicrates"},{"id":"19337888","text":"Thunderspire Labyrinth is the second in the three part series of adventures introducing the new 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons concept of Points of Light, a loosely connected and open-ended setting designed to allow modules and Dungeon Masters created materials to be seamlessly integrated into either a single, largely unmapped fantasy world or a Dungeon Master custom made setting. The adventure, written by Mike Mearls and Richard Baker was published in 2008 by Wizards of the Coast, as a sequel to the adventure Keep on the Shadowfell. The adventure is designed for character of levels 4-6 and the module code \\"H\\" stands for Heroic Tier. This module is set in a region of the world called the Nentir Vale, the details of which are given in the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide. ==Synopsis== Thunderspire Labyrinth can be run as either a loose sequel to Keep on the Shadowfell or as a standalone module. Players find themselves journeying to Thunderspire, a mountain beneath which lies the abandoned subterranean minotaur city of Saruun Khel. The module suggests many goals for players in Saruun Khel, the largest of which is to investigate a slave ring run by a group called the Bloodreavers and rescue a group of civilians recently enslaved by this organisation. (This may be as a result of events in Keep on the Shadowfell or through other, unconnected, plot hooks.) The players then proceed through a number of mini-dungeons; the Bloodreavers turn out to have sold the slaves to the duergar tribe known as Clan Grimmerzhul, who have then onsold a smaller subset of the slaves to a band of fiend-tainted gnolls. Finding and overcoming the gnolls reveals a sinister plan about to be enacted by a renegade wizard named Paldemar, who has designs on conquest of the Nentir Vale in which Thunderspire is located. Ultimately players confront and defeat Paldemar, which concludes the module. ==Monsters== Thunderspire Labyrinth contains the first 4th Edition appearances and write-ups of the duergar, along with bronze warders, norkers, phalagars, and Enigmas of Vecna. ==Contents== * A 32-page adventure book one booklet * A 64-page adventure book two booklet * A full-color poster map * A light cardboard portfolio ==Publication history== The adventure was designed by Richard Baker and Mike Mearls and was published in July 2008.

She was born in Alexandria. She studied theatricals in the dramatics at the National Theatre and piano at the Greek Odeum of Athens. She first appeared in the national theatre and the company Marika Kotopoli. In 1936 and 1937 she entered the Artistic Theatre with Tzavalas Karousos where she played many important roles. She worked with Karolos Coon in the first theatrical acts by Anton Chekhov and with Thymelikos Theatrical Company with Linos Karzis in 1938/39. In the spring of 1940, she entered the accomplishable youth theatrical company at the Zefiros Theatre. In the summer of 1941, she participated again in another successful youth theatrical company together with Minis Fotopoulos at the Nana Theatre on Vouliagmenis Avenue. During World War II (1942‚Äì44), there were basic cadets of the public Armed Forces Group Council in the Middle East, she participated with prolongation in Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Jordan.

Their remains have been found in southern Africa, Western Europe, North America, India and China. The morganucodontans were probably insectivorous and nocturnal, though like eutriconodonts some species attained large sizes and were carnivorous.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338687375_A_Large_Morganucodontan_Mammaliaform_from_the_Late_Jurassic_of_Germany Nocturnality is believed to have evolved in the earliest mammals in the Triassic (called the nocturnal bottleneck) as a specialisation that allowed them to exploit a safer, night-time niche, while most larger predators were likely to have been active during the day (though some dinosaurs, for example, were nocturnal as well). == Anatomy and biology == Diagram showing characteristic double jaw joint Morganucodontans had a double jaw articulation made up of the dentary-squamosal joint as well as a quadrate-articular one. This implies that they also retained one of their postdentary bones: the articular. There is a trough at the back of the jaw on the inside (lingual) where the postdentary bones sat. The double jaw articulation and retention of the postdentary bones are characteristic of many of the earliest Mammaliaformes, but are absent today in mammals: All crown-group mammals have a lower jaw that is composed of a single bone, and the articular has been incorporated into the middle ear, having become the malleus (while the quadrate has become the incus). Unlike Sinoconodon and other therapsids, morganucodontan teeth were diphyodont (meaning that they replaced their teeth once, having a 'milk' set and 'adult' set as seen in today's mammals including humansPanciroli E. 2017 Fossil Focus: The First Mammals - http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2017/fossil-focus-first-mammals/) and not polyphyodont (meaning that the teeth are constantly replaced, and the animal and its teeth get larger throughout its lifetime, as in reptiles). Evidence of lactation is present in Wareolestes, via tooth replacement patterns. Morganucodontans also had specialised teeth ‚Äì incisors, canines, molars and premolars ‚Äì for food processing, rather than having similarly shaped teeth along the tooth row as seen in their predecessors. Morganucododontans are thought to have been insectivorous and carnivorous, their teeth adapted for shearing. Niche partitioning is known among various morganucodontan species, different types specialised for different prey. The teeth are structured in such a way that occlusion happens by the lower cusp \\"a\\" fitting anteriorly to upper cusp \\"A\\", between \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". This occlusion pattern is also seen in the unrelated triconodontids, but it is by no means universal among morganucodontans; Dinnetherium, for example has an occlusion mechanism closer to that of gobiconodontids (also unrelated), in which molars basically alternate. Wear facets are present. The septomaxilla, a primitive feature also found in Sinoconodon, is found in morganucodontans, as well as a fully ossified orbitosphenoid. The anterior lamina is enlarged. The cranial moiety of the squamosal is a narrow bone that is superficially placed to the petrosal and parietal. Unlike its predecessors, the morganucodontans have a larger cerebral capacity and a longer cochlea. The atlas elements are unfused; there is a suture between the dens and axis. The cervical ribs are not fused to the centra. The coracoid and procoracoid, which are absent in therians, are present. The head of the humerus is spherical as in mammals, but the spiral ulnar condyle is cynodont-like. In the pelvic girdle, the pubis, ilium and ischium are unfused. At least Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium are unique among mammaliformes for lacking epipubic bones, suggesting that they didn't have the same reproductive constraints. Morganucodon at least appears to have had a long lifespan and a lower metabolism than modern mammals. == Classification == Because morganucodontans possessed the mammalian dentary- squamosal jaw joint, systematists like G. G. Simpson (1959) considered the morganucodontans to be mammals. Some palaeontologists continue to use this classification.

His pioneering work on musical drama earned him the title of \\"Father of the Filipino opera\\".Ladislao Bonus Historical Marker (1854 - 1908) installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines == Biography == The eldest son of Pedro Bonus and Maria Mariano, he was born in Pandacan on June 27, 1854. He acquired his first lessons in music from Gregorio de Luna and Guillermo de Luna. Motivated by a strong desire to learn, he became so proficient with the violin, cello and viola that he could easily substitute for a player of any of those stringed instruments. He mastered the contrabass and served in the orchestra every time a foreign opera company visited Manila. In 1887, Bonus organized a complete opera company in Pandacan. It was composed entirely of Tagalog musicians and singers, to wit: Teodora San Luis and Josefa Tiongson, sopranos; Victoria Madina, mezzo soprano; Andres Ciria Cruz and Jose Conseco, basses; and Carmen Mendoza, Juana Natividad, Remegio Natividad, Rufina Bonus, Agustin Natividad, Marcela Barroga, Simon Natividad, Valentin Natividad, and Mariano Natividad, chorus members. Bonus served in the company as director and conductor of the orchestra. Jose Canseco was the stage director.Bonus, Ladislao. (2015). In V. Almario (Ed.), Sagisag Kultura (Vol 1).

Initially set up around 1901 it was closed in the early 1950s. The camp was initially used for training by the Citizens' Military Forces in the years prior to the World War I. Training was conducted for units of the First Australian Imperial Force (1AIF), prior to embarking for overseas deployment. With the end of World War I, the camp remained in use through the inter-war period. During World War II, the camp was again used for the training of units of both the Second Australian Imperial Force (2AIF) and Citizens' Military Forces militia troops. The facilities at Rutherford Camp were spartan consisting of tent accommodation. After the cessation of World War II, the camp area was gradually sold off to be resumed as grazing land and closed in the early 1950s. The 61st Australian Camp Hospital was located at Rutherford Camp. The troops and supplies for the camp were transported by rail and offloaded at the Rutherford Racecourse siding on the Rutherford Racecourse railway line. ==References== *Australian War Memorial *Rutherford Racecourse Branch Line Category:Australian Army Category:Military history of Australia during World War I Category:Military camps in Australia ","title":"Rutherford Army Camp"},{"id":"19337973","text":"Typical Z-Drag Configuration A Z-Drag or Z-Rig is an arrangement of lines and pulleys commonly used in rescue situations. The basic arrangement provides a theoretical mechanical advantage of three. The name comes from the fact that the arrangement of lines is roughly Z shaped. Besides the mechanical advantage to pulling, it also uses only part of the total length of the rope for the block and tackle arrangement. The typical configuration (see diagram) uses two single pulleys and two Prusik knot loops or other suitable friction hitches. These Prusiks provide fixed attach-points on the rope that can be moved when slightly loosened. The first Prusik knot provides the mechanical advantage. The second Prusik knot can be used to hold the position of the rope and is sometimes referred to as a 'progress capture device' or ratchet. It is also advisable to attach a towel or soft object (such as a life vest) to the end of the line near the connection to the object being pulled since the line is under high tension and could break free and present a dangerous flying hazard. Borrowed from rock climbing, the Z-Drag is considered an important tool in whitewater rescue and is used primarily for the recovery of pinned boats. The Z-Drag is considered an important tool in mountain rescue because of its simplicity and is used for nearly all lifting systems. It also serves as an excellent method for tightening the rope to be crossed in a Tyrolean traverse, where the other end is also fixed to a stable object. ==See also== *Trucker's hitch - another 3-fold advantage system using single loops *Mechanical advantage ==References== * Swiftwater Rescue: A Manual for the Rescue Professional * Whitewater Rescue Manual: New Techniques for Canoeists, Kayakers, and Rafters * River Rescue: A Manual for Whitewater Safety * Swiftwater Rescue Category:Safety equipment Category:Ropework Category:Swiftwater rescue ","title":"Z-drag"},{"id":"19337986","text":"Juraj Njavro (2 July 1938 - 15 September 2008) was a Croatian medical doctor and politician.

Founded and promoted by retired wrestler Eddie Sharkey, a longtime veteran of the American Wrestling Association and owner of the Pro Wrestling America Training Center, Pro Wrestling America featured many established wrestlers while in between the then \\"Big Three\\" (American Wrestling Association, National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wrestling Federation) as well as providing many lightheavyweight and cruiserweight wrestlers with their first national exposure, most notably, Sabu, Jerry Lynn and The Lightning Kid. Although the promotion stopped running regular events in 1993, it has held sporadic events in the Minneapolis-area with Sharkey's wrestling school since 1996. Among the former students who have appeared for several of these events include Lacey and Austin Aries, both being top stars in Ring of Honor. ==History== In 1982, after leaving the AWA as a result of a pay dispute with promoter Greg Gagne, Sharkey was approached by fifteen other wrestlers similarly upset with Gagne over withholding payment and convinced Sharkey to start his own promotion. Sharkey duly set up his own promotion Pro Wrestling USA, starring his own trainees such as the two future members of the Road Warriors tag team (at this stage known as Crusher Von Haig and The Road Warrior respectively) as well as Rick Rood, and Barry Darsow (then still wrestling under his legal name) . Sharkey was soon able to sign other wrestlers including Paul Ellering, Tom Zenk, Nikita Koloff, The Destruction Crew (Mike Enos & Wayne Bloom) and the Steiner Brothers (Rick & Scott Steiner) as well as Mad Dog Vachon, Bruiser Brody, Larry Cameron often making appearances. Ray Whebbe, Jr. and Dale Gagne, the current owner of AWA Superstars, was also involved with the promotion. Although a chief rival of the American Wrestling Alliance during the late 1980s, Sharkey and Gagne eventually agreed to a talent exchange deal between the two promotions. A number of PWA veterans were brought into the AWA during its last years including Derrick Dukes and Ricky Rice. In 1986, Eddie Sharkey and promoter Don Condello worked out an agreement for PWA wrestlers to appear in televised wrestling events in central Canada. Chris Markoff, Buck Zumhofe, Ricky Rice & Derrick Dukes and The Terminators (Riggs & Wolff) were among those who appeared in the territory. Pro Wrestling America, among other regional promotions such as Georgia All-Star Wrestling and the United States Wrestling Association, also had a working relationship with the Global Wrestling Federation during its last years and allowed its own wrestlers compete in GWF tournaments and other events. Jerry Lynn and The Lightning Kid, two of the promotion's top light heavyweight wrestlers, faced each other in a match to crown the first GWF Light Heavyweight Championship. A number of PWA wrestlers often appeared on The Prima-Donns, a long-running Public-access television cable TV show in the Minneapolis-area, including Eddie Sharkey, Baron von Raschke, Nick Bockwinkel and Jerry Lynn. Pro Wrestling America was so successful during its early years, despite no access to television or advertising according to Eddie Sharkey, that the promotion was the first and, as of 1991, the only independent promotion never to lose money. The promotion would eventually cease running shows after 1993, however Sharkey once again began promoting in the area with Terry Fox after a three-year absence, under either Wrestle America 2000 or Pro Wrestling America, with students from their wrestling camp. The promotion has since occasionally toured Japan and the Middle East. ==AlumniChampionships== {  !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Championship !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Current champion(s) !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Previous champion(s) !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Date won !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Location - PWA Heavyweight Championship Wellington Wilkens, Jr.  August 25, 1996 Sendai, Japan - PWA Iron Horse Television Championship The Lightning Kid Derrick Dukes April 20, 1991 Mora, MN - PWA Light Heavyweight Championship Jerry Lynn The Lightning Kid December 27, 1991 Dallas, TX - PWA Tag Team Championship Thunderblood Storm Troopers January 1996  } ==References *CageMatch.de - Pro Wrestling America Category:Entertainment companies established in 1985 Category:Independent professional wrestling promotions based in the Midwestern United States Category:Companies based in Minnesota Category:1985 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Pro Wrestling America"},{"id":"19338024","text":"This is a list of Romanian diplomats.

Their classification is contentious: according to cladistic studies, they may be (distantly) related to Euarchontoglires (rodents, primates and their relatives), although they are more recently regarded as the first branch to split from basal eutherians. One recent large- scale cladistic analysis of eutherian mammals favored lepictidans as close to the placental crown-clade; and several other recent analyses that included data from Cretaceous non-eutherian mammals found Leptictis to belong to the superorder Afrotheria. The most recent phylogenetic studies recover it as actually a paraphyletic assemblage leading to Placentalia. == Description == The leptictids are a characteristic example of the non-specialized placental mammals that took part in the late Cretaceous-Paleocene evolutionary radiation, originally bunched together in the order Insectivora. The leptictids became extinct during the Oligocene. Their archaic cranium and dentition make it difficult to determine their relationship to other groups. Leptictid postcranial anatomy has been studied from the well-preserved middle Eocene Leptictidium specimens found at Messel, Germany.August√≠ and Ant√≥n, 2002, p. 5 Judging from these specimens, lepticids were small placentals with a body length ranging from . The head had a long and slender snout, probably featuring a short trunk, which may have been used for scratching the undergrowth in search of insects and worms. The mouth's archaic dentition included two or three incisors, a canine, and V-shaped cheek-teeth - four premolars and three molars. Their forelegs were shortened, but their hind legs were elongated. While this anatomy is reminiscent of small kangaroos and jerboas, suggesting a jumping locomotion, the structure of the tarsal bones hints at a specialization for terrestrial running. Perhaps these animals were capable of both modes of locomotion; running slowly in search for food, and jumping quickly to avoid threats. Additionally, the Messel specimens feature a surprisingly long tail, unique among modern placental mammals, formed by 40 vertebrae and probably used for balance. ==Classification== *Order Leptictida **Family Gypsonictopidae ***Genus Gypsonictops **Family Leptictidae ***Genus Amphigyion ***Genus Gallolestes ***Genus Labes ***Genus Lainodon ***Genus Leptonysson ***Genus Palaeictops ***Genus Praolestes ***Genus Wania ***Subfamily Leptictinae ****Genus Blacktops ****Genus Ictopidium ****Genus Leptictis ****Genus Myrmecoboides ****Genus Ongghonia ****Genus Prodiacodon ****Genus Protictops **Family Pseudorhyncocyonidae ***Genus Diaphyodectes ***Genus Leptictidium ***Genus Phakodon ***Genus Pseudorhyncocyon == Notes  References == * ==Further reading== * * == External links == * Insectivore- like mammals: Tiny teeth and their enigmatic owners * Category:Paleocene mammals Category:Eocene mammals Category:Late Cretaceous first appearances Category:Oligocene extinctions ","title":"Leptictida"},{"id":"19338073","text":"The Little Sioux Scout Ranch is a Scout reservation operated by the Mid- America Council of the Boy Scouts of America. It is located in Little Sioux, Iowa, about sixty miles north of Omaha, Nebraska in Iowa's Loess Hills and 15 minutes east of Interstate 29. Hiking trails cover the camp, which is forested with mowed meadows and has both developed and remote campsites. There are also four cabin shelters and a lake. The Mutual of Omaha Administration Building was completed in 2000, and two years later the MidAmerican Energy Pavilion was finished, seating 300 at picnic tables. Individual packs, troops and posts use the facility, along with Order of the Arrow conclaves, and district and council camporees. Pahuk Pride, a week-long National Youth Leadership Training event, was held annually at the camp until 2017. The camp was the site of a tornado that killed four Boy Scouts and injured 48 others on June 11, 2008. Many awards for heroism were awarded. The camp reopened in 2009. ==June 2008 tornado== At 6:35 p.m. CDT on June 11, 2008 an EF3 tornado struck the camp during a Pahuk Pride National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT). There were 93 boys and 25 youth and adult staff members in attendance; four boys were killed and 48 injured. Scouts attending the weeklong Pahuk Pride event at the camp were from Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. The National Weather Service office in Valley, Nebraska said they issued a tornado warning 12 minutes before the twister hit the camp. People at the camp reported having five minutes between sighting the funnel cloud and touch down at the camp. Some reports indicated that a relay hub that would have alerted the scouts sooner was temporarily inoperable as it had been struck by lightning and was in a restart sequence when the original warning was issued. The actual sounding of the tornado siren at the camp was due to manual activation of the camps siren from a staff member in the Mutual of Omaha Welcome Building. According to a camp counselor, nearly all the injuries and fatalities happened when a small cabin that some campers took shelter in was destroyed by the tornado. The Scouts were split into two groups for the event and had taken shelter in two different buildings when the storm hit. The tornado was one of 28 reported in that time period, spread across eastern Kansas and into Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. Many of the injuries were reported to have happened when a brick fireplace in the northern shelter, where the Scouts were taking cover, was destroyed by the tornado winds. A truck parked outside was thrown through the air and may have struck the building. The tornado killed Josh Fennen, 13; Sam Thomsen, 13; Ben Petrzilka, 14, all from Omaha and Aaron Eilerts, 14, from Eagle Grove, Iowa. The Scouts' first aid training was immediately used. MSNBC asked Ethan Hession, 13, \\"You said, 'If it had to happen it is good it happened at a Boy Scout Camp.' Why would you at the age of 13 say such a thing?\\" Hession replied, \\"Because we were prepared. We knew that shock could happen. We knew that we need to place tourniquets on wounds that were bleeding too much. We knew we need to apply pressure and gauze. We had first-aid kits, we had everything.\\" The Boy Scouts at the camp, including some injured, immediately began to administer first aid and assist their injured fellow campers. The chief of the local volunteer department, Ed Osius, said, \\"It‚Äôs the scouts that saved a lot of lives.\\" According to the local Omaha World- Herald, the wounded were taken to several locations. * Four were brought to the Saint Joseph Hospital at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, all in stable and good condition; * Four were brought to Mercy Medical Center in Sioux City, Iowa, and were in stable condition; * Nineteen were taken to Burgess Medical Center in Onawa, Iowa; * Fourteen were taken to Community Memorial Hospital in Missouri Valley, Iowa. Three of those were transferred to Creighton, and; * Eight were brought to Memorial Community Hospital and Health System in Blair, Nebraska, one in critical condition. Parents expressed frustration and anxiety about communication problems that kept them from knowing the status of their children. Surviving Boy Scouts were taken to West Harrison High School in nearby Mondamin, Iowa to wait for their parents to pick them up. Some boys reportedly waited up to five hours. The Omaha Police Department helicopter conducted an infrared scan of the camp early in the morning on June 12, despite the fact that as of 12:00 midnight CST all people have been accounted for. A police lieutenant suggested it may just be as a precaution. As many as 42 Scouts remained hospitalized the following morning with wounds ranging from cuts and bruises to major head trauma. Aftermath Many acts of bravery occurred during and after the storm. Both Nebraska and Iowa governors praised the actions of the surviving Scouts. Governor of Nebraska Dave Heineman said in a statement, \\"I want to thank the scouts and the scout leaders who helped in the aftermath of the storm. They responded in true Boy Scout fashion.\\" Governor of Iowa Chet Culver said at a press conference the following morning, \\"There were some real heroes at the Scout camp. They set up triage and were taking care of one another and saved many lives before emergency responders arrived\\". Later in the day on June 12, both governors were joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, who toured the devastated camp and afterwards expressed the condolences of U.S. President George W. Bush to the families of the dead Scouts. Chertoff said he was \\"particularly touched by the finest young people from this region being caught up in the ... terrible tragedy\\", adding that, \\"the reaction of the Boy Scouts was in the best tradition of what they're being taught.\\" Chief Scout Executive Bob Mazzucca planned to visit the council and help assist families of the Scouts, and has launched an appeal to fellow Scouts for relief funds. On September 8, 2008, Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska Rick Sheehy presented the first-ever Be Prepared Local Hero award to the Mid-America Council Pahuk Pride Class of 2008 because of their preparation for and taking care of each other during and after the tornado struck. On September 13, 2008, those who died in the storm were presented the Spirit of the Eagle Award, a posthumous award from the Boy Scouts of America. Also on September 13, 2008, the Boy Scouts of America's National Court of Honor awarded 121 medals for heroism to Scouts and Scout leaders for their actions during the tornado: 75 Medals of Merit, 30 Heroism awards, 7 Honor Medals, and 9 Honor Medals with Crossed Palm. Controversy While most praise the actions of the Scouts in the aftermath of the tornado, many question the absence of a tornado shelter on the grounds. In a press conference on June 12, 2008, Lloyd Roitstein, Scout Executive with the Mid-America Council of the Boy Scouts of America is quoted as saying, \\"Absolutely not\\" to a question about whether the camp grounds had a tornado shelter. On June 13, 2008, The Omaha World Herald quoted Roitstein as saying \\"One of the things you learn in Scouting, one of the skills you learn is what happens when you're out in the wilderness and severe weather. \\"And we teach them of course to go to the lowest-lying area, go into a ditch and get down as low as you can. Because when you're out hiking in the mountains or canoeing down a river or whatever, there are no storm shelters.\\" The lack of tornado shelters is a topic of debate. Bryan and Arnell Petrzilka of Omaha, whose son Ben was killed in the storm, are heading a project to add tornado shelters to the Little Sioux Ranch and possibly others in the area. A fund for donations has been set up with the Omaha State Bank. Reconstruction FEMA declared Monona County along with the Little Sioux Scout Ranch a disaster area. On July 26, 2008, volunteers from the Shelby County Rescue and Recovery Team along with 22 professional loggers helped to clear out damaged and destroyed trees at the Ranch.

After his death, Obodas was worshiped as a deity. ==Life== Obodas was the successor of Aretas II, from whom he inherited the war with the Hasmonean kingdom. He defeated them around 93 BCE on the Golan Heights. Then he ambushed Alexander Jannaeus near Gadara (Umm Qais), just east of the Sea of Galilee. Using camel cavalry, he forced Jannaeus into a valley where he completed the ambush thereby getting revenge for the Nabateans' loss of Gaza. Moab and Gilead, two mountains east of the Dead Sea and the Jordan River, were returned. Around 86 BCE, the Seleucid ruler, Antiochus XII Dionysus, invaded Nabatea. During the Battle of Cana, Antiochus was slain and his demoralized army perished in the desert. The Nabataeans, seeing how Obodas defeated both the Hasmoneans and the Greeks, started to venerate Obodas as a god. Obodas was buried in the Negev, at a place that was renamed in his honour, Avdat.

He is sometimes known as William Cartwright, Junior or William Cartwright the younger to distinguish him from his father, another William Cartwright (fl. 1598 - 1636), an actor of the previous generation.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 86-9. ==Early career== William Cartwright the younger was about eighty years old when he died; he was therefore born around 1606 or 1607. Nothing is known of his early life; it is reasonable to assume that he began his stage career under his father's tutelage. He was included with his father on a 1635 list of actors; apparently they both belonged to the King's Revels Men at that time. James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699) maintains that the younger Cartwright was associated with the Salisbury Court Theatre -- which may refer to his time with his father's troupe, or may indicate that he was with Queen Henrietta's Men in the 1637-42 period. The parish records of St. Giles in the Fields show that he married his first wife, Elisabeth Cooke, on 1 May 1633 -- and his second wife, Andria Robins, just three years later, on 28 April 1636.Eleanore Boswell, \\"Young Mr. Cartwright,\\" Modern Language Review, Vol. 24 No. 2 (April 1929), pp. 125-42; see p. 127. ==Theatre closure== Jane Cartwright For the years 1642-1660, when the theatres were closed, evidence of the activities of the former actors is scanty. It is known, however, that Cartwright was one of those who tried to maintain clandestine dramatic activity in the later 1640s.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light of English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509. He then became a stationer or bookseller; his shop was in Turnstile Alley in the neighborhood of Lincoln's Inn Fields. Other former actors, Andrew Pennycuicke and Alexander Gough, also shifted into the book business in the Commonwealth period. In this era, booksellers also functioned as publishers; but evidence of only one publication by Cartwright is extant. In 1658 he issued a new edition of Thomas Heywood's An Apology for Actors (originally printed in 1612), under the title The Actor's Vindication. Cartwright made one major addition to Heywood's text: a passage in praise of Edward Alleyn, with whom his father had been associated. Cartwright's second wife Andria was buried on 12 May 1652. He married Jane Hodgson, his third wife, on 19 November 1654. ==Restoration== Cartwright's stage career revived with the re-opening of the theatres in 1660. He was one of the thirteen actors who were the original \\"sharers\\" (partners) in the King's Company when Thomas Killigrew organized that troupe. Cartwright remained with the company until it was absorbed into the United Company in 1682. Cartwright performed a range of roles with the King's Company,Nunzeger, p. 88. including: * Falstaff in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays * Brabantio in Othello * Corbachio in Jonson's Volpone * Sir Epicure Mammon in The Alchemist * Morose in Epicene * Lygones in Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King * Apollonius in Dryden's Tyrannick Love * Mario in The Assignation * the Priest in The Indian Emperour * Abenamar in The Conquest of Granada * Hermogenes in Marriage √† la mode * Lord Latimer in Boyle's The Black Prince * Sir Jasper Fidget in Wycherly's The Country Wife * Major Oldfox in The Plain Dealer. Cartwright received a minor mention in the anti-Dryden satire The Rehearsal, in which he supposedly plays \\"Thunder.\\" When the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane burned down in 1672, Cartwright invested ¬£150 in its replacement.Boswell, p. 133. Cartwright remained with the United Company after 1682, until the end of his acting career. He was active even at an advanced age; with the United Company he played Cacafogo in Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife. ==Bequest== Cartwright was a collector as well as an actor and bookseller. At his death he willed his collection to Dulwich College. The collection comprised 239 portraits, plus drawings, prints, books, and manuscripts; Cartwright also willed the College money (¬£400 of \\"broad old gold\\") and even personal effects (\\"two silver tankards, damask linen, an Indian quilt, and a Turkey carpet\\").George Frederic Warner, Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Muniments of Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dulwich, London, Longmans, Green, and Co., 1881; p. 203. The portrait collection included public figures like Sir Thomas Gresham, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Mary, Queen of Scots; Richard Burbage and Richard Perkins among other actors; and personal items -- pictures of Cartwright, his father, and his first and third wives. Disputes over Cartwright's last will and testament, between his servants and the College, generated an extensive legal record.Boswell, pp. 133-40. Cartwright's will mentions that he was childless; if he and any of his three wives had offspring, they did not survive him. Given his connection with Dulwich, Cartwright was likely also responsible for donating MS. Egerton 1994, a collection of play manuscripts, to the College.F. S.

The plot of the game revolves around a group of gnomes repairing their magical forest after a chaotic rampage by an evil warlock frees all the forest spirits. The object of the game is for the player to contain these spirits by matching three or more spirits of the same type in order to make them disappear.Abstraction Games Interview - Potpourrii Players shoot spirits from a cannon on a track that surrounds a swirling whirlpool (the \\"potpourii\\") where the spirits are suspended, with each quadrant of the play area corresponding to a different season and the different types of spirits players can shoot. The twist is that instead of simply matching the required number of spirits, the player must add to the cluster a different type of spirit that reacts to them and allows the cluster to disappear. ==Reception== IGN gave the game 5/10, noting that the \\"sluggish, sloppy controls\\" and the lack of a tutorial hurt the game, ultimately claiming Potpourrii is \\"far too complicated for its own good\\". However, they did have praise for its \\"mellow and happy\\" audio and graphics, despite the latter's muddled and confusing interface.IGN: Potpourrii Review WiiWare World also gave it 5/10, praising its \\"crisp visuals, captivating art style and cutesy music\\" yet also disappointed by its \\"extremely sluggish\\" gameplay and frustrating control.

It served as Harrison's first single from her second studio album Fear of Flying (2000) and featured Yonkers rapper Jadakiss. The song was written and composed by the latter and Harrison along with Teron Beal, Jimmy Cozier, Swizz Beatz and Mashonda Tifrere. Lyrically, \\"The Best of Me,\\" a street savvy anthem addresses a woman holding off being intimate or physical with a guy. The song received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. However, \\"The Best of Me\\" underperformed on Billboards US Hot 100; peaking and spending two non- consecutive weeks at number fifty. It fared better on the component Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart peaking within the top 20 at number fourteen. Internationally, the song peaked within the top 40 in Germany, peaking at number twenty-six. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Chris Robinson and serviced to video outlets on March 6, 2000. Her love interest was portrayed by Sisq√≥'s cousin. ==Background and release== \\"The Best of Me\\" was composed by M√Ωa Harrison and Swizz Beatz, along with singers Teron Beal, Jimmy Cozier, Mashonda, and rapper Jadakiss, the latter of which is also featured vocally on the song. Originally expected to be recorded by rapper DMX in a Miami recording session with Swizz, the instrumental of the song was left unused until the producer returned to New York City to start work on Harrison's album at The Hit Factory. Upon accidentally pushing a button in the studio, Harrison's management reportedly \\"jumped up and said 'That's it, that's it'.\\" When recording \\"The Best of Me\\" producer Swizz Beatz admired Harrison's work ethic, commenting, she's as dedicated to mastering vocals as she is to dance. He noted, \\"She takes everything seriously when it comes to the music citing \\"she's a perfectionist.\\" However, Harrison clarified, \\"I'm not a perfectionist but I like to improve.\\" An eleventh hour addition, the record was among the last tracks that were recorded for the Fear of Flying album. Jadakiss, then a member of the Ruff Ryders Entertainment's group The LOX, came aboard as a result of label connections with Interscope Records. Speaking on the message of the uptempo track with \\"a lot of meanings,\\" Harrison explained: \\"[It] talks about thinking about consequences before you make a decision, especially decisions made when you're in a situation of the heat of the moment,\\" she said, \\"when passion and infatuation and seduction and all these things are taking place, and you're actually liking it. However, as a female, things do happen to you that you must carry on after the fact, so you're trying to weigh the consequences and make a decision based on what you know, and you may not know much about this person. It's just about setting standards for yourself and what you want.\\" Before \\"The Best of Me\\" was chosen as the lead single from Fear of Flying, Harrison initially expected reggae- influenced \\"Lie Detector\\" to be released as her next single. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, \\"The Best of Me\\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Fear of Flying, All Music's Jose F. Promis praised \\"The Best of Me\\" highlighting \\"The Best of Me\\" as arguably the best song on the album while noting it as \\"one of the better pop songs of 2000.\\" Billboard magazine called \\"The Best of Me\\" a \\"dreamy midtempo tune.\\" \\"The Best of Me\\" was featured on The Village Voices Pazz & Jop end of the year critics list. ==Commercial performance== In the United States, The Best of Me made its debut at number eighty-five on Billboard Hot 100 issue dated week of April 15, 2000.

The reserve is protected by the Department of Environment and Forest of Arunachal Pradesh. In a notification (CWL/D/26/94/1393-1492) dated Itanagar 19 April 2001, issued by the Principal Secretary, the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh renamed Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary as Pakke Wildlife Sanctuary Division. This Tiger Reserve has won India Biodiversity Award 2016 in the category of 'Conservation of threatened species' for its Hornbill Nest Adoption Programme. ==Location== Pakke Wildlife Sanctuary lies in the undulating and hilly foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in Arunachal Pradesh's _Pakke Kessang_ District at altitude ranging from . It is bounded by Bhareli or Kameng River in the west and north, and by Pakke River in the east. It is surrounded by contiguous forests on most sides. To the east lies Papum Reserve Forest with an area of . Towards the south and south-east, the sanctuary adjoins reserve forests and Assam's Nameri National Park. To the west, it is bounded by Doimara Reserve Forest with an area of and Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary; and to the north by Shergaon Forest Division. Selective logging on a commercial scale occurred in the reserve forests until 1996. The main perennial streams in the area are the Nameri, Khari and Upper Dikorai. West of Kameng River are Sessa Orchid Sanctuary and Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary. ==History== The area of Pakke Tiger Reserve was initially constituted as Pakhui Reserve Forest on 1 July 1966 and declared a game reserve on 28 March 1977. In 2001, it was renamed Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary and became Pakhui Tiger Reserve on 23 April 2002 as the 26th Tiger Reserve under Project Tiger of the National Tiger Conservation Authority. ==Geography== The reserves elevations range from above msl. The terrain is rugged with mountainous ranges in the north and narrow plains and sloping hill valleys in the south. The sanctuary slopes southwards towards the river valley of the Brahmaputra River. The area of Brahmaputra and Chittagong Hills, which includes Pakke and Namdapha Tiger Reserve, is the north-western limit of the Indochinese tiger's range, bordering the eastern limit of the Bengal tiger's range.Jhala, Y. V., Qureshi, Q., Sinha, P. R. (Eds.) (2011). Status of tigers, co-predators and prey in India, 2010. National Tiger Conservation Authority, Govt. of India, New Delhi, and Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. TR 2011/003 pp-302 ==Climate== Pakke Tiger Reserve has a subtropical climate with cold weather from November to March. The temperature varies from . Annual rainfall is . It receives rainfall predominantly from the south-west monsoon in May to September and north-east monsoon from November to April. October and November are relatively dry. Winds are generally of moderate velocity. Thunderstorms occasionally occur in March‚ÄìApril. The average annual rainfall is 2500 mm. May and June are the hottest months. Humidity levels reach 80% during the summer. ==Flora== The habitat types are lowland semi-evergreen, evergreen forest and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests. A total of 343 woody species of flowering plants (angiosperms) have been recorded from the lowland areas of the park, with a high representation of species from the families Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae, but at least 1500 species of vascular plants are expected from Pakhui WLS, of which 500 species would be woody. While about 600 species of orchids are reported from Arunachal Pradesh, Pakhui WLS and adjoining areas also harbour many orchid species. The forest has a typical layered structure and the major emergent species are Bhelu Tetrameles nudiflora, Borpat Ailanthus grandis and Jutuli Altingia excelsa. The general vegetation type of the entire tract is classified as Assam Valley tropical semi-evergreen forest. The forests are multi-storeyed and rich in epiphytic flora and woody lianas. The vegetation is dense, with a high diversity and density of woody lianas and climbers. The forest types include tropical semi-evergreen forests along the lower plains and foothills dominated by Kari Polyalthia simiarum, Hatipehala Pterospermum acerifolium, Karibadam Sterculia alata, Paroli Stereospermum chelonioides, Ailanthus grandis and Khokun Duabanga grandiflora. The tropical semi-evergreen forests are scattered along the lower plains and foothills, dominated by Altingia excelsa, Nahar Mesua ferrea, Banderdima Dysoxylum binectariferum, Beilschmedia sp. and other middle storey trees belonging to the Lauraceae and Myrtaceae. These forests have a large number of species of economic value. Subtropical broadleaved forests of the Fagaceae and Lauraceae dominate the hill tops and higher reaches. Moist areas near streams have a profuse growth of bamboo, cane and palms. About eight species of bamboo occur in the area, in moist areas in gullies, in areas previously under settlements, or subjected to some form of disturbance on the hill slopes. At least 5 commercially important cane species grow in moist areas, along with Tokko Livistona jenkinsiana, a species used extensively by locals for thatching roofs. Along the larger perennial streams, there are shingle beds with patches of tall grassland, which give way to lowland moist forests with Outenga Dillenia indica and Boromthuri Talauma hodgsonii. Along the larger rivers, isolated trees of Semal Bombax ceiba and two species of Koroi Albizzia sp. are common. These forests have a high percentage of tree species (64%) that are animal-dispersed, with 12% tree species being wind-dispersed.Datta, A. and Rawat, G. S. 2008. Dispersal modes and spatial patterns of tree species in a tropical forest in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. Tropical Conservation Science 1 (3): 163-183. ==Fauna== At least 40 mammal species occur in Pakhui Tiger Reserve (PTR). Three large cats - the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard and clouded leopard share space with two canids ‚Äì the wild dog and Asiatic jackal. Among the herbivore species, elephant, barking deer, gaur, and sambar are most commonly encountered. The commonest monkeys are the Rhesus macaque, Assamese macaque and the capped langur. In addition, PTR is home to as many as sixteen species of viverrids, weasels and mongooses. Commonly seen in pairs is the yellow-throated marten. Notable mammals in the Tiger Reserve are: tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, jungle cat, wild dog, jackal, Himalayan black bear, binturong, elephant, gaur, sambar, hog deer, barking deer, wild boar, yellow- throated marten, Malayan giant squirrel, flying squirrel, squirrel, capped langur, rhesus macaque, Assamese macaque, gaur. The presence of stamp tailed macaques has been reported by one researcher. At least 296 bird species have been recorded from PTR including the globally endangered white-winged wood duck, the unique ibisbill, and the rare Oriental bay owl. PTR is a good place to see hornbills. Roost sites of wreathed hornbills and great hornbill can be observed on the river banks. Birds seen in Pakke Tiger Reserve include: Jerdon's baza, pied falconet, white-cheeked hill-partridge, grey peacock- pheasant, elwe's crake, ibisbill, Asian emerald cuckoo, red-headed trogon, green pigeon spp., forest eagle owl, wreathed hornbill, great hornbill, collared broadbill and long-tailed broadbill, blue-naped pitta, lesser shortwing, Himalayan shortwing, Daurian redstart, Leschenault's forktail, lesser necklaced laughing-thrush, silver-eared leiothrix, white-bellied yuhina, yellow-bellied flycatcher warbler, sultan tit, ruby-cheeked sunbird, maroon oriole, and crow-billed drongo. Of the over 1500 butterfly species found in India, it is estimated that Pakke Tiger Reserve could be home to at least 500 species. A total of 36 reptile species and 30 amphibian species have been reported in Pakke Tiger Reserve. The Assam roofed turtle, a highly endangered species, is commonly sighted. The king cobra is sometimes seen on the fringes of villages and is not uncommon within the park. The pied warty frog, resembling bird droppings, is also found here. ==Park protection== Presently, there are 27 anti-poaching camps where 104 local youth and 20 gaon burrahs (village fathers) have been employed as forest watchers. A 41 km road has been constructed to ease logistics and deter poachers. The people living around the park belong to the Nyishi community. The Ghora Aabhe (a group of village chiefs) and Women Self Help Groups help authorities in wildlife protection by providing information and enforcing customary laws. The Nyishi community has joined hands with civil society and the forest department to protect hornbill nests. The Nyishi tribe uses fiber glass replicas of hornbills beaks as their head gear and has fines for hunting of tigers, among other regulations. The Ghora Aabhe Society (a group of village chiefs) was formed in 2006. A group of 12 village heads, along with the forest department, supports conservation efforts around Pakhui Tiger Reserve (PTR). Their work has been widely recognised, through several awards and articles in print media. The Ghora Aabhe enforce customary laws, institute penalties against hunting and logging, aid in capacity building and spread awareness of PTR. ==Visiting Pakke== * Essentials: trekking shoes, binoculars, camouflage, mosquito repellant * Temperature: 12 ‚Äì 34 ¬∞C * Monsoon: June to September * Best time to visit: November to April Getting there Pakke Tiger Reserve is accessible through Seijosa in the east, Bhalukpong in the west and Pakke Kessang in the north. * Roads: Seijosa is connected to Guwahati and Tezpur through the Soibari‚ÄìPakke Kessang road.

The Krishna river cuts its basin almost deep over a distance of through the reserve. There are several waterfalls in the reserve such as the Ethipothala Falls, Pedda Dukudu, Gundam and Chaleswaram. ==Ancient history== The ancient temples at Srisailam of Lord Mallikarjuna and his consort goddess Bhramaramba, an incarnation of Parvathi as the fair-complexioned boon from Brahma, contain one of the twelve sacred Shaiva Jyotirlingas and one of the eighteen Maha Shakthi peethas in India. This area contains ruins of Nagarjuna Viswa Vidyalayam. The site was once the location of many Buddhist universities and monasteries. The ruins of a fort of the 3rd century BCE Indian ruler, Ikshwaku Chandragupta overlook the Nirjivapuram (Lifeless city) valley. The ancient fort of king Pratap Rudra of the Kakatiya dynasty and several other forts are visible on the banks of the Krishna River. An ancient wall constructed there by the Kakateeyas is an impressive historic feature. This area contains several rock shelters and cave temples including: Akka Mahadevi Bhilam, Dattatreya Bhilam, Umaa Maheswaram, Kadalivanam, and Palankasari. ==Flora== The main types of forest biomes in the reserve are: southern tropical dry mixed deciduous forest, Hardwickia forest and Deccan thorn scrub forests with much Euphorbia scrub.

It forms part of Betla National Park and Palamau Wildlife Sanctuary. == Formation == The area in Latehar District in Jharkhand was set aside as protected in 1974 under the Indian Forests Act. Before the formation of the reserve, the area was used for cattle grazing and camping; it was acutely prone to forest fire. In 1973, the area was set up as the Palamu Tiger Reserve. == Area == The tiger reserve has a total area of with a core area of 414.93 km2 and a buffer area of 650 km2. Ramandag, Latoo and Kujurum forest villages are in the core area. Most of the villages are small; one village, Meral, consisted in 1993 of just of land, 9 families and 78 people. In 1993 there were 45 villages in the buffer area and about 60 more in the periphery of the reserve. , that number had grown to 136 villages that fall under the \\"buffer area\\" regulations of the Palamu Tiger Reserve. Only seven of the villages were in existence in 1923. The villagers have no legal claim to lands that were settled after 1973 when the buffer area for the reserve was created. == Wildlife == The tiger population is extremely scarce and counting them has become particularly difficult due to Naxalite activities that have increased since 1990. , the count, using DNA to prevent over-counting, is one male and five female tigers. The initial count in 1973 when the tiger reserve was created was 50 tigers, but some claim that this was an over-count without adequate controls. By 2005 the number of tigers was down to 38. The census in 2007 found only 17 tigers. The 2009 tiger census based on DNA analysis indicated that there were just six tigers in the reserve. The forest department claimed that, since the core area was almost inaccessible due to difficult terrain and the Naxalite presence, the census may not have found all the tigers. No new tigers have been found in the years since and decreased game and hunting opportunities suggest that these are the only six. As of 1989, 65 elephants were believed to reside in the reserve. Apart from tigers and elephants, leopards, gaurs, sambars and wild dogs live in the reserve. (For a more exhaustive list see article about Betla National Park.) Though the North Koel River runs through the reserve, the animals depend on man-made holes for water, making them easily accessible to humans. Over 140 species of birds (including peafowl) have been sighted in the reserve. Two white vultures were spotted by the officials of Palamu Tiger Reserve in Chainpur in 2013.Rare vultures sighted in Palamu after a decade, The Times of India They were seen on the sand bed of River North Koel, said sources. This is the first time in 10 years that a vulture has been sighted in Palamu. ==Issues== *Increased pressure from human activities, including illegal settlement and poaching, has reduced the number of tigers and the ability of the reserve to support more tigers. *Funding has been a continuing problem. Since there is not an adequate management plan for the reserve, it continues to be so. *Staff shortage is big problem. Monitoring, protection and conservation work is not applied in all region of this reserve. *Naxalites existence along with difficult terrain makes proper surveillance and implementation of conservation measures tough. ==See also== *Palamu district *Latehar district *Palamu Fort * Medininagar National Park ==References * Project Tiger homepage for Palamu Tiger Reserve Category:Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests Category:Tiger reserves of India Category:Tourist attractions in Jharkhand Category:Wildlife sanctuaries in Jharkhand ","title":"Palamau Tiger Reserve"},{"id":"19338850","text":"is a Japanese volleyball player who played for Kurobe AquaFairies.

Phospholipids are the primary lipids composing cellular membranes. Phospholipids can be saponified, which releases the fatty acids contained in their diglyceride tail. Once the phospholipids of an unknown sample are saponified, the composition of the resulting PLFA can be compared to the PLFA of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism. PLFA analysis may be combined with other techniques, such as stable isotope probing to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample. PLFA analysis was pioneered by D.C. White at the University of Tennessee, in the early to mid 1980s. Phospholipid bilayer. Each phospholipid consists of a polar hydrophilic head (red) and two hydrophobic fatty acid tails. The fatty acid structure affects the bilayer structure. Fatty acids with an unsaturated tail (blue) disrupt the packing of those with only saturated tails (black). The resulting bilayer has more free space and is consequently more permeable to water and other small molecules. ==Phospholipid fatty acid analysis== PLFAs are an essential structural component of all microbial cellular membranes. PLFA analysis is a technique widely used for estimation of the total biomass and to observe broad changes in the community composition of the living microbiota of soil and aqueous environments. There has been a surge of interest in PLFAs in recent years, evident from the large increase in peer-reviewed journal references on the subject. However, there is increasing concern that some researchers are assigning PLFAs to specific microbial classes when in fact those PLFAs are present in a broad range of life forms. Phospholipids can occur in many biological classes (such as in plant roots, fungi, as well as in soil bacteria), so care has to be taken in over-assigning PLFA biomarkers to the wrong class. Even though phospholipids occur in many different life forms, the fatty acid side chains between differing life forms can be quite unique. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. 18:3 œâ3c) are found in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, but are often not present in bacteria. Monounsaturated fatty acids (particularly at the omega-7 position), odd-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g. 15:0), branched-chain fatty acids (mainly iso/anetiso and 10-methyl) and cyclopropane fatty acids (e.g. 19:0 cyclo œâ7c) are mostly synthesized by bacteria. The polyunsaturated fatty acid, 18:2 œâ6c (linoleic acid), is found in soil fungi, whereas the monounsaturated fatty acid, 16:1 œâ5c, is predominant in Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The basic premise is that as individual organisms (especially bacteria and fungi) die, phospholipids are rapidly degraded and the remaining phospholipid content of the sample is assumed to be from living organisms. As the phospholipids of different groups of bacteria and fungi contain a variety of somewhat unusual fatty acids, they can serve as useful biomarkers for such groups. PLFA profiles and composition can be determined by purifying the phospholipids and then cleaving the fatty acids for further analysis. Knowledge of the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiota in soils, water and waste materials is useful in optimizing crop production, in bioremediation and in understanding microbial ecosystems. Soil microbial community analysis by PLFA has been a widely used technique due to the sensitive, reproducible measurement of the dominant portions of the soil microbiota and the fact that PLFA does not require cultivation of the organisms. Sampling of soil populations by culturing has proven not cost effective and results in biased results due to the differing ease of culturing of some organisms. The main drawback of PLFA has been that the extraction time is very long and cumbersome. A new 96-well plate PLFA extraction procedure has been developed which represents a 4-to-5 fold increase in throughput over traditional PLFA extraction methods. This new method, coupled to new software tools for analyzing the PLFA data, will be useful to laboratories performing large numbers of PLFA analyses, or for laboratories wanting to begin PLFA research.

However, due to difficulty in culturing many of the organisms, the differential growth rates of the organisms, and labor involved, this proved to be not satisfactory. A 1965 article proposed using molecules produced by the organisms as biomarkers for the microbial communities. In the following two decades, rapid progress was made in development of gas chromatographs (GC) and of fused silica capillary columns for the GC instruments, enabling better analysis of biological materials, including fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). PLFA analysis can be used for microbial community structure and activity through the use of ‚Äúsignature‚Äù fatty acids. The basic concept is that the phospholipid content represents living organisms as these compounds are rapidly decomposed in aerobic mixed communities and that some of the neutral lipid components such as the lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria do not reflect organisms alive at the time of sampling. PLFA sample preparation Although the method of sample collection is different for soil, water samples, etc., the extraction-derivatization is generally similar to the following protocol from an article on soil microbial communities. The lipids were extracted from the dried soil sample by use of a chloroform-methanol-phosphate buffer mixture by use of a brief sonication followed by shaking for 2 hours and centrifugation to pellet the soil material. The liquid above the soil had additional chloroform and water added to cause separation of the lipid-containing chloroform from the buffer/methanol phase. The lipids were fractionated on a solid-phase extraction column and the neutral lipids, free fatty acids and other materials discarded and the phospholipid phase then dried, prior esterification to form the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) to make them suitable for analysis. Analysis of FAMEs Gas chromatography (GC) analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is the method of choice for analysis of PLFAs from soil. The GC is coupled with either a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) or a flame ionization detector (FID). The GC-MSD system is more expensive to purchase and maintain, requires considerable skill to operate, and is typically used for qualitative analysis only. Identification of fatty acids using the GC-FID system is typically use for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAMEs, and is usually dependent on comparison of retention times of the unknown fatty acid compounds in comparison to purchased FAME standards. A commercially available, fatty-acid based microbial identification system (using GC-FID), which reproducibly names and quantitates the FAMEs, has been widely adopted for PLFA analysis. ==The PLFA components of soil microbiota== Actinomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria that are some of the most common bacteria in soil, freshwater and marine environments. Actinomycetes are active in decomposition of organic matter and give rise to the rich \\"earthy\\" smell of freshly tilled soils. This group of bacteria produce distinctive biomarker fatty acids having a methyl branch at the 10th carbon, such as 16:0 10-methyl and 18:0 10-methyl. Some common species of soil actinomycetes include Rhodococcus, Nocardia, Corynebacterium, and Streptomyces. Gram-positive bacteria include aerobic Bacillus species especially those related to B. cereus and to B. subtilis. These bacteria are common in the bulk soil and increase in numbers in the rhizosphere. The PLFA profiles of these Gram- positive species have high percentages of biomarker branched-chain fatty acids such as 15:0 iso and 15:0 anteiso. Thus, the sum of the iso and anteiso fatty acids in a PLFA analysis may provide an estimate of the abundance of the Gram- positive bacteria (other than actinomycetes) in the sample. Gram-negative bacteria are a major component of the plant rhizosphere and improve plant growth by increasing solubility of phosphate, producing ionophore compounds that increase uptake of iron or other minerals and may produce antifungal compounds. Gram-negative bacteria produce high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g. 16:1 omega-7 and 18:1 omega-9) during active metabolism but convert much of the unsaturated fatty acid composition to cyclopropane fatty acids (e.g. 17:0 cyclopropane and 19:0 cyclopropane) when metabolism and cell division slow due to shortage of nutrition or other stress. Thus, in PLFA analysis, the sum of monounsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids may provide an estimate of the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria. A high ratio of cyclopropane to monounsaturated fatty acid indicates stress conditions. Anaerobic bacteria in agriculture are primarily a factor in soils of low oxygen levels such as occur in greater depths or of wet conditions such as in rice paddies. Using PLFA analysis in early sampling, the bacteria- archaea consortia in rice paddy soil was about 44% aerobic bacteria, 32% facultatively anaerobic- bacteria and 24% archaea. Under longer term flooding, the levels were 27%, 36% and 37% respectively and with total biomass being significantly lower. Dimethyl acetals (DMA) formed during derivatization are considered to be biomarkers of anaerobic bacteria. Archaea are universally distributed in soils and have been shown to control nitrification in acidic conditions and to contribute to ammonia oxidation in agricultural and forest soils. However, as the phospholipids of archaea are not ester linked as in bacteria, but are ether linked, they are not significantly present in routine PLFA sample preparation which is designed to cleave ester-linked fatty acids. Arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) penetrate the walls of cortical cells of about 80% of all vascular plant families, generating a symbiotic relationship. The fungi form membrane structures adjacent to the plant cell membrane allowing exchange of phosphorus, nitrogen compounds and minerals from the fungus and the plant provides the fungus primarily with photosynthesis-derived sugars. As the AMF are obligate symbiotic fungi, they are not free-living in the soil. The AMF hyphae in the root form lipid materials which then are transported to the hyphae that extend into the soil from the root and thus may occur in a soil sample. Vesicles are lipid storage organs of AMF and these and the hyphae in the soil contain the fatty acids 18:2 w6c (often used as an indicator of fungal content of the PLFA analysis) as well as containing the fatty acid 16:1 w5c which has been recommended as a biomarker for AMF (PLFA fraction:AMF hyphae and NLFA fraction:AMF spores). ==Applications of PLFA analysis== Sampling of agricultural soils for analysis of chemical composition (e.g. pH, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, etc.) has long been practiced in crop production and while there has been recognition of the importance of the soil microbiota, tools for studying the microbiota have been developed relatively recently. High value vegetable crops Many high-value vegetable crops easily justify soil testing both for chemical content and the soil microbiota. Conventional, low-input and organic farming systems showed a rapid response of the soil microbial communities to wet/dry cycles and that increases in bacterial cyclopropyl fatty acids were useful to detect periods of stress. Lines of transgenic corn (maize) expressing Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxins were found to have small effect on soil microbial communities when compared by PLFA analysis to their non-transgenic isolines. Successful exotic invasive plant species can have profound effects on the microbial communities of the soil perhaps thus improving their competitiveness. Grassland restoration practices of tillage, weeding and herbicide use showed an impact on microbial communities of the upper soil but very small changes on the microbiota of lower soil layers and that after 4 years of recovery the communities were very similar to untreated plots. Bioremediation Bioremediation has been studied using PLFA analysis of soil microbiota from sites contaminated by diesel oil, crude oil, explosives, olive mill waste, pentachlorophenol, coal tar and PCBs. There are reports of the effects on PLFAs of heavy metals on arbuscular fungi and on bacteria, of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on rice paddy bacteria and of methylene chloride on bacteria. Phytoplankton Phytoplankton (eukaryotic algae) are microscopic photosynthesizing plants that inhabit the sunlit layers of oceans and bodies of freshwater. As the primary source of elaborated carbon compounds, they are vital to the aquatic food web. Phytoplankton produce considerable amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 w3c), with microalgae being the origin of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil. The diverse taxonomic groups in algae vary in abundance dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, sunlight, and nutrient availability. The PLFA biomarker compositions were found to enable determination of the prevalence of the major groups in several marine environments. In a study of reservoir sedimentary deposits, an assumption was made that the community PUFA content constituted ca. 50% of the total microeukaryotic PLFAs. It was also assumed that \\"The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids describes the relative contribution of phototrophic to heterotrophic members of the microeukaryotic community‚Ä¶.\\" Aquatic environments In contrast to the considerable microbial diversity in soils, free-living microbes distributed by marine currents and exposed to algal exudates exhibit global distributions for a few dominant microbial groups of relatively few species. Streambed sediments displayed a variation in microbial community structure (as measured by PLFA) related to the forest environment and geographic location of the stream, with much of the variation determined by use of the algal biomarker fatty acid 18:3 w3. By PLFA analysis, considerable spatial and seasonal variations were determined in a freshwater reservoir sedimentary microbial community. Forestry Coniferous forests are dependent on available nutrients in soil rather than agricultural fertilizers and thus are routinely colonized by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The mycorrhizae may be ectomycorrhizae (EMF) and/or arbuscular (AMF) in type in the forest. The amount of total PLFA in soil provides an estimate of the total soil fungi (not including AMF). The AMF can be estimated by the amount of 16:1 w5c fatty acid in the PLFA. Water stress was indicated by an increase in [PLFA ratios of saturated, monounsaturated and (cyclo 17:0 + cyclo 19:0) / (16:1 w7c + 18:1 w7c)] in a Douglas fir forest. Boreal forests with low soil pH values had elevated EM PLFAs and raising the pH of the soil increased bacterial PLFAs. The introduction of photosynthates through tree roots is a major source of carbon for soil microbiota and influences the composition of fungal and bacterial communities. Forest areas without tree roots had less fungal biomarkers and more actinobacterial biomarkers than areas with tree roots. Addition of nitrogen fertilizer to an oak forest reduced the ectomycorrhizal fungal content of the soil microbiota. Composting Composting of organic materials is the microbial degradation of heterogeneous organic material under moist, self-heating, aerobic conditions. Initially, activity by mesophilic organisms leads to a rapid rise in temperature, followed by thermophilic organisms dominating the degradation process leading to a cooling period in which mesophilic bacteria again dominate populations. A commercial FAME extraction protocol developed for identification of bacteria, a mild alkaline methanolysis protocol and PLFA-extraction/derivatization were compared for effectiveness. The PLFA protocol gave the most detailed information about community succession, however, the other two protocols were much simpler and appeared suitable for analysis of microbial FAME profiles in compost. Wastewater treatment Activated sludge technology is the most widely used method for wastewater treatment. Complex microbial communities in activated sludge processes are needed for the stable removal efficiency of organic pollutants. PLFA analysis can be used to monitor the microbial community composition of activated sludge reactors, which microbial groups are predominant, and the efficiency of such systems. ==References *USDA/NRCS Recommended Soil Health Indicators - Technical Note No. 450-03 *Soil Health Institute - North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements Category:Fatty acids Category:Sustainable agriculture Category:Soil biology Category:Mycology ","title":"Phospholipid-derived fatty acids"},{"id":"19338941","text":"\\"Down in the Valley\\", also known as \\"Birmingham Jail\\", is a traditional American folk song.

Guitarist Jimmie Tarlton claimed to have written the lyrics in 1925 while he was jailed in Birmingham for moonshining. It was first recorded by Tarlton and his partner Tom Darby on November 10, 1927 in Atlanta, Georgia for Columbia Records. According to one biographer of the folk musician Lead Belly, he performed it for Texas Governor Pat Neff at the Sugarland Penitentiary in 1924. The ballad is played in the 3/4 time signature. Lyrics vary, as with most folk songs. For example, sometimes the line \\"Hang your head over, hear the wind blow\\" is replaced by \\"Late in the evening, hear the train blow\\". In 1927, Darby and Tarlton sang \\"down in the levee\\" in place of \\"down in the valley\\"; the version sung by Lead Belly in 1934 substitutes \\"Shreveport jail\\" for \\"Birmingham jail\\". ==Selected recordings== * Darby and Tarlton (1927, Columbia 15212D) ‚Äì sold over 200,000 copies, one of Columbia's best-sellers at the time * The Andrews Sisters recorded it in 1944 and their version briefly reached the Billboard charts. They had featured the song in the film Moonlight and Cactus (1944). * Patti Page - a single release in 1951. * Cisco Houston included his version of the songs in two of his albums. * Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) * Connie Francis - included in her album Sing Along with Connie Francis (1961). * Jo Stafford - for her album Do I Hear a Waltz? (1966) * Slim Whitman - in his album Cool Water (1968). * Jerry Garcia and David Grisman, on the 1996 album Shady Grove ==In other media== This song is the basis of the 1945 Kurt Weill and Arnold Sundgaard opera Down in the Valley. It was performed by Anne Baxter in the Wagon Train episode, ‚ÄúThe Kitty Angel Story‚Äú (1959). It was performed on The Alvin Show and The Andy Griffith Show in 1962. The author/songwriter David M. Pierce used selected lyrics from the song as titles for a series of detective novels written between 1989 and 1996: Down in the Valley, Hear the Wind Blow, Dear, Roses Love Sunshine, Angels in Heaven, Write Me a Letter and As She Rides By. The first four verses are featured in Catherine Marshall's novel, Christy, before the prologue. It is sung in the movie Stir Crazy by the character Grossberger portrayed by Erland Van Lidth. The actual recorded artist is Dorian Holley; as credited in the movie's soundtrack. Jim and Anna sing the song in Tillie Olsen's novel Yonnondio: From the Thirties as they arrive in the Dakotas. The 3/4 time and melancholy of the song contrast with the hope they are feeling as they arrive there. The song is performed by Ronny Cox (Ozark Bule) and David Carradine (Woody Guthrie) in the Academy Award winning film (Best Cinematography/Best Music-Score) Bound for Glory (biography of Woody Guthrie) in the scene that takes place in a migrant fruit pickers camp. http://www.halashby.co.uk/page18.html It is also used in the movie Along the Great Divide starring Kirk Douglas, Walter Brennan, Virginia Mayo, and John Agar although it was written long after the time period set of the movie. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ‚ÄúDark Page‚Äù, a mental projection of Deanna Troi's father sings the song, stating she could never fall asleep as a baby unless she heard it. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by author Suzanne Collins, Lucy Gray Baird sings her variant of the song, changing the words to \\"To the Capitol Jail\\" instead of \\"To Birmingham Jail.\\" ==References== * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * \\"Traditional Ballad Index of Folk Songs\\" at California State University, Fresno * \\"Down in the Valley\\", Darby and Tarlton 1929 recording at the Internet Archive * Down in the valley, the sheet music Category:American folk songs Category:Children's songs Category:Songs about Alabama Category:1927 songs ","title":"Down in the Valley (folk song)"},{"id":"19338950","text":"Samseongsan is a mountain in South Korea.

Racing started on 30 January. The Louis Vuitton Pacific Series was organised in association with the New Zealand Government, Emirates Team New Zealand, the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Auckland City and Skycity Entertainment Group. Bruno Troubl√© was Louis Vuitton's organizer and spokesperson for the Series. The creation of the event was in response to the legal battle surrounding the America's Cup yachting competition at the time. Because of the long delays from the legal action, and the fact that the 33rd America's Cup became a Deed of Gift match without a defender or challenger selection series, the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series was established as a competition for other America's Cup racing syndicates. Ten syndicates took part in the regatta, which used four International America's Cup Class boats loaned to the regatta by Team New Zealand and BMW Oracle Racing. This made participation more affordable for the teams. Described by its creators as a \\"fun and friendly event\\", the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series relied on the concept of loaned boats and quick and short races with an abbreviated schedule to pack 53 match races into a three-week period. Racing was held every day except on one scheduled lay day. Team New Zealand won the Louis Vuitton Pacific Trophy, beating the Swiss Alinghi team 3‚Äì1 in the Cup Final. In September 2009, this initial event was expanded into the four Louis Vuitton Trophy regattas, held between November 2009 and November 2010. These events continued to be relatively low cost, using a small number of loaned boats to keep syndicates active while waiting for the 8th Louis Vuitton Cup to determine the challenger for the 34th America's Cup. ==Course/Schedule== Up to six match races were held each day on a short windward-leeward course laid at the entrance to Auckland's WaitematƒÅ Harbour, between Rangitoto Island and the city foreshore. Four different courses were used depending on weather patterns. Emirates Team New Zealand, as hosts, earnt direct entry into the Louis Vuitton final. However, the team was also allocated to a pool and raced in the preliminary qualifying rounds. Points won by Team New Zealand in pool play were disregarded when the rankings were determined after the qualifying rounds. The 10 teams were divided into two qualifying groups of five, with the top three teams in each pool proceeding to the Gold Fleet and the remaining two teams proceeding to the Silver Fleet. The winner of the Gold Fleet earnt direct entry into the Challenger's Final, with the remaining teams in the Gold Fleet, and the two winners of the Silver Fleet, proceeding to the Third Round. The winner of the Third Round then met the winner of the Gold Fleet in the Challenger's Final; the winner of which proceeded to the final to race against Emirates Team New Zealand. The winner of final was presented with the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series trophy. ==The Yachts== Team New Zealand provided NZL-92 and NZL-84 for the event and BMW Oracle Racing shipped USA-87 and USA-98 from Valencia for the event. The boats arrived in Auckland in mid-December. All four boats were extensively redesigned and worked on by onshore crew before the event. The boats were simplified and as a result did not completely meet IACC standards. The changes were made to make the boats easier to operate and make the races as even as possible. ==Pools/Results== Pool A (USA 87 & 98) 30 January ‚Äì 3 February { -  {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !width=195 Team Name !width=20 abbr=\\"Raced\\" Races !width=20 abbr=\\"Won\\" W !width=20 abbr=\\"Drawn\\" D !width=20 abbr=\\"Lost\\" L !width=20 abbr=\\"Points\\" Pts - style=\\"background: #BEF574;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Team New Zealand 44004 - style=\\"background: #BEF574;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" BMW Oracle Racing 43013 - style=\\"background: #BEF574;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Damiani Italia Challenge 42022 - style=\\"background:\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Pataguas K-Challenge 41031 - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" China Team 40040 }  {  border=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! width=40  ! width=50 TNZ ! width=50 PKC ! width=50 BOR ! width=50 DIC ! width=50 CHT - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" TNZ style=\\"background: #000000;\\" style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (1:38) style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:28) style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:19) style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:59) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" PKC style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #000000;\\" style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (1:02) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" BOR style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:54) style=\\"background: #000000;\\" style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:52) style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (1:28) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" DIC style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (0:45) style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #000000;\\" style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"W (1:18) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" CHT style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #dddddd;\\"L style=\\"background: #000000;\\" } } Number in brackets is winning delta.

Initially ordained an Orthodox clergyman, in 1907 Verigin changed his religious position united himself to Catholic faith. From 1910 to 1929 was a priest who celebrated Mass in a Russian Catholic church in Rome and participated as a member of Pro Russia movement, however maintaining pessimistic views in relation to Russian Orthodoxy union with Catholic Church. Verigin died in 1938.\\"THE HISTORICAL DESTINY OF THE RUSSIAN CATHOLIC TRADITION OF THE BYZANTINE RITE\\". ==Biography== Sergiy Verigin was born in Ljubljana in a family of Russian nobles, his father was then working in the Russian embassy. In 1888 graduated from high school in Moscow, after which he entered the Moscow Theological Academy, where he studied with Father Nicholas Tolstoy, who took the union with Catholic Church in 1894. In 1889 Verigin dedicated to the priesthood in the Penza and received a gold cross as a sign of special favor and the location of the emperor. By tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church was forced to marry her, but married life was painful about. Sergius, and at the first opportunity, distanced himself from his wife and children and saw them only occasionally. In 1905 sent as a priest in France and served in Pau and Biarritz until mid 1907. On August 28, 1907 Father Verigin joined to the Catholic Church and Cardinal Rampolla del Tindaro specifically addressed him the issue of accession. Sergiy Verigin repeatedly crossed the border of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There he met with Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky that on August 8, 1910 attributed it to his diocese as a missionary with the right to conduct services in the Russian Catholic Church in Rome. From 1910 until the demolition of the church in 1932 he served the Divine Liturgy in the Russian Catholic Church of Saint Lawrence in Rome and on October 10, 1932 Verigin was appointed rector of the new church of Saint Anthony in Russicum .

He was a 2014 All Australian and has previously won a Sandover Medal while playing with Peel Thunder. ==Early career== Only 174 cm tall, Ballantyne started his career with Peel Thunder in the West Australian Football League in 2005 as a midfielder. In 2008, Ballantyne moved into the forward line with great success, kicking 75 goals to finish second in the Bernie Naylor Medal behind Subiaco's Brad Smith, and winning the Sandover Medal by 2 votes from Callum Chambers as the fairest and best player in the league. To recognise this achievement, Peel Thunder named the outer wing at Rushton Park the Hayden Ballantyne Wing in April 2009. ==AFL career== Ballantyne's success in the WAFL attracted the attention of AFL recruiters, and at the age of 21, he was drafted by the Fremantle Football Club with its second round selection in the 2008 AFL National Draft (pick No. 21 overall).Clarke, Tim; Ballantynes rise continues with Sandover glory ; WAToday; 16 September 2008 Ballantyne risked being excluded from the draft when he missed the Western Australian state screening session due to being overseas on a holiday. He was later tested individually and allowed to remain nominated for the draft.Ballantyne unconcerned by AFL draft drama; ABC News; 22 October 2008 Ballantyne was a mature-age draftee at the age of 21, with most draftees no older than 18. Ballantyne won the 2011 AFL Goal of the Year. In his role as a small forward, Ballantyne became noted for his ability to pester and annoy his opponents, and to often win free kicks by encouraging overzealous retaliation from them. In April 2012, the Herald Sun newspaper named him as the league's \\"chief pest\\" for his success in this aspect of the game, in the week after champion Geelong full-back Matthew Scarlett had received a three-week suspension for such a retaliatory punch (Ballantyne himself was suspended for one week for a separate incident in the same match). Ballantyne received some criticism following his lacklustre performance in the 2013 AFL Grand Final, which Fremantle lost by 15 points. At the end of the 2017 season, Ballantyne signed a one-year contract extension. In August 2018, he signed a further one-year contract extension for the 2019 season. In August 2019 Ballantyne was informed that he would not be offered a contract extension for 2020. ==Post AFL career== Ballantyne has signed with Peel Thunder for the 2020 WAFL Season. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2019 seasonHayden Ballantyne's player profile at AFL Tables - - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2009 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  17  8  10  9  64  23  87  25  14  1.3  1.1  8.0  2.9  10.9  3.1  1.8 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2010 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  19  33  17  180  85  265  64  62  1.7  0.9  9.5  4.5  13.9  3.4  3.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2011 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  17  23  19  190  66  256  52  59  1.4  1.1  11.2  3.9  15.1  3.1  3.5 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2012 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  21  31  17  236  81  317  58  79  1.5  0.8  11.2  3.9  15.1  2.8  3.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2013 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  21  34  30  204  72  276  82  66  1.6  1.4  9.7  3.4  13.1  3.9  3.1 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2014 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  20  49  26  194  49  243  86  54  2.5  1.3  9.7  2.5  12.2  4.3  2.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2015 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1  15  15  13  119  50  169  36  59  1.0  0.9  7.9  3.3  11.3  2.4  3.9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1  20  26 17  159  84 243  64  60 1.3  0.8  8.0  4.2  12.2  3.2  3.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2017 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  10  11  7  71  33  104  32  34  1.1  0.7  7.1  3.3  10.4  3.2  3.4 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2018 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  17  21  14  127  60  187  57  37  1.2  0.8  7.5  3.5  11.0  3.4  2.2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2019 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  3  1  3  23  10  33  8  6  0.3  1.0  7.7  3.3  11.0  2.7  2.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 171 ! 254 ! 172 ! 1567 ! 613 ! 2180 ! 564 ! 530 ! 1.49 ! 1.01 ! 9.16 ! 3.58 ! 12.74 ! 3.3 ! 3.1 } ==Personal life== Ballantyne's father, Graeme Ballantyne is a horse trainer based at Lark Hill, Rockingham.

It is, within the Canadian system of honours, the fifth highest of the war and operational service medals. ==Design== Designed by Carl Gauthier and Fraser Herald Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, the South-West Asia Service Medal is in the form of a nickel- plated gunmetal disc with, on the obverse, the Latin words ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA (Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen) and, separated by maple leaves, CANADA, all surrounding an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II wearing the George IV State Diadem, symbolizing her roles as both fount of honour and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces.

Should an individual already possessing a South-West Asia Service Medal be awarded the medal bar for combat service, he or she is granted a claspin nickel-plated gunmetal with raised edges and bearing the word AFGHANISTANfor wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended. ==Eligibility and allocation== On 6 August 2002, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, created the South-West Asia Service Medal to recognize members of the Canadian Forces who had provided support in the War in Afghanistan. To qualify for the medal, individuals had to have served in operations conducted in Southwest Asia for at least 90 days after 11 September 2001, and those who for a minimum of 30 days engaged in direct combat with the enemy in the theatre of war (which included Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, Suez Canal, and north-western parts of the Indian Ocean) were entitled to receive the additional medal bar; in total, 7,497 medals were issued, along with 7,200 bars. ==See also== * Canadian order of precedence (decorations and medals) * Gulf War military awards ==References * Category:Canadian campaign medals ","title":"South-West Asia Service Medal"},{"id":"19339038","text":"–í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ë—É–ª—å–∏–Ω (born May 18, 1972 in Penza, U.S.S.R.) is a former Russian professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the Russian Superleague and Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). ==Playing career== Boulin was drafted 103rd overall in the 5th round by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft.

He served as an officer in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, most noted for his performance in the early part of the Battle of Westport in 1864. After the war, Jackman fled to Mexico, then returned to the United States. He again took up farming, served as a state legislator, and later entered law enforcement. ==Early life and career== Jackman was born in Jessamine County, Kentucky, in the spring of either 1826 or 1828, the son of Thomas Jackman and his wife Mary Drake. Sometime in 1830, the family moved to Howard County, Missouri, where Sidney Jackman was taught some basic schooling. By late in the 1840s he was living in Boone County, Missouri, where he look up work as a schoolteacher as well as farming. On February 18, 1849, Jackman married his first wife, Martha Rachael Slavin, in Boone County, and they would have two daughters and four sons together. Soon after getting married Jackman moved his family to Howard County, Missouri, and in 1855 they settled in Papinville, located in Bates County. In both locales Jackman again was farming and teaching. Jackman organized local militias while in Papinville to deal with \\"Jayhawker\\" and other raids from nearby Kansas, and in 1860 he relocated his family further into Missouri's interior to try to avoid these troubles. By the time of the American Civil War, Jackman was a captain in the Missouri State Militia. ==Civil War service== Jackman chose to follow the Confederate cause in 1861 and entered the Missouri State Guard. In May 1862 he led cavalry troops in the raid of Neosho, Missouri. In the summer of 1862 was authorized to raise a cavalry regiment of Missourians in Arkansas. Finding this slow going, he obtained permission to recruit in Missouri.McGhee, pp. 233-234 On August 16 Jackman fought at the Battle of Lone Jack, where he led troops that helped defeat the Union forces occupying Lone Jack, Missouri. While this unit was originally mounted, upon its return to Arkansas it was dismounted by Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman. It was mustered into Confederate service on August 31 in Arkansas under Col. Jackman. It was designated the 7th, then the 16th Missouri Infantry. On October 25, 1862, Jackman resigned to resume recruiting in Missouri.McGhee, p. 234 Jackman would serve in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War, mainly participating in irregular guerilla style tactics against Union targets. By the fall and winter of 1862 Jackman had successfully recruited enough troops to aid the regular Confederate Army raids into Missouri. On January 11, 1863, his men entered Union-held Columbia, hoping to free Confederates in the city's jail, but the attempt failed. On April 23 Jackman and his troopers kidnapped Missouri Militia (Union)Eicher, 2001, p. 119 Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Bartholow and then set up camp at Glasgow. On June 1 Jackman's small command encountered and defeated a group of Federal cavalry, where he reportedly shot the leader of the Union horsemen. In May 1864 Jackman and his men entered Arkansas and were based near the Boston Mountains in the northwest part of the state. By June he had recruited a cavalry regiment that was to be called \\"Jackman's Missouri Cavalry\\" which was added to Brig. Gen. Joseph Shelby's cavalry division of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's Army of Missouri in the Trans-Mississippi Department. That fall Jackman's command (a cavalry brigade consisting of two regiments and two battalions of raw recruits) participated in Price's Raid. During the first stages of the raid Jackman led the attack and capture of Union-held Glasgow. Westport Jackman fought in the Union victory at the Battle of Westport near modern-day Kansas City, Missouri, on October 22 - 23, 1864, one of the war's largest clash of mounted troops. During the first day of the battle, he led the attack that routing the Federals from their initial position, and early on second day his brigade launched a successful attack directly on Westport. When the Confederate rear collapsed during his attack he was ordered to halt and act as rear guard to fend off the Union pursuit. Two days later in Kansas at the Battle of Mine Creek, Jackman's cavalry was ordered to guard Price's supply trains and thus missed the Confederate defeat and resulting rout, though his brigade succeeded in slowing the Federal pursuit. During his raids and skirmishes Union soldiers had taken his family into custody in 1865, as \\"retribution for his guerilla activities.\\" At first, they were held in St. Louis, Missouri, later moved to Natchez, Mississippi, and finally held at Alexandria, Louisiana, until the end of the war. On May 10, 1865, Jackman was promoted to the rank of brigadier general by the commander of the Trans- Mississippi Department, Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith; however his appointment was never confirmed by the Confederate Congress.Eicher, p. 601. \\"Edmund K. Smith, Trans-Miss Dept., Series of 1865, General Orders No. 46\\" ==Postbellum== With the collapse of the Confederate States in 1865, Jackman and some of his men decided not to surrender and headed for Mexico. Along the way, Jackman reunited with his now-released family in Shreveport, Louisiana, and proceeded with them toward Texas and the border. Near the end of 1865 they arrived in the city of San Marcos, located in Hays County, Texas. Jackman entered northern Mexico, leaving his family in Texas while he ascertained whether to relocate there. Deciding against it, he crossed back into the United States and surrendered to Federal authorities in San Antonio. Taken to New Orleans, Louisiana, took the loyalty oath to the U.S. Government, and was subsequently paroled. During 1867 Jackman bought a ranch near Kyle, Texas, and settled his family there, farming and raising cattle. He and his wife helped found the First Christian Church, Disciples of Christ, and he later was a Blanco Chapel Free School trustee. His wife of 21 years, Martha, died in 1870. In 1873 Jackman won election as representative to the Fourteenth Texas Legislature. Jackman remarried in 1875 to Cass (Kyle) Gains, a widow, and they would have two sons and two daughters together. On March 17, 1885, Jackman was appointed the U.S. Marshal for western Texas by U.S. President Grover Cleveland. He held this post until his death at his home in Kyle in June 1886. He is buried in the town's Kyle Cemetery. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Acting Confederate) ==NotesReferences== * Allardice, Bruce S.

Founder and vocalist Mike Park announced his departure from Skankin' Pickle in the liner notes of The Green Album, writing \\"The band has been such a big part of my life but I feel it is time to move on!\\".

Adam Walters ==Journalistic career==  Early career  Walters' first job was at The Daily Advertiser, in his home town of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales.https://au.news.yahoo.com/nsw/a/15538591/seven-wins-tv-news-walkley- award/ In 1985 he moved to Sydney, working as a reporter and newsreader for radio 2WS, 2CH and 2 Triple M. In 1989 he joined The Daily Telegraph. Television journalism In 1990, Walters made the transition to television, as a crime reporter for the Seven Network. In 2000, he switched to the Nine Network, continuing in the role of crime reporter. He shared a Walkley Award for the Nine News team's coverage of the 2002 Bali bombings - also nominated in the Logie Awards of 2003. In 2006, Walters became the Nine Network's NSW State Political Correspondent, and went on to earn Walkley and Logie award nominations for most outstanding television news reporting in 2007 after a series of stories which led to the resignation of the NSW Police Minister. Seven Network On 20 May 2010, Walters broke a story on Seven News in Sydney about the resignation of New South Wales Transport and Roads Minister David Campbell. The story used hidden camera footage of the Minister leaving a sex club in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Upon being told the story would air, Campbell resigned as Minister an hour prior to the news bulletin, and his resignation was accepted by then Premier Kristina Keneally. Although former NSW Labor Premier Barrie Unsworth said Campbell's actions were \\"deplorable\\" for exposing himself to \\"blackmail and compromise\\" the story was criticized by other sections of the media and by politicians. Despite the criticism the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) ruled Seven's Campbell story was in the public interest. After Labor's 2011 election defeat Fairfax Media's Sun-Herald State Political editor reported that the story about the former Police Minister and Chair of the NSW Crime Commission was a critical setback for former NSW Premier Kristina Keneally. In 2012 Walters and Seven News colleagues Lee Jeloscek, Sharri Markson and Michael Mckinnon won the Walkley Award for Television News Reporting for reports demonstrating that the NSW Government had disregarded departmental advice against a ban on regular unleaded petrol. Ten Network Walters joined Network Ten as a reporter in mid-2015. On 9 and 10 February 2016, Ten Eyewitness News broadcast a two-part story by Walters concerning an inquiry held by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The reports included assertions from Sydney businessman Charif Kazal that the inquiry had \\"destroy[ed]\\" his reputation, by providing a forum for \\"baseless\\" and \\"false\\" allegations that he had engaged in corrupt conduct. The first report included a claim from Mr Kazal that the ICAC commissioner at the time was aware there was no evidence to support the allegations, which were not the subject of any recommendation for prosecution. The reports were based on Kazal's objection to the damage of a \\"corruption\\" finding, despite the conclusion in ICAC's final report that: \\"The Commission is not of the opinion that consideration should be given to obtaining the advice of the DPP with respect to the prosecution of Charif Kazal for an offence under section 249B(2)(b) of the Crimes Act.249B(2)(b) of the Crimes Act This is because the Commission does not consider there is sufficient admissible evidence to make out the elements of the offence.\\" ICAC later accepted the advice of the NSW Director of Public Prosecution not to prosecute Charif Kazal for an offence under section 87 of the ICAC Act in relation to his evidence. The second report featured a direct appeal from Mr Kazal to then NSW Premier Mike Baird, who agreed to meet the businessman to hear his complaints.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/icac-inspector- asked-to-examine-suppression-of-evidence-in-kazal-case-20160226-gn54cg.html Fairfax Media reported:Fairfax Media > The outgoing acting inspector of NSW's anti-graft watchdog has recommended > winding back the agency's ability to label people \\"corrupt\\" because he says > an aspect of the power \\"undermines the presumption of innocence\\". > Legislation governing the Independent Commission Against Corruption states > that such a finding can be made if a person's actions \\"could\\" adversely > affect those of a public official or authority.

In 2018, almost two years after Walters broke the ICAC/Kazal story, The Australian newspaper revealed Mr Kazal's treatment had been referred to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In October 2019 The Daily Telegraph reported \\"the United Nations Human Rights Committee has reactivated an investigation into complaints by Sydney businessman, Charif Kazal, that his human rights have been violated by the NSW anti-corruption watchdog.\\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/united-nations- investigating-complaint-about-independent-commission-against-corruption/news- story/9bf82502996ee61d2edf19fc83da21a1 Print journalism In 2009, Walters reported on the proliferation of illegal brothels in NSW for The Daily Telegraph. The largest was subsequently closed down following a council investigation. Walters also reported on alleged child sexual abuse in Australian swimming, and a secret police investigation that had been set up to investigate allegations against swimming coach Terry Buck. Four years after he broke the story in 2009 the substance of Walters' coverage was submitted as testimony to the Royal Commission into the Institutional Responses to Child Abuse. Buck was never charged after the same allegations - examined by the Royal Commission - were made to a NSW police taskforce, suddenly disbanded just weeks after its investigations began in the months following the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

It was described as a new species and placed as the sole member of a new subfamily, Martialinae. The generic name means \\"from Mars\\" and was given due to its unusual morphology, and the species epithet heureka indicates the surprising discovery. It belongs to the oldest known distinct lineage to have diverged from the ancestors of all other ants. ==Etymology== The aberrant features of this ant led Stefan P. Cover and Edward O. Wilson to comment that it was an ant that had to be from Mars. The genus name, then, refers to the planet Mars, alluding to the strange characteristics that seem to come from nowhere; the species epithet is from Ancient Greek Œ∑·ΩïœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ± \\"I found it\\", echoing Archimedes' famous exclamation, meant to epitomize the troubles involved in the rediscovery of the species after the first specimen discovered in a soil sample was lost. ==Discovery== Two specimens were first discovered by Manfred Verhaagh of the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2000, but they were damaged. Later, a new specimen was collected in 2003 by Christian Rabeling, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. ==Description== Head of a worker Like all members of the family Formicidae, these ants have distinctive elbowed antennae, prominent metapleural glands, and distinctive petioles. The ants, though, lack compound eyes, are pale in colour, and lead a subterranean life, preying on small litter organisms. The workers have unusual, elongated mandibles, distinctly basal in their features. Based on the morphology, the authors suggested the ants lead an underground life, possibly foraging on the surface during the night. The first two specimens were found in soil core samples, while another was found in leaf litter. They probably make use of pre-existing underground cavities, as their legs do not show adaptations for digging. ==ReferencesCategory:Ants Category:Insects described in 2008 Category:Hymenoptera of South America Category:Holocene species first appearances ","title":"Martialis heureka"},{"id":"19339130","text":"The Acorn People is a non-fiction book for middle grade readers first published in 1976. It is a memoir by author, educator and storyteller Ron Jones about a summer he spent at a camp for disabled children. It was adapted for television in 1981. ==Summary== Ron Jones looks forward to his summer at Camp Wiggin, where he will work as a camp counselor. Although he knows the children who attend Camp Wiggin are disabled, he assumes he will still be able to have fun enjoying the outdoors, hiking, swimming and boating at the camp. He gets very discouraged in the beginning and says some pretty harsh things. When he arrives and meets the children, however, he is at first appalled at how severely disabled they are. Once he gets to know the children, he really starts to fall for them and even gets attached to the camp. When the camp ends, he is even discouraged to see the children leave. Then Jones meets his group of children‚Äîa group called \\"The Acorn People.\\" They have given themselves this name because of the acorn necklaces they make at camp. Over time, they teach their counselor that despite their disabilities, they are just like everyone else on the inside and that they are capable of accomplishing much more than he previously understood. Jones comes to care for and love these children as much as the full-time staff at Camp Wiggins. The Acorn People was honored as the Christian Book of the Year. ==Main characters== This story begins at Camp Wiggens, a camp that is suited to handicap children. Ron Jones is a camp counselor and is also in charge of five of the campers along with a man named Dominic. Ron didn't expect Camp Wiggens to be such hard job, as he took the job thinking that the kids were not so severely disabled. *Benny B: An African American child who has no use of his legs because of polio.

In the student newspaper The Fulcrum, the University's Director of Communications, Andr√©e Dumulon, stated that \\"[a]ccess was prohibited because we found that there were some unauthorized individuals in the lab.\\" Rancourt complained that the administration did not justify or explain the action. Rancourt was then banned from accessing the laboratory. On December 10, 2008, Rancourt was provided with two letters by administration officials. The first letter indicated that he was under administrative suspension and banned from campus, while the second indicated that the Dean of the Faculty of Science had recommended to the Board of Governors that Rancourt be fired. The stated reason for the University of Ottawa's actions was Rancourt's assigning of A+ grades to all students in his fourth-year physics courses in the Winter 2008 term. These courses include Quantum Mechanics (a required course) and Solid State Physics.

During this time period, all 3 conflicting factions (ARBiH, HVO, and VRS) have planted land mines near the current-day political entity borders, and as a result the country has had the most severe land mine problems in the world. ==Land mine situation== Landmine situation in BiH in September 2008 A Norwegian deminer at work in Bosnia in 2007 Bosnia and Herzegovina's contamination with land mines stems exclusively from the 1992‚Äì95 war in the country. By 1996, some two million land mines and unexploded munitions littered Bosnia. By September 2013 land mines and unexploded munitions remained scattered in 28,699 locations. A total of 1,230.70 km¬≤ (2.4% of the country's territory) was mined. Extensive landslides and the worst flooding since the 19th century, in May 2014, unearthed landmines prompting authorities to send in de-mining workers to locate and deactivate mines that were threatening residential areas. Land mine clearing is done by various government agencies and NGOs as well as some NATO military units. Between 1996 and 2017, more than 3,000 square kilometres have been cleared of mines. Bosnia and Herzegovina's strategic vision in 2008 was to clear all land mines by the year 2019.

GX animated series. ==Main characters== ; : :The main protagonist of the series. He is described as an energetic, passionate and optimistic boy who comes to Duel Academy to learn to become the new King of Games. He enjoys seeking out new duel challenges and is known to be quite lucky when it comes to his draws. He is capable of communicating with Duel Spirits, most often conversing with Winged Kuriboh, a card he received from Yugi Mutou on the day of his entrance exam. He specializes in using Fusion Monsters, his main deck being the Elemental Heroes deck before later obtaining a set of Neo-Spacian monsters and his key card, Elemental Hero Neos. Following the third season, in which he entered an alternate dimension and confronted the duel spirit, Yubel, he has gained the powers of both The Supreme King, an evil alter-ego he temporarily took on, and Yubel, giving him powerful insight. ; : :Jaden's roommate at Duel Academy. He often doubts himself, living in the shadow of his older brother Zane, but has shown himself to be a talented duelist, managing to rise in the ranks from Slifer Red to Ra Yellow to Obelisk Blue. He battles using a Vehicroid deck, which in season four becomes a Cyberoid deck that he creates by implementing Zane's Cyber Dark Dragon deck. ; : :A portly student who is described as large and intimidating, like a bear, but is lazy and \\"has the energy of a sloth\\".

He thus becomes one of Jaden's rivals throughout the series, though he eventually gains a mutual respect for Jaden later on. It is revealed early in the first season of the series that his elitism stems from his older brothers who urge him to become a great duelist in order to have their family reign over the dueling world, as his brothers rule over the political and financial worlds.

Jaden had sent Yubel into a capsule which was fired into space in hopes of her coming in contact with the Darkness of Justice in order to cure her of her protectiveness. However, the capsule that Yubel was in became affected by the Light of Destruction, driving her insane and causing her to begin to believe that love and suffering are the same thing. When she returned to Earth, Yubel was heavily damaged to the point where her hand was the only thing left of her.

However, Yubel used Viper to her own ends and, after getting what she wanted, killed Viper. Yubel would possess Marcel's body and afterwards Jesse Anderson's body all to show Jaden how much she loves him through the pain her actions bring to him.

One day, Viper gave Pierce a deck of Duel Monster cards as a present but they were blown away by the wind. When Pierce went after them, he was hit by an on-coming truck and was killed. In another mission, Viper encountered Yubel, who sensed the darkness in his heart and offered to resurrect Pierce if Viper were to gather enough energy to revive it, to which Viper agreed to do. Viper entered Duel Academy a couple of years later and gave Bio-Bands to the students of the academy in hopes that the energy they produced from their duels would be enough to revive Yubel. Viper would eventually duel Jaden Yuki and lose to him, but the energy from that duel did revive Yubel.

A swim brief or racing brief is any briefs-style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming, diving and water polo. The popularity of the Australian Speedo brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in many countries around the world (e.g. the United States, New Zealand, UK, Europe and mostly the Philippines) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuit, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, swimming trunks, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as \\"budgie smugglers\\". Like underwear briefs, swim briefs feature a V-shape front and a solid back providing form-fitting coverage. They typically are worn below the lower waist. They are generally secured by thin banding at the upper thighs and either a drawstring around the waist or an elastic waistband. Swim briefs are most often made of a nylon and spandex (Lycra) composite, while some longer- lasting suits are made from polyester and still others from other materials. Most swim briefs have a beige or white front lining made of a similar fabric. ==Use and popularity== Swim briefs are worn by professional and recreational athletes in many water sports. They are the standard for competitive diving and water polo. They are preferred in competitive swimming for the reduction of the water's drag on the swimmer, although jammers and bodyskins are sometimes worn instead of the swim brief. Participants in sports that require a wetsuit such as waterskiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding often wear swim briefs as an undergarment to the wetsuit. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In Continental Europe, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the United States and the United Kingdom, the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are still seen to some extent. In some swimming pools in France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene. Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \\"speedos\\" or \\"budgie smugglers\\".* Swim briefs are sometimes worn under board shorts for modesty purposes, and they are often used as an athletic supporter under shorts during sporting activities. ==Styles== Male model wearing swim briefs, 2004. Briefs worn for competitive and recreational swimming are manufactured in standard sizes and in waist measurements. They are available in a wide variety of solid colors and patterned designs. Racing suits Comparison of jammer and swim brief types of swim suits. The most common racing suit styles are 1.5 inch to 3 inch paneled briefs (as measured by the height and length of the suit's side panel). The racing suit's main function is to reduce the drag of an athlete in water, thus improving his time. For this reason racing suits are made of materials that hug the body, minimize friction and minimize water retention. Spandex (Lycra) suits generally produce less drag, but are also more vulnerable to prolonged exposure to chlorine than nylon. Therefore, nylon suits are preferred for training and practice, where the increased durability is required for the long periods of usage and the extra resistance brings a training benefit. Lycra suits (and composite hi-tech swimwear fabrics) are preferred for actual racing. In water polo and sometimes in diving, suits may have panels greater than 3 inches. Water polo players generally wear racing suits. This is to minimize the fabric available to grabbing and pulling by opponents - actions that are illegal yet often happen underwater - while not compromising the strength of the fabric. High-level players wear specialized suits, usually of a very tight fit and made of thicker, tougher and more slippery fabric, intended to thwart pulling and grabbing during rough play; they often wear two suits on top of each other. Triathlon swimming briefs A special variety of briefs and trunks made for the triathlon features the racing suit's design for the swimming portion of the race but also incorporates light padding in the crotch of the garment for the bicycle portion of the race. This is a lighter version of the chamois leather in cycling shorts, to allow running in to be performed more efficiently and the shorts to dry faster after the swim. ==Manufacturers== In addition to the style's namesake company Speedo, competitive briefs-style swimwear are produced by companies including Zoggs, Tyr, Dolfin, Arena, Kiefer, Adidas, Nike, Inc. and aussieBum. Many of these companies have expanded their merchandise to reflect recent trends in water sports. These include the growing popularity of the jammer style and the development of full body suits for competitive swimming. On the fashion end, several designer companies including Nautica, Olaf Benz, Calvin Klein and aussieBum have begun lines of brief style suits in the United States. Most designer brands of male swimwear in Europe, Asia and Australia produce lines of much briefer style suits, including the increasingly popular Brazilian square cut trunks (known as sunga in Portuguese). ==References== Category:Australian inventions Category:Swimsuits Category:Australian clothing Category:Swimming equipment Category:Water polo equipment ","title":"Swim briefs"},{"id":"19339254","text":"The General Campaign Star () is a campaign medal created in 2004 by the Canadian monarch-in-Council to recognize members of the Canadian Armed Forces who had directly participated in any military campaign under Canadian or allied command. It is, within the Canadian system of honours, the sixth highest of the war and operational service medals. ==Design== The General Campaign Star is in the form of a four-point compass rose with, on the obverse, a wreath of maple leaves surrounding a superimposed composition of two crossed swords (representing the Canadian Army), an anchor (symbolizing the Royal Canadian Navy), and a soaring eagle (representing the Royal Canadian Air Force), all surmounted by a St. Edward's Crown, evoking the sovereign's roles as both fount of honour and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces. On the reverse is a space for engraving the recipient's name and rank between the reigning monarch's royal cypher topped by another crown above and a sprig of three maple leaves below. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in Canada's official colours of red and white flanking a central band in green, representing service. The accompanying medal bars are rectangular with raised edges and bear the name of the campaign for which they presented; the first is worn centred on the ribbon, while additional bars are evenly spaced and arranged in the chronological order earned, with the eldest at the bottom, closest to the medal. For wear on undress, a silver, gold or red maple leaf is pinned to the ribbon bar, denoting, respectively, the award of a second, third or fourth or subsequent bar. ==Eligibility== On 7 July 2004, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Paul Martin, created the General Campaign Star to recognize, without having to produce a new medal for each mission, members of the Canadian Armed Forces or allied forces who had participated in Canadian military campaigns. To qualify for the medal, individuals had to have served in a theatre of war in the presence of an armed enemy. Bars As with the General Service Medal, the General Campaign Star (GCS) was initially only awarded with one ribbon. Bars were to be attached to denote the area or mission which qualified for recognition; the first two bars were titled \\"ALLIED FORCE\\" and \\"ISAF+FIAS\\". In 2009, the system of bars was revised such that ribbons denoted specific theatres or services and bars recognized multiple rotations. As a result, recipients of the original GCS with the Allied Force bar remounted their medals without the bar and used the new Allied Force ribbon. Recipients of the medal with the ISAF+FIAS bar needed only to have the medal remounted without the bar on the same ribbon. The Allied Force bar was presented to fighter pilots and AWACS crew members who flew a minimum of five sorties over Kosovo and other territories, including Albania and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, as well as the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, during Operation Allied Force, between 24 March and 10 June 1999. For some recipients, it might have been necessary for them to return their NATO Medal before accepting the Allied Force bar. Those in the Canadian Armed Forces who served for at least 30 days after 24 April 2003 in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) effort in Afghanistan were eligible to receive the ISAF bar. Those soldiers not under NATO control (such as those operating as part of the US controlled Operation Enduring Freedom) were awarded the South-West Asia Service Medal. ==See also== * Canadian order of precedence (decorations and medals) * Gulf War military awards ==References== Category:Canadian campaign medals ","title":"General Campaign Star"},{"id":"19339293","text":"A≈üaƒüƒ± L…ôg…ôr may refer to: * A≈üaƒüƒ± L…ôg…ôr, Khachmaz, Azerbaijan * A≈üaƒüƒ± L…ôg…ôr, Qusar, Azerbaijan * L…ôg…ôrqƒ±≈ülaq, Azerbaijan ","title":"A≈üaƒüƒ± L…ôg…ôr"},{"id":"19339323","text":"Midland-Odessa Sockers FC is an American soccer team based in Midland, Texas, United States.

It was also the first reported case of in Asia. As of 25 November 2009, there have been 32,301 confirmed cases of swine flu in the city. ==Initial response== Following news of the flu outbreak in Mexico and the United States, on 26 April, Secretary for Food and Health York Chow announced that Hong Kong had raised its influenza pandemic alertness level to \\"serious\\", out of three possible alertness levels: alert, serious, and emergency. Hong Kong also became one of the first jurisdictions to declare swine flu as a notifiable disease, and much of the procedures against the spread of the swine flu were learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak, of which Hong Kong was the center. Chow advised Hong Kong residents to avoid travelling to cities facing an outbreak of the flu, and stated that swine flu has been added to the list of notifiable disease, which required cases of the flu to be reported to the government. Residents were also advised to take precautionary measures against infection if travel to affected areas was necessary. Surveillance measures at boundary control points were boosted to detect travellers with fever and respiratory symptoms, and travellers who were suspected of being infected would be quarantined and monitored. ==First case== On 1 May, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang told reporters that tests performed by the Department of Health and the University of Hong Kong confirmed that a 25-year-old Mexican citizen who had traveled to the city via Shanghai on a China Eastern Airlines flight was infected with swine flu. In light of this, Tsang raised Hong Kong's influenza pandemic alertness level to \\"emergency\\" from \\"serious\\". This first confirmed case of swine flu in Hong Kong was also the first confirmed case in Asia. The man had developed a fever after arriving in Hong Kong, and was then isolated in Princess Margaret Hospital, the hospital designated to handle swine flu cases. The hotel where the traveller had stayed, the Metropark Hotel in Wanchai, was quarantined and about 200 guests and 100 staff were instructed to remain in the hotel for seven days regardless of whether or not they had come into contact with the traveller. Authorities also made an effort to track down anybody who had made contact with the traveller, with Chow appealing to those who were on the same flight as the traveller to contact health officials. The guests and staff were released on 8 May, when the quarantine expired. Tsang was at the hotel for the release, speaking to reporters and with those who had been quarantined. To compensate for the quarantine, the government offered guests two free nights of accommodation at other hotels in Hong Kong. The Mexican traveller was also discharged after treatment with the antiviral drug Tamiflu and the Centre for Health Protection confirmed that he was no longer carrying the virus. ==School closure== Following the finding that 12 students at St. Paul's Convent School contracted the swine flu virus, Chief Executive Donald Tsang ordered the closure of all primary schools, kindergartens, and special schools for two weeks starting from 12 June. The 12 cases of infection were confirmed to be the first known cluster of local transmission of the virus. According to the Education Bureau, the school closure affected about 500,000 students from 964 kindergartens, 601 primary schools and 61 special schools. ==See also== * 7 Days in Life * 2009 flu pandemic * 2009 flu pandemic in Asia * 2009 flu pandemic by country * 2009 flu pandemic timeline * 2009 flu pandemic tables * Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ==References== Hong Kong Flu Pandemic in Hong Kong, 2009 Flu ","title":"2009 swine flu pandemic in Hong Kong"},{"id":"19339356","text":"Yerg√ºc (also, Yergyuch, Yerkyuch, Yergyudzh, Ot-Yerguch, Borispol, and Barispol) is a village and municipality in the Khachmaz Rayon of Azerbaijan.

UP SOLAIR traces its origins from Labor Education Center (LEC) which was established in 1954 to promote social justice and labor empowerment through education, research and labor empowerment. It started as a project of the UP School of Business Administration through its Dean Jose Valmonte in 1953 in response to the new era of collective bargaining and economic unionism with the passage of the Industrial Peace Act (RA No. 875- Magna Carta of Labor) in 1953 (Sibal, 2008). A highly capable training and professional staff of labor lawyers, researchers and trainers conducted studies, training and capacity-building programs to assist labor organizations, particularly the trade unions and cooperatives.http://www.solair.upd.edu.ph/public_html/about07.html. Access Date: September 16, 2008 The Center expanded its services in Asia. According to former Dean Ofreneo, this was an offshoot of the Cold War during the 1950s (Ofreneo, 2008 as cited by Sibal, 2008). The Center was subsequently renamed the Asian Labor Education Center (ALEC) in 1958 and became the leading regional training institution for Asian trade union leaders. ==From ALEC to SOLAIR== Graduate studies were subsequently offered on April 18, 1975 in addition to the Center's extension and research activities. By that time, the institution's name was changed from ALEC to Institute of Industrial Relations (IIR). On March 24, 1988, it was renamed School of Labor and Industrial Relations (SOLAIR) \\"to adequately reflect the functions and the areas of concern of the unit, and in keeping with nomenclature of counterpart industrial relations schools in the international academic community.\\" It is the pioneering degree-granting unit in Labor and Industrial Relations within a major University in the Philippines and Asia (Kaufman, 2004 as cited by Sibal, 2008). The School's research and extension programs have expanded into 3 centers on December 20, 1996: Center for Labor and Grassroots Initiatives (CLGI); Center for the Administration of Labor Justice (CaLJ); and Center for Industry Productivity and Competitiveness (CIPC) (Sibal, 2008). ==UP SOLAIR today== The school currently offers graduate degree programs in Diploma in Industrial Relations and Master of Industrial Relations.

There was also a 1/4 mile dirt racing surface that shared the front stretch with the 1/2 mile track. It was used until the track was closed to auto racing in 1973. Attendance varied from 30,000 people for larger events to 10,000 people for ones of less significance. The track is located at the Canfield Fairgrounds in Canfield, Ohio, and is still in use today, primarily during the Canfield Fair. ==History== The original promoter of auto racing in Canfield was Charlie Findlay and then his nephew George C. Findlay in the early 1960s. It was Charlie that had close ties with Johnny Marcum, (MARC) Midwest Association of Racing Cars and Canfield Speedway was the priority track. In 1964 ARCA took over MARC as the desire for dirt tracks died out. ==Races== It was on the NASCAR Grand National Schedule for three years from 1950-1952 hosting one event annually over that time period. The NASCAR Grand National and Short Track series competed there as well as ARCA and USAC. The Grand National events were 200 laps and long. The Short Track Race was 100 laps and the track was 1/4-mile long making the race . The ARCA races were either 100 laps on the 1/4-mile or 200, 250, or 300 laps on the 1/2-mile as the track had two different configurations. Some of the events used the inverted start with the pole qualifier starting last. Both USAC races were 100 laps on the quarter mile configuration. ==Records== The quickest laps recorded in sanctioned events were just under the 24 second mark with cars averaging around the speedway on the half mile configuration. On the quarter mile quick time was under 16 seconds and cars averaged . The NASCAR pole record is and the race record is 48.057 mph 2:04:51. The record for cautions is 4 and smallest margin of victory and the largest 3 laps. The largest purse was $4350 and the most lead changes was 2. == Table of NASCAR Sanctioned Events == {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Date ! Event Name ! Series ! Race Winner !

He was the youngest diver to win the championship in what is now the NASCAR Cup Series. He was aided to the championship when Lee Petty was stripped of some points for racing in non- NASCAR sanctioned events. His only lead lap finish in his career was at Canfield Speedway (when he won). His only career pole came at Canfield Speedway the following year in 1951. He was the 1st of 6 drivers to win a championship without winning a pole in that season. He is 1 of 4 drivers to win a championship with only 1 win that season (nobody has won with 0 wins). In the three grand national races only 4 cars combined finished on the lead lap. ==References Sources == *http://www.ultimateracinghistory.com/racelist3.php?trackid=104 *http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks?id=113 *http://www.racing- reference.info/trackdet?trk=113&series;=W&show;=1 *http://jacobsusa.com/cjsspeed/nascar/tracks/canfield_speedway.shtml *http://www.nascar.com/ *https://archive.is/20070810193516/http://community.nascar.com/blogs/14457 *http://www.legendsofnascar.com/Bill_Rexford.htm *http://www.legendsofnascar.com/Jimmy_Florian.htm *http://www.race- database.com/track/track.php?track_id=Canfield *https://web.archive.org/web/20081118201153/http://www.jayski.com/pages/tracks/bgntracks.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20120831041056/http://www.jayski.com/stats/winbynum.htm *The Stock Car Racing Encyclodepia, *Canfield Speedway: A Photo Journey 1946-1973 Category:Buildings and structures in Mahoning County, Ohio Category:Motorsport venues in Ohio Category:NASCAR tracks Category:Tourist attractions in Mahoning County, Ohio ","title":"Canfield Speedway"},{"id":"19339423","text":"The Harrisburg Stampede were a professional indoor football team based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Stampede participated in several different leagues over their history: the American Indoor Football Association in 2009 and 2010, the Southern Indoor Football League in 2011, American Indoor Football in 2012 and 2013, and the Professional Indoor Football League in what became their final season of play in 2014. The team suspended operations on December 30, 2014. The Stampede played their home games at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center for their first five seasons. In 2014, they played in the Giant Center in nearby Hershey. The \\"Stampede\\" name alluded to the team's original home venue, which hosts the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show, and the team's colors were blue, black and white. ==History== 2009 The team was co-founded by John Morris and Fred Clark. In September 2008, the team announced that they would use the nickname \\"Stampede\\" after narrowing a list of entries down to 3. In the Stampede's inaugural game, they beat an opposing team of American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) All-Stars, 46‚Äì26, in the 2009 AIFA Kickoff Classic. In their first regular season game, the Stampede were defeated by the reigning AIFA champion, Florence Phantoms by a score of 19 - 13. In their second ever regular season game, the Stampede defeated the Baltimore Mariners 37-34. After a 2-4 start, Morris fired head coach Kelly Logan and replaced him with defensive coordinator, Mike McDonald. Marques Colston, a New Orleans Saints wide receiver, held a share during the team's first season. Colston left the group after the inaugural season, citing philosophical differences. 2009 season schedule {  - !Date !Opponent !Home/Away !Result - March 14 Florence Phantoms Away Lost 13‚Äì19 - March 28 Baltimore Mariners Home Won 37‚Äì34 - April 4 South Carolina Force Home Lost 37‚Äì40 - April 11 Columbus Lions Home Lost 33‚Äì35 - April 18 Erie RiverRats Away Won 34‚Äì31 - April 25 D.C.

Robinson helped the Stampede turn their record around, leading them to an 11-3 regular season record, clinching a playoff spot. The #2 seeded Stampede defeated the #3 Erie Storm by a score of 52-48 in the first Stampede playoff game ever. The following week, the Stampede were defeated by the undefeated Mariners by a score of 65-13 in the Eastern Conference Championship Game. 2011 The Stampede began the 2011 season by naming Bernie Nowotarski the team's head coach and general manager. 2011 also brought a new league for the Stampede, as they moved into the Southern Indoor Football League (SIFL) after the merger of the AIFA's Eastern Conference with the SIFL After an 0‚Äì6 start to the 2011 season, Nowotarski was removed as General Manager and Head Coach of the Stampede. He was replaced by Josh Resignalo. The following season, the SIFL disbanded, leading the Stampede to re-join their former league, which is now going by American Indoor Football (AIF). 2012 In 2012, the team joined American Indoor Football (AIF), the league was run by previous AIFA owner/CEO John Morris. In January 2012, Morris sold the team to local businessman Justin Coble, who made moves to broaden the fan base and re-energize the city of Harrisburg about the Stampede team; Colston returned to the team's ownership group just prior to the start of the 2012 season. 2013 As of August 2012 Marques Colston's Dynasty Group acquired full control of the team and had continued to grow the footprint of the Stampede with its primary mission of servicing the community in the Greater Harrisburg area. The Stampede advanced to the AIF Championship Game for the second straight year in 2013, this time defeating the Cape Fear Heroes 57-42 earning their first ever title. 2014 In September 2013, the Stampede announced that they would be joining the Professional Indoor Football League for the 2014 season. After the 2014 season, on December 30, 2014, Colston shuttered the team due to financial problems and purchased a stake in the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League. ==Final roster== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"text- align:center; background-color:black; color:white; border:2px solid #005AA9;\\" Harrisburg Stampede roster -  style=\\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Quarterbacks Running backs Wide receivers  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Offensive linemen Defensive linemen  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Linebackers Defensive backs Kickers  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font- size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Injured reserve *Currently vacant Exempt list *Currently vacant Failure to report - exempt *Currently vacant Suspension *Currently vacant Left squad *Currently vacant - } ==All-league players== The following Stampede players were named to All-League Teams: * QB E.

Jimmy Florian won the pole for the event and Bill Rexford won and went on to take the Championship. It is notable as Rexford's only victory that season, making him one of a few drivers to win the championship with only 1 victory. == Sources == *https://web.archive.org/web/20080831224648/http://www.ci.canfield.oh.us/HistoryofCanfield.html http://www.canfieldfair.com/ Category:Agricultural shows in the United States Category:Fairgrounds in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Mahoning County, Ohio Category:Motorsport venues in Ohio Category:Tourist attractions in Mahoning County, Ohio Category:Festivals in Ohio ","title":"Canfield Fairgrounds"},{"id":"19339535","text":"The United Copper Company was a short-lived United States copper mining business in the early 20th century that played a pivotal role in the Panic of 1907. United Copper was incorporated in 1902 by F. Augustus Heinze, a copper magnate who had tussled for years with Amalgamated Copper for lucrative copper mines in Butte, Montana. The firm was incorporated in New Jersey with an authorized capital of US$80,000,000. United Copper combined Heinze interests in The Montana Ore Purchasing Company, The Nipper Consolidated Copper Company, The Minnie Healy Mining Company, The Corra Rock-Island Mining Company, and The Belmont Mining Company. Retrieved on September 16, 2008. Upon consolidation, United Copper was capable of producing about 42 million pounds (19 thousand metric tons) of copper a year, as compared to 143 million pounds (65 thousand metric tons) per year for Amalgamated Copper. United Copper was literally traded \\"on the curb\\" outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). \\"On the curb\\" trading was later formalized as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). In 1907, after its legal battles with Amalgamated had finally been settled, Retrieved on September 16, 2008. United Copper again found itself the center of a scandal: in October, F. Augustus Heinze's brother, Otto Heinze, devised a scheme to corner the market in United Copper stock. The Heinzes owned a large share of the company and Otto believed that many of these shares had been loaned out to investors hoping to short sell the stock. Short sellers borrow, or make arrangements to borrow, the stock of a company, which they then sell at current prices. If prices later drop, they repurchase shares of the company, now at a cheaper price, to replace the borrowed stock. The difference is the profit of the short seller. Heinze's plan was to move aggressively to purchase the stock of United Copper. The price would soar high. Then, with prices high, and Heinze controlling most of the stock, he would force the short-sellers to repay the borrowed stock, a move called a \\"short squeeze.\\" The short-sellers would have no option but to settle with Heinze for high prices. But Otto Heinze overestimated how much of the company the family controlled (cf: family business). When he forced the borrowers to buy back stock they were able to get it from other sources. When the market realized his corner had failed, the stock price of United Copper collapsed. So shocking was the collapse, that depositors rushed to pull the money out of the banks of F. Augustus Heinze. From there panic spread, as people pulled money out of banks associated with Heinze, and then from trust companies associated with those banks (see Panic of 1907). In 1908, F. Augustus Heinze was indicted for his role in the corner. Retrieved on September 16, 2008. The share price of United Copper, meanwhile, never recovered. In 1913 the company was placed into receivership, so its assets could be unwound. Retrieved on September 16, 2008.

Vehicles used in military operations can be hard to extricate from sand, snow, or mud. ==Approaches== Recovery can be performed using manual winches or motor-assisted methods of recovery, using ground or vehicle-mounted recovery equipment (mostly winches and cranes), with the recovery of heavier vehicles such as tanks conducted by armoured wheel and track recovery vehicles (ARVs). During peacetime and in non-combat settings, various recovery vehicles can be used. In combat, under enemy fire, armies typically used armoured recovery vehicles, as the armour protects the crew from small arms fire and gives some protection from artillery and heavier fire. Vehicle recovery can be performed by the vehicle itself, particularly if it has a powered winch, or by another like vehicle of similar weight and engine power. Many field expedients and improvised approaches for both recovery and repairs have been used by different armed forces since the wide introduction of vehicles into armed force. During the First World War, recovery vehicles tended to be re-purposed tanks. In WW II, while tanks and armoured personnel carriers were still converted into recovery vehicles, specialized, factory-built armoured recovery vehicles were introduced. This includes recovery with the use of the fifth wheel towing device or with Allied Kinetic Energy Recovery Rope (AKERR). AKERR is braided nylon rope which is designed to stretch, which makes AKERR tow ropes better able to pull stuck vehicles out of mud. Special hand and arm signals are used during the vehicle recovery to guide the participants where field of view or line-of-sight are restricted and to make communications feasible in noisy battlefield conditions.

Most of the characters and their birthdays are named after Japanese Prime Ministers.Published in April 2009 edition of PUSH!! by Akio Onuma. ==Characters== Primary characters ; : (credited as Tatsuya Hirai in game) :Makoto Ito is the protagonist of the School Days visual novel and its adaptations. He's the unlikely antagonist in the Cross Days manga. A generally mild-mannered and composed student in year one (10th grade), class three, his life becomes complicated when Sekai Saionji sets him up with Kotonoha Katsura, a girl he has a crush on. :Soon afterwards, Sekai decides to kiss him at a train station where he is waiting on Kotonoha for their first date. From this point onwards, Makoto's personality can change drastically depending on the player's decisions in the visual novel, and he can become anything from a mostly decisive and faithful partner to one of his love interests, to an indecisive and/or selfish and cruel person who unfaithfully initiates multiple relationships and, in the bad endings, pays a heavy price for it. In almost all VN routes and adaptations, he is good friends with Taisuke Sawanaga and Otome Katou (the latter of whom is a childhood friend), and lives with his divorced mother and has a younger sister named Itaru who lives with their father. :His anime incarnation, though initially casual, gentle and understanding, gets addicted to sex over time and instead becomes more apathetic, rash and egotistical towards others, regardless of interpersonal harm or later consequence. It is hinted on multiple occasions that he is aware of the negative consequences of his actions, but makes no real attempt to remedy them. This version of Makoto is seen as callous and selfish, and has been negatively received by multiple critics and fans of the original game. In the final episode, he is killed by a jealous and emotionally unstable Sekai, who stabs him to death for being unfaithful to her with Kotonoha. Kotonoha, having lost her sanity upon seeing Makoto's corpse, kills Sekai in return. Makoto, when portrayed in the manga, is much more reserved and controlled, and even struggles choosing over Sekai and Kotonoha. In the final two chapters of the manga, Makoto is accidentally slashed by a maddened Kotonoha, who immediately breaks down in remorse. After being admitted to a hospital, Makoto announces to Sekai that he shall live with Kotonoha to help ease her spirits, only to discover later on that Sekai fatally stabbed Kotonoha so as to prevent her from harming Makoto further, much to his horror. His birthday and his surname are derived from It≈ç Hirobumi. Makoto's given name means \\"fidelity\\" and or \\"truth\\" which can be ironic. He is considered a generic protagonist since he is a gentle ordinary high school student. Although not directly stated, it is implied that his father is Tomaru Sawagoe (a character who appeared in other 0verlfow games), a fact which is proven through external sources. ; : (credited as Soyogi Tono in game) :Polite and reserved, Kotonoha Katsura is a student in year one, class four who is on the student council and serves as one of the most pivotal characters in the story. A sweet girly girl and noticeably well-endowed bookworm, she becomes the initial love interest of Makoto early into their second term, and with some effort from Sekai Saionji, becomes his girlfriend after she reciprocates her affection for him. While Kotonoha for the most part is calm and gentle, she has a very delicate psyche, which under stress can lead to irrational culpability, delusions and even malice. Hence, she is a well known yandere character. She has a younger sister named Kokoro and lives with their wealthy mother Manami and father in the fictional area of Haramihama. She is disliked by Otome Katou and is subject to her bullying on account of her beautiful appearance, among other reasons. :In the anime, she becomes insane from her love for Makoto, her desperation to keep him as her boyfriend, and her knowledge of his unfaithfulness to her. Makoto realizes how much he had hurt Kotonoha, and, overwhelmed by remorse, takes her back as his girlfriend. Tragically, the next day, Kotonoha soon discovers Makoto had been killed; correctly deducing a jealous Sekai had murdered him, she lops off Makoto's head and presents it to Sekai seconds before murdering her in revenge. She is later seen lovingly cuddling Makoto's severed head on a boat facing the sunrise. In the manga, she accidentally slashes Makoto in an attempt to kill a luring Sekai, who, in order to prevent her from harming Makoto further, kills her while Makoto recovers in a hospital. Her birthday and her surname are derived from Katsura Tar≈ç. ; : (credited as Kaname Yuzuki in game) :Sekai Saionji is a student in year one, class three who is the antithesis and foil of Kotonoha. A playful tomboy and outgoing classmate seated directly next to Makoto, she takes a curious interest in him during their first acquaintance, and in every medium of the series, helps to establish his bond with Kotonoha. Though a genuinely upbeat genki girl, Sekai does occasionally show a more serious side, and when sufficiently frustrated can be loud, selfish, overemotional and even manipulative. She lives with her mother Y≈çko in the fictional area of Motehara-Sakashita and works part-time as a waitress at the family restaurant Radish. :In the anime, she attempts to set up Makoto and Kotonoha in a relationship, but ultimately ends up falling in love with Makoto. Makoto, bored with Kotonoha, decides to go after Sekai, who he supposedly impregnates after making love to her. Makoto, stressed and confused as to what to do about Sekai's pregnancy, leaves Sekai for Kotonaha, who he discovers to have been emotionally devastated by his cheating on her. Sekai then stabs Makoto to death for his unfaithfulness to her, only for Kotonoha to kill her in return, after she accuses Sekai of faking her pregnancy. Once Sekai is dead, Kotonoha claims her suspicions were accurate. In the manga, Kotonoha very nearly kills her for luring Makoto away from her, but accidentally slashes Makoto himself, who gets admitted to a hospital. Sekai, having become insane from the shock of nearly being killed, fatally stabs Kotonoha in order to prevent her from harming Makoto further. Her birthday and her surname are derived from Saionji Kinmochi. It's revealed in the Summer Days game that mother of Sekai is the daughter of Makoto's father (that makes her 'half-sister' of Makoto), so Makoto is Sekai's uncle. Secondary characters ; : (credited as Hana Yamamoto in game) :Setsuna Kiyoura is a student in year one, class three, who likes Makoto, is on the student council as a class representative. One of the more inscrutable characters, Setsuna is a keen, focused and habitually tacit girl who tends to have and keep the most level head of her peers when situations go awry. Setsuna is a silent and emotionless kuudere who is very stoic in tone and expression. She is Sekai's best friend, having grown up with her, and to a considerable degree is overly solicitous of her, to the point of hurting others to ensure that Sekai is happy. In Summer Days, where she is the protagonist, Setsuna is shy and timid, in contrast to her more serious portrayal in School Days. Her mother, Mai, only makes an appearance in Summer Days. With the exception of Kokoro Katsura, Setsuna is the shortest character of the main cast, and is often mistaken for a junior high school student, a trait she is well aware and conscious of. Her birthday and her surname are derived from Kiyoura Keigo. In the anime, she is forced to leave for France, but, fearing for Sekai, who she knows to be emotionally unstable, places her in the hands of Makoto, who she orders to stay faithful to Sekai. It is soon revealed that Setsuna actually had a crush on Makoto. Her transferring to France, coupled with Makoto's subsequent unfaithfulness to Sekai, left Sekai in a deep emotional depression. It's revealed in the Summer Days game that mother of Setsuna, like Sekai's mother, is the daughter of Makoto's father (that makes her another 'half-sister' of Makoto), so Makoto is Setsuna's uncle, too. ; : (credited as Hikaru Isshiki in game) :High maintenance and fastidious, Hikari Kuroda is a student in year one, class three, recognizable by her signature squid rings hairstyle. She initially believes that Makoto and Sekai are dating from the very start, and tends to negatively generalize him; later growing closer to him herself. Though she is actually quite friendly and social, Hikari is the most childish of the cast; sporting an unduly knack for whining and prying into the affairs of others. Her family owns a confectionery store and caf√©, famous for its lemon custard pie. Hikari is good friends with Sekai and has an unreciprocated crush on Taisuke Sawanaga. Her birthday and her surname are derived from Kuroda Kiyotaka. In the anime, she grew out of her crush on Taisuke, and began having a sexual relationship with Makoto. ; : (credited as Miko Fujimura in game) :Nanami Kanroji is a student in year one, class three who is a member of the girls' basketball team, attending the school on an athletic scholarship. A mostly interpersonal character, Nanami is a mature and silent tomboy who generally does not involve herself in the affairs of others and as such remains for the most part unanalyzed. She is the only girl of the main cast to have an established boyfriend from the start, a member of the basketball club named Kyoichi, though to her chagrin he is a devout otaku. Nanami is good friends with Sekai, who comes from her junior high school, and Otome Katou. Of the entire cast, Nanami is the tallest character. ; : (credited as Yuki Matsunaga in game) :Direct and headstrong, Otome Katou is a student in year one, class four, who like Nanami, is a member of the girls' basketball team. She is usually very intimidating, authoritative to her peers, tolerates nothing but her way and opinion, and does not generally associate with anyone but her trio of friends Minami Obuchi, Natsumi Koizumi and Kumi Mori; who together frequently harass and coerce Kotonoha. Despite her difficult behavior and tsundere personality however, Otome can be particularly tender and shy, especially around Makoto, who she has known since junior high school and has a crush on. Because she is very much a tomboy Makoto saw her as 'one of the guys' and took her confession as a joke. Apparently Otome has a younger sister named Karen, who appears in Shiny Days. Her birthday and her surname is derived from Kat≈ç Tomosabur≈ç. ; : (credited as Hikage Hinata in game) :Taisuke Sawanaga is a student in year one, class three. A spirited, peculiar, perverted and rather hopeless romantic, Taisuke is Makoto's best friend from junior high school who frequently endeavors to forward his otherwise lonely ambitious love life, oblivious to Hikari's feelings for him. He takes a strong interest in Kotonoha, despite her rejection, and only under certain circumstances in the game actually dates her. Though Taisuke raped Kotonoha or Sekai, the VN suggests he is somehow unaware how wrong rape is. Taisuke is the second tallest character of the cast, and is the only other male character besides Makoto. ; : (credited as Aoi Kamitsuki) :Kokoro Katsura is the sweet-natured younger sister of Kotonoha. Unlike her older sibling, Kokoro is peppy, talkative and full of curiosity, and although she frequently teases Kotonoha, she worries about her greatly. She has a good friend named Uzuki and affectionately looks up to Makoto as her older brother. Kokoro lives with Kotonoha and their mother Manami and father. Her birthday and her surname are derived from Katsura Taro. ; : (games), Megu Ashiro (anime) :Youko Saionji, maiden name In≈ç, is Sekai's mother.

A representative figure of the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony, which started in 1896, in Nagyb√°nya, Austria-Hungary (today Baia Mare, Romania), He moved through different styles, shifted from the naturalism that was the aesthetic of the colony, to historical subjects, to romantic realism and to a Post-Impressionism style. His work is held by the Hungarian National Gallery, the Thorma J√°nos M√∫zeum, regional museums and private collectors. In 1966, the Hungarian National Gallery held a major commemorative exhibition, The Art of Nagyb√°nya, commemorating the innovations of Thorma and fellow artists. In February 2013, it opens a major retrospective of more than 100 pieces of J√°nos Thorma's work, drawing from numerous institutions and private collectors in Europe. ==Early life and education== J√°nos Thorma was born in 1870 in Kiskunhalas, Austria-Hungary to B√©la Thorma, a tax agency cashier, and his wife Gizella Fekete. The family moved to Nagyb√°nya when the youth was 14. He began to study art at Bertalan Sz√©kely's drawing school. At the age of 18, he went to Munich, where he studied from 1888 to 1890 under the Hungarian painter, Simon Holl√≥sy, who held free classes. Following a path similar to other young artists from Austria-Hungary, in 1891 and 1893‚Äì95, Thorma also went to Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian. ==Career== His first significant painting, Szenved≈ëk (The Bereaved), was exhibited at the Budapest Art Gallery, then at the Paris Salon in 1894. In 1896, on the occasion of the millennium of the Magyars' conquest of Pannonia, he presented his painting about The 13 Martyrs of Arad, Aradi v√©rtan√∫k (The Martyrs of Arad), which gained him nationwide renown in Hungary. Many of his early works were large canvases on historical themes. In 1896 he was one of the founders of the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony, whose members included Simon Holl√≥sy, K√°roly Ferenczy, and Istv√°n R√©ti, who achieved international recognition. From 1902‚Äì27, he was a teacher at the Nagyb√°nya Painters' Association, becoming its president in 1917. In 1898 Thorma began to paint Talpra magyar! (Rise up, Hungarian!), on which he worked intermittently almost to his death. \\"Thorma J√°nos\\" , Sz√©kely Museum of Ciuc His first paintings were naturalistic, and an early inspiration was Jules Bastien-Lepage. Thorma used the artist's most popular work, the Portrait of Sarah Bernhardt, in 1892 as a model in his own painting of Ir√©n Biltz. Thorma's painting had the characteristic atmosphere of Art Nouveau. As a young man, Thorma felt that naturalism offered him too little to achieve his goals as a painter, and he was inspired by German romanticism (as shown in his The Bereaved, 1892) and French classicism (The Martyrs of Arad, 1893‚Äì94). In 1897, following a long trip to Western Europe, Thorma painted several Biblical subjects, including B√©kess√©g veletek - \\"Pax vobiscum\\", which show the influence of Rembrandt. After 1900, Thorma's work turned toward realism: Kocsisok k√∂z√∂tt (Among the Coachmen) (1902); Okt√≥ber elsej√©n (On the First of October) (1903); K√°rty√°z√≥k (The Card-Players, 1904). In 1906-07 he showed influence from Spanish sources in his Cig√°nyutca (The Gypsies' Street, 1907). He also was inspired by the French painter, Paul Gauguin, as shown in H√∫sv√©ti keny√©rszentel√©s (The Blessing of the Bread) and Templombamen≈ëk (People Going toward Church), both ca. 1910. After 1920 Thorma developed his own en plein air style, based on his substantial knowledge of painting. He used certain elements of neo-classicism in such works as Tavasz (Spring, 1920) and F√ºrd√©s ut√°n (After Bathing, 1928). In the last decade of his life, he painted impressionistic landscapes and portraits. In 1918 he took his historical works to Hungary, as he expected Romania to be invaded at the end of World War I. He stored them in Debrecen. After the Treaty of Trianon, when the Nagyb√°nya region was incoriporated to the Kingdom of Romania, only Thorma remained in the town; the other Hungarian painters left. The government encouraged him to continue the naturalistic \\"official Nagyb√°nya school,\\" although his own work had developed in quite different ways. In September 1929, Thorma, aged 59 and until then a bachelor, married Margit Kiss, a painting disciple and distant relative. He died in Baia Mare eight years later. Since the late twentieth century, and the opening of the Eastern Bloc, there has been renewed attention given to the innovations of the Nayb√°nya artists. In collaboration with other institutions, the Hungarian National Gallery has organized a major retrospective of Thorma's work, consisting of more than 100 pieces. Its title classifies him as a representative painter of the Barbizon school in Hungary. The exhibit opens in February 2013, through the collaboration of the \\"Art Museum in Nagyb√°nya, the Janus Pannonius Museum in P√©cs, the M√≥ra Ferenc Museum in Szeged, the D√©ri Museum in Debrecen, the Herman Ott√≥ Museum in Miskolc, the Katona J√≥zsef Museum in Kecskem√©t, and the Thorma J√°nos Museum in Kiskunhalas, as well as Hungarian, German and Romanian private collectors.\\" ==Exhibits== *2009, Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914, 2 Oct 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery ==Legacy and honors== * 2013, J√°nos Thorma, the Painter of the Hungarian Barbizon, 8 February - 19 May 2013, Hungarian National GalleryJ√°nos Thorma, the Painter of the Hungarian Barbizon, 8 February - 19 May 2013, Hungarian National Gallery * 1966, The Art of Nagyb√°nya.

In a tactical area of responsibility during combat operations the primary purpose of conducting route reconnaissance is to find and report all enemy forces that can interfere with movement along a route, and to identify the limit of direct-fire range and terrain that dominates the route. Route reconnaissance includes creation of reconnaissance overlays to identify land and water features, bridge reconnaissance and classification, road reconnaissance and classification, special terrain reconnaissance such as that used during cross- country movement, at the landing areas, on the inland waterways, or when using footpaths and trails, engineer reconnaissance, and use of military route signs (standard signs, sign lighting, bridge signs). A significant part of route reconnaissance is the ability to identify choke points that prohibit military traffic by using conversion factors and tables to identify non-standard surfaces or inadequate load bearing in structure. To do so, Military Load Classifications are used for standard vehicles of a given armed force. Route reconnaissance is typically conducted by a foot, horse or vehicle-mounted route reconnaissance patrol, sometimes with aid of aerial reconnaissance aircraft. The patrol would include regular reconnaissance elements and a combat engineering team.

He won a silver medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic games, came third in the 1955 Peace Race and finished the 1958 Tour de France. ==Biography== Brittain was born in the Knotty Ash district of Liverpool. He joined the Woolton Wheelers and by the end of 1950 had ridden 1h 11m 45s in the East Liverpool Wheelers Novices' 25-mile time-trial. He won his first race at the distance in 1h 7m 45s wearing plimsolls and a flapping shirt. Brittain was called up to the army to start his national service in 1952. There he made up an Army team with Brian Robinson and Jim Grieves. He also became known as the nephew of Regimental Sergeant Major Brittain, who was reputed to have the loudest voice on a British army drill ground. ==Cycling competitions== The army entered him for races and his showing led to his first national selection, in a \\"B\\" team for the An T√≥stal stage race in Ireland in 1953. Bad weather meant that 58 riders quit the race and 16 finished. Brittain was among the non-finishers. He was picked to ride for Britain in the 1954 UCI Road World Championships at Solingen, near Cologne, Germany. He rode with Bill Baty, Ray Booty, John Perks, Bernard Pusey and Don Sanderson. Brittain crashed on the seventh lap and finished 12 minutes behind the leaders. Peace race In 1955 Great Britain picked Stan Brittain to ride the Peace Race, the Soviet bloc's amateur version of the Tour de France. He came second on the first day and next day took the lead. He held it until the seventh stage, when he lost it to Gustav Schur of East Germany. Brittain slipped to third on the ninth day. Schur won and Brittain came third. In 1956 Brittain was again selected to represent Great Britain. He came ninth on the first day but then he slipped further behind and dropped out at the start of stage six. In 1957 he won two stages and half the intermediate prizes, or primes, offered to the first rider through cities along the route. In 1958 he finished ninth. 1956 Olympics Brittain represented Great Britain at the 1956 Summer Olympics that were held in Melbourne. He competed in both the Men's Individual Road Race, where he finished in sixth position, and in the Men's Team Road Race, where Great Britain finished second and he won a silver medal. Tour de France Jacques Goddet, organiser of the Tour de France, invited Britain to send riders in 1958. Brittain, Brian Robinson and Ron Coe were to ride with Shay Elliott of Ireland, an Austrian, a Dane and two Portuguese. The British and Elliott rode as a team within a team. Robinson won the stage into Brest and Brittain finished 68th at 3h 3m 5s. He said in an interview in Cycling: :There was a big difference between the Tour of Britain (which had been used as a selection race) and the Peace Race compared with the Tour de France. It wasn't wise to go from one to another in such short stages. Although I finished 66th, I was never in contention. The Tour is a race and a half. It was then and is now. It is the class of riders who make the race and the country you go through: the Alps and the Pyrenees ‚Äì the toughest in the world ‚Äì which makes it a bike race. :I wasn't involved in the racing. That was up front with the big-hitters. Just to get through the Alps and the Pyrenees was something. I had lost my climbing ability, but even in my best climbing years I was never going to climb those mountains, some 12 miles long. I was six-foot something and with a racing weight of 12 stones four [78kg, 172lb], which made it difficult to take over the hills and the mountains. Brittain was an independent, a semi-professional. He rode for Viking Cycles in Britain for the first months of 1959, then left to live off the prizes he could win in Belgium. He didn't ride the Tour de France because of a broken wrist. He rode on the continent again in 1960 and started the Tour de France. :All was going well and I came to the Tour more confident than I had been in 1958. I picked up a stomach bug after seven days. It was on the stage from Limoges to Bordeaux ‚Äì I hadn't eaten for two days ‚Äì and my legs had gone. The slight hills finished me. I would have got through the Tour with style if it hadn't been for that. He stayed in Belgium and rode criteriums, local races with an engagement fee, until the end of summer. He abandoned the Tour again in 1961, when it reached the mountains and rode until the end of 1964 in Britain and then stopped racing when he was 33. :It becomes harder and the enthusiasm wanes. I had been training for so many years and I had had my best years. I could have ridden a few more but I decided that was it. I wasn't going to improve and I was no longer as good as I had been. ==Honours== In 1957 Stan Brittain was awarded the Golden Cycle by Merseyside Cycling Development. In February 1988 he was presented with a silver pin by Anne, Princess Royal commemorating his achievements in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. == Major results == ;1953 : Abandoned ‚Äì An Tostal race, Ireland ‚Äì British Army B Team ;1954 : Crashed ‚Äì World Championships ‚Äì Solingen, Individual road race. ;1955 : 3rd ‚Äì Peace race ;1956 : Abandoned ‚Äì Peace race : 5th - Tour of Sweden : Silver medal ‚Äì 1956 Summer Olympics Men's Team Road Race, : 6th ‚Äì 1956 Summer Olympics Men's Individual Road Race, ;1957 : 2nd ‚Äì Peace race :: Won 2 stages : 1st overall ‚Äì Dagens Nyheters 6-day stage race (Sweden) ;1958 : 9th ‚Äì Peace race : 66th ‚Äì Tour de France ;1960 : Abandoned ‚Äì Tour de France ;1961 : Abandoned ‚Äì Tour de France ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:English male cyclists Category:British cycling road race champions Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Great Britain Category:Cyclists at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Liverpool Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:People from Knotty Ash ","title":"Stan Brittain"},{"id":"19340140","text":"Wonga may refer to: ==Species== * Wonga pigeon, a pigeon that inhabits areas in eastern Australia * P. pandorana (wonga vine), a species of the genus Pandorea ==Places in Australia==  Queensland  * Wonga, Queensland, a town in Queensland * Wonga Beach, Queensland, a locality in Queensland  Victoria  * Wonga, a town in South Gippsland Shire, Victoria *Wonga Park, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria *Arthurs Seat, Victoria, a mountainous and small locality, indigenous name Wonga ==Other uses== * Wonga, a British slang term for money * Simon Wonga (1824‚Äì1874), aboriginal elder * 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'√©tat attempt or Wonga coup * Wonga, a contest on the UK television show The Big Breakfast * Wonga.com, a UK high-interest payday loan company == See also == * Wunga (disambiguation) ","title":"Wonga"},{"id":"19340141","text":"Douglas Cameron Gordon, commonly known as Doug Gordon, (1956 ‚Äì October 16, 1998) was an American whitewater kayaker, who was a member of the U.S. Slalom Team from 1981 to 1987, and a chemist. Gordon died in Eastern Tibet when he and three other paddlers attempted the first descent of the Tsangpo River. == Kayaking == Gordon was a member of the U.S. Slalom Team from 1981 to 1987. He obtained several medals from the National Championships and qualified four times for the Whitewater Slalom World Championships. In 1995 and 1996, Gordon participated in expeditions to British Columbia, with Jamie McEwan and E.J. McCarthy on the Homathko River and with McEwan and Mark Clarke on the Dean River, respectively.Whitewater on JamieMcEwan.com (retrieved on 15 September 2008) When Gordon heard about the death of slalom kayaker Richie Weiss' death in 1997, he wrote according to Jamie McEwan that \\"running hard whitewater is dangerous, and that those doing so must accept that danger as the price of pursuing their sport at a high level.\\"Jamie McEwan (undated). Were We Foolish to Be on the River at That Level? (retrieved on 14 September 2008) copy at: Accident Database: Accident #522 at American Whitewater (retrieved 31 July 2013)  Expedition to the Tsangpo: The first 10 days  Tsangpo River whitewater In 1998, Gordon participated in an expedition to the Tibetan river Tsangpo (named the Brahmaputra River in its lower course), sponsored by National Geographic. The team of middle-aged paddlers also included the brothers Jamie McEwan (Olympic slalom bronze medalist in 1972) and Tom McEwan (former slalom racer, with first descent experience including the Great Falls of the Potomac), and Roger Zbel. Three of them would use expedition kayaks, one a whitewater canoe. Gordon was the most experienced of the team, but all were considered expert river runners. A ground crew of five completed the expedition. Their plan was to accomplish the first descent of a 140-mile (225 km) section of the Tsangpo, passing the deepest river gorge on earth,Angus Phillips (31 October 1998). Tibet Kayak Expedition Turns Fatal. Local Paddlers End Trip After Group Member Dies in Tsangpo River. Washington Post. (retrieved on 14 September 2008) the more than 4877 meter (16,000 ft) deep gorge between 7782-meter Namjagbarwa Feng and 7194-meter Gyala Peri. The paddlers had planned up to six weeks for the descent. When the team arrived, they found that the Tsangpo had a medium-high flow, much higher than when Wicklife W. \\"Wick\\" Walker (the expedition leader) and Tom McEwan had scouted it the previous fall at about ; the volume now supposedly reached , three times what the expedition team had expected.Todd Balf (March 1999). The Last River. Men's Journal (retrieved on 12 July 2013) The reasons were the year's severe monsoon season and the la ni√±a phenomenon.GORP Editors (2001). Introduction to The Last River. The Tragic Race for Shangri-La. Three Rivers Press. (retrieved on 14 September 2008) In fact, the water levels had already dramatically decreased in the days before the team arrived: Jamie McEwan estimated from the look of the banks that a few weeks earlier, the highest waterline had been about 3-6 vertical meters higher; and only ten days earlier, German kayaker Lukas Blucher had estimated a flow of , whereas Jamie McEwan estimated only when they arrived. While the team was there, the water levels continued to drop, by about 5‚Äì10 cm per day, but the current remained very strong. This later led to criticism from some of the paddling community, who \\"considered [the water level] suicidal.\\"Peter Heller (July 2002). Liquid Thunder. Outside Online. (retrieved on 14 September 2008) Apart from the water flow, the difficulty of the river is caused by the relatively steep average river gradient of 1.23%. The team decided to stick nonetheless to their plan of running the parts of the Tsangpo which they could, and carry their boats where they could not, even though they now expected a larger portion of hiking. As planned, the four paddlers would run or hike the gorge by themselves, carrying their own equipment and food for 15 days. The ground team would meet them further downriver. As a result, the boats had to be loaded with provisions for several days, which may have made \\"the kayaks ungainly and hard to maneuver,\\" at least compared to expeditions with a larger support crew to carry equipment and provisions for the paddlers. On October 5, 1998, the paddlers started their run at the town of Pei. They kept scouting far ahead before running sections of the river. Even where they boated, they usually stayed to the sides of the Tsangpo to avoid the powerful main current, which was so strong that they rarely found places where they could safely ferry over to the other side of the river. After two days, Jamie McEwan slid from the rocks on the river side into the water before having completely secured his spraydeck. When his boat flipped over, water entered and made it impossible to upright the boat. Jamie McEwan exited his boat and swam to shore, but his boat and equipment were swept downstream. They were found and taken by Tibetan hunters and pilgrims to Gyala, which the paddlers reached four days into their river run, with McEwan hiking the last two days. After Gyala, the river was expected to be even steeper, based on topological information of the paddlers.  Expedition to the Tsangpo: Death  On October 16, after of the originally intended route, the team advanced and scouted on the river-left ledge. Tom McEwan was to remain at a lower part of the river to film the descent of the other three and be able to throw a safety line (throw rope) in the case of an emergency, a standard safety procedure in whitewater paddling. Gordon was the first to paddle the section. He chose a route over a waterfall of , hugging the river-left, in order to boof (skip over) a rock at its bottom and land in an eddy current (calmer water) beneath. At the foot of the waterfall, however, he was pulled into a hydraulic in the middle of the falls' bottom and flipped over. He did not manage to upright his boat (\\"roll up\\") at once, but was flushed out of the hydraulic, towards the middle of the Tsangpo‚Äîpassing approximately from Tom McEwan, far out of reach of the safety line. At the bottom of the falls was a stretch of approximately of calmer water. If Gordon had managed to right his boat at this point, he could still have paddled to safety. Two further roll attempts failed, however, and he was swept into a succession of rapids which Tom McEwan later described as \\"a certainly fatal series of recirculating hydraulics.\\"Tom McEwan (undated). Trip Report of the Yarlung Tsangpo Expedition. (retrieved on 14 September 2008) His team members later conjectured that Gordon had not managed to roll up because he had been partly pulled out of his boat, as had happened to him once before earlier on the trip.Account by Jamie McEwan (1998), possibly originally an e-mail. Reprinted in an e-mail by Rich Kulawiec on 18 November, 1998 (retrieved on 14 September 2008) Neither Gordon nor his kayak was seen again. The other three paddlers started a search for Gordon. Tom McEwan and Zbel hastened down the river ledge while Jamie McEwan emptied his boat, carried it down the difficult section, and joined the search on the water. The following days, the three continued the search for Gordon's remains downriver. Walker and another ground team member, who had been informed via satellite telephone, went to the river and searched further downriver. On October 20, the three paddlers and the ground team members met below the place where the accident had occurred. Gordon was presumed dead, family and authorities informed, and the search discontinued. The expedition was called off, and after a small ceremony for Gordon, the expedition members left on the most direct route, consisting in seven days of hiking and three days of driving to Lhasa. A memorial service for Gordon was held in Cornwall, Connecticut, on November 21, 1998.  Further Tsangpo kayaking expeditions  Already in 1993, Japanese kayaker Takei Yoshitaka had died on the Tsangpo, within of his put-in near the confluence with the Po Tsangpo River. His and Gordon's death helped to create the ill fame of the Tsangpo as a particularly difficult, if not unrunnable river; some use the catchphrases \\"Everest of whitewater\\" or \\"Everest of Rivers.\\"(2 April 2002) The Outside Tsangpo Expedition triumphs on \\"The Everest of Rivers\\" - Tibet's legendary Tsangpo. Expedition kayaker Scott Lindgren and a team of 87 conquers one of the last great adventure prizes on the planet. Outside Magazine (retrieved on 15 September 2008) The next expedition to the Tsangpo was started in the winter of 2002, well after the monsoon season and before the snow melted. Kayaker Scott Lindgren employed an international crew of 87 people from seven countries to support the descent of several paddlers.  Video and books on the expedition to the Tsangpo  Some of the film material of the expedition was later published as a documentary, aired in the USA on the Discovery Channel. Dedicated to Gordon, the film included footage that Tom McEwan shot right before Gordon's death. This part of the documentary, which has also found its way onto the internet, gives a somewhat misleading account of the circumstances of Gordon's death, as evidenced by online comments on the video.All comments to the video White Waters Pull Kayaker to His Death on youtube (retrieved on 15 September 2008) First, a voice-over claims that the water level of the Tsangpo had not been this high \\"in decades\\", without mentioning that the level had already dramatically dropped before the paddlers even arrived at the river. In addition, video from briefly before Gordon's death shows how he approached the waterfall, and how his boat was sucked into the hydraulic at the bottom of the fall, flipped over, and finally flushed out. As the video ends there, it evokes the false impression that he died in the hydraulic of the waterfall. The voice of one of the other three paddlers is heard, however, commenting on the moment when Gordon was swept into the hydraulics in the middle of the river: \\"I saw him disappear into the first hole, and I never saw him again.\\"White Waters Pull Kayaker to His Death on www.reallybored.net (retrieved on 15 September 2008) Two books were written on the expedition, one of them by expedition leader Walker. * Todd Balf (2001).

The band's fanbase began to grow, and the Format released their second EP, Snails, with Atlantic Records in April 2005.

On February 10, 2013, Fun. won a Grammy for their song \\"We Are Young\\". Upon receiving the Grammy, Ruess commented, \\"I don't know what I was thinking writing the chorus for this song. If this is in HD, everyone can see our faces, and we are not very young. We've been doing this for 12 years, and I just got to say we could not do this without the help of all the fans that we've had keeping us afloat for the last 12 years.\\" Fun also won the Grammy for Best New Artist. Alongside Fun, Ruess had been a supporting vocalist for many different songs across genres. In 2012, he was featured on \\"Only Love\\" from Anthony Green's second solo album, Beautiful Things, and in 2013 was featured on Pink's album, The Truth About Love, in the song \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\". The song began as a simple songwriting session with Pink. She decided the song needed another side to it and subsequently a male part was written. While at first reluctant, with Pink encouraging him, he decided to participate in the duet. The song eventually topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming his first number-one single as a solo artist and his second overall. After the success of \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\", Ruess was featured on Eminem's eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 on the track \\"Headlights\\".

It would be the last new Fun song performed before Ruess' pursuing his career as a solo artist, however the band has made it clear that they are on hiatus, not splitting up. 2014‚Äìpresent: Solo projects On February 5, 2015, Fun posted a letter on their official website as a note to their fans on the status of the band. The band wrote that \\"there was no new Fun album in the works\\", and instead all three members were pursuing their own projects, including Ruess; who is beginning to release an album, as a solo musician. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ruess added, \\"You get a little selfish about the songs that you write, and it's really hard to do that in a group setting, where there are two other people, and you have to think about everybody else's feelings. I'm writing and singing these songs about myself. When you work with producers versus bandmates, that line becomes a lot less blurry.\\" In addition to his solo album, Ruess was invited to perform on Brian Wilson's album No Pier Pressure. Wilson, who co-founded the Beach Boys, likened Ruess' voice to his deceased brother and former bandmate Carl Wilson. Ruess then contributed guest vocals to the frequent collaborator Emile Haynie's 2015 release, We Fall.

He was born to a Mahar Dalit family in Dhamangaon (Taluka: Akole, District: Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India). He was a Buddhist by religion. ==Works== Baluta He gained fame for his autobiographical 1978 novel Baluta (), written as a story told by Dagdu Pawar to the more literate Daya Pawar, both being personas of the author. The novel recounts the \\"experiences of an untouchable struggling for a peaceful existence, mentally tormented but incapable of retaliation in word and deed.\\" There was \\"strong anti-Dalit reaction\\" when it was published in Maharashtra. Baluta created ripples in literary circles and earned him many awards at all levels, including one from the Ford Foundation. It got translated into several languages. The strengths of the book are the simple, straightforward and to- the-point portrayal and a transparent realistic illustration of the ethos around him. The book created a new genre in Marathi literature. Many autobiographical books talking about harsh experiences hard realities were written after Baluta. Pawar's use of language is not merely that of revolt but of a deeply introspecting analytical intellectual. pu la Deshpande reviewed Baluta: \\"On reading this book the cataract of blind traditions stuck to our eyes that makes us unaware of facts will melt away in the tears that fill our eyes on seeing this horrifying reality will emerge new rays of hope. Reader will then seek to be more humane henceforth in life, What else is the intent of all good literature? Creating new kinship among mankind and free the society from artificial and vexing bonds, right? The same can be said for all Pawar‚Äôs literature.\\" Poetry and other work Although he earned fame through his autobiographical prose in Baluta, poetry was his forte. He gave expression to the oppression of the Dalits through his verse. > \\"Shilekhali haat hota, tari nahi phodla hambarda, > Kitr janmachi kaid, kuni nirmila ha kondvada\\" > (The hand was crushed under a stone, yet no outcry was heard > How many generations of imprisonment? Who created this prison?) With effective verses like the above from his first collections of poems Kondvada, he voiced the atrocities and oppression faced by generations of Dalit. Published in 1974, Kondvada earned him a literary award from the State. Among his other famous works are Chavdi and Dalit Jaanivaa, two of his compilation of articles, and Vittal, a collection of short stories. He wrote the screenplay for Jabbar Patel‚Äôs film Dr. Ambedkar. He was appointed with the National Film Development Corporation. Pawar won the prestigious Padmashri award the Government of India. Pawar‚Äôs writing‚Äôs reflects his active participation in the social, cultural and literary movements on the national level, his avid following of foreign literature, analytical and contemplative thinking, unwavering stance, deep understanding and empathy towards social happenings and issues. His work was highly effective. He received some amount of recognition by way of awards. But due to oppressive circumstances, he suffered mentally and physically in his personal life. It is this perennial suffering that comes through sharply in his writings. One of his poems gives a feel for his suffering: > \\"Dukhaana gadgadtaana he zhaad me paahilela > Tashi yaachi mule kholvar boudhivrukshaasaarkhi > Boudhivrukshaala phula tari aali > He Zhaad saaryaa rutut kolpun gelela > Dhamani dhamanit phutu paahnaaryaa yaatanaa > Mahaarogyaachyaa botsanssarkhi zadleli paane > He khod kasla? Phandiphandila jakhadleli kubdi > Maran yet naahi mhanun marankalaa sosnaara > Dukhaana gadgadtaanaa he zhaad me paahila\\" > (I have seen this tree tremble in pain > Albeit the tree has deep roots like the Bodhi tree > The Bodhi tree at least bore flowers > This tree though is withered in all seasons > Pain trying to burst through its very pore > Leaves withered like those of a leper‚Äôs fingers > What is this disease?

(A Qing officer rank which corresponds to a vice governor nowadays.) After he retired and returned to his home town Dongguan he lived in Keyuan. Zhang was good at and fond of Chinese writing, painting, chess, poetry, antiquing, stone collecting, etc. He invited friends, poets, scholars and painters to gather in Keyuan. And that's how Keyuan became one of the origins of Guangdong culture. Compared with the other three gardens, the significance of Ke Yuan is far beyond just being a private own garden. Keyuan could be considered the origin of Lingnan culture, for example, the famous lingnan style painting (a major branch of Chinese painting) was originated in Keyuan. ==Image gallery== Image:Keyuan.jpgDongguan Keyuan Image:Keyuan6.jpgDongguan Keyuan Image:Ky-bridge.jpgDongguan Keyuan Image:Ky1.gifDongguan Keyuan Image:Ky2.jpgDongguan Keyuan Image:Viewfromhome.jpgA view of Keyuan ==References== Category:Gardens in Guangdong Category:Landscape design history of China Category:Dongguan ","title":"Keyuan"},{"id":"19340209","text":"Yongmabong is a mountain in Seoul, South Korea.

Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. Department of Natural Resources. State of Alaska. January 1974. (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) Because there is no way to transport the Prudhoe Bay gas to markets, as gas comes out of the wells, it is separated from the oil stream and reinjected into the ground to maintain the oil reservoir pressures. There are several proposals to transport the Prudhoe Bay gas. See, Alaska Gas Pipeline. Cook Inlet, showing Knik and Turnagain Arms The second source is located on the Kenai Peninsula on the South coast of Alaska. There are probable gas reserves of 1,726.4 Bcf in this area.DOE Opinion and Order No. 2500 (PDF), p. 45. U.S. Department of Energy (June 3, 2008). Retrieved 2008-09-15. Most of this gas is exported to Japan through a liquefied natural gas terminal located on the Cook Inlet. The Cook Inlet basin contains large oil and gas deposits including several offshore fields. As of 2005 there were 16 platforms in Cook Inlet, the oldest of which is the XTO A platform first installed by Shell in 1964, and newest of which is the Kitchen Lights Unit platform installed by Crowley and supported by the German engineering and project management companies Heavylift@Sea,Overdick and Projektbox installed in 2015. Most of the platforms are operated by Union Oil which was acquired by Chevron in 2005. There are also numerous oil and gas pipelines running around and under the Cook Inlet. The main destinations of the gas pipelines are to Kenai where the gas is primarily used to fuel commercial fertilizer production and a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and to Anchorage where the gas is consumed largely for domestic uses. ConocoPhillips and Marathon operate the LNG terminal under a series of two-year-long licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Energy under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. When these companies applied for another two-year extension of the license, various Alaskan entities, including the local fertilizer plant opposed the application on the grounds that there was not sufficient gas to meet local requirements as well as the proposed exports. The Agrium fertilizer plant claimed it closed because it could not obtain a gas supply. On June 3, 2008, the Department of Energy granted the extension having found that there were sufficient supplies for Alaska's needs. On 22 July 2014, the Alaska LNG project submitted an application to export LNG to the US Department of Energy (DOE). ExxonMobil has confirmed that the Alaska LNG project will seek to export up to 20 million tpa of LNG. The project will export LNG for a period of 30 years to countries that have existing free trade agreements (FTA) with the US, as well as to non-FTA countries. The project is anticipated to create up to 15,000 jobs during construction and approximately 1000 jobs for operation of the project. ExxonMobil has confirmed that the Alaska LNG project will seek to export up to 20 million tpa of LNG. The Alaska LNG project participants are the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. (AGDC) and affiliates of TransCanada, BP, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil. The LNG project is now in the pre-front-end engineering and design phase, which is expected to be completed in 2016. ==Gas pipeline== The State of Alaska has adopted legislation which would provide $500 million of start-up funding for a new pipeline to transport Prudhoe Bay gas. The selected proposal from TransCanada Corp. would go through Canada without connecting to the existing natural gas system in Southern Alaska. However, three Boroughs have formed the Alaskan Gasline Port Authority to build a line from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez that would connect to the existing system.

The programme was cancelled without the prototype having been completed or flown. It was to have provided passenger and cargo transport from rough and unprepared fields, with secondary roles as an aerial survey platform and air ambulance. The design itself was that of a conventional, strut-braced, high-wing monoplane, similar in general appearance to the Britten-Norman Islander, but with an upswept rear fuselage to provide for clamshell cargo doors underneath the tail. The main units of the fixed, tricycle undercarriage were carried on short stub-wings on the lower fuselage, which also provided the attachment points for the wing struts. This arrangement allowed the fuselage to maintain a rectangular cross-section along its length without landing gear components or attachment points intruding into the cargo space. The original design was for an eight-seat aircraft, but a follow-on version with 12 seats was anticipated. Had it flown, the XT-400 would have been the first aircraft of Indonesian design to carry more than three people. Construction throughout was of metal. Work on the prototype commenced in 1977, with a first flight anticipated in 1980. This however did not transpire, and the XT-400 project was cancelled in 1981 with the prototype still unfinished. ==Specifications (as designed) References== * * * Category:Abandoned civil aircraft projects XT-400 Category:High-wing aircraft Category:Twin piston-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"LAPAN XT-400"},{"id":"19340343","text":"Nasim Al Safarjalani (1935‚Äì1994) (in Arabic ŸÜÿ≥ŸäŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÅÿ±ÿ¨ŸÑÿßŸÜŸä) comes from a prominent Arab Syrian family (Al Safarjalani) from Damascus, Syria. ==Origins and youth== Historian Salah ad-Din Al Safarjalani records that Nasim Al Safarjalani was born in Damascus in 1935, the son of a reasonably well-off Arab Army Officer. His family and many of his recent ancestors had been ulama and preachers in the district's Umayyad Mosque. Al Safarjalani thus grew up in a conservative family atmosphere, and attended an early education at the Tajhiz al-Ula where Salah ad-Din al-Bitar was his teacher with Michel Aflaq, both founders of the Arab Ba'ath Party in the early 1940s. He was also exposed to the political vicissitudes of the time, as his father Asaf Al Safarjalani (in Arabic ÿ¢ÿµŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÅÿ±ÿ¨ŸÑÿßŸÜŸä) had a leading role in the Great Syrian Revolution of 1925 against the French, who were then the mandatory power in Syria. ==Early political activity== Nasim Al Safarjalani in Latakia, Syria A distinguished attorney at young age, Al Safarjalani was on a path to a prominent public life and a rising figure in the Syrian political arena. Quickly he was recognized and admired among his peers and was named for several government posts, among them, General Secretary of the Presidential Council and Governor of Latakia Province. Nasim Al Safarjalani became the youngest ever Syrian Governor in the modern history of Syria. He held his post as Governor of Latakia at age 28. His performance was spectacular. To this date, the people of Latakia Province regard Al Safarjalani as the most distinguished Governor of Latakia Province since independence. ==Downfall, exile and death== On 23 February1966 a bloody coup d'√©tat led by leftist Ba'athist faction headed by Chief of Staff Salah Jadid, overthrew the Syrian Government. A late warning telegram of the coup d'√©tat was sent from President Gamal Abdel Nasser to Nasim Al Safarjalani (The General Secretary of Presidential Council), on the early morning of the coup d'√©tat. The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid's \\"regionalist\\" (qutri) camp of the Ba'ath Party, which promoted ambitions for a Greater Syria and the more traditionally pan-Arab, in power faction, called the \\"nationalist\\" (qawmi) faction. Jadid's supporters were also seen as more radically left-wing. Al Safarjalani was sentenced to death in absentia by a special military court headed by later Syrian Defence Minister, Mustafa Tlass, and Interim Syrian President and Vice President of Syria Abdul Halim Khaddam, as prosecutor. Al Safarjalani managed to make his escape and flee to Beirut. In 1969 another court condemned Al Safarjalani to death in absentia. He was never pardoned even when President Hafez al-Assad came to power. A return to Damascus was never reconciled and an agreement was never reached with al-Assad. He was also rumored to be in contact with Syrian opposition figures in Baghdad. At the age of 31, Nasim Al Safarjalani was forced into exile. Several of Al Safarjalani's colleagues were assassinated (Salah ad-Din al-Bitar, Muhammad Umran), hence Al Safarjalani fled from one country to another. Members of the party's other fractions fled; Michel Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other members of the party's historic leadership. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, Aflaq's close trusted friends and colleagues, managed to help Aflaq make his escape, and hence Aflaq was able to flee to Beirut. A few months later, Al Safarjalani escaped through Al Zabadani mountain area in Syria to Lebanon. A journey described as a three day on foot struggle. Al Safarjalani was never able to return to his country. In 1994 Al Safarjalani died in exile. As an Arab politician he set an example to the people of Syria and to the Arab world to the nature of political life in Modern Syria and several other Arab states. ==Notes== Akram al-Hawrani, http://www.jablah.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2265 Shibli al-Aysami, http://www.alrasidalarabi.com/10-2006/Madi17.htmShibli Al Aysami, http://www.alrasidalarabi.com/Madi1.htm Dandashli pp. 340‚Äì341 Dandashli pp. 365‚Äì366 Mohammad Farouk Moneer, https://www.sandroses.com/abbs/t68721/ http://alhiwaradimocraty.free.fr/3-06-08-1.htm http://www.ahewar.org/debat/show.art.asp?aid=67611 ==References== * Awraq men yawmiyat al thawra al souriya [Arabic] (1926‚Äì1927), General Mustafa Wasfi Al Samman, Damascus, 2004.

Despite these claims, it also promoted populist referendums, deregulation, compulsory military service, \\"stopping the culture for young unmarried women to have babies\\", and restricting the welfare state. The NZRP believed that list MPs in New Zealand's mixed member proportional electoral system are not properly accountable to voters. As a result, it would run only electorate candidates, and promised to support the party chosen by the majority of the electorate. The party applied to register its logo with the Electoral Commission, but the application was refused as the logo could confuse voters. The party ran only a single candidate, Turner in the 2008 election. Turner ran in the West Coast-Tasman electorate and received 62 votes (0.18%). By 2010, the party's website was defunct. It did not run any candidates in the 2011 election.

At thirteen Zec won a scholarship to the Saint Martin's School of Art and, upon graduating, initially joined Arks Publicity, an agency specialising in advertising for radio companies, before establishing his own commercial art studio at only 19 working for advertising agencies including J. Walter Thompson.Dennis Griffiths (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422‚Äì1992, London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.617 While working there he drew an illustration of the Flying Scotsman travelling at top speed at night. ==Daily Mirror== In the early 1930s the Daily Mirror was relaunched along the lines of an American-style tabloid. Zec's former copyeditor at Arks Publicity, William Connor, who was working for the paper, recommended Zec (who had been doing occasional work for the paper including on \\"Belinda Blue-Eyes\\", a copy of the New York News‚Äô cartoon strip ‚ÄúLittle Orphan Annie‚Äù and scripted by Connor) for the role of political cartoonist.British Cartoon Archive: Philip Zec, University of Kent. Zec joined the staff of the Mirror in 1937. Zec had no previous experience of drawing cartoons but was hired by H. G. Bartholomew and given complete creative freedom without editorial censorship. Working alongside Connor, who went under the pen-name \\"Cassandra\\", Zec was to provide cartoons to accompany \\"Cassandra‚Äôs\\" column. With Connor occasionally providing captions for Zec's drawings, the outbreak of war in 1939 provided the dominant influence in his work during this period.Robert Connor Cassandra: Reflections in a Mirror, Cassell, 1969 Unlike the early war time cartoons of David Low and others, Zec depicted the Nazi regime as snakes and vultures, implying a sinister side in contrast to the \\"buffoons\\" drawn by his peers. Zec also extended his caricatures to the allies of Hitler, drawing Pierre Laval as a toad at a time when the Frenchman was looking to associate more closely with Hitler.Zbynek Zeman, Heckling Hitler, University Press, 1987, p. 9. Commentators have since ascribed this approach to a strong anti-Nazi sentiment borne out of Zec's Jewish ancestry.Hugh Cudlipp, Walking on the Water: Autobiography, Bodley Head, 1976, p. 136. It is said the feeling was mutual and that Adolf Hitler had placed Zec on his \\"black list\\" of individuals to be arrested following an invasion of Britain. ==\\"The price of petrol\\"== A cartoon by Zec published in 1942 caused a political furore that threatened the existence of the Daily Mirror and caused him to be labelled a traitor. Appearing in the 6 March 1942 edition, the cartoon featured a Merchant Navy seaman adrift in rough waters clinging to the remains of a ship, apparently torpedoed by a German submarine. Beneath the picture, the caption read: \\"The price of petrol has been increased by one penny ‚Äì Official.\\" One of a series of pieces attacking profiteers, the original caption penned by Zec was to have been \\"Petrol is Dearer Now.\\" According to Zec, the cartoon was intended to illustrate that wasting fuel had serious consequences in terms of the risks taken (and the lives lost) by seamen bringing it to the country. William Connor (pen name \\"Cassandra\\") suggested the revised caption, believing Zec's effort lacked impact. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Supply Herbert Morrison along with others in the government were outraged. They interpreted the cartoon as a comment that petrol companies were deliberately profiting at the expense of British lives - particularly those in the merchant navy. The cartoon was resurrected some 40 years later by Les Gibbard - with similar political consequences - as Great Britain again found itself at war.Contentious Cartoon by Dr Tim Benson, PoliticalCartoon.co.uk Morrison called Zec's piece a \\"wicked cartoon... worthy of Goebbels at his best\\" and telling the Mirror's editor, Cecil Thomas, that \\"only a very unpatriotic editor could pass it for publication\\". Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labour, argued that Zec's work lowered the morale of the armed forces and the general public.Joel Taylor, \\"Strokes of Genius\\", Camden New Journal, 6 May 2005. Churchill called on MI5 to investigate Zec's background, which revealed nothing more sinister than the fact he had left-wing sympathies and found no evidence of him being involved in subversion. At the same time the Mirror's register of shareholders was investigated to consider whether the paper should be shut down.Chris Horrie, Tabloid Nation: The Birth of the Daily Mirror to the Death of the Tabloid, London: Andr√© Deutsch, 2003. The matter was debated in the House of Commons and, after MPs urged caution, the government settled on a severe reprimand.Colin Seymour-Ure, Prime Ministers and the Media, Blackwell, 2003, p. 262. == \\"Don't lose it again\\" == Three years later, Zec's VE Day contribution was widely acclaimed. Depicting a wounded soldier handing over a laurel representing victory and peace in Europe, the caption read: \\"Here you are. Don't lose it again!\\" The cartoon had sufficient impact for Herbert Morrison to ask Zec to help with Labour publicity for the 1945 General Election with the politician dismissing his comments just three years previously on the premise that: \\"everybody makes mistakes\\", Zec obtained a belated apology and, as a result on the morning of the election \\"Don't lose it again!‚Äô\\" was reprinted taking up the entire front page of the Mirror. The accompanying text suggested that the best way for the country to remain at peace was to vote for the Labour Party. ==Post-war== After the war Zec became a director of the Daily Mirror and eventually joined the board of the Mirror Group. Between 1950 and 1952 he was employed as editor of the Sunday Pictorial while continuing to draw for the Daily Mirror until he left in 1954, succeeded in the role of cartoonist by Victor Weisz, or 'Vicky' as he was better known. In 1958 Zec left the Mirror Group altogether, and moved to the Daily Herald, remaining there until 1961. Zec also worked as a director of the Jewish Chronicle for 25 years and was the editor of New Europe newspaper. ==Death and legacy== Becoming blind in later life, Philip Zec died in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 14 July 1983. In 2005, a biography by his brother, Donald Zec, was published under the title \\"Don't Lose It Again!\\", recalling the caption to Philip Zec's VE Day cartoon. In 2019, on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the Guardian newspaper published cartoonist Steve Bell's modified version of Zec's \\"Don't lose it again\\", in which Zec's wounded soldier is shown wearing a Soviet Army uniform, above the words, \\"Don't forget us again!\\" ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1909 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art Category:British cartoonists Category:British Jews ","title":"Philip Zec"},{"id":"19340511","text":"George Huth Cotterill (4 April 1868 ‚Äì 11 October 1950) was an English amateur footballer who made four appearances for England as a forward in the 1890s, captaining the side on his last two appearances. He usually played as an inside right or centre forward. ==Career== Education Cotterill was born in Brighton, Sussex and was educated at Brighton College where he first showed his all-round athletic ability. He began his football career with the college in 1882 and was appointed team captain two years later, retaining this position for three years before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1887. At Cambridge University, he was awarded his football blue in each of the years from 1888 to 1891 (including being captain in 1890). Corinthians and England He first played for Corinthian aged 18 in 1886, making his debut against Derby County on 6 November 1886, when he scored in a 3‚Äì2 victory. His appearances were infrequent until 1888‚Äì89, when he made six appearances, scoring three times including two against Preston North End on 9 March 1889. He also put two goals past Sheffield United on 6 January 1890. His performances for both Corinthians and Cambridge University ultimately led to a call-up to the England team. He made his international debut against Ireland on 7 March 1891, while still at Cambridge University. For the second year running, England played both Wales and Ireland on the same day, and, for the match against Ireland played at Molineux, Wolverhampton, England selected a predominantly Midlands based team, with five players making their debut. Cotterill played at inside right and was amongst the scorers as England, who were \\"too skilfull (sic) for the Irish\\" won 6‚Äì1. This match was Tinsley Lindley's final appearance for England, and he marked the occasion with two goals. On 19 December 1891, Cotterill played for England in an \\"unofficial\\" match against Canada, when he scored in a 6‚Äì1 victory. Fellow Corinthian, C. B. Fry also played for England in this match. During the 1891‚Äì92 season, Cotterill made six appearances for Corinthian scoring seven goals including a hat trick in a 4‚Äì4 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 20 February 1892. On 5 March 1892, England again played simultaneous matches against Wales and Ireland. This time, Cotterill was selected as part of a predominately amateur team (most of the players were members of the Corinthian club) to play against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, and was one of only three players in the side who had previous international experience. England were \\"a little too skilful for the Welsh\\" and ran out 2‚Äì0 winners with goals from Arthur Henfrey and Rupert Sandilands. In April 1892, Corinthians played a multi-sport tournament against the Barbarians rugby club. Cotterill played at inside right in the soccer match which Corinthian won 6‚Äì0, with Tinsley Lindley scoring a hat-trick. Cotterill also played in the rugby match, which Corinthian won 16‚Äì13, although the match was not a very serious encounter and was described by The Times newspaper as \\"a very amusing game\\". The rugby match was followed by an athletics meeting in which C. B. Fry was prominent, winning both the long jump and high jump, with Cotterill winning the \\"Putting the Weight\\" with a distance of 34 ft 1in. Finally, the two clubs met a few weeks later in a cricket match in which Cotterill played alongside several other prominent Corinthians, including Fry, Lindley and Charles Wreford-Brown, with the Barbarians winning by four wickets. By now Cotterill had left University and his primary registration was now with Old Brightonians, although he continued to turn out on a regular basis for Corinthian. He started the 1892‚Äì93 season with goals in each of the first three matches for Corinthian, including a hat- trick in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Sunderland on 12 November. For the first time, Cotterill was able to join a Corinthian tour of northern England and Scotland, when he played five games in eight days in December and January against professional teams scoring five times. Cotterill was appointed team captain for the 1893 British Home Championship matches against Ireland and Scotland. For the match against Ireland, played at Perry Barr, Birmingham on 25 February 1893, the selectors again called up a predominately amateur, Corinthians dominated eleven with another seven d√©butantes. Amongst the d√©butantes was Walter Gilliat of Old Carthusians who scored a hat-trick in his only appearance in an England shirt. England \\"won the game with ease\\" as further goals from G.O. Smith, William Winckworth and Rupert Sandilands enabled England to run out convincing 6‚Äì1 victors. For the next match, against Wales, the England selectors chose an entirely different, professional eleven players. Cotterill was restored for the final international match of the season at Richmond, London on 1 April 1893 against Scotland who were hoping to avenge their defeat in each of the two previous seasons. England selected a strong eleven, with only Cotterill's fellow Old Brightonian, Leslie Gay making his debut in goal. Cotterill scored England's second goal to bring the scores level after 58 minutes, with England eventually running out 5‚Äì2 victors, thus enabling them to claim the championship for the third consecutive season. In 1893, he again started the season well for Corinthian with a hat-trick in an 11‚Äì0 defeat of The Army (Rupert Sandilands scored six). He repeated this on 13 January 1894 in a 4‚Äì6 defeat against Aston Villa. Villa had taken a three-goal lead before Cotterill's hat-trick brought the score to 3‚Äì4. He finished the 1893‚Äì94 season with 16 goals from 13 appearances. Over the next few seasons, he was only able to make a handful of appearances for Corinthian and he bowed out at the end of the 1897‚Äì98 season, having played 65 matches, scoring 53 goals in his thirteen seasons with the club. In his football career, he also played for Weybridge and Burgess Hill, and represented Surrey and Sussex. Cricket He played seven matches for Cambridge University in 1888‚Äì89, but did not obtain his Blue. He also appeared in ten matches for Sussex between 1886‚Äì90. In his total first-class career, he played 17 matches and scored 305 runs at an average of 10.16. As a right-arm slow bowler, he claimed three wickets at an average of 38.33. His father, George Edward Cotterill, also played cricket for Cambridge University (1858‚Äì1860), Cambridgeshire (1858) and Sussex (1869‚Äì1874), and his uncle, Joseph Cotterill played for Sussex (1870‚Äì1888). Other sports He was an all round athlete, rowed for Weybridge Rowing Club, played rugby for Richmond and Surrey, and at university he was a member of the track, field and rowing teams. Military career On 24 July 1886, aged 18, he was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, the Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment). On the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the 11th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, being temporarily promoted to the rank of Captain on 22 September 1914. He subsequently achieved the rank of Major. He died at Llandaff, Glamorgan, Wales on 1 October 1950, aged 82. == References  External links == * * Profile on Cricinfo * Profile on www.cricketarchive.com * Career as England Captain * Profile on www.englandfc.com * Wisden obituary * Corinthian Casuals F.C. ‚Äì Player profiles Category:1868 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Footballers from Brighton Category:People educated at Brighton College Category:England international footballers Category:English footballers Category:Cambridge University A.F.C. players Category:Corinthian F.C. players Category:Burgess Hill Town F.C. players Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1864 to 1889 Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Lancashire Fusiliers officers Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:English rugby union players Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Old Brightonians A.F.C. players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"George Cotterill"},{"id":"19340539","text":"\\"Movin' On\\" is a song by American singer M√Ωa. It served as the second single from her self-titled debut studio album. The song was written and composed by Harrison, Mark Andrews and Darryl Pearson. The lyrics of the bouncy R&B; track speak of a woman leaving her cheating ex-boyfriend. The song received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised the singles' remix stellar production and Silkk's rap cameo. \\"Movin' On\\" became a top 40 hit on Billboards Hot 100; peaking and spending three non-consecutive weeks at number thirty-four. It fared better on the US Hot R&B; Singles chart peaking at number four. Internationally, the single reached the Top 20 in New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by director G. Thomas Ferguson and University Music CEO Haqq Islam. The video was shot in the non- fictional high school University High. In the video, Harrison displayed her cheerleading skills and towards the end of the video leaves her cheating ex- boyfriend. ==Critical reception== Billboard magazine gave the song a positive review, writing, \\"This is no one-hit wonder.

He was the son of Abu Kalijar. ==Reign==  Struggle for power  Map of Fars and its surrounding regions in the 10th‚Äì11th centuries After the death of Abu Kalijar in 1048, his eldest son Abu Nasr Khusrau Firuz had succeeded him as senior amir in Baghdad and assumed the title \\"al-Malik al-Rahim.\\" Abu Mansur, however, rose up against his brother and control of Fars. Al-Malik al-Rahim along with his brother Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah invaded Fars and occupied Shiraz, also managing capturing Abu Mansur during the invasion. However, turmoil between the Turks and Daylamites in his army forced them to abandon the province and leave it in the hands of Abu Mansur. Abu Mansur then managed to become the ruler of Fars once again, and captured parts of Ahvaz from Al-Malik al-Rahim. Al-Malik al- Rahim, however, managed to recapture Ahvaz and seize another town named Askar Mukram from Abu Mansur. In 1051 or 1052 al-Malik al-Rahim's army again invaded Fars and this time defeated Abu Mansur and his allies. Fars was for the next year or so reunited with Iraq and governed by Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah on al- Malik al-Rahim's behalf. Abu Mansur, however, requested the support of the Seljuk sultan Toghrul Beg, and was able to recapture Shiraz in 1053 or 1054. He then recognized Toghrul Beg as his overlord and placed the sultan's name first in the khutba, in front of al-Malik al-Rahim's. In 1055, a Dailamite military leader named Fuladh, captured Shiraz and repelled Abu Mansur from Fars. Fuladh then made an agreement with Al-Malik al-Rahim where he agreed to acknowledge his authority. However, Al-Malik al-Rahim and Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, did not trust him, and along with Abu Mansur, reconquered Shiraz from Fuladh. Abu Mansur then agreed to acknowledge the authority of Al-Malik al- Rahim. Seljuq suzerainty In December 1055 al-Malik al-Rahim was arrested and deposed by Toghrul Beg's forces in Baghdad, bringing an end to Buyid rule in Iraq. Abu Mansur, who once again acknowledged his authority, however, was able to remain in power in Fars for another seven years as a Seljuk vassal. Constant fighting with his brothers, however, weakened his rule, and in 1062 he was killed while fighting against the Shabankara tribal chief Fadluya. The Seljuks shortly afterward entered Shiraz and took control of Fars. ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1062 deaths Category:Buyid dynasty Category:11th-century rulers in Asia Category:History of Fars Province Category:11th-century Iranian people ","title":"Abu Mansur Fulad Sutun"},{"id":"19340623","text":"Accessible publishing is an approach to publishing and book design whereby books and other texts are made available in alternative formats designed to aid or replace the reading process. Alternative formats that have been developed to aid different people to read include varieties of larger fonts, specialised fonts for certain kinds of reading disabilities, Braille, e-books, and automated Audiobooks and DAISY digital talking books. Accessible publishing has been made possible through developments in technology such as print on demand (POD), e-book readers, the XML structured data format, and the Internet. ==Aim== The aim of accessible publishing is to make reading easier for those who have difficulties doing so. This group includes people who are blind or who have low vision, people with learning disabilities, and people who are learning a second language. Accessible publishing also aims to allow people to read whichever format allows them to read fastest or allows them to absorb the information in a better way. In the twenty-first century, the accessible publishing aim is to make every book available in all formats so that every reader can read with ease and proficiency. Guidelines and techniques for publishing in accessible formats have been made available by several organisations and authors, including: * EDItEUR: \\"Accessible Publishing - Best Practice Guidelines for Publishers\\".EDItEUR: \\"Accessible Publishing - Best Practice Guidelines for Publishers .

The predominant publishing theory, which stressed economy of scale, tended to make only one format of a given book available. In this way they could be mass-produced and made available for the general public. This model did not allow for any other format to be widely available, however. There were a number of developments in technology that increased the accessibility of books. The first of these was the development of the Braille language by Louis Braille in 1821. Then there was the development of audiobooks which originated from the United States Congress in 1931 and became popularised by advances in recording and the use of voice actors. In 1980, Thorndike Press came into existence as a republisher of large print books.Thorndike Press: About Thorndike PressThorndike Press: Public Libraries. Thorndike bought the rights for large print versions of books from publishers and then republished them in a larger and more accessible format for people with reading difficulties. ==Recent developments== New portable readers, such as the VictorReader StreamHumanWare USA: Victor Reader Digital Talking Book Players. and the Plextalk PocketPlextalk: Plextalk Pocket handle talking books in a wide variety of formats including DAISY Digital Talking Book, MP3, text only, and many others.

He was also a state and national representative, playing four Tests for Australia in 1973. ==Playing career== St. George Maddison started his first-grade football career with St. George in 1965 and the following year appeared in his first grand final, the last of the Dragons' record-breaking 11 consecutive premiership wins. He won that first premiership as a but later moved into the forwards and enjoyed success in his career as a wide running second-rower. In the late 1960s after St George had lost the stars of their long reign, Ken Maddison's work ethic (along with the stellar brilliance of Billy Smith and Graeme Langlands) was a factor in keeping the club competitive, regularly finishing in the top five. Maddison played in the 1971 Grand Final loss to South Sydney, again in the centres. Ken's younger brother Keith Maddison also played alongside him at the Dragons in six seasons from 1966 to 1971. Cronulla-Sutherland In 1972 Maddison moved to the young Cronulla-Sutherland club, playing in the . 1973 was Maddison's career high-point when he became the first forward to win the Rothmans Medal for best and fairest player in the League, edging out Ron Coote by just one point. He also scored a personal best eight tries that year before playing in Cronulla's first Grand Final, the 1973 loss to Manly-Warringah 7 - 10. Although Maddison played at a time when the loose forwards of the Souths' pack - Coote, Bob McCarthy, Gary Stevens and Paul Sait - dominated representative selections, he managed his Australian debut at the end of a great club season in 1973 when he was selected for the 1973 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. He was one of the form forwards of the tour scoring two tries in the third and deciding Test against Great Britain. He played in all three Ashes Tests, in one Test against France and in nine minor tour matches scoring six tries in all. The following year he made his sole state appearance for New South Wales Blues. Maddison continued playing for Cronulla-Sutherland until 1975. In 2006, he was named at second-row in a Sharks dream team. ==References *Ken Maddison at nrlstats.com *Kangaroos beat Lions at Wilderspool Category:1946 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:St. George Dragons players Category:Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks players Category:Western Suburbs Rosellas players Category:New South Wales rugby league team players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Living people Category:Rugby league second-rows Category:Date of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ken Maddison"},{"id":"19340730","text":"Ru»ôchi»õa (; ; ; ) is a reddish, pinkish or white marble found in Romania.

He has been a member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia since 2008, representing the seat of Kwinana. He was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party ten days after first being elected to parliament, and continues to hold the position. Before entering politics, Cook worked as a public relations consultant. He had earlier been involved in student politics, serving as the first president of the National Union of Students. ==Early life== Cook was born in Perth, and attended Scotch College.Roger Hugh Cook, Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

Retrieved 10 October 2012. After graduating, Cook worked in the offices of a number of Labor MPs, including Stephen Smith, Jim McGinty, and Chris Evans.About Roger ‚Äì Roger Cook official website. Retrieved 10 October 2012. He served as state president of the Labor Party from 1999 to 2000. Cook later became involved with Aboriginal advocacy groups, serving at various times as a policy coordinator for the Western Australian Aboriginal Native Title Working Group, as CEO of the Yamatji Marlpa Barna Baba Maaja Aboriginal Corporation, and as government relations manager for the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council. From 2004 to 2008, he was state manager of CPR, a public relations firm which is closely associated with the Labor Party. ==Politics== At the 2008 state election, Cook won the seat of Kwinana in a tightly fought contest, winning by 300 votes from independent candidate Carol Adams, the mayor of the City of Kwinana. Adams had unsuccessfully attempted to gain Labor pre- selection, and later accused Alan Carpenter of \\"parachuting\\" Cook into the seat. On 16 September, ten days after the election, Cook was elected to the position of deputy leader of the Labor Party under Eric Ripper. He is a member of the Labor Left faction, backed by the United Voice trade union (previously known as the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union). After Ripper was replaced by Mark McGowan as leader of the opposition in January 2012, Cook maintained his position as deputy leader. He was re-elected at the 2013 state election in a rematch with Adams, winning an increased majority. However, Kwinana was a very safe Labor seat in a \\"traditional\\" two-party matchup with the Liberals; Cook would have won it in both 2008 and 2013 with majorities of well over 10 percent in a traditional contest with a Liberal candidate. Proving this, Cook was easily reelected in 2017 amid the massive Labor wave that swept through Perth, taking over 68 percent of the two-party vote, a \\"traditional\\" two-party swing of seven percent. ==Portfolios== Cook has held the following portfolios since his election in 2008: * 26 September 2008 ‚Äì 27 January 2012: Deputy Leader of the Opposition; Shadow Minister for Health; Shadow Minister for Mental Health; Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs * 27 January 2012 ‚Äì 9 April 2013: Deputy Leader of the Opposition; Shadow Minister for Health * 9 April 2013 ‚Äì 26 June 2015: Deputy Leader of the Opposition; Shadow Minister for Health; Shadow Minister for Science * 26 June 2015 ‚Äì 17 March 2017: Deputy Leader of the Opposition; Shadow Minister for Health * 17 March 2017 ‚Äì present: Minister for Health and Minister for Mental HealthABC WA election: McGowan unveils Labor 'cabinet for the times' with Cook as deputy, Wyatt named treasurer 16 March 2017 ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Category:Murdoch University alumni Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:People educated at Scotch College, Perth Category:Curtin University alumni ","title":"Roger Cook (politician)"},{"id":"19340871","text":"Anchorage Press in Twickenham, west London, was an international distributor of maritime training publications published by The North of England P&I; Association.

In the 1990s developed by DWEER Bermuda and licensed by Calder AG Membrane Desalination for use in the Caribbean. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) needs high pressure and some of the reject stream can be reused by using this device. According to Calder AG, 97% of the energy in the reject stream is recovered. The DWEER system uses a piston doublechamber reciprocating hydraulically driven pump, and a patented valve system in a high pressure batch process with large pressure vessels, similar to a locomotive, to capture and transfer the energy lost in the membrane reject stream. Its advantage is its high efficiency rate, but it suffers from complex and large mechanical components which are susceptible to corrosion from seawater due to its metal composition.
