This plant was cited as Hovea Celsi in Description des plantes rares cultivees a Malmaison et a Navarre by Aim√© Jacques Alexandre Bonpland. ==Description== The erect and slender shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of It is usually single stemmed and the young branches are covered in spreading often rust coloured hairs. The stipules are narrow triangular and around in length. The alternately arranged leaves have an elliptical blade to around in length. The species has purple or blue flowers that appear between August and December in its native range. The pea shaped flowers are arranged in short clusters among the leaf axils. The axillary inflorescences contain one to seven flowers. The seed pods that form later are ovoid to ellipsoid in shape and are in length and wide. The olive brown seeds within have an elliptic shape and in length and wide. ==Taxonomy== The species was first formally in 1808 as Poiretia elliptica by James Edward Smith in 1808 in the work Characters of Platylobium, Bossiaea and of a new Genus named Poiretia as published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. It was later transferred to the genus Hovea by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1825 in the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis.

He then coached Vis Pesaro, where he obtained the first promotion in his coaching career (in 1999‚Äì2000, from Serie C2 to Serie C1 after playoffs), and after another impressive season he was called to coach newly promoted Serie B team Messina. During that season, he was fired, but then recalled, and hardly managed to save his team from relegation. In 2002‚Äì03, Palermo hired him to replace Ezio Glerean just at the first matchday, but he was sacked as well at the twentieth. Arrigoni went on to become manager of Serie C2 club Frosinone in 2003‚Äì04, leading them to win the league. In 2004‚Äì05, Arrigoni was surprisingly called to coach a Serie A team, Cagliari Calcio. Also thanks to outstanding players such as Antonio Langella, Gianfranco Zola, Mauro Esposito and David Suazo, Arrigoni went on leading his team to a very good season that ended in 12th place. Arrigoni, who had left Cagliari at the end of the season in order to join Torino, then cancelled by the federation because of financial troubles, was recalled to Cagliari in 2005‚Äì06, but resigned soon after following heavy protests from its supporters. In 2006‚Äì07, he coached Livorno, with the additional opportunity to make his debut in a European competition, UEFA Cup in the case. On 14 January 2007, Livorno chairman Aldo Spinelli declared his willingness to sack Arrigoni after his side lost 5‚Äì1 away to Atalanta B.C.. However, after the players called for his return, with captain Cristiano Lucarelli declaring \\"The team is united against the club\\", Arrigoni was reinstated two days later. However, his dismissal was only delayed, as he was finally sacked on 21 March and replaced by Fernando Orsi. In June 2007 he was unveiled as Bologna's boss with the goal to lead the rossoblu back to Serie A and in May 2008 achieved automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B. Despite an impressive win at San Siro against AC Milan in the first league week, Arrigoni made a disappointing start in his season back in the top flight, and was ultimately sacked on 3 November 2008 following a crush 5‚Äì1 loss against relegation-battling rivals Cagliari. In February 2010 he was unveiled as new head coach of Serie B strugglers Triestina, replacing Mario Somma. Under his tenure, Triestina did not improve its results and were ultimately relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after losing a two-legged playoff to Padova. On 26 June 2010 Arrigoni was named as the new coach of Sassuolo, replacing outgoing manager Stefano Pioli who was appointed at Serie A club Chievo. He was dismissed later on 3 October after losing four of the initial seven league games despite the club's top flight ambitions, and was replaced by Angelo Gregucci. On 1 November 2011, Arrigoni was appointed as a new head coach of Cesena.

He is one of the original promoters of Project Angel, an international organization to found the Supreme Headquarters Alien Defense Organisation (SHADO), in order to fight incoming flying saucers carrying hostile aliens. He is always portrayed by actor Ed Bishop. ==Fictional biography== This informations are taken from the UFO episodes which establish a timeline of Straker's life, cited in parenthesis. Nothing is known of Ed Straker's youth, but it is known that he became a United States Air Force pilot and a Colonel and became friends with Royal Air Force pilot Alec E. Freeman. He later met General James L. Henderson, who, as the episodes \\"Identified\\" and \\"Confetti Check A-OK!\\" suggest, introduced him, in the early 1970s, in Project Angel (a project to fight incoming hostile UFOs), in which the United States, the Soviet Union, France and an unidentified side of Germany cooperated. As the United States were the major contributor to the project, the leader of the defense organization was to be an American, and Straker suggested (\\"Confetti Check A-OK!\\") he to be his friend General Henderson, but he could not cover this role as he was severely injured in a UFO attack to the Rolls-Royce Phantom V in which he, Straker and \\"the Cabinet Minister\\" were traveling to meet the Prime minister of the United Kingdom (\\"Identified\\"). In the same period, he married (\\"Confetti Check A-OK!\\") a woman named \\"Mary\\". Due to work to put in action Project Angel, Straker stayed much time out of home, and Mary's mother started thinking (\\"Confetti Check A-OK!\\") that he was cheating her daughter, then she hired a detective and, Straker, knowing that he was being followed, started to organize Project Angel meetings at the house of female employee Ayshea Johnson to protect military secrets by making his absence appear as a love story with her. After knowing of this, a pregnant Mary divorced from Straker, but had (\\"Confetti Check A-OK!\\") a premature birth due to shock. Their son was named \\"John\\", and Mary married a man named \\"Rutland\\" (as seen in \\"A Question of Priorities\\"). Approximately ten years later, SHADO (the Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation) became fully operational, with Straker as Commander-in-chief and Col. Freeman as Second-in-command, and its headquarters thirty meters under the Harlington-Straker Studios in Harlington (with many SHADO members also working inside it). It is known that shortly after this, a special radar device designed by Col. Virginia Lake was transported (\\"Identified\\") on a supersonic Seagull X-ray airplane, under Freeman's supervision, but the aircraft was attacked by a UFO. Luckily, the saucer was destroyed by SHADO's Sky One aircraft, piloted by Capt. Peter Carlin. Some time later, SHADO went in contact (\\"Exposed\\") with three incoming UFOs, which flew by the Moon and were detected by SHADO Moonbase, but one of them was not intercepted by its fightercraft. Sky One was launched to destroy it, but, in the same area, Paul J. Foster was testing a high-speed airplane, Ventura Aircraft Corporation's XV-104. The UFO approached it and he and his copilot, Jim, took some photographs and a video, but the aircraft was badly damaged when Sky One fired a missile at the saucer. Jim died and Foster suffered minor injuries, before being fired by Ventura's leader, Mr. Kofax. After some investigation, Foster became aware of SHADO's existence, and became SHADO recruit 804 and a director at Harlington-Straker. Foster soon became close friends with Freeman, but Straker kept a strictly formal relationship with him, and later transferred him to the Moonbase. In that period, John was hit (\\"A Question of Priorities\\") by a Ferrari 275 GTB while walking on a road, and was transported to an hospital, but, due to an allergy to antibiotics, he required a special product from the United States. Straker ordered a SHADAIR airplane to transport it from New York City to Harlington, but acting Commander-in-chief Freeman, unaware of the fact, ordered the plane to stop in Ireland before doing this, trying to intercept an alien defector. The plane, however, arrived too late, and John died, then Mary decided to not meet Straker anymore.

It was described in 1891 and named for discoverer Ponciano Aguilar. ==Description== Aguilarite is bright lead-gray on fresh surfaces but becomes dull iron black when exposed to air. The mineral occurs with massive habit, as elongated pseudododecahedral crystals up to , or as intergrowths with acanthite or naumannite. ==Discovery== In the late 19th century, Ponciano Aguilar, superintendent of the San Carlos mine in Guanajuato, Mexico, found several specimens of a mineral thought to be naumannite. The samples were given to F. A. Genth for identification, who, along with S. L. Penfield, discovered that it was a new mineral. The mineral was described in the American Journal of Science in 1891 and named aguilarite in honor of Ponciano Aguilar. When the International Mineralogical Association was founded, aguilarite was grandfathered as a valid mineral species. ==Occurrence== Aguilarite is uncommon, and forms at relatively low temperatures in hydrothermal deposits rich in silver and selenium but deficient in sulfur. The mineral is known from a number of countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Aguilarite occurs in association with acanthite, calcite, naumannite, pearceite, proustite, silver, stephanite, and quartz. ==Chemistry and structure== In 2013, aguilarite's chemistry and crystal structure were reexamined by Bindi and Pingitore. The significant reevaluation of aguilarite did not discredit its status as a valid mineral, but it was established as the selenium analogue of acanthite instead of sulfur-rich naumannite. The sample primarily studied came from the Gem and Mineral Collection of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University. The work of Petruk et al. in 1974 formed the basis of knowledge regarding the silver‚Äìsulfur‚Äìselenium system for about forty years. They indexed their x-ray diffraction patterns of aguilarite on an orthorhombic cell similar to naumannite. Bindi and Pingitore determined that aguilarite is, in fact, monoclinic and is isostructural to acanthite and not naumannite. Bindi and Pingitore believe that Petruk et al. were unable to resolve closely spaced peaks due to low resolution equipment, making aguilarite appear similar to naumannite. Additionally, a number of inconsistencies in unit cell dimensions in the 1974 work show that aguilarite does not have the same structure as naumannite. The crystal structure of aguilarite consists of planes nearly parallel to (010) composed of tetrahedrally coordinated nonmetal atoms and AgX3 triangles (where X is a nonmetal). The planes are joined by twofold-coordinated silver atoms. Aguilarite is part of the acanthite-like solid solution series Ag2S‚ÄìAg2S0.4Se0.6. The mineral comprises the range from 50 atomic percent selenium up to the transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic. ==References== ;Bibliography * * ==Further reading== * ==External links== Category:Monoclinic minerals Category:Sulfosalt minerals Category:Silver minerals Category:Sulfide minerals Category:Selenide minerals ","title":"Aguilarite"},{"id":"7777994","text":"Robert A.

The similarity required of the viols in a chest of viols usually meant that they were made by the same maker, and sometimes were ordered in sets. Similar viols were desirable because they would blend better, and also stay in tune with each other better than more disparate instruments. One enclosure is described by Thomas Tudway in Hawkins's General History as \\"a large hutch, with several apartments and partitions in it; each partition was lined with green bays, to keep the instruments from being injured by the weather.\\" These cases were sometimes expanded to house an expanding collection of instruments. As mentioned in the above quote, the purpose of the chest was not only to house the instruments, but also to protect them from changes in temperature and humidity, which can damage instruments.

He is well known for his contributions to the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He was a major influence in pushing for black culture to focus less on integration with White culture, to that of celebrating their differences within an equally important and meaningful artistic and political field, thus celebrating Black Heritage. ==Biography== Neal was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Woodie and Maggie Neal, who had five sons. Neal's parents had a strong influence on his later works. His father had less than a high school education but was \\"exceptionally well read\\" and his mother instilled in him a love of the arts. He graduated from Roman Catholic High School in Philadelphia in 1956. He later graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in 1961 with a degree in history and English, and then received a master's degree in 1963 from the University of Pennsylvania in Folklore (which became a major subject of many of his later works). In 1963, Neal was a professor for Drexel Institute of Technology in Philadelphia for a brief period, before landing a job in New York as a copywriter in 1964 for Wiley and Sons. From 1968 to 1969, Neal taught at the City College of New York. The following year he taught at Wesleyan University, and then at Yale University from 1970 to 1975. During his time at Yale he won a Guggenheim Fellowship for African-American critical studies. Neal is known for working with Amiri Baraka to open the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School. His early writings‚Äîincluding \\"The Negro in the Theatre\\" (1964), \\"Cultural Front\\" (1965), and \\"The Black Arts Movement\\" (1968)‚Äîwere influential in defining and describing the role of the arts in the Black Power era. Additionally, he became the arts editor of the Liberator magazine (1964‚Äì69), educational director of the Black Panther Party, and was a member of the Revolutionary Action Movement. During this time, Neal became more involved in radical black politics and spent more time with Baraka and the Black Liberation movement (774). His time as an arts editor allowed him to interview some of the most influential black artists, musicians, and writers, which only increased his involvement and influence in the Black Arts Movement. His essays and poems appeared in publications such as Liberator, Drama Critique, Soulbook, Black Theatre, Negro Digest, Performance, and Black World(for which he was either a founder, editor and/or a contributor). He wrote and produced two major plays, The Glorious Monster in the Bell of the Horn (1976) and In an Upstate Motel (1981). Glorious Monster was described by a critic as \\"lyric drama, a poetic interpretation of the hopes and aspirations of black artists and the middle class\\". Neal's essays dealt with social issues, aesthetic theory, literary topics, while his poetry focused more on African-American mythology, history, and language. He also uncovered Ed Bullins's plagiarism of Albert Camus's 1949 play The Just Assassins. One of his most famous and defining works was the essay \\"The Black Arts Movement\\", which addressed the need to be \\"radically opposed to any concept of the artist that alienates him from his community\\" . This work addressed the \\"Black aesthetic\\" and the need to reject a \\"white aesthetic\\". This work symbolically represented the essence of his message as a leader in the Black Arts movement. At Howard University in Washington D.C., Neal held the Andrew W. Mellon chair in humanities. During 1976‚Äì79, he was the Executive Director for the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities. This organization helped with grants to further the arts in black communities. ==Family== In 1965, he married Evelyn Rodgers, a chemist; they had one adopted son, Avatar. Neal died from a heart attack on January 6, 1981, at a theater workshop in Hamilton, New York. Information on his life and career can be found at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which is a section of the New York Public Library. ==Works== *Black Boogaloo: Notes on Black Liberation (poetry) (1969) *Introductions to Zora Neale Hurston's autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, and her novel Jonah‚Äôs Gourd Vine (1971). *Moving On Up (screenplay) (1973) *Hoodoo Hollerin' Bebop Ghosts (poetry) (1974) *The Glorious Monster in the Bell of the Horn (play) (1979) *In an Upstate Motel: A Morality Play (play) (1980) *Visions of a Liberated Future: Black Arts Movement Writings Edited by Michael Schwartz; with commentary by Amiri Baraka, Stanley Crouch, Charles Fuller, and Jayne Cortez (essays) (1989) ===As editor or contributor=== *Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing (co-editor, with Amiri Baraka) (1968) *Trippin': A Need for Change (co-author, with Amiri Baraka and A.

He wields certain ecclesiastical powers, takes part in patriarchal synods, and has the right to confirm and dismiss abbots, with the approval of the Patriarch of Constantinople, under whose jurisdiction Mount Athos functions as an autonomous monastic republic. In the past, the protos seems to have been given authority to ordain (cheirotonia) priests, but currently ordinations on Mount Athos are performed by the Archbishop of Thessaloniki. The earliest historical documentation of the office of protos is from 908. The first typikon of Mount Athos (the book containing monastic rules and regulations), published by the emperor John Tzimiskes in 972, recognised the first authority over Mount Athos which was elected by the monasteries. During the centuries that followed, the institution of the protos would at times flourish and at other times decline. In the beginning of the nineteenth century the typikon of 1810 was published, which assigned the protos along with four overseers and with a holy synod composed of representatives from the twenty sovereign monasteries which make up the Mount Athos community. The seat of the protos has been in Karyes since 911, and the primary church for the Athonite administration is called the Protaton. ==History== ==List of protoi== *Christodoulos of Patmos,Angold (2000), p. 267 after 1093 *HilarionAngold (2000), p. 595 *John Tarchaneiotes, ca. 1107Angold (2000), p. 282 *John Chortaitinos,Angold (2000), p. 591 fl. 1253 *Niphon Kausokalybites, 1345-1347Fine (1994), p. 312 *Anthony, 1348 (Serbian) *Dorotheus of Hilandar, 1356-1366 (Serbian) ==References== ===Sources=== * *Michael Angold (2000), Church and society in Byzantium under the Comneni, 1081-1261 ==External links== *Protaton of Mount Athos Category:Ecclesiastical titles Category:Eastern Orthodox monks Category:Mount Athos ","title":"Protos (monastic office)"},{"id":"7778140","text":"Blaikie is a Scottish surname.

In the past, regional development policy tended to try to achieve these objectives by means of large-scale infrastructure development and by attracting inward investment (OECD,2020). A large number of international organizations such as the OECD, UN, IMF and many more that provide assistance on economic, environmental and social issues to the less economically developed regions.

O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science (abbreviated as O'B), formerly known as Boston Technical High School is a college preparatory public exam school along with Boston Latin School and Boston Latin Academy. O‚ÄôBryant specializes in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (\\"STEM\\") in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and is named for one of Boston's prominent African-American educators John D. O'Bryant. The school is currently located on 55 Malcolm X Boulevard in the neighborhood of Roxbury, Massachusetts. With a student body of 1,500 7th‚Äì12th graders, this school is part of the Boston Public Schools. The school was named a 2010 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence, the US Department of Education's highest award. In 2014 the school was awarded Gold by the US News Best High School Ranking, indicating that it is one of the top public high schools in the country. ==History== The logo for Boston Technical High School Now over one hundred years old, the O'Bryant began as the Mechanic Arts High School in 1893. Until the early 1970s, it was an all- boys school. In 1944, the school became Boston Technical High School. The original building containing the various shops, woodworking, machine shop, forge shop and drafting rooms was built around 1900 and was located on the corner of Dalton and Belvidere Streets in the Back Bay. The Hilton Hotel is located there today. In 1909 the five-story class room, chemistry and physics labs building was completed on Scotia Street adjacent to the older building. Later, the school moved to the building that originally housed Roxbury Memorial High School (1930 to 1960) at 205 Townsend Street in Roxbury, Massachusetts. That school building is now the home of Boston Latin Academy. Boston Technical High School remained there until 1987 when it relocated to a new building at 55 New Dudley Street (now Malcolm X Boulevard). In 1989, Boston Technical High School and Mario Umana Technical High School merged but still kept the name of Boston Technical High School. In 1994, the school graduated the first class for the school renamed after Boston educator John D. O'Bryant. ==Academics== This school is a science and math specialized institution and it is one of the examination schools in the greater Boston Area. The O'Bryant is ranked #9 in the state and is the #1 Math and Science school in the city of Boston. In 2012 The O'Bryant received a gold medal by U.S News & World. It is a relatively new exam school that offers many advanced placement courses in math and science and it's a school with many excellent students. It is the most diverse of the three exam schools and it's one of the hosts of the JROTC club. Through partnerships with MIT, Northeastern University, Harvard, Microsoft, STEP Inspire, and other area businesses and institutions, the O'Bryant looks to lead science, technology, engineering, and math instruction and programming for the city of Boston. The current Headmaster as of November 2016 is Tanya Freeman-Wisdom. ===Requirements=== Admission to O'Bryant is determined by a combination of a student's score on the Independent School Entrance Examination and the student's recent grades, and is limited only to residents of the city of Boston. Although the O'Bryant runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it only admits students into the 7th, 9th & 10th grade. Unlike the other two Boston exam schools, the day is composed of six periods instead of seven and there is no requirement to take a course of Latin. There is a requirement three years of the same language (Mandarin-Chinese, Spanish, Latin, and French) for all students who enter at seventh, ninth, and tenth grades. Unlike other public schools there is also a requirement of six years of mathematics, including a requirement to pass Calculus. ===Gateway to the LMA=== Gateway to the LMA (Longwood Medical Area), is a program that prepares low-income and minority students for high-level careers in medicine, science, and engineering. The gateway program involves extra instructional periods, after-school tutorials, smaller classrooms, more intermediate classes, and internships with a science-based institution. Applications are open to eighth graders, and the program runs from ninth grade until graduation. Acceptance is based on a three-question essay, regular attendance, and grades above B-. ===Solar panel project=== The Current Building of John D. O'Bryant The school is home to a state-of-the-art solar energy system created by students at the school in June 2004. The 2 kW photovoltaic (PV) array, installed on the southeastern wall of the school, uses semiconductor technology to convert sunlight into pollution-free electricity. The solar equipment was donated by the MIT Space Systems Laboratory through a grant from NASA. The O'Bryant School also received support on curriculum development from the MIT Edgerton Center. Heliotronics of Hingham, MA provided a Solar Learning Lab, which gives students real-time system data on power production, efficiency, and weather conditions for analysis. ===MCAS=== The O'Bryant moved from not being ranked in the top 50% on MCAS in 2002 to being ranked #3 in the entire state in 2003 and 2004 for the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) 10th Grade Mathematics. Over 98% of the students who took the test received \\"Advanced\\" or \\"Proficient\\" on the 10th grade MCAS exam, taken in the spring of 2006. The O'Bryant also ranked #8 in the entire state for the MCAS in reading & literature. Over 95% of the students who took the test received \\"Advanced\\" or \\"Proficient\\" on the 10th grade MCAS exams, taken in the spring of 2006. ===College scholarships=== Based on excellent performance on the 2006 MCAS, a total of 899 students in the Boston Public Schools have qualified for the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, which provides four years of free tuition to any state university or college in Massachusetts. To qualify for the scholarship, students had to score in the Advanced category (Level 4) on either the English Language Arts or Math sections of the MCAS exams and in at least Proficient (Level 3) on the other. Also, the students' scores had to rank in the top 25% of the district. In order to maintain the scholarship, students must complete their college program in four years or less and maintain a 3.0 grade point average. ===Advanced Placement=== The O'Bryant School was awarded the Siemens Award for Advanced Placement in 2003 by the Siemens Foundation. The O'Bryant offers an abundance of Advanced Placement classes such as Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Calculus, Statistics, English Literature and Composition, English Language and Composition, U.S. History, European History, Computer Science, U.S. Government & Politics and Spanish. In 2008 they added AP Environmental Science and Microeconomics. ==Extracurricular activities== Students from the 2014 MIT Inventeam. All students must maintain a 2.67 GPA (B-) or higher in order to partake in any extracurricular activities. The extra curricular activities include fall, winter and spring sports. With its ties to colleges such as MIT, Harvard University, Microsoft & Northeastern University; the students at the O'Bryant school are offered with many programs that revolves around science, technology, engineering and math. In addition, the school has also been awarded the Lemelson-MIT Inventeams grant 2 times: first in 2006 and later in 2014. The 2014 Inventeam worked on a project to create an autonomous solar cleaner that was presented at a 3-day event in June, 2015, at MIT's Eureka Fest. ===Sports=== The mascot for all teams at the O'Bryant is the Tiger. Teams at the O'Bryant include Baseball, Basketball, Cheer leading, American Football, Hockey, Rowing, Football, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Track & Field, and Volleyball. The School's colors are blue and white. ===Clubs=== There are a full range of clubs and programs that the school offers.

Coach Ortega was the 2008 scholastic coach of the year. ==John D. O'Bryant== John D. O'Bryant was born in Boston on July 15, 1931. He attended and graduated from the Boston Public Schools and went on to earning both his bachelor's and master's degrees at Boston University. O‚ÄôBryant served in the United States Army and then became a teacher and guidance counselor from 1955 to 1969, then taking a role as Director of the Health Vocational Training Program at the Dimock Community Health Center. He became the first African-American on the Boston School Board in 75 years, elected in 1977 during the tumultuous Boston busing desegregation era. He was later selected to be the vice president of Northeastern University in 1979. O‚ÄôBryant was the first African American ever to serve as vice president. He kept that position until his sudden death in 1992. During that period, he oversaw the workings of the African-American Institute and provided invaluable leadership in what were often difficult times. ==Notable alumni== * Richard Egan (Class of '53), co- founder of EMC Corporation and former United States Ambassador to Ireland * Dan Sullivan (Class of '57), former National Football League player * Arthur Gajarsa (Class of '58), federal judge in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit * William Bratton (Class of '65), former Chief of Police for the LAPD, NYPD, and BPD * Charles Yancey (Class of '65), Boston City Councillor * Fred Ahern (Class of '70), former National Hockey League player *N.C.

It depicts the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus with his family: to the left is his wife Julia Domna, and in front of them are their sons Geta (probably with the erased face) and Caracalla. It is now part of the Antikensammlung Berlin (inventory number 31329), currently held in the Altes Museum. ==Description== The work is a tempera or egg-based painting on a circular wooden panel or tondo with a diameter of . It depicts the Imperial family wearing sumptuous ceremonial garments. Septimius Severus and his sons are also holding sceptres and wearing gold wreaths decorated with precious stones. This image of a grey-haired Severus, with his wife and young children, emphasises the dynastic ambitions of the new emperor. The darker skin tone of Severus reflects his Libyan origins. Julia Domna has her distinctive hairstyle, crimped into parallel locks, possibly a style from her home in Syria, and perhaps a wig. One son's face has been obliterated in a deliberate act of iconoclasm, and the vacant space smeared with excrement. Most scholars believe it is Geta whose face has been removed, probably after his murder by his brother Caracalla and the ensuing damnatio memoriae. However, it is also possible that Geta (as the younger son) is the smaller boy, and it is Caracalla's face which was eradicated, perhaps as a compensatory retaliation for Caracalla's mass execution of young Alexandrian men in the year 215.Dieter Metzler, \\"Bilderstuerme und Bilderfeindlichkeit in der Antike,\\" in Bildersturm, ed. Martin Warnke (Munich, 1973), pp. 17-18 The tondo was probably created in a square or rectangular shape, and later cut into a circle. The loss of some of the original painting is most apparent with the sceptres that the males are holding: the upper parts, once adorned with imperial symbols, are now missing. It seems likely that the panel was cut down in modern times to improve its saleability on the art market.Vincent Rondot: Derniers visages des dieux d'√âgypte, Paris 2013 , p. 33 ==Interpretation== The image is probably an example of imperial portraits that were mass-produced to be displayed in offices and public buildings throughout the Roman Empire; as part of Roman legal procedure, some documents had to be signed in front of an image of the emperor, which gave them the same status as if signed in his actual presence. With each change of emperor, the portrait would have been discarded or replaced. Since wood is an organic material and does not normally survive, the Berlin Tondo remains, so far, the only surviving specimen of this type of painting. ==Provenance== The tondo appears to be of Egyptian origin, using similar materials and style to the Fayum mummy portraits. It may have been painted to celebrate the visit of Septimius Severus to Egypt in 199 CE, following his military victories against Parthia the previous year, and before his campaigns in north Africa in 203. Caracalla is depicted as a youth, indicating a date before 205. The history of the painting after its creation is not known until the Antikensammlung Berlin acquired it in 1932 from an art dealer in Paris. It remains in the collection at the Altes Museum, one of the Berlin State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin).

She was seeking the help of detectives Robert Parker and Patrick Rafferty, whom she knew from earlier incidents with her abusive son. Melva Legere said she feared her son-- an unemployed ex-convict who had previously done time in Greene and Sing Sing prisons for sexual assault, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, and attempted assault--might try to take her car from her.Becker, M.

Seeing Marlon Legere on East 49th Street sitting in his mother's Mazda 626, the two detectives drove the wrong way down the street and boxed in Legere with their car so he could not drive off. Neither detective was wearing a bulletproof vest. The detectives exited their vehicle and approached Legere from both sides of his mother's car. Legere somehow obtained Parker's 9 mm Glock and shot both officers four times each, mortally wounding them. Legere would later tell police: \\"When they tried to grab me, I wouldn't let them. I grabbed their gun and I shot them.\\" Before passing out, Rafferty managed to shoot Legere in the foot and the ankle.Ramirez, J.

At the same time Parker dialed 911 on his cell phone and was able to calmly describe the situation and identify his attacker to the operator. \\"I have a photo of the guy who shot me on my dashboard,\\" he said. Both detectives were still alive when ambulances showed up, but did not survive the trip to the hospital. ==Flight and capture== After being shot by Rafferty, Marlon Legere, still bearing Parker's service weapon, hobbled into the street and carjacked Omar Harvey out of his Mercury Villager minivan.Detective Patrick Rafferty Legere drove twelve blocks to the apartment of a female acquaintance, where he tried to get rid of Parker's gun. Police took him into custody two hours later, when a neighbor saw Legere lying down and bleeding on the apartment's fire escape. Parker's gun was recovered from a lot behind the building. ==Trial and afterwards== On September 13, 2004, prosecutors filed first degree murder charges against Legere. When the case went to trial, Legere pleaded not guilty but declined to take the stand in his defense. His attorneys' strategy was to portray the crime as an attempt at self-defense, arguing that Legere thought he was being robbed. The detectives were in plainclothes and driving an unmarked car at the time. According to defense attorney Ivan Vogel: \\"It's a combination of self defense and just a tragic situation where the circumstances unraveled ... Mr. Legere was fighting for his life.\\" The jury deliberated only one day. Legere was convicted on February 2, 2006 and on February 22, 2006, received two life sentences without parole for the first- degree murder charges, 25 years for a first-degree robbery charge, and one year for a fourth-degree criminal mischief charge.

With its centuries-old tourist tradition, it is a very popular vacation spot located in the continental part of the country, serving as a spa center and health resort. Connected by the state road D307 and L202 railway it is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) north from the country's capital city Zagreb. From amalgamation of a local community, the municipality of Stubiƒçke Toplice was founded on 27 April 1993 as a unit of local government. The name of the town literally means \\"the spa of Stubica\\", marking it as the spa resort near the town of Donja Stubica. The municipality has four settlements: Pila, Sljeme, Strmec Stubiƒçki and Stubiƒçke Toplice. ==History== === Ancient times === Stubiƒçke Toplice has a long, rich and diverse history. It is believed that the town was known as early as the time of Roman Empire, due to two Roman coins from the era of emperor Hadrian that were found near the pool in 1963. === 13th to 18th century === The first written trace of the place was found in 1209, in the charter of Hungarian-Croatian King Andrew II, where the toponyms \\"Toplice\\" and \\"Stubica\\" are mentioned. In the Middle Ages, Stubiƒçke Toplice was mentioned in 1567, in the investigation against Franjo Tahy, when this area belonged to the Susedgrad-Stubica seigniory. The final battle of the great peasant fight in 1573 took place on the hill Kapel≈°ƒáak. At the top of the hill, there was a small chapel of St. Catherine at the time, for which the visitation from 1622 suggests was once a parish church. The sources of thermal water hot springs in Stubiƒçke Toplice were first described by Hungarian historian Nikola Isthv√°nffy in the 17th century. In the 18th century Stubiƒçke Toplice was owned by counts Vojkffy - Vojkoviƒá from Donje Oroslavje. In 1776 count K. Vojkffy built, besides the springs itself, the first swimming pool, which represents the beginning of a future spa and balneology tradition. === Maksimilijan Vrhovac period and sudden development of the resort (18th and 19th century) === Statue of the bishop Maksimilijan Vrhovac in the central park A significant period in development of Stubiƒçke Toplice began in 1806, when the Zagreb bishop Maksimilijan Vrhovac (Karlovac, 23. 11. 1752. - Zagreb, 16. 12. 1827) bought nearby Golubovec castle from the Domjaniƒá family and then thermal springs in Stubiƒçke Toplice from counts Vojkffy ‚Äì Vojkoviƒá. Until 1811, Vrhovac systematically bought the surrounding land, increased the possession of the place and turned it into a large complex where a modern thermal spa would be built. In 1811, the construction of the main building ‚Äì Maksimilijan's bath ‚Äì began. The draft was made by the official builder of Bishop Vrhovac ‚Äì Heinrich Vesteburg. The great building of the Maksimilijan bath, well-composed and functionally solved, made in baroque style, was a very large investment for its time. It was also the first regulated thermal spa in Croatia, which, in some of the later modifications, still works today. In the park, behind the Maksimilijan bath, a neo gothic-stylized octagonal pavilion was built, named the Steam bath of Dijana, presenting one of the first applications of the neogothicism at this area. St. Catherine chapel in Stubiƒçke Toplice, built in 1814 The third building of the whole resort complex, the classicist chapel of St. Catherine, was built by the same person. It was built and dedicated in 1814. It is important to emphasize that on the complex of Stubiƒçke Toplice, the same person, at the same time, built the three objects and applied different styles (baroque tradition, neo-gothic, classicism). At the invitation of the bishop of Maksimilijan Vrhovac in Stubiƒçke Toplice, the most famous doctors and surgeons come to investigate and confirm the healing and possible health care enabled by using thermal springs. During the 19th century, the owners of the spa were heirs of Vrhovac in Stubiƒçki Golubovec - Novosel nobles, counts Sermage, barunes Rauch and Barunes Steeb as the last owners. By 1918, the bath did not change its mode of operation. === 20th century - present === The first illustrated tourist guide publication of Stubiƒçke Toplice, The Mineral Bath and Spas of Stubiƒçke Toplice, was printed in 1914 when the owner of the spa was Levin Baron Rauch. Activity at the resort and spa was then cut off following World War I. Before the construction of the Zabok-Gornja Stubica railway in 1916, the town was connected with the neighbouring town of Zabok with the spa-owned car. Between the two world wars, the spa became a joint-stock company. Outdoor pools, catering and other facilities are built. Stubiƒçke Toplice became the most visited excursion site in the vicinity of Zagreb. In the second half of 20th century, significant expansion of the spa began, with upgrading of the baths, rehabilitation center and construction of a new hotel. Prior to 1993, Stubiƒçke Toplice belonged to the territory of the former Municipality of Donja Stubica (which earned town privileges in 1997). Since the municipality of Stubiƒçke Toplice was founded on April 27, 1993, a large number of building, infrastructural, culture, educational and social projects in the town were realized through the initiative of Vladimir Bosnar, arguably the most favored and memorable mayor by the town inhabitants, who served in this position from the municipality's inception until his death in 2017 (with a short break in early 2000s). On March 22, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Stubiƒçke Toplice got hit by 5.5 magnitude earthquake (the strongest one in that area since 1880) which caused no reported casualties and only few minor material damages in the town's area. A 3-metre wide (10 ft) sinkhole opened on the grounds of Special hospital for medical rehabilitation after the earthquake. Neighbouring town Donja Stubica and municipality of Gornja Stubica, however, suffered significant material damage. == Geography == Valley of the creek Vidak with the settlement under Kamenjak forest === Geology and topology === Stubiƒçke Toplice, one of the smallest municipalities in the county, occupies 25 square kilometers (10.4 square miles), and is 162 meters above sea level. It is situated in the southern part of Krapina-Zagorje County, lying underneath the northern slopes of Medvednica mountain, approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the capital city Zagreb (which is situated beneath the opposite, south side of the mountain). Protected by the hills Kamenjak from north-east and Kape≈°ƒáak from south-west, Stubiƒçke Toplice marks the confluence of the local creeks Vidak and Topliƒçina. About 80% of the town's area is located in the Nature park of Medvednica - the natural landscape value of the municipality. The whole area of the municipality is covered by the hills that are connected to the Medvednica massif on the southeast and to the Krapina river valley on the north. The area of Stubiƒçke Toplice is stretched by a dense network of mountain creeks, which belong to the Krapina river basin. It is an area of diverse vegetation made up of forests, plateaux, valleys, meadows and preserved streams of mountain valley watercourses. Oak, hornbeam and beech communities predominate on the slopes of the local hills. However, on the higher and colder parts of Medvednica mountain, the most common are the forests of beech and pine. The vegetation along the creek valleys is primarily made of willows, alders and secondary communities of humid habitats in the form of a tall sedge. Swamp areas occur in places with slower water flows. The settlement borders on the east with the town Donja Stubica, west with the village Kru≈°ljevo Selo (territory of the town Oroslavje) and Zagreb County, more precisely with the municipality of Jakovlje (village Igri≈°ƒáe), north with Oroslavje and village Andra≈°evec (Oroslavje territory), south with the municipality of Jakovlje (more precisely Kraljev Vrh), the city of Zagreb (neighborhood Podsljeme) and southwest with Zagreb County (municipality of Bistra). === Climate === Stubiƒçke Toplice area has a humid continental climate, with average relative humidity of 75-80%. The average temperature in the town is 9.6 degrees Celsius (49.3 ¬∞F); 18.9 ¬∞C (66.0 ¬∞F) in summer and 0.2 ¬∞C (32.4 ¬∞F) in winter. Estimated annual rainfall is 1164 mm (according to the 2013 census). The most common winds are southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). == Economy, tourism and culture == Stubiƒçke Toplice plays an important role in the country's continental tourism. The town lies on the healing thermal springs, which offer natural wealth and potential to the town. The municipality bases itself on development of health, congress and recreational tourism. === Health and congress tourism === alt= Stubiƒçke Toplice is a home to special hospital for physical rehabilitation, surrounded by a spacious park that stretches all the way to the forest slopes of the surrounding hills. It is a complex of three buildings: the oldest part of the hospital, Maksimilijan built in the 19th century and modernized/reconstructed in 2010s, Toplice built in 1973, and the newest Dijana featuring a fitness center, built in 1997. Today, the Special Hospital is a successful provider of health tourism, using the tradition of treatment with thermal water as a natural healing factor and modern medical rehabilitation. Thermal spring water is known for its therapeutic properties, which can be used to treat various injuries, muscle inflammation, rheumatism, etc. It is characterized by high temperature at the source (43‚Äì63 ¬∞C), which is evidence of great depths. High temperature, and a rich chemical composition give great healing properties. Together with the neighbouring 3-star congress hotel Matija Gubec built in 1972, rehabilitation center provides modern wellness/spa, sauna, professional hydro massage and indoor/outdoor swimming pool services. alt= === Recreational tourism === alt= Stubiƒçke Toplice enjoys a picturesque landscape where the Medvednica forest slopes descend towards thermal springs. With its specialties (rich cultural heritage, healing thermal springs, Kapel≈°ƒçak and Kamenjak hills filled with historical stories, Lake Jarki, promenades, parks, biodiversity of the Medvednica Nature Park etc.), Stubiƒçke Toplice attracts many hikers, tourists and mountaineers. Entrance board of the Medvednica Nature Park The historic educational forest trail Kamenjak, with its natural, religious and historical significance, was restored on the Kamenjak hill and the forest of the same name in late 2004 / early 2005 and again in 2014. It is located on the southwest side of Kamenjak forest, in the northeastern part of the Stubiƒçke Toplice municipality, near the hotel Matija Gubec and the Special Hospital. The length of the track is 1200 meters and the altitude difference is 87 meters. The richness of the plant and animal world is the main feature of the forest. At the end of the trail there was an oak called Gal≈æenjak which collapsed in 2010s, former protected monument of nature since 1965, where, according to folk tales, the rebellious serfs of the 1573 peasant fight were hung. As a continuation of the peasant fight story, on the neighboring hill, the scenic and historical-memorial locality Kapel≈°ƒçak, there is a memorial plaque which marks the place where the revolt leader Matija Gubec was caught. The final part of the promenade leads to the small chapel of St. Catherine situated on the Kapel≈°ƒáak hill. === Events, manifestations and cultural life === Stubiƒçke Toplice's tourist board, in cooperation with active associations, promotes the cultural life of the town throughout the year. Exhibitions, concerts in the parish church, live bar music and various cultural and sporting events are organized. Cultural and historical values, traditional inheritance, protection of the environment and gastronomic traditions of Hrvatsko Zagorje region are promoted, with events like The Mushroom-picking autumn event in the village of Pila (Gljivarenje v Stubakima), ‚ÄûEaster‚Äú (Vuzem) and ‚ÄûChristmas‚Äú (Bo≈æiƒá) in the local square etc. The municipality hosts several associations aiming to promote different sports. Among the prominent sports associations, are clubs for auto-moto, cycling, fishing, mini football, table tennis and taekwondo. Since 1993, the mountain car race \\"Grand prix of Stubiƒçke Toplice\\" (Velika nagrada Stubiƒçkih Toplica) has been held. Each year at the time of the Snow Queen Trophy event (a World cup alpine ski race held on Medvednica mountaintop Sljeme usually in early January), bus transfer for race-visitors is traditionally organized between Stubiƒçke Toplice and Sljeme. Stubiƒçke Toplice is a recognizable ecological destination and a long-time winner of the prestigious \\"Green Flower\\" (Zeleni cvijet) award for the cleanest town in continental Croatia. == Education == Elementary school Stubiƒçke Toplice in February 2020 Stubiƒçke Toplice has a school that provides elementary education program, serving grades 1‚Äì8. Construction of the building began in 1994. As a part of the elementary school in the neighbouring town of Donja Stubica, it began with its work with the program for grades 1‚Äì4 in 1996. For the students who finished grade 4 in Stubiƒçke Toplice there was ensured extension of their elementary education from grade 5 at Elementary school Donja Stubica at that time. Since 2009, the school has been upgraded to serve grades 1‚Äì8, supporting entire program. Later the same year, the school made secession from Elementary school Donja Stubica and started with its independent work. The municipality library (Opƒáinska knji≈ænica) was also opened in 2018 in the town center. == Transportation == The town is connected by bus and railway with the majority of the neighboring and medium-distanced towns, including Zagreb. === Road access === The town lies on the intersection of the state road D307 that connects Marija Bistrica, Donja Stubica and Oroslavje with the A2 highway in Zabok and regional road ≈ΩU2219 that connects Stubiƒçke Toplice with Stubiƒçki Strmec, Pila and Sljeme. On call taxi services are also available from the town center. === Railway access === Stubiƒçke Toplice has a train station on the local L202 railway corridor that is served by daily passenger trains. == References == == External links == * Category:Populated places in Krapina-Zagorje County Category:Municipalities of Croatia Category:Spa towns in Croatia ","title":"Stubiƒçke Toplice"},{"id":"7778352","text":"The municipality is located in Krapina-Zagorje County in northern Croatia Tuhelj is a village and municipality in Krapina-Zagorje County in Croatia.

It was approved by the FDA on July 2, 2009. It was recommended as an alternative to amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in people whose hearts have either returned to normal rhythm or who undergo drug therapy or electric shock treatment i.e. direct current cardioversion (DCCV) to maintain normal rhythm. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug. In the United States, the FDA approved label includes a claim for reducing hospitalization, but not for reducing mortality, as a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated in the clinical development program. A trial of the drug in heart failure was stopped as an interim analysis showed a possible increase in heart failure deaths, in patients with moderate to severe CHF. The U.S. label for dronedarone includes a boxed warning, stating that dronedarone is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure, with NYHA Class II‚ÄìIII heart failure with a recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or referral to a specialized heart failure clinic, or with permanent atrial fibrillation.\\" Dronedarone is also associated with rare cases of severe liver damage, including liver failure. ==Mechanism of action== Dronedarone has been termed a ‚Äúmultichannel blocker‚Äù however it is unclear which channel(s) play a pivotal role in its success.Guillemare E, Marion A, Nisato D, Gautier P, ‚ÄúInhibitory effects of dronedarone on muscarinic K+ current in guinea pig atrial cells,‚Äù in Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, 2000 7 Thus, dronedarone's actions at the cellular level are controversial with most studies suggesting an inhibition in multiple outward potassium currents including rapid delayed rectifier, slow delayed rectifier and ACh-activated inward rectifier.Aimond F, Beck L, Gautier P, Ch√©rif OK, Davy JM, Lorente P, Nisato D, Vassort G, ‚ÄúCellular and in vivo electrophysiological effects of dronedarone in normal and postmyocardial infarcted rats,‚Äù in The Journal of Pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, 2000. 11 It is also believed to reduce inward rapid Na current and L-type Ca channels. The reduction in K current in some studies was shown to be due to the inhibition of K-ACh channel or associated GTP-binding proteins. Reduction of K+ current by 69% led to increased AP duration and increased effective refractory periods, thus shown to suppress pacemaker potential of the SA node and return patients to a normal heart rhythm. In a European trial, the average time to recurrence of an arrhythmia was 41 days in the placebo group vs. 96 days in the dronedarone group (similar results obtained in the non-European trial, 59 and 158 days respectively).Singh BN, Connolly SJ, Crijns HJ, Roy D, Kowey PR, Capucci A, Radzik D, Aliot EM, Hohnloser SH; EURIDIS and ADONIS Investigators, ‚ÄúDronedarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter,‚Äù in The New England Journal of Medicine, 2007. 12 ==Chemistry== Chemically, dronedarone is a benzofuran derivative related to amiodarone, a popular antiarrhythmic. The use of amiodarone is limited by toxicity due its high iodine content (pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid disease) as well as by liver disease. In dronedarone, the iodine moieties are not present, reducing toxic effects on the thyroid and other organs. A methylsulfonamide group is added to reduce solubility in fats (lipophobicity) and thus reduce neurotoxic effects. Dronedarone displays amiodarone-like class III antiarrhythmic activity in vitro and in clinical trials. The drug also appears to exhibit activity in each of the 4 Vaughan-Williams antiarrhythmic classes.http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid;=152656&drugname;=Multaq+Oral&monotype;=monograph&print;=1. ==Pharmacokinetics== Dronedarone is less lipophilic than amiodarone, has a much smaller volume of distribution, and has an elimination half-life of 13‚Äì19 hours‚Äîthis stands in contrast to amiodarone's half-life of several weeks. As a result of these pharmacokinetic characteristics, dronedarone dosing may be less complicated than amiodarone. ==Contraindications== * Permanent AF (patients in whom normal sinus rhythm will not or cannot be restored)http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/022425s023lbl.pdf * Recently decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization or Class IV heart failure. * Second-or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome (except when used in conjunction with a functioning pacemaker) * Bradycardia * Concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor * Concomitant use of drugs or herbal products that prolong the QT interval and may induce Torsade de Pointes * Liver or lung toxicity related to the previous use of amiodarone * Severe hepatic impairment * QTc Bazett interval ‚â•500 ms, or use with drugs or herbal supplements that prolong QT interval or increase risk of torsades de points (Class I or III antiarrhythmic agents, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain oral macrolides, ephedra). * Pregnancy and nursing mothers * Hypersensitivity to dronedarone * Hepatic impairment. In Jan 2011 the FDA advised about cases of rare, but severe, liver injury, including two cases of acute liver failure leading to liver transplant in patients treated with dronedarone (Multaq). It is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin in patients taking dronedarone will prevent the development of severe liver injury. * PR interval exceeding 280 ms * Use of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3a isoenzyme inhibitors (includes: clarithromycin, cyclosporine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) ==Clinical trials== Clinical trials have compared dronedarone to placebo and to amiodarone, for its ability to reduce atrial fibrillation, to reduce mortality overall and from cardiac causes, and for its adverse effects, including excess mortality.Guillemare E, Marion A, Nisato D, Gautier P, ‚ÄúInhibitory effects of dronedarone on muscarinic K+ current in guinea pig atrial cells,‚Äù in Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, 2000. 7 Dronedarone is a non-iodinated class III anti-arrhythmic drug which helps patients return to normal sinus rhythm. This treatment for AF is also known to reduce associated mortality and hospitalizations compared to other similar antiarrhythmic agents.Connolly SJ, Crijns HJ, Torp-Pedersen C, van Eickels M, Gaudin C, Page RL, Hohnloser SH; ATHENA Investigators, ‚ÄúAnalysis of stroke in ATHENA: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm trial to assess the efficacy of dronedarone 400 mg BID for the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter,‚Äù in Circulation, 2009.8 In the EURIDIS and ADONIS trials in atrial fibrillation (2007), dronedarone was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm, with no difference in lung and thyroid function in the short term. However, in the ANDROMEDA study (2007), dronedarone doubled the death rate compared to placebo, and the trial was halted early. ANDROMEDA enrolled patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure, a relatively sicker patient population. In a more recent atrial fibrillation trial, ATHENA, with 4628 subjects, dronedarone was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the composite endpoint of first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death. There was a significant reduction in the rate of cardiovascular death, but not in the rate of death from any cause. Later post- hoc analysis of the ATHENA-results showed a significant reduction in the rate of stroke. Patients randomized to dronedarone were more likely to develop bradycardia and QT-interval prolongation (but only 1 case of Torsades). Nausea, diarrhea, rash, and creatinine elevation also were more common in the dronedarone arm. The PALLAS trial (2011) was stopped for safety concerns due to the finding that \\"dronedarone increased rates of heart failure, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation who were at risk for major vascular events\\". A Black Box warning was subsequently added by the FDA stating that the risk of death, stroke, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure doubled in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. ===Direct current cardioversion results=== Dronedarone has been tested in some trials as a way to improve the success rate of electrical cardioversion. In one such trial by the Veteran's Administration it was used prepare patients for electrical conversion to sinus rhythm. In the ATHENA study, 25% of patients were started on dronedarone before cardioversion.Effect of Dronedarone on Cardiovascular Events in Atrial Fibrillation.Stefan H. Hohnloser, M.D., Harry J.G.M.

The FDA is not bound by the Committee's recommendation, but it takes its advice into consideration when reviewing new drug applications.FDA briefing document on dronedarone The FDA approved dronedarone on July 2, 2009. Health Canada was the second major regulatory body to approve the drug, giving its approval on August 12, 2009.

As a youth in Butte, he was a top pitcher and outfielder in baseball, and graduated from Butte Central Catholic High School in 1947. Sweeney played college football as an end at the University of Portland in Oregon, and graduated in 1951. After his junior year, the school dropped football as an intercollegiate sport, and Sweeney spent his senior season of 1950 as a high school coach at Columbia High School in Portland. ==Coaching career== Following graduation he returned to Montana and was a high school assistant at his alma mater, Butte Central, for a season. He was its head coach from 1952 to 1955, and at Flathead High School in Kalispell from 1956 to 1959. Sweeney moved up to the college ranks in 1960 as an assistant coach at Montana State in Bozeman, and was promoted to head coach in 1963. He compiled a record and three Big Sky conference championships in his five seasons with the Bobcats,Big Sky Conference Football Media Guide where one of his starting quarterbacks was Dennis Erickson. At Montana State, Sweeney is credited with convincing Jan Stenerud, a Norwegian on a skiing scholarship, to go out for the football team as a kicker. Stenerud went on to become the only \\"pure\\" kicker inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His salary at MSU in 1967 was $15,000. After his success in Bozeman, he moved up to the Pac-8 Conference at Washington State in Pullman, where he started with a one-year contract at $20,000 in 1968. He had only one winning season and compiled a record in eight seasons.Washington State Football Media GuidePacific-10 Conference Media Guide His team's most noteworthy accomplishment was the defeat of Rose Bowl-bound Stanford in 1971 to garner him NCAA District 8 Coach of the Year honors. After a disappointing conclusion to the 1975 season (winless in conference), Sweeney resigned at WSU a week after the season ended. He was promptly hired at Fresno State, where he coached for two seasons before becoming a National Football League (NFL) assistant for two years. He spent the season with the Oakland Raiders in John Madden's final and the season with the St. Louis Cardinals under Bud Wilkinson, who was fired before the season's end.

Situated on the Weiti River immediately south of the Whangaparaoa Peninsula in the Rodney District, it is part of the area known as the Hibiscus Coast. ==History of Stillwater== In the early 19th century Silverdale was established as a port for transporting kauri logs to Auckland. Stillwater was also used as a secondary landing to transport logs, kauri gum and later fruit produce from orchards established on cleared land at Stillwater, Silverdale and Dairy Flat. As there was no roading sea was the only form of transport available. The last shipment of kauri gum to leave Stillwater was in 1890. The pack horse tracks from Dairy Flat are still clearly visible on the Weiti Station property. The first settler in Stillwater in 1852 was Andrew Weatherspoon Thorburn and his family. Part of his original holding is now a reserve and memorial park bequeathed on their farm. Several houses were built on the river's edge in the early days as more land was cleared and made available for farming. Some live stock was introduced, but fruit from orchards seemed to be the major produce transported to Auckland from Stillwater. Other early settlers included the Dacres, Percy, Blackshaw and McPike brothers families. In 1950 the McPike brothers subdivided their farm to form what has become the Stillwater settlement known today. After the Second World War the motor camp was developed and a road from East Coast Road constructed. Prior to this there existed only a farm track to Stillwater with a ford crossing at Doctor's Creek. The original bridge built was gradually improved over the years to the two lane concrete bridge today. In 1980 the Council began tar- sealing the road. In 1985 Stillwater was connected to the Whangaparaoa sewerage system and more substantial houses were built in the area. By the year 2000, most of the power and telephone cables were put underground and footpaths formed the length of Stillwater Crescent. Houses were built on almost all the original sections developed and Stillwater could no longer be called a holiday resort; it had become a well established marine suburb. In time Coastal Heights was developed followed by the adjoining Inlet Views property and new coastal development is taking place over the river opposite the Stillwater Boat Club. Buildings continue to appear as land is cleared. ==References== ==External links== * Photographs of Stillwater held in Auckland Libraries' heritage collections.

Subsequent expansions increased seating capacity to 17,000 permanent seats and temporary bleachers. The stadium's inaugural game was a victory over Roanoke College on September 25; four weeks later, the dedication game was a win over rival Virginia. The playing field was aligned northwest to southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level. The stadium's last game was in 1964, a Virginia Tech victory over North Carolina State on November 7. The stadium was razed in 1965 and over the next thirty years the large grassy area became known as the \\"Prairie.\\" In the 1990s, three new residence halls, Payne Hall, Peddrew-Yates Hall, and New Residence Hall East (together known as the \\"Prairie Quad\\") were built on the former site of Miles Stadium.

One of the Maritime Provinces, Nova Scotia's geography is complex, despite its relatively small size in comparison to other Canadian provinces. ==Physical geography== Map of Nova Scotia The mainland portion of the Nova Scotia peninsula is attached to North America through the Isthmus of Chignecto. Various offshore islands, the largest of which is Cape Breton Island, form the bulk of the eastern part of the province. The geological history of the province spans more than 1.2 billion years . Continental drift led to the southern half of the province's mainland portion, the Meguma terrane, once being attached to Africa whereas the Avalon terrane comprising the northern half, including Cape Breton Island, was once attached to Scandinavia and Scotland. The Meguma terrane became joined to the present North American landmass as part of the Appalachian orogeny. Composed largely of Cambrian to Ordovician sedimentary deposits, it is joined to the Avalon terrane along the Minas Fault Zone, which runs east-west from Chedabucto Bay to Cobequid Bay. Nova Scotia has a great variety of coastal landforms. Most of the land in Nova Scotia is bedrock. As a result of erosion and transportation of unconsolidated material, landforms such as beaches and marshes are being formed. These deposits are also being eroded and/or flooded by the rising sea level. Glaciation during the Quaternary Period had an overwhelming effect upon the landscape. Glaciers abraded and plucked at the bedrock during their advances across the country, creating various deposits that vary in thickness and form; in some places, they are up to 300 meters thick. Nova Scotia's numerous hills, several low mountain ranges (the entire province is located within the Appalachian Mountains), lush river valleys, lakes and forests, windswept barrens, and a varied sea coast ranging from extremely rugged to broad sandy beaches, can be attributed to these forces. Drumlins, or little hills formed by glacial action, are a key feature in this and other communities in Lunenburg County. Here on the left is the \\"James Hirtle Hill\\" and on the right is the \\"Michael Wile Hill\\". The image is being taken from the \\"Bolivar Hill.\\" Nova Scotia forms part of the southern shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its sub-basin, the Northumberland Strait. The Cabot Strait lies north and east of Cape Breton Island. The main part of the Bay of Fundy lies off its northwestern shore, and large sub-basins including the Cumberland Basin, the Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay create major indentations into its coastline. The Gulf of Maine (of which the Bay of Fundy is a component) lies off the western shore. The South Shore and Eastern Shore, as well as the southern and eastern parts of Cape Breton Island constitute a pelagic coast, fronting the open Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia has numerous offshore fishing banks which are submerged sections of the continental shelf. Rising sea levels since glaciation have inundated many parts of the coastline, including these areas on the continental shelf, providing rich habitat for marine life, as well as defining other unique features such as various coastal islands, bays, harbours and the Bras d'Or Lake ‚Äì an estuary that defines the central portion of Cape Breton Island. ==Cultural geography== ===History of Nova Scotia=== Replica of Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons's habitation at the Port-Royal National Historic Site. Initially, settlement patterns in Nova Scotia were defined by water transportation routes for the Maritime Archaic Indian civilization, followed by their descendants, the Mi'kmaq Nation, who used coastal waters for seasonal marine fishing and rivers and lakes for freshwater fishing. European discovery resulted in settlements in protected natural harbours and along shorelines where convenient trade routes for sailing ships provided reliable transportation to markets in Europe, New England and the Caribbean. European settlers brought industrial fishing technologies and introduced large-scale forestry to sustain settlement construction and shipbuilding activities. Wars between European military powers, notably Britain and France, resulted in various territorial claims and numerous defence works established along Nova Scotia's coastal settlements and inland trade routes. The largest of these defensive installations was a French military fortified port at Louisbourg Harbour on Cape Breton Island. The fortified military port of Halifax on Halifax Harbour was similarly founded to counter Louisbourg's presence. A French settlement at Port-Royal is currently the second longest continuously occupied European settlement in North America (after St. Augustine, Florida). Originally part of Acadia, the territory fluctuated for several decades through competing claims from Scotland (under Sir William Alexander, who gave the territory the name \\"Nova Scotia\\" in honour of his homeland) and England. France relinquished Acadia in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht. However, the boundaries were not delineated, and Britain only gained control of present-day peninsular Nova Scotia. Britain's colonial capital was established at Annapolis Royal, while France maintained control of Cape Breton Island (which they called √éle Royale). The French territory of Acadia and New France finally fell permanently to Britain at the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763. The colonial capital was transferred from Annapolis Royal to Halifax in 1749 upon the establishment of that community. Under British control, Acadian farming settlements that had been abandoned under the Great Upheaval were populated by decommissioned soldiers and settlers brought from New England. Foreign Protestants were actively recruited to settle Nova Scotia (which at that time included present-day New Brunswick) as the Empire's \\"Fourteenth Colony\\" in America. The presence of the Royal Navy and British Army in the colony largely contributed to stability that saw the colony remain loyal during the American Revolutionary War. In 1784, Britain created the colony of New Brunswick to accommodate United Empire Loyalist refugees from the seceding American colonies. Cape Breton Island was also created as a separate colony, leaving Nova Scotia to its mainland peninsula once again. In 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was permanently folded back into Nova Scotia, resulting in the present-day provincial territory. Transportation networks in the form of canals (the Shubenacadie Canal) and later railways (the Nova Scotia Railway, followed by the Intercolonial Railway, the Dominion Atlantic Railway, the Halifax and Southwestern Railway and the Sydney and Louisburg Railway), contributed to a growing trend toward urbanization in the years leading up to the entry into Confederation in 1867. The settlement was concentrated around major industrial towns and port communities. Motor vehicle usage in the 20th century led to highway development and suburban sprawl around larger centres. ===Economic geography=== Traditionally, Nova Scotia's economy has been defined by natural resources in the primary sector. Resources available for mining include coal, gypsum, iron ore, gold, salt and barite. Offshore deposits of oil and natural gas have begun being exploited. The fishing fleet operates on the continental shelf, especially on the Grand Banks. Years of overfishing have led to setbacks in production. Lobster, scallops, and haddock are currently the biggest catches. Inland, forests yield spruce lumber and the province's industries produce much pulp and paper. In the northwest, dairy farming is an important sector of the economy. The Annapolis Valley and Kings County have orchards. There also are significant grain, hay, fruit, and vegetable crops. The bay lowlands, which were reclaimed by dikes in the 17th century, are very productive for agriculture. The economy has been undergoing a slow transition to a post-industrial service-oriented structure in recent decades. Manufacturing is becoming the largest sector of Nova Scotia's economy. Iron and steel are produced in Sydney. Also, there is food processing (especially of fish), and manufacturing of automobiles, tires, sugar, and construction materials. Halifax is a railroad terminus and a year-round port. There are hydroelectric and tidal power-generating plants. Coast, countryside, and historical sites attract tourists. ==Geography by region== ===Cape Breton Island=== Dominion Coal Company, Cape Breton Island, circa 1900. Cape Breton Island is notable for its mining industry. When explorers and settlers arrived here in the 17th and 18th centuries, they were focused on the coal, which was discovered in rocks and cliffs. Coal was used to heat houses and factories, used by blacksmiths to mold iron, and for the steam engines of trains. Coal was extracted principally in the Sydney‚ÄìGlace Bay area of Cape Breton Island until the mines were closed in 2001. Many mines have shut down as coal becomes a less popular fuel. Despite this, Nova Scotia still gets most of its electricity from coal, most of which is now imported. Some of Cape Breton's mines have been turned into tourist attractions and museums, and retired miners take people on tours of old mines. ===Central and Northern=== Northumberland Strait, between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, is long and approximately wide. The shoreline varies from sandstone and sandy beaches in the west to granite rocky beaches in the east. The strait's fishing industry is currently in a decline, but lobster remains a commonly sought species. The areas north of the Minas Basin contain extensive coal seams, with numerous mines in production since 1758. There have been several disasters resulting in coal miners being injured or killed, the most famous being the Springhill Mining Disaster (1958) and the most recent being the Westray Mine Disaster (1992). The Cobequid Bay, the innermost part of the Bay of Fundy, experiences the world's highest tides, averaging up at Burntcoat Head. Parrsboro's Fundy Geological Museum houses the world's most complete collection of fossils from the Coal Age (approximately 300 million years ago) and the Joggins Fossil Cliffs have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many exceptional finds of dinosaurs and plant life have been found in the cliffs along the Bay of Fundy. Among the longest rivers in Nova Scotia is the Shubenacadie, which runs from the Bay of Fundy into Grand Lake in Enfield. This river is one of few worldwide which experience a tidal bore, a visible rush of seawater twice daily during the incoming tide, caused by the funnel shape of the Bay of Fundy and the high tides which are experienced in the region. Gypsum mining is an industry in central Nova Scotia south of the Minas Basin. The world's largest gypsum mine is located at Milford. Gypsum is a component in drywall production, which is used as a construction material. It can be used as a soil conditioner to improve drainage and fertility of the soil. === Eastern Shore === ====Population==== The area between Dartmouth and Cape Breton is sparsely populated. The decline in the fishing industry has meant an outflow of people to larger urban areas and to other fishing villages in the province. Sheet Harbour & Canso with populations of 885 & 820 respectively, are the largest communities. There are more than 300 communities along the Eastern Shore, which vary in size. ====Tourism==== See main article: Tourism on the Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia) Tourism is becoming an increasingly active industry along the Eastern Shore. There is a Fisherman's Life Museum in Jeddore Oyster Ponds. There is trout fishing & Atlantic salmon serves as a sport in rivers along the coast. At Eastern Passage there is a Fishermen's Village tourist attraction with a few stores. The largest beaches on the Eastern Shore are Lawrencetown Beach, in Lawrencetown, Martinique Beach, near Musquodoboit Harbour & Taylor Head Beach, located in Spry Bay, within the boundaries of Taylor Head Provincial Park. ====Geography/Industry==== There are many, many lakes along the Eastern Shore, the largest of which are Porter's Lake, Lake Charlotte & Tangier Grand Lake. Several major rivers flow into the harbours & coastal indents along the Eastern Shore, including: *The Musquodoboit River, which flows into the Musquodoboit Harbour. *The Tangier River, which flows from Tangier Grand Lake to immediately west of the community of Tangier *West River-Sheet Harbour & East River Sheet Harbour, which flow into the Northwest & Northeast Arms of Sheet Harbour respectively. *The Saint Mary's River flows into the Atlantic Ocean, passing through the community of Sherbrooke. In the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, the forests grow close to the water. A sawmill was constructed in Sheet Harbour around the year 1921, at the head of the Northwest Arm. In 1971, the sawmill was destroyed by Hurricane Beth. It was never rebuilt. ===South Shore=== Lunenburg County's population is about 48,000, of which about 6000 people are Acadian. Many others are related to the first German settlers. It is known for its shipbuilding industry. It is also becoming a tourist destination. The Bluenose was built here - the boat that appears on the Canadian dime. Highliner Foods has a production facility in Lunenburg. Mahone Bay has three churches ‚Äì Trinity United, St. John Lutheran and St. James Anglican ‚Äì which have stood by the head of the harbour for over one hundred years. The word \\"Mahone\\" derives from Mahone, the French word for the private ships that sailed by the shore of the Mahone Bay. Oak Island, also in Mahone, is believed to have treasures buried in it. Peggys Cove is a small community known for its rocky shore and lighthouses, one of which serves as a Canada Post office during the summer. It is also the location of the Swissair Flight 111 memorial and a sculpture by the resident William E. deGarthe which serves as a monument to Nova Scotian fishermen. ===Nova Scotia's provincial berry and flower=== On January 11, 1996, the House of Assembly declared the wild blueberry the Provincial Berry of Nova Scotia. The blueberry mainly grows in northeastern North America. Forests cover all of Nova Scotia. In these woodlands, often nearly hidden with fallen leaves, grows the mayflower, also known as the trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens). In 1901 the mayflower was declared to be the Provincial Flower of Nova Scotia by the provincial legislature. ==Climate== Located on the east coast of Canada, Nova Scotia is almost entirely surrounded by the sea, which heavily influences the climate due to oncoming Atlantic storms. Due to the ocean's moderating effect Nova Scotia has cool summers as opposed to other cities in Canada around the same latitude. Nova Scotia's maritime climate is influenced by the cold air masses passing from the centre of Canada and the warm air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Winters can be very severe, blizzards occur several times each winter. Winters are cold compared with other coastal cities on the same latitude because the direction of the Atlantic currents is going east to Europe. Because it juts out into the Atlantic, Nova Scotia is prone to tropical storms and hurricanes in the summer and autumn. ==See also== *List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories *List of areas disputed by the United States and Canada *Extreme communities of Canada *Canadian Geographic ==References== ==External links== * T2.1 Introduction to the Geological History of Nova Scotia ","title":"Geography of Nova Scotia"},{"id":"7778762","text":"URBNET Records is an independent record label based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

His father was from a Connecticut family, and relocated to New Orleans cotton broker; he later returned to New London and became active in the whaling industry and other business ventures. Brandegee was educated at Union Academy in New London and Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven. In 1845 Brandegee entered Yale University, where he was elected membership to Delta Kappa Epsilon and Skull and Bones. He graduated in 1849, and then began studying at Yale Law School. Brandegee completed his legal studies in the office of Andrew C. Lippitt in 1850, was admitted to the bar in 1851, and began to practice in partnership with Lippitt. Brandegee was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1854. Although a young member of the House, he was selected as a member of the important judiciary committee. He was also chairman of the select committee to manage the \\"bill for the defense of liberty,\\" which was aimed at preventing the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law in Connecticut. Later, Brandegee chaired the committee which oversaw passage of Connecticut's version of the Maine liquor law, which prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages. From 1857 to 1859, Brandegee served as Judge of New London's city court. During this time he became a popular speaker in favor of abolishing slavery, and he delivered speeches at locations throughout Connecticut. In 1860, he was chosen as one of Connecticut's electoral college members, on the Republican ticket headed by former Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin; Abraham Lincoln carried Connecticut, and the electors cast their ballots for Lincoln for president and Hannibal Hamlin for vice president. Brandegee was again elected to the Connecticut House as a Republican in 1858. He was reelected in 1859, but declined the office because of the death of his father. The following year he was elected to the House again, this time being chosen as Speaker of the House. During this first \\"War\\" session of the House, Brandegee managed to keep favor with both Democrats and Republicans. At the end of the year, fellow Bonesman and the leader of the Democrats in the House, Henry C. Deming presented him with a silver service as a token of appreciation for his impartiality. At the start of the Civil War, Brandegee was active in supporting the Union cause. He traveled all over Connecticut addressing meetings, raising troops and arousing public sentiment. ==United States House of Representatives== In 1862 he was elected to Congress from the 3rd district of Connecticut. Although the youngest member of the House, he was selected as a member of the House Committee on Naval Affairs, and later the Military Affairs Committee. Brandegee was also on the Committee on Naval Accounts, and Chairman of a Special Committee on constructing a post office and military route from New York City to Washington, D.C. Respected as an ardent abolitionist as well as a friend of President Abraham Lincoln, he and a fellow Representative, Democrat James E. English of New Haven voted in favor of the momentous 13th Amendment in 1864 that outlawed slavery; Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln erroneously depicts them as two Connecticut Democrats with fictional names voting against the amendment. Also in 1864, Brandegee was a member of the Connecticut delegation to the National Republican Convention in Baltimore, which re-nominated President Lincoln, and nominated Andrew Johnson for the Vice Presidency. Brandegee continued in Congress throughout the Reconstruction Era. In 1866 he attended the National Union Convention at Philadelphia. He did not stand for reelection to Congress in 1866, and his term expired in March 1867. ==Post Civil War== In 1871, Brandegee was nominated for the office of Mayor of New London. He won and served a single two-year term. He was Chairman of the Connecticut delegation to the Republican National Conventions of 1880 and 1884. In 1892 he was a founding partner of Noyes & Brandegee, which was one of the leading law firms in New London. After his service as Mayor his fellow Republicans had tried to convince him to run for Governor or Senator, but Brandegee declined any further elected offices, although he served as Corporation Counsel of New London in 1897 and 1898. Brandegee died in New London on November 10, 1904, and was buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery in New London. ==Legacy== At a special meeting of the superior court on December 31, 1904, Judge George D. Stanton said of Brandegee: ==Family== Augustus Brandegee was the husband of Nancy Christine Bosworth (1840-1881). They were the parents of Augustus (1857-1881), Helen (1858-1915), Frank (1864-1924), and Marian (1866-1884). Brandegee's son Frank also served as a Member of the United States House of Representatives, and was a longtime member of the United States Senate. ==References== ==External resources== *Augustus Brandegee at Find A Grave Category:1828 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Hopkins School alumni Category:Connecticut lawyers Category:American abolitionists Category:Connecticut state court judges Category:Connecticut Republicans Category:Speakers of the Connecticut House of Representatives Category:People of Connecticut in the American Civil War Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut Category:Mayors of New London, Connecticut Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Augustus Brandegee"},{"id":"7778813","text":"Mobley is a surname.

Later Hsao Lung is filming a movie. On the set, he is approached by a group of gangsters, led by a man named George, who want to control Hsao Lung. Hsao Lung declines, so they go after his girlfriend Alice, forcing her poison Hsao. During sex, the poison takes action and Hsao supposedly dies.

It currently holds a 5.4 on IMDb. On Rotten Tomatoes the film currently holds a 33% audience rating with an average rating of 2.9/5. John Wallis of DVD Talk awarded the film a rare zero stars out of five and said: \\"Not only is a bad film for its horrible story, and lack of any action worth noting, it tramples Bruce's name like no other, inserting stock footage of his press conferences, his funeral, newspapers reporting his death, and using Bruce film clips (under a horrible saturated, polarized color effect) as signs that the Bruce-clone daydreams and is inhabited by the spirit of the real Bruce. Unless you are the most die-hard of Bruceploitation fans/completists, its really not worth a second of your life.\\" The Video Vacuum gave the film 2 stars and said: \\"Once Bruce dons the patented yellow and black track suit for the finale, the film briefly comes to life. The scenes where he has to fight level by level like Game of Death are pretty good. Sadly, it‚Äôs too little too late. The best part of the movie though is Bruce‚Äôs sex scene. He gets drugged right before getting it on and while he‚Äôs in the throes of passion, he starts freaking out and convulsing out of control. It‚Äôs pretty hilarious.\\" Jeff Bona of City on Fire gave the film 0 stars and said: \\"As a kid, I remember renting True Game of Death on VHS (Master Arts Video). The DVD version I recently watched (Fortune 5 DVD) has a lot more footage, which includes: Excessive nudity (bush and all), an extended nightclub sequence, and a slightly different opening shot. The VHS version had the same Bruce Lee stock footage, only in different areas. You know what? Who cares about the different versions. They all suck.

Upon completing his University coursework at the insistence of his advisor Long moved to New York to immerse himself in the study of fine art. In NYC, Long became a member of the Art Students League of New York, studying under the guidance of such notable artists as Robert Beverly Hale and Frank Mason.

These works set the stage for several major fresco projects in the U.S. (13 to this day) including a dome and the largest secular fresco in the United States. There have been in depth documentaries produced about two of his frescoes, these include Chapel of the Prodigal (completed with James Daniel, Roger Nelson, and Charles Kapsner) and Shadow into light, both of which were produced by A New Light Productions, Inc. The videos depict the painting of Return of the ProdigalMontreat College (1995- ), and A New Light Productions, Inc. Chapel of the Prodigal: The Painting of the Fresco, the Return of the Prodigal.

In addition to his prolific fresco work, Long has had works in the Royal Academy as well as the Royal Portrait Society (London, UK). He has exhibited in Florence, London, Paris, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and is represented in major collections throughout Europe and the Americas. He has lived and worked in Europe for over thirty years and now divides his time between Europe and the United States. In 2001, Long was awarded the coveted Arthur Ross Award for Excellence in the Classical Tradition (Classical America, New York, New York) by Philippe de Montebello (current and longest- serving Curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Mr. de Montebello has referred to Ben Long as one of the greatest draftsmen of the 20th Century. In 2002, Ben Long received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2005, the Art Renewal Center added Ben Long to its Trademarked list of \\"Living Masters\\".

Abstract: St. Peter's Catholic Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, commissioned artist Ben Long to erect a fresco in the church sanctuary. The fresco was erected on the gabled south wall of the sanctuary. The work of art commenced in 1988 and it was completed in 1989, with assistance of apprentices and consultation of building professionals. In February 2002, the buon fresco partially collapsed from the wall of the sanctuary, which was constructed c. 1893. Coincidentally, the church was surrounded by ongoing construction activity for a large multi-use development, and the collapse reportedly occurred during removal of concrete pavement close to the structure. The church alleged, as did some investigators, that the collapse ensued because of adverse vibrations associated with the construction activity. This paper presents the evaluations of the author, including observations, analysis of vibration activity, and laboratory testing, which revealed the fresco failure commenced prior to surrounding construction because of inherent defects in the fresco installation. * Long, Ben.

He spent the earlier part of his career teaching in the United States of America, but he later settled in Italy, near Florence, and it was there between 1918 and 1936 that he wrote most of his works.Neal W. Klausner. (1967). C. A. Strong: Realist and Panpsychist. The Monist. Vol. 51, No. 2, British and American Realism, 1900-1930. pp. 267-283. ==Early life and studies== Charles Augustus Strong was born in America on 28 November 1862, at Haverhill, Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of Augustus Hopkins Strong. In 1865 his father moved the family to Cleveland, Ohio, where they became acquainted with the family of John D. Rockefeller. Strong received education at the Rochester Theological Seminary, where his father was President. He entered the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire. Strong was a student of Latin and Greek, and edited the school paper. In July 1881 he travelled to Germany, where he studied at the G√ºtersloh Gymnasium. In 1883 he returned to America and entered the University of Rochester, where he received an AB in 1884 and an LLD in 1919. Strong graduated from Harvard in 1885 with a second AB. At Harvard he was influenced by the philosopher and psychologist, William James, and became friends with George Santayana; and together they founded the Harvard Philosophical Club. From 1885 to 1886 he returned to the Rochester Theological Seminary, which was still headed by his father. In 1886 Strong headed to Berlin with George Santayana on a James Walker Fellowship from Harvard. Strong turned away from a career as a clergyman. In Berlin he studied psychology, philosophy, and physiology with professors Carl Stumpf and Friedrich Paulsen. ==Career== On his return to America Strong worked part-time as an instructor in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1889 Strong went to Paris, Freiburg and Berlin. In the same year he married Bessie, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller. In 1890 Strong became a docent at Clark University and in 1892 he was appointed associate professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. Chicago's first psychological laboratories were set up by Strong in 1893. Strong moved on to Columbia University, where he lectured in psychology until 1903 and from 1903 to 1910 was a professor of psychology. In 1903 he authored his first work, Why the Mind Has a Body. In 1906, on the death of his wife, Strong moved with his daughter Margaret to Fiesole near Florence in Italy. Strong died on 23 January 1940 near his Villa Le Balze, Fiesole, Italy. His villa was left to Georgetown University by his daughter, Margaret Rockefeller Strong de Larra√≠n, Marquesa de Cuevas (1897-1985) for the establishment there of the Charles August Strong Center for Scholarship. He was a member of the Century Club of New York. ==Philosophy== In The Origin of Consciousness (1918), Strong advocated a form of panpsychism. The book expanded on William Kingdon Clifford's mind-stuff theory. Philosopher David Skrbina has noted that \\"Strong stands out as one of the more consistent and open advocates of panpsychism in the first part of the century.\\"Skrbina, David. (2005).

Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte, who was King of Holland from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment. Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Once called to serve, recruits typically served 14 or 16 months. During the months of service recruits receive basic training for two and half months and are on active duty for the remainder of the period. Following service, conscripts are placed in reserve. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted. In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Even though it is generally thought that conscription has been abolished in the Netherlands, this perception is, in fact, incorrect. The compulsory attendance was abolished, not the conscription. The laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel still remain in place. In 2018, the law on conscription was changed to also include women. Every citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered, but that they do not have to present themselves for service. In Cura√ßao, active conscription is still in existence.

The vessel was commissioned on 5 March 1946 with Commander Bernard A. Smith in command. ==Pacific duty== Following shakedown, Ozbourn reported for duty with the U.S. Pacific Fleet at San Diego, California in August 1946. She departed San Diego 6 January 1947 with Destroyer Division 171 (DesDiv 171) for the Far East; returned to San Diego in October; began her next deployment 1 October 1948, shortened by a collision with . Although two crew members were killed, damage control parties saved the ship, and she returned to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs. During 1949 and early 1950, Ozbourn trained midshipmen, underwent overhaul and participated in various exercises, one of which was the first guided missile test at sea conducted with . ==Korean War== When hostilities began in Korea, Ozbourn joined Task Force 77 (TF 77). She participated in the Inchon landing, the Blockade of Wonsan and assisted with air operations off the Korean coast, twice receiving the Korean Presidential Citation for her efforts. In February 1951, despite having received two direct hits and several near misses from shore batteries the same day, Ozbourn sent her motor whale boat to rescue a downed pilot floating in a mine field. After returning to San Diego for repairs and overhaul and a brief assignment with TF 95 in the Wonsan area, Ozbourn returned to TF 77 in July 1952. In short order she rescued 18 men who had jumped from to avoid a menacing fire and picked up 3 downed airmen from . During the next two years Ozbourn made regular tours with the 7th Fleet followed by training operations in the San Diego area. ==Training ship== From 1956 to 1964 Ozbourn underwent major overhaul, engaged in intensive training exercises, participated in festivals and celebrations in several west-coast cities and in Australia, and operated periodically with the 7th Fleet. Having undergone Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) Mark I conversion earlier, she joined Task Group (TG 10) for a major Presidential Demonstration. From the flight deck of , President John F. Kennedy watched Ozbourns ASROC launching 6 June 1963. ==Vietnam War== Ozbourn sailed independently for Pearl Harbor 8 July 1964 to join DesDiv 233 and ASW Group 1 for a six-month Western Pacific deployment. From Yokosuka, Japan, ASW Group I sailed for the South China Sea after North Vietnamese PT boats had engaged American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. After providing antisubmarine warfare (ASW) protection for TF 77 and after participating in a naval weapons demonstration, Ozbourn returned to Long Beach. Several months of maintenance, repairs and intermittent local training operations followed; then came another deployment to the Western Pacific 20 August 1965. Attached to TG 77.6, Ozbourn provided gunfire support in the III and IV Corps areas of South Vietnam delivering tons of high explosives in covering fire. Eight crewmen were recommended for decorations during these actions. In July 1966 Ozbourn began a two-year tour of duty with the 7th Fleet as a member of Destroyer Squadron 9. A great part of that time was spent on gunfire assignments supporting troops in South Vietnam and interdicting supply and communications routes in North Vietnam. She received direct hits on 25 March and 4 December 1967 but continued her mission each time. For \\"outstanding actions against the enemy and for excellent combat readiness\\", she received both the Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\". Ozbourn returned to Long Beach 6 September 1968 and remained there, with intermittent movements to Portland and San Diego, for the next year. In September 1969 she deployed again to WestPac, where she operated with the 7th Fleet into 1970. On 13 November 1970 (Friday the 13th) Ozbourn left Long Beach for a six-month operational deployment in the western Pacific to Vietnam. Subic Bay, Philippines, was its deployed base. On 1 January 1971 Ozbourn joined up with the USS Hancock Task Group at Yankee Station in the South China Sea. 11 January Ozbourn transferred from the USS Hancock Task Group to the Task Group. Ozbourn also took on oil from USS Kiwhiswi. The third week of January, USS Ozbourn was in Hong Kong. The fourth week of January, they did repair work in Subic Bay, Philippines. From 1 to 21 February Ozbourn was on the gun-line at the Vietnam Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to provide naval gunfire support. On 21 February it docked briefly to a pier in Da Nang Harbor. The following two days were spent USS Ranger at Yankee Station. From 24 February through 2 March the destroyer patrolled Northern Search & Rescue Station (SAR) with . On 3 March the vessel sailed to Subic Bay for 40-hour upkeep. On 5 March they celebrated Ozbourns 25th anniversary. From 15 through 31 March Ozbourn was deployed at Yankee Station with USS Kitty Hawk. From 1‚Äì11 April, first day Ozbourn tied up at a pier in Da Nang, then Ozbourn steamed to the 2nd and 3rd Mil. Region of the gunline in the south. On 11 April Ozbourn docked briefly to the piers in Da Nang Harbor. From 12 to 23 April Ozbourn was stationed on the gunline at Vietnam DMZ. The ship left on 23 April for Subic Bay. Two days later Ozbourn departed Subic Bay for Long Beach. On 13 May 1971, Ozbourn arrived at Long Beach Naval Station. On 15 June Destroyer Division 92 was decommissioned, and Ozbourn transferred to Destroyer Squadron 19. On 17 June Ozbourn left Long Beach on a midshipman cruise to San Francisco, Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, and Pearl Harbor. The destroyer returned to Long Beach on 4 August. From 20 September through 18 January 1972, Ozbourn left the Mole and entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard dry dock for a four-month shipyard overhaul. On 10 April Ozbourn left for a WestPac deployment to Vietnam. On 9 May 1972, along with several other ships of the US 7th Fleet, she supported minelaying efforts in Haiphong Harbor. This resulted in her being bombarded by the shore batteries of North Vietnam, but there were no direct hits. Sailors on board for this action were subsequently authorized to wear the USN/USMC Combat Action Ribbon. Ozbourn eventually returned stateside on 10 November.

The east wing also extended north to meet the church. This section was known to have been further extended in 1638 by Isabelle Salviati whilst the church was being worked on.arts and culture.google.com The West wing was destroyed in a fire in 1723French Guidebook. 41eab1865628223f29f5a3a8341aeb20.pdf.The joining edge can be seen on the northwest corner of the tower.

Well From the courtyard there is a central gate that leads into a more agriculture courtyard surrounded by barns and outbuildings also containing a large circular dove cote. This has been suggested to have been part of the medieval fortifications that was later converted.

The Salviati family did not build the wings in a heavily Renaissance manner, that was becoming very popular at the time due to their wish to play down their Italian background. The Chateau was listed in 1906, with later listings for the larger environment and sold to the state by Valentine Stapfer in 1933 on the proviso that the building and interiors remain intact.

It was established in 1995 and started with a 3-day broadcast to coincide with the Cinderford Carnival. It broadcast around the whole of the Forest of Dean Area from its main studio in Cinderford. ==History== Initially the station was broadcasting using a Restricted Service Licence. At this time a 28-day licence was the only option and expensive. By 1998 this had changed to enable broadcasting on a daily rate. In the next few years a series of locally based broadcast projects usually 4 days at a time were developed across the Forest of Dean District. In each setting 3 months of training and programme making with people of all ages and abilities would take place to really ground the locality of content and ownership. Small towns hosting their own stations included Lydney, Sedbury, Mitcheldean, Cinderford, Newent and Coleford. This community involvement bubbled toward the opportunity to broadcast across the whole area and become the first ever Community radio station to be awarded a full-time licence in the UK following a couple of years on air as an Ofcom pilot experiment which included 12 other community stations. At this point an independent survey commissioned by Ofcom came up with a FOD Radio listenership of almost 10%, with BBC Local radio at around 8%, this was quite an achievement.(RD 25/10/13) In 2002, Forest of Dean Radio was awarded an Access Radio Licence which allowed the station to broadcast 7 days a week on a fixed Medium Wave frequency. Then in 2005, the station became the first ever fully licensed Community Radio Station in the UK. Shows included the Really popular Sunday afternoon show Fresh Hits with Ryan Davies & Justin, The Verdict, a sports show with Jamie Harris and Tom Jackson, and Phils Acoustic sessions. The station ceased full-time broadcasting on 31 December 2009 The final broadcast included a Christmas Radio Show; organised, written, and performed by the young people of Newent Youth Club. It included a Christmas radio play, interviews and musical performances by the young people. ==References== ==External links== * Forest of Dean Radio Homepage - The website of the Forest of Dean community Radio.

Engraving by V. A. Bobrov from the beginning of the 19th century. Andrey (Andrei) Nikiforovich Voronikhin () (28 October 1759, Novoe Usolye, Perm Oblast ‚Äì 21 February 1814, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian architect and painter. As a representative of classicism he was also one of the founders of the monumental Russian Empire style. Born a serf of the Stroganov family, he is best known for his work on Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Andrey Voronikhin was born in the village of Novoa Usolye (now Perm Krai) to a family who were the serfs of count Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganov, a longtime President of the Imperial Academy of Arts. It is generally believed that he was fathered by Alexander Stroganov. Voronikhin trained in painting in the workshop of Ural icon painter Gabriel Yushkov. The talents of his youth attracted Stroganov's attention, and in 1777 the count sent Voronikhin to study in Moscow. Among his teachers were Vasili Ivanovich Bazhenov and Matvey Fyodorovich Kazakov. After 1779 Voronikhin worked in Saint Petersburg. In 1785, Voronikhin was liberated. From 1786 through 1790 he studied architecture, mechanics and mathematics in France and Switzerland. In 1797, the artist obtained the academic title of ¬´–ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏¬ª from the Academy of Fine Arts for the pictures ¬´–í–∏–¥ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≥–∞–ª–µ—Ä–µ–∏ –≤ –°—Ç—Ä–æ–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–º –¥–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–µ¬ª (1793, Hermitage) and ¬´–í–∏–¥ –°—Ç—Ä–æ–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–∞—á–∏¬ª (1797, Russian museum, Saint Petersburg). From the beginning of the 19th century he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts. The earliest architecture of Voronikhin includes finishing the interiors of Stroganov Palace (1793). The magnificent baroque forms, proposed by Rastrelli, were replaced by Voronikhin with a strict classical order, characterized by simplicity and refinement. Furthermore, he reconstructed the interiors of the Stroganov Dacha on the Black River (1795 - 1796), and also built estates in Gorodnya (1798). The main creation of Voronikhin was Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. The construction began on 27 March 1801, and work was finished in 1811. On the occasion of renovating the temple, Voronikhin was granted a pension and the order of St. Anna of the second degree. A number of other works of Voronikhin were the house of the Department of the Treasury, the building of the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, the colonnade of the Peterhof, and palaces in Strelna, Gatchina and Pavlovsk. The architect died on 5 March 1814 in Saint Petersburg. Voronikhin's nephew, Nikolay Ilyich Voronikhin, was an architect based in Ryazan.

In 1907 he entered the brokerage firm F. S. Butterworth & Co., then moved to Callaway Fish & Co. in 1910. He briefly joined Foster & Adams and became treasurer of the Air Reduction Co. in 1918. He rose through the ranks of the company, eventually becoming chairman in 1937. Adams served on the boards of a number of companies, including the United States Industrial Alcohol Company, Pur Carbonic, Inc., Dry Ice, Inc., the Cuban Air Products Corp. and served as a trustee for Mutual Life. The highest point in his career came when he was made a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During World War II Adams held several positions within the government. In 1940 he consulted the Council of National Defense on industrial materials. He served on the National Defense Mediation Board and headed the iron and steel branch of the War Production Board. His father, Charles Frederick Adams was a bank manager and his daughter, Phyllis Adams was a producer with NBC.

In 1969, Mann won his first NCAA 440 yard hurdles championship with a time of 49.6 seconds. Tying the NCAA and American records, the time was three-tenths of a second off the world record. A year later in Des Moines, Iowa, Mann captured his second NCAA championship and set a new world-record time of 48.8 seconds for the 440 intermediate hurdles. During his collegiate career Ralph was NCAA champion three times. He was a three-time All-American, and in 1970 was second in the voting for the Sullivan Award. He competed in the 400 m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics and won the silver medal. Ralph was a five-time AAU champion. He received the AAU‚Äôs DiBenedetto Award for the single most outstanding career, most notably for his Olympic silver medal. In 2015, he was inducted into the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

The flowers hang in clusters and can also be eaten raw, as can the main part of the plant (altyeye in Arrernte). Some people suck the nectar from the flowers as a source of food, while others use it as a garnish. Bush bananas are cooked in hot earth beside the fire or eaten raw when young (the flavour has been likened to fresh peas or zucchini). The root of the plant is called Merne atnetye and can also be eaten raw or cooked. The very white roots are cooked in the hot earth close to the fire. Young leaves can be used in salads.

In 1870 he purchased two lots on the corner of Main Street and Bannatyne Avenue, the location of the Ashdown retail store for over one hundred years. Ashdown's successful real estate speculation, combined with his business acumen, made him a millionaire by 1910. By 1875, business had expanded into both retail and wholesale operations until in 1881 his worth was over $150,000. He established branch stores in Portage la Prairie and Emerson, Manitoba and employed over seventy-five people and later opened a store in Calgary in 1889. He settled in the then affluent part of Winnipeg known as Point Douglas, along with W. G. Fonseca, Robert & Stewart Mulvey and Dr. Schultz. He was elected to the Winnipeg Board of Trade in 1879 along with president A. G. B. Bannatyne, W,H. Lyon, vice-pres., and D. H. McMillan. He was active in a number of projects in the expansion of the city. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as the main intercontinent mode of transporting goods across country, prompted Ashdown in 1878 to propose that the city offer a bonus of $300,000 toward the construction of a bridge across the Red River from Saint Boniface and to build the desired railway to the western boundary of the province. The Manitoba and South Western Railway co. was created to carry out this proposal and to guarantee that the Dominion Government change the route of the Pacific Railway from Winnipeg westward. In 1897, Winnipeg wholesalers won a major concession, thanks in part to Ashdown's efforts as chairman of the Freight Rates Committee, to introduce a \\"Traders Tariff\\" that ensured that they paid freight charges no greater than those paid by eastern companies. In 1900, Ashdown sent a whole train through the west loaded with 800 tons of building material and general hardware, with each car labelled, \\"Hardware from J.H. Ashdown\\". This spectacular stunt raised the interest of eastern Canadian as well as American companies to the commercial opportunities in Western Canada. In 1904, the J.H. Ashdown store in Winnipeg burned down and was immediately replaced with a new one that was considered to be the finest hardware store in Canada. Not to be outdone, the T. Eaton Co. of Toronto opened its first store in Winnipeg, in July 1905, comprising of floor space and employing eight hundred people. In 1907, Ashdown was elected mayor of Winnipeg and served for two years before being defeated by William Sanford Evans. Winnipeg was hit by a recession in 1907, as an indirect consequence of the Wall Street panic in that year, with construction hardest hit during that period. Ashdown travelled to Montreal, New York and London with hopes of selling bonds in order to pay off large loans from the banks but was unsuccessful. Various developments within the city such as the Louise Bridge construction, a gas plant and a hydro-electric plant at Pointe de Bois would have to be postponed until better times. Throughout the years Ashdown's Warehouse supplied every conceivable kind of merchandise, including its own \\"Diamond A Brand\\" goods. In the 1990s, the warehouse was among the first structure in the Exchange District to undergo conversion to residential use. James H. Ashdown died at his home in Winnipeg on 5 April 1924, but the firm remained a family business until it was sold in 1971. His brother George Ashdown was also a politician, who served as mayor of Morden and in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. ==References== * * ==External links== * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * J.H.

This book introduced Divine Feats, which are still used in version 3.5. This book also contained tips for creating and playing characters of the aforementioned class, as well as several prestige classes. ==Publication history== The book was designed by Rich Redman and James Wyatt, and was published in 2001 by Wizards of the Coast. Cover art was by Brom, with interior art by Dennis Cramer. Although it was not updated to 3.5 Edition, most of the book's prestige classes were reintroduced in the 3.5 supplemental sourcebook Complete Divine. ==Reception== The reviewer from Pyramid found the advice on effectively playing clerics and paladins useful, even if it \\"rarely goes beyond the basics information\\", and found the section on special paladin mounts to be one of the most interesting areas.http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2289 ==See also== *Masters of the Wild *Song and Silence *Sword and Fist *Tome and Blood ==References== ==External links== *Product page at wizards.com Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks Category:Handbooks and manuals ","title":"Defenders of the Faith (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)"},{"id":"7779744","text":"Training Command may refer to: ;Albania *Albanian Training and Doctrine Command ;Australia *Training Command - Army (TC-A), Australian Army, now part of \\"Forces Command\\" *Training Command (RAAF) (1953‚Äì2006), now named \\"Air Force Training Group RAAF\\" ;Bangladesh *Army Training and Doctrine Command ;Canada *Canadian Forces Training Command ;India *Army Training Command *Training Command ;Korea *Republic of Korea Air Force Education and Training Command ;Pakistan *PAF Air Education and Training Command ;Serbia *Serbian Training Command ;Singapore *Training Command (Singapore) ;Sri Lanka *Army Training Command (Sri Lanka) ;UK *RAF Flying Training Command *RAF Personnel and Training Command *RAF Technical Training Command *RAF Training Command ;USA *Air Education and Training Command (since 1993), United States Air Force *Air Training Command (1946‚Äì1993), United States Air Force *Army Air Forces Training Command (1943‚Äì1946), U.S. Army Air Force *Central Flying Training Command *Central Technical Training Command *Eastern Flying Training Command *Eastern Technical Training Command *Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command *Naval Air Training Command *Naval Education and Training Command *Naval Nuclear Power Training Command *Naval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command *Northwest African Training Command *Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois *USAAF Central Technical Training Command *Western Flying Training Command *Western Technical Training Command *108th Training Command (Initial Entry Training) (since 1946), United States Army Reserve ","title":"Training Command"},{"id":"7779757","text":"Ndiss Kaba Badji (born 21 September 1983) is a Senegalese athlete who competes in the long jump and triple jump. He is the Senegalese record holder for triple jump, with 17.07 metres achieved when he won the 2008 African Championships. He has a personal best long jump of 8.32 metres, achieved in October 2009 in Beirut, helping him to win the silver medal at the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie. ==Early career== Badji won a silver medal at the African Junior Championships in 2001. He then competed at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica. Here, he finished ninth in the triple jump. In the long jump competition he exited in the qualification round with a result of 7.37 metres.. Retrieved on 27 January 2009. He missed the final round by only one centimetre. His personal bests at that time were 7.83 metres in the long jump and 16.30 metres in the triple jump, both achieved in Dakar. Later that season he finished fifth at the African Championships in Athletics. He jumped 7.90, albeit with a wind assistance of 3.6 m/s. In 2003 he finished fifth at the Universiade and won the silver medal at the All-Africa Games in Abuja. His distance achieved there--7.92 metres--was a new personal best. ==International career== ===Breakthrough and fall=== In 2004 Badji broke the 8 metre barrier for the first time, jumping 8.00 metres at an indoor meet in February in Moscow. In March he competed at the World Indoor Championships, albeit without reaching the final. However, he capitalized on his 8.00 m result during the outdoor season. He won a silver medal at the African Championships in July, and on 1 August he jumped 8.20 metres at a high altitude in Sestriere. At the Olympic Games three weeks later, however, he failed to reach the final round. Then, in an IAAF out-of-competition test conducted in March 2005, Badji tested positive for the illegal substance androstenedione. As a result, he was barred from competing in the sport between June 2005 and May 2007. ===Return=== Badji returned from his suspension in time for the 2007 season. In June in Algiers he achieved a long jump of 8.11 m. At the All-Africa Games held in the same city one month later he won the triple jump competition, with a new personal best of 16.80 metres. He entered the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, where he finished seventh in the long jump competition. He was the only Senegalese person to reach a final at the 2008 Olympic Games. He was also scheduled to enter in triple jump, but did not actually compete. In 2008 he improved further. At the African Championships only competed in triple jump, but won the gold medal with a new national record of 17.07 metres. At the Olympic Games in August he finished sixth in the long jump competition with a season's best of 8.16 metres. Again he also entered in triple jump, but fouled all his jumps. At the 2008 World Athletics Final he finished seventh in the long jump and eighth in the triple jump. In early 2009 it was announced that Badji had been awarded the Lion d‚ÄôOr by the newspaper Le Soleil. He was also elected Sportsman of the Year by the Senegalese sports press. ==Competition record== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - rowspan=22001 rowspan=2African Junior Championships rowspan=2R√©duit, Mauritius 4th Long jump 7.08 mhttp://www.wjah.co.uk/wojc/AFJC/AFJC2001.html#20082 - bgcolor=silver2nd Triple jump 15.09 m - rowspan=32002 rowspan=2World Junior Championships rowspan=2Kingston, Jamaica 15th (q) Long jump 7.37 m (wind: -1.5 m/s) - 9th Triple jump 15.29 m (wind: +0.3 m/s) - African Championships Rad√®s, Tunisia 5th Long jump 7.90 m - rowspan=22003 All-Africa Games Abuja, Nigeria bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 7.92 m - Afro-Asian Games Hyderabad, India bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 7.86 m - rowspan=32004 World Indoor Championships Budapest, Hungary 22nd (q) Long jump 7.54 m - African Championships Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 7.86 m - Olympic Games Athens, Greece 27th (q) Long jump 7.74 m - rowspan=22005 rowspan=2Islamic Solidarity Games rowspan=2Mecca, Saudi Arabia bgcolor=cc99663rd Long jump 8.02 m - bgcolor=silver 2nd Triple jump 16.34 m - rowspan=32007 World Championships Osaka, Japan 7th Long jump 8.01 m - rowspan=2All-Africa Games rowspan=2Algiers, Algeria 5th Long jump 7.84 m - bgcolor=gold 1st Triple jump 16.80 m - rowspan=32008 African Championships Addis Ababa, Ethiopia bgcolor=gold 1st Triple jump 17.07 m (NR) - rowspan=2Olympic Games rowspan=2Beijing, China 6th Long jump 8.16 m -  ‚Äì Triple jump NM - rowspan=32009 Universiade Belgrade, Serbia bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 8.19 m (w) - World Championships Berlin, Germany 18th (q) Long jump 7.98 m - Jeux de la Francophonie Beirut, Lebanon bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 8.32 m - rowspan=22010 World Indoor Championships Doha, Qatar 6th Long jump 7.86 m - African Championships Nairobi, Kenya bgcolor=silver 2nd Long jump 8.10 m - 2011 All-Africa Games Maputo, Mozambique bgcolor=cc9966 3rd Long jump 7.83 m - rowspan=32012 World Indoor Championships Istanbul, Turkey 5th Long jump 7.97 m - African Championships Porto Novo, Benin bgcolor=gold 1st Long jump 8.04 m - Olympic Games London, United Kingdom 24th (q) Long jump 7.66 m - 2013 World Championships Moscow, Russia 22nd (q) Long jump 7.62 m - 2014 African Championships Marrakech, Morocco 8th Long jump 7.61 m (w) } ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Senegalese male long jumpers Category:Senegalese male triple jumpers Category:Olympic athletes of Senegal Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Senegal Category:Doping cases in athletics Category:Senegalese sportspeople in doping cases Category:African Games gold medalists for Senegal Category:African Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:African Games silver medalists for Senegal Category:African Games bronze medalists for Senegal Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2003 All-Africa Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2007 All- Africa Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2011 All-Africa Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2015 African Games Category:Universiade medalists for Senegal Category:Medalists at the 2009 Summer Universiade ","title":"Ndiss Kaba Badji"},{"id":"7779809","text":"Aechmea fasciata is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.

Prior to turning professional Wright spent four years at the University of Toronto, and also briefly played in the minor American Hockey League before retiring in 1975. ==Amateur career== Born in Toronto, Ontario, Wright was selected 4th overall in the 1966 NHL Amateur Draft by his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs after dominating local Junior B ranks. The following season, he joined the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, where he would play with a host of future NHL stars, including Brad Park, Brian Glennie and Gerry Meehan. In his rookie season, Wright helped lead the Marlboros to the Memorial Cup as Canada's top junior team, scoring 5 points in 9 games in the final tournament. The following season, he emerged as one of the team's top players, registering 64 points in 54 games. However, rather than turn professional at the conclusion of his junior career, Wright chose instead to attend the University of Toronto, where he would pursue a degree in Health and Physical Education. During his time with the Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team, he would establish himself as one of the top players in CIAU history. The team would win 4 consecutive CIAU titles during his time there, with Wright being named playoff MVP in 3 of those years. He was honoured as a CIAU All-Canadian in 1969 and 1972, and captained the squad during his final two seasons. Wright was also a member of the university's golf team, and in 1994 was elected to the University of Toronto Hall of Fame for his athletic achievements during his time there. ==Professional career== Wright had been drafted away from the Maple Leafs by the Vancouver Canucks in 1970, and joined the team in 1972 at the conclusion of his university career. Wright made the team as a rookie, and put together a fine 1972‚Äì73 season, finishing with 10 goals and 37 points in 71 games. This placed him 5th on the team in assists and 8th in scoring, and his 27 assists were at the time the most ever by a rookie Canuck forward. However, Wright would get off to a sluggish start in 1973‚Äì74 with just 6 points in his first 20 games, and was dealt to the St. Louis Blues for Mike Lampman. His offensive struggles would continue in St. Louis, and he finished the season with 6 goals and 15 points in 52 games between Vancouver and St. Louis. The following summer, Wright was selected by the Kansas City Scouts in the 1974 NHL Expansion Draft. However, he would play only 4 games for the Scouts, instead spending almost the entire season with their farm squad in the AHL. Following the season, he chose to retire from professional hockey. Wright finished his career with 16 goals and 52 points, along with 67 PIM, in 127 NHL games. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Often cast as a villain or sore loser, one of his most celebrated bouts was a 1932 match with Jim Londos at a sold-out Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, which Londos won. The audience of 14,500 was the highest attendance for any North American wrestling match that year. ==Background== In 1938, Zaharias met Babe Didrikson, a talented female athlete best known as a golfer, at a charity golf event; the promoter had matched the wrestler, the golfer, and a minister in a threesome as a gag. Zaharias and Didrikson married later that year, and Zaharias quit wrestling in order to manage his wife's career. He promoted wrestlers and ran a cigar store in Denver. As Babe's career soared, he managed a tailoring shop, a women's sports clothier in Beverly Hills, California, and a golf course in Florida, where the couple retired. In 1975, Alex Karras portrayed George Zaharias in the TV movie Babe, (opposite his future wife, actress Susan Clark), which told the story of Didrikson, who won two gold medals in track and field at the 1932 Olympics and returned to become a champion golfer, her battles to be accepted as a woman in a man's sports world, and her fight against cancer. Zaharias also did some part-time acting. The Zahariases had no children and were rebuffed by authorities when they sought to adopt. He died in Tampa, Florida, having outlived Babe by 28 years.

The original plan called for a red roof but the Park Service vetoed this in favor of a green roof which blended in with the natural environment. This is in keeping with the National Park Service Rustic style of architecture. The inn opened on July 1, 1917 and cost between US$90,000 and US$100,000. The lodge is built with exposed cedar logs that provide its structural framework. It includes French doors in 14 bays to \\"allow summer breezes to enter\\" and dormer windows for natural lighting to enter on the second story, \\"augmented by hanging lamps\\". In 1920 a four-story Paradise Annex was added. It was designed by RNPC architect Harlan Thomas and contained 100 rooms (85 with private baths). In 1931 a golf course was designed by Roy H. Dobell and built at the lodge and in 1936 a ski rope tow was installed. In 1942 to 1943 the US Army used the inn to house troops training for winter mountain conditions. The extreme elements took their toll on the inn. In 1952 the Rainier National Park Company sold the inn to the National Park Service who contracted with concessionaires to operate the inn. The Park Service considered demolishing the inn but relented after a public outcry. US$1.75 million was spent in 1979 to strengthen and restore the building. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and ==Architecture== Paradise Inn in 2008 after renovations. The original building is two stories tall. Two rooms, the great hall and the dining room take up most of the ground floor. A three-story section on the building's east side makes the building a T-shape and contains additional guest rooms. The great hall is 50 by 112 feet (15 m by 34 m) and has a wrap-around mezzanine level. There are 4-by-6 foot (1.2 m by 1.8 m) stone fireplaces at both ends of the room. The mezzanine level was added in 1925. The dining room is 51 by 105 feet (15.5 m by 32 m) and has a 50 feet (15 m) high stone fireplace. The original guest rooms are above the dining room and are only 8 by 8 feet (2.4 m by 2.4 m). Each one fits between a set of rafters which support the roof. Hans Fraehnke, a German born carpenter created furniture from local materials for the inn including two 1,500 pound (680 kg) tables, a 14 feet (4 m) tall grandfather clock and a rustic piano which President Harry S. Truman played on during a visit to the inn in 1945. More tables and chairs are from the Old Hickory Company of Indiana. ==Two Year Closure== The inn was closed in 2006 for two years to perform renovations and structural work to allow the inn to withstand a large earthquake. This was done as part of a US$30 million project which also included the groundbreaking for a new visitor center at Paradise. The inn reopened in May 2008. ==Gallery== File:Paradise Inn in Black and White.jpg File:Paradise Inn mezzanine table - Mount Rainier Washington.jpg File:Paradise Inn - Mount Rainier NP Washington.jpg File:Paradise Inn.jpg File:Paradise Lodge, Mount Rainier.jpgParadise Inn at Mount Rainier ==References== ==External links== *Architecture in the Parks: A National Historic Landmark Theme Study: Paradise Inn, by Laura Soulli√®re Harrison, 1986, at National Park Service. *Mount Rainier National Park - Paradise (U.S. National Park Service) - Paradise area of the National Park from the National Park Service. *Historic timeline, narrative and photos of Paradise Inn - at National Park Lodge Architecture Society website. * Paradise Construction Projects  Mount Rainier National Park - Construction at the inn and the Jackson Visitor Center. *Welcome to Mt.

In 1914 the family returned to Frankfurt am Main for a holiday. They were interned on the outbreak of World War I. His father was drowned when the ship in which he was trying to return to South Africa sank. The family went to live in Wales with relatives, the family of Lewis Silkin. Jacobson and his mother subsequently moved to London where he attended Strand School and studied journalism at King's College London. He started out on local newspapers but by 1934 was assistant editor of The Statesman newspaper in Calcutta. On his return to England he became assistant editor of the pocket-sized literary and humour magazine Lilliput (magazine) in October 1937. == Wartime years == During World War II Jacobson served with the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) and rose to the rank of major. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1944 in recognition of his exemplary gallantry. == Journalism == Metal printing plate from the election-issue Daily Mirror of 10 October 1974 After the war he returned to journalism and worked as a feature writer on the pioneering photojournalistic magazine Picture Post under its influential editor Tom Hopkinson.

Accessed January 8, 2008. It comprises the largest contiguous forest in Central Jersey, nearly in area. The highest point is only above sea level, but the way it rises steeply from the surrounding farmland has earned it the title of 'mountain'. The ridge itself sits within a larger area of rough terrain called The Sourlands. ==Toponymy== The reddish brown soil of Sourland Mountain. The origin of the name Sourland is unclear and a few theories exist. It could be derived from the term ‚Äúsorrel-land‚Äù which describes the sorrel (reddish-brown) colored shale-bearing soils encountered by the pioneering German farmers, or German immigrants from the Sauerland region simply anglicized the name of their home region. Another possible source for the name is from 17th century Dutch settlers who referred to the region as \\"sauer landt\\" because the region was clearly not suitable for farming. To this day, the area remains relatively undeveloped - besides being unsuitable for farming, the hard igneous rock, nonporous clay soils, steep slopes and perched wetlands create groundwater conditions which make the area difficult for drilling wells and installing septic systems. ==History== Early farmers had to contend with the mountain's boulder strewn slopes. Before the arrival of Europeans, Sourland Mountain was inhabited by Unami speaking Lenape, in particular the Musconetcongs.Wittwer, Norman C. The Dawn of Hunterdon. County of Hunterdon: History. Accessed May 16, 2009 However, settlements and farms along the mountain seem to have been restricted to river valleys due to the poor, rocky soils upslope. There is evidence indicating the Delaware River likely supported at least one such Lenape settlement at the southern foot of the mountain around present-day Lambertville, New Jersey.Geological Survey of New Jersey ‚Äì Bulletin 6: Annual Administrative Report of the State Geologist for the year 1911. MacCrellish and Quigley, Printers, Trenton, NJ, 1912. See Page 66, Archaeological Survey, Sites in Northern New Jersey. Available via Google Books In the 18th and 19th century, the mountain's many streams were heavily exploited as an energy source for various mills. At the same time, Sourland Mountain became a valuable source of lumber. However, by the time of the Civil War, most of the forests that had previously covered the mountain had been depleted. In place of these forests, farms sprang up along the more easily managed parts of the mountain, and rural villages were formed. Rock quarries and a local pottery industry were also started around this time.Sourland Mountain Planning Council ‚Äì Sourland Mountain. A Brief History. Accessed May 10, 2009. By the end of the 19th century, Sourland Mountain supported a thriving peach farming industry. But a blight just before the start of the new century, as well as a statewide shift to an industrial economy, eventually crippled agriculture on the mountain. Rural villages soon disappeared, and new forests began to grow over abandoned farmland. The only pre-20th century industry that was able to survive into the modern era was rock quarrying ‚Äìthe mountain's trap rock was crushed and used to build railroad beds and roads throughout the region.New Jersey Skylands ‚Äì Sourland Mountain Accessed May 16, 2009. For the first half of the 20th century, Sourland Mountain remained a remote part of New Jersey, with few connections to nearby metropolitan areas. This changed in the 1940s when new road construction made the mountain more accessible, allowing suburbia to begin invading its valleys and slopes. Today the mountain acts as a watershed for surrounding communities, while at the same time providing recreational opportunities to Central New Jersey. ==Geography== Topographic map depicting Sourland Mountain and surrounding area. As a range, Sourland Mountain includes the main ridge and smaller secondary ridges. Near the northern part of the range, Pheasant Hill forms a parallel rise on the east flank of the main ridge. South of Pheasant Hill, a somewhat detached ridge forms Pennington Mountain. This same ridge, which continues to run parallel to the main ridge, is broken in three more places south of Pennington Mountain, forming (from north to south) Mount Canoe, Baldpate Mountain, and Strawberry Hill. A knob in the shallow valley between Strawberry Hill and the southernmost stretch of the main ridge forms Belle Mountain. Goat Hill comprises the highest point of the main ridge before reaching the southernmost end of Sourland Mountain at the Delaware River. Partly adjacent to Sourland Mountain is a sizeable traprock ridge which extends eastward from Pennington Mountain for approximately nine miles, forming (from west to east) Mount Rose, Rocky Hill, and Ten Mile Run Mountain. West of the main ridge, near Flemington, is Prospect Hill, a volcanic remnant lying along the western edge of the Amwell Valley. The hill appears to be geologically linked to Sourland Mountain by a volcanic dike running mostly beneath the surface. ==Geology== local rock that occurred as a result of igneous intrusions. Sourland Mountain was formed 200 million years ago by a plutonic intrusion of a hard igneous rock, diabase, into the Brunswick Shale.Land and Natural Resources of West Amwell , accessed November 9, 2006 The intrusion occurred as tectonic forces created the Newark Basin, a prehistoric rift valley active near the rift which ultimately spread North America and Africa apart. The parallel ridges of the mountain were probably formed by magma seeping up through linear faults created during the rifting process During the early Jurassic the rift which formed the Newark Basin failed, and the intrusion which would eventually become Sourland Mountain ceased growing. Initially, the vast majority of volcanic material remained within the crust. However, the diabase and related hornfels which form the backbone of the mountain are a type of highly erosion resistant stone known as trap rock. Consequently, millions of years of erosion lowered the more easily worked shale surrounding the intrusion, turning it into the elevated ridges which currently comprise Sourland Mountain. The Palisades Sill, in northeastern New Jersey and southeastern New York, was not only formed under similar circumstances to Sourland Mountain, it is at least partly contiguous with it. The ridge forming Mount Rose, Rocky Hill, and Ten Mile Run Mountain, is a continuation of the Palisades which connects to Pennington Mountain. South of Pennington Mountain the Palisades sill and Sourland Mountain's eastern ridge are essentially the same feature. Like the Palisades, Sourland Mountain exhibits volcanic dikes which extend away from the main ridge. One such dike extending northwest from Sourland Mountain has been determined to be responsible for the creation of Prospect Hill, an extrusive basalt peak near Flemington, New Jersey.Hunterdon County: County Profile ‚Äì Natural Resources. Available online. Prospect Hill marks the only known location where Sourland Mountain's magma actually erupted to the surface. In this respect, it is similar to Snake Hill, which it most likely a volcanic plug linked to the Palisades. One of the key differences between Sourland Mountain and the other volcanic mountains of the Newark Basin, including the Watchungs and the Palisades, is that it has not been touched by glaciers. This has left the mountain with a mantle of Triassic argillite, which covers much of the underlying trap rock and comprises the bulk of Pheasant Hill.Stanford, Scott D. et al. Earthquake Loss Estimation Study for Somerset County, NJ: Geologic Component. New Jersey Geological Survey, March 2008. The impermeability of argillite is primarily to blame for Sourland Mountain's extremely poor aquifer.Houghton, Hugh F. Hydrogeologic Study of Water-Well Failures in Argillite Bedrock of Sourland Mountain, Somerset County, New Jersey, in 1982. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Water Resources, Geology Survey, 1988. ==Wildlife== Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) in the Sourland Mountain Range Sourland Mountain is in the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion It is an environmentally sensitive area and is home to several rare and threatened plants and animals, including: trout lilies, wood anemones, ginseng, spotted salamander, pileated woodpecker, bobcat, wood turtle, barred owl, bobolink, Cooper's hawk, grasshopper sparrow, Savannah sparrow, upland sandpiper, and the scarlet tanager. The Sourlands serve as a stopover area for migratory birds that travel between South and Central America and the Arctic as well as forest birds migrating between Washington, D.C., and Boston. The area also supports a large population of deep-woods birds such as scarlet tanagers and barred owls. Being the largest contiguous forest between the Pine Barrens and the New Jersey Highlands, it is critical to the survival of neotropical migrant birds and other rare species of plants and animals. D&R; Greenway Land Trust's partner in Mexico, Amigos de Calakmul, protects bird habitat at the southern end of the migratory flyway.D&R; Greenway Land Trust: Partners and Links , accessed November 9, 2006 ==Recreation== Small parks and access points make the mountain popular for hiking, mountain biking, hunting, and bird watching. Rock climbing is permitted in certain parks such as Sourland Mountain Preserve in Somerset County, but not in others such as Sourland Mountain Nature Preserve in Hunterdon County. The largest park is the Sourland Mountain Preserve in Somerset County. Nearby is the Sourland Mountain Nature Preserve,Hunterdon County: Sourland Mountain Nature Preserve , accessed November 9, 2006 located in Hunterdon County. ==Notable inhabitants== Notable residents of the Mountain include: playwrights Eugene O'Neill, aviator Charles Lindbergh, patriot John Hart (signer of the Declaration of Independence), the painter George Bellows, and freed slave and tavern owner Sylvia Dubois. In March 1932, the mountain was the scene of the notorious kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby. The Lindberghs had chosen the mountain for their new home precisely because of its isolation and inaccessibility. ==References== ==External links== * The Sourland Planning Council * Sourland Mountain Preserve page at Somerset County Parks * Sourland Mountain Special Resource Area Designation * NY-NJTC: Sourland Mountain Preserve Trail Details and Info * Sourlands A documentary film released June 2012.

One of her distinguishing features was that her funnels were square-shaped. She was built to carry 1,045 civilian passengers in first, second, third, and steerage class. She was converted to an armed merchant cruiser when France entered World War II, until demilitarized following the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne on 22 June 1940. Aramis was seized by Japan in 1942, renamed , and served as a repatriation ship in 1943. She served as a transport between Singapore and Japan in 1944 until sunk in the battle for convoy Hi-71 while assigned to the defense of the Philippines. ==French service== Aramis departed Marseille on 21 October 1932 for her maiden voyage with the French Line Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. Ports of call included Marseilles, Port Said, Djibouti, Colombo, Penang, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe. As World War II hostilities opened, Aramis began conversion to an armed merchant cruiser on 4 September 1939 at Saigon. Conversion to croiseur auxilliaire X-1 was completed at Hong Kong on 1 March 1940. X-1 patrolled the South China Sea until demilitarized at Saigon on 1 November 1940. Aramis then served as a dockside barracks at Saigon until seized by Japan on 12 April 1942. ==Japanese service== Aramis was renamed Teia Maru in June 1942 and sent to Japan carrying 569 prisoners of war (POWs) and 4,697 tons of cargo. Yard overhaul for naval service by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at Yokohama was completed on 20 November 1942. On 14 September 1943 Teia Maru departed Yokohama on the second Japanese-American exchange voyage carrying 80 American repatriates from Japan. Approximately 975 repatriates boarded at Shanghai on 19 September, 24 boarded at Hong Kong on 23 September, 130 boarded at San Fernando, Philippines on 26 September, 27 boarded at Saigon on 30 September, and others boarded at Singapore on 5 October. Teia Maru arrived at Mormugao, Goa on 15 October 1943 carrying 1,525 priests, nuns, Protestant missionaries, and businessmen with their families who had been stranded in areas captured by Japan. On 19 October 1,340 Japanese officials and businessmen with their families arriving aboard the Swedish-flagged MS Gripsholm were exchanged for 1,270 Americans, 120 Canadians, and 15 Chileans, as well as Britons, Panamanians, Spanish, Portuguese, Cubans, Argentines, and nationals from other Central and South American countries. Teia Maru departed from Mormugao on 21 October and returned the repatriated Japanese to Yokohama on 14 November. Teia Maru traveled to Singapore with convoy Hi-41 in February 1944, and returned to Japan with convoy Hi-48 in March. She again traveled to Singapore with convoy Hi-63 in May 1944, and returned to Japan in June carrying about 1,000 Australian, British, Dutch, and other prisoners of war (POWs) who had worked on the Burma Railway.

It is set in the Noon Universe following The Land of Crimson Clouds and \\"Destination Amalthea\\", hundreds of years before the other Noon novels. This is the Strugatsky brothers' final hard-SF novel, and it gives reasons why they decided to move into social science fiction instead. ==Plot summary== The novel's main character is Yuri Borodin, a young space welder. His mother was sick and Yuri missed the spaceship that was to transport him to his new work site. He gets a ride to his destination on a ship piloted by some of the characters of The Land of Crimson Clouds. When the novel starts Yurkovsky and Bykov senior say goodbye to Grisha Bykov - Bykov's son - and Dauge and leave on a mission from international spaceport Mirza-Charle. Meanwhile, Yuri Borodin is also in the spaceport, trying to find a ride. Spaceport authorities direct him to the port director, but he is currently out of town. Disappointed Yuri wanders into a Capitalist-run bar, where the owner-cum-bartender is engaged in an ideological debate with a Russian Communist. Yuri befriends the Russian, Ivan Zhilin, and tells him of his problems. Ivan suggests Yuri to go to the spaceport hotel in the evening, and try to convince the astronauts who stay there to take him along. Yuri does so and meets Bykov and Yurkovsky. Yurkovsky, currently serves as a Chief Inspector. He plans to make a tour of several planets and planetoids. Bykov is piloting his ship. They agree to give Yuri a ride. Their first stop is Mars. The Earth (mostly Russian) colonists there are battling an alien life form the giant slug (the Flying Martian Leech aka sora-tobu hiru). As the colonists are planning a large-scale slug hunt, they realize that some of the buildings in the area are not human-made. Since the buildings look so much like the simple prefabricated structures set up by the colonists, everyone just assumed they were left there by previous expeditions. Some colonists lament the lack of initiative that has descended over the colony in recent years, and Yurkovsky agrees. The raid on slugs, carried out in part using the weapons brought by Yurkovsky, is reasonably successful, and the colonists cheer up. On the way to research station Eunomia, the spaceship crew runs an emergency drill, and Yuri, while stressed and confused, holds up to the pressure. The station was orbiting the Sun with parameters of 15 Eunomia, a very large asteroid which nearly completely disappeared after a few years of research. Yurkovsky and Yuri witness a scheduled experiment on propagation of gravitational waves that are created by annihilating a chunk of the asteroid the size of Everest. A lot of physicists want to work on Eunomia due to the unique research opportunities that it provides. The station is severely overcrowded but the scientists gladly put up with the inconveniences such as food shortages or having to sleep in an elevator. Yurkovsky disapproves, but gives a part of his own food supply to the hungry physicists. He says that such scientists should be a role model for Yuri. Planetoid Bamberga has deposits of precious space pearls. Capitalists run a mine on Bamberga. In the drive to maximize profits the miners work more than six-hours a day despite health risks due to high levels of radiation in the mine. This causes illness and premature death. The local safety-inspector, a Hungarian Communist, protests. But he is ignored and harassed. After his arrival, Yurkovsky arrests the mine's director on multiple offences including smuggling liquor and prostitutes with their possible subsequent killing. He tells the workers to elect a replacement, reminding them that the mining license is given only temporarily and may be revoked at any time. The miners emphatically protest. Despaired, Yurkovsky leaves the meeting with the miners. However, one of the miners returns the string of space pearls that Yurkovsky accidentally left behind. The returned pearls are worth a large sum of money and Yurkovsky thinks that there is still hope for the miners. Back on the spaceship, Yuri and Zhilin watch an action film about the heroes of space exploration, and the young Yuri becomes excited. Zhilin explains the movie oversimplifies the picture and the life is much more complicated and a lot less glamorous than how it is portrayed. He alludes to the events in The Land of Crimson Clouds. The next stop of the tour is Diona space observatory; the researchers there produce valuable scientific contributions. However, personal relationships deteriorate. Yuri gets into a fight with one of the young researchers. It turns out that two of the senior scientists were spreading rumors about the others to further their scientific careers. Yurkovsky orders them back to Earth and even suggests one of them to kill himself. He says that these two men managed to deceive the rest of the crew so successfully because many people in Communist society are not accustomed to others blatantly lying to them, and they are too proud to try to figure out the truth for themselves. Yurkovsky spaceship approaches Saturn and stops at Ring One space station. From there, Yuri is supposed to go to Ring Two: his worksite. Yurkovsky is getting too old for space travel. In all likelihood, this trip is the last of his space flights. He did a lot of research on the rings of Saturn and now he wants to see them close. The same is true for his navigator: Krutikov. Yurkovsky and Krutikov take a rocket to fly near the rings. As they approach the rings, Yurkovsky notices an unusual (and seemingly artificial) rock formation, and urges Krutikov to fly closer, despite the danger of a meteorite collision. Bykov orders them, over the radio, to stop. Yet, anxious to find out more about the discovery, Yurkovsky attacks Krutikov and breaks the radio. Krutikov yields and descends to the rock formation. Bykov is speeding toward them on a spaceship that is supposed to leave for Ring Two space station. Yuri is on board. The rocket of Yurkovsky and Krutikov gets hit with a meteorite and they die. Yuri is injured and hospitalized. He ponders how people will think of the new discovery as very important, but they will not remember the people who made it; he wishes that no discovery were made and the two people were still alive. Bykov and Zhilin return to Earth and meet a sick Dauge. He tells Bykov that a new expedition to planet Transpluton, also known as Cerberus, is planned, and he is offered to lead it. Bykov agrees apathetically.

Barnhart is suffering a drought exacerbated by the copious consumption of groundwater used in the hydraulic fracking process of petroleum extraction. Numerous oil rigs are located in the area. ==History== Barnhart was founded by Willam A. Barnhart in 1910, when the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway was constructed throughout West Texas, passing through the area. A post office opened in Barnhart in 1912, and a school operated in the community from 1912 to 1969. By 1920 the town had the Barnhart State Bank, which was moved to another town in 1927, and a newspaper, the Barnhart Range, published by Ed Downing. The population was estimated around 50 in 1915. In the 1920s and 30s, Barnhart became a large-volume shipping point, due to its location between major railroad lines. Barnhart was described as \\"dusty, bawling cattle, hell- raising cowboys and trains a half-mile long\\", in the 1920's and 30's. Barnhart had everything the cowboys and railroaders needed: A hotel, cafe, a bank and a theater. Because of the remoteness of West Texas, traditional cattle drives continued to Barnhart, long after the practice was popular. The amount of cattle coming through began to cause problems for the local ranchers. To protect the pastures from over-grazing, ranchers began to put up more fencing. This ended what may have been the beginning of the end to cattle drives in Texas. To get around the issue, the Ozona-Barnhart Trap Company was formed in 1924. A long, narrow path of leased/purchased land stretching 34 miles, from south of Ozona to Barnhart, became Texas‚Äô last major cattle trail. In April of 1934, Barnhart's former postmaster pled guilty in federal court to ‚Äúconversion of funds.‚Äù Barnhart, which is out in the middle of the Texas plains, naturally lacked law enforcement at that time. During the depression, the federal government began buying up the cattle, and having them killed to reduce supply, hoping to revive a market that had practically died.http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasTowns/Barnhart-Texas.htm ==Climate== According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Barnhart has a semi- arid climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Barnhart, Texas ==Highways== * * ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Irion County, Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:San Angelo, Texas metropolitan area Category:Populated places established in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Texas ","title":"Barnhart, Texas"},{"id":"7780483","text":"An uncollected story written by J.

A monk named Xing Hai in the Ting Song temple on Mount Hui in Wuxi asked a travelling bamboo artisan to make him a stove on which he could boil water for tea. Surprisingly, it included bamboo to form the frame of the stove. The sides were cemented with clay and the inside walls and the ring on top were iron. It was about a foot tall, with a cylindrical top and square bottom, similar in shape to the Qian Kun (Heaven-Earth) mythological pot or a cong. There are several paintings including a bamboo stove, amongst which are The Bamboo Stove by T'ang Yin (1470-1524) and the later Tasting Tea made from Spring Water by Chin T'ing-piao (latter half of the 18th century). Poems praising the stove were written and these were mounted on a scroll known as \\"The Bamboo Stove Painting Scroll\\". A society called the Blue Mountain Poetry Society was founded in the late 15th century. They built a meeting hall and garden at the foot of Mt Hui and found the stove which had been lost and returned it to the temple. Early in the 17th century the stove was lost again and the temple also burned down. The scroll was found again during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722) and a poet from Wuxi called Gu Zhenguan had two copies of the stove made. He took these and the scrolls to Mount Hui where a new Ting Song temple was built. The original stove was also found again at a farmer's house by a monk and returned to Wuxi. In 1751 the Qianlong Emperor visited the temple because of the fame of the bamboo stove. He wrote about it and the Second Spring Under Heaven (or Er'Quan (Second Spring) for short), whose water was famous for making wonderful tea. The emperor wrote four poems about the stove and visited it again six years later. This time he wrote two more poems and named its room \\"The Bamboo Stove Mountain Chamber\\". He then had a copy of the stove made and constructed a Bamboo Stove Mountain Chamber in the Western Hills. The emperor made more visits to the temple in later years and wrote more poems about the stove.

It was contested between Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers. Spurs were the holders of the cup, and were hot favourites, while unfancied QPR had just missed out on promotion from the Second Division. After three and a half hours of football, Spurs ran out eventual winners, 1‚Äì0 in the replay. It would be the last final involving a team from outside the top flight for 10 years. Tottenham's victory meant that they had then won the FA Cup seven times ‚Äì matching the record set by Aston Villa 25 years earlier. It also preserved their unbeaten record in FA Cup finals. Tottenham's Argentinian player Ricky Villa decided not to play in the final because of the ongoing Falklands War. ==Road to Wembley== { width=50% valign=top ===Tottenham Hotspur=== Home teams listed first.

QPR's young goalkeeper Peter Hucker was certainly the busier keeper although Spurs were mainly being kept to long range efforts. Hucker's performance in the first match would ultimately earn him the Man of the Match award. QPR were not outclassed however, although their attacking options were hindered when prolific striker Clive Allen, who had scored the winner in the semi-final, was injured early in the game and was a peripheral figure thereafter. He was replaced by Gary Micklewhite five minutes into the second half. Ninety minutes came and went with the score 0‚Äì0. With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Glenn Hoddle found himself just outside the QPR penalty box. His shot took a deflection (off Tony Currie) and found the right-hand corner of Hucker's goal. Not to be outdone, five minutes later Simon Stainrod took a long throw ten yards from the Spurs goal line. Rangers' burly centre-back Bob Hazell, flicked the ball on at the near post and Terry Fenwick headed the ball past Spurs keeper Ray Clemence at point-blank range, making the final score 1‚Äì1. ==Replay== The replay took place at Wembley five days later. Clive Allen had not recovered from his injury and his replacement on the Saturday, Gary Micklewhite, started the game. Early in the game after only six minutes had elapsed, the Spurs midfielder Graham Roberts broke through into the Rangers penalty area. Rangers' captain on the evening, Tony Currie (regular captain Glenn Roeder was suspended), made a lunge to get the ball but only succeeded in bringing Roberts down. It was a clear penalty. Glenn Hoddle coolly slotted the penalty away sending Peter Hucker the wrong way. QPR soon managed to get into the game though and before long had the ball in the net by Micklewhite, but the goal was disallowed for an offside against Stainrod. It was fair to say that for much of the rest of the game they were the better side, taking the game to their more highly fancied opponents. The only thing they could not manage to do was score. The closest they came was in the second half when John Gregory received a raking long pass from the left wing from Simon Stainrod and spotted Spurs keeper Ray Clemence slightly off his line. Gregory's audacious volleyed chip from just inside the box however, agonisingly hit the crossbar and bounced to safety. Steve Archibald hit the post late on for Spurs but Hoddle's early penalty remained the only goal, and Spurs retained the trophy just as they had done in 1962. Spurs became the only team to win three FA Cup Final replays, as well as the only team to win FA Cup Final replays in successive years. ==Match details== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Ray Clemence - LB 2  Chris Hughton - CB 3  Paul Miller - CB 4  Paul Price - RM 5  Micky Hazard - RB 6  Steve Perryman (c) - CM 7  Graham Roberts - CF 8  Steve Archibald - LM 9  Tony Galvin - CM 10 Glenn Hoddle - CF 11 Garth Crooks - colspan=4Substitute: - MF 12 Garry Brooke - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Keith Burkinshaw } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font- size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Peter Hucker - RB 2  Terry Fenwick - LB 3  Ian Gillard - CM 4  Gary Waddock - CB 5  Bob Hazell - CB 6  Glenn Roeder (c) - LM 7  Tony Currie - CM 8  Mike Flanagan - CF 9  Clive Allen - CF 10 Simon Stainrod - RM 11 John Gregory - colspan=4Substitute: - MF 12 Gary Micklewhite - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Terry Venables } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. *One substitute. } ==Replay== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Ray Clemence - LB 2  Chris Hughton - CB 3  Paul Miller - CB 4  Paul Price - RM 5  Micky Hazard - RB 6  Steve Perryman (c) - CM 7  Graham Roberts - CF 8  Steve Archibald - LM 9  Tony Galvin - CM 10 Glenn Hoddle - CF 11 Garth Crooks - colspan=4Substitute: - CM 12 Garry Brooke - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Keith Burkinshaw } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font- size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Peter Hucker - CB 2  Terry Fenwick - LB 3  Ian Gillard - CM 4  Gary Waddock - CB 5  Bob Hazell - RB 6  Warren Neill - CM 7  Tony Currie (c) - LM 8  Mike Flanagan - CF 9  Gary Micklewhite - CF 10 Simon Stainrod - RM 11 John Gregory - colspan=4Substitute: - MF 12 Steve Burke - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Terry Venables } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *One substitute. } ==Cup final song== The Tottenham Hotspur squad recorded a cup final song for the 1982 final ‚Äì \\"Tottenham Tottenham\\". ==References== ==External links== *Match report at fa-cupfinals.co.uk * 1981‚Äì82 F.A Cup Results at soccerbase.com * 1982 Cup Final at sportingchronicle.com Final Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final 1982 FA Cup Final 1982 FA Cup Final FA Cup Final ","title":"1982 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"7780529","text":"Miguel Augusto Riffo Garay (born 21 June 1981) is a Chilean retired footballer and current manager of Deportes Iquique. ==Club career== Product of Colo-Colo youth ranks, he won eight titles in his career with that club, being his most successful moment with the coach Claudio Borghi, when he also was named during the 2007 season at the Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n Best Eleven.

(1977) The Face of the Tiger. Rivington Books and Andr√© Deutsch, London. Such a tiger has the black stripes typical of the Bengal tiger, but carries a white or near-white coat. == Variation == A tiger at the Madrid Zoo The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur. The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2‚Äì3 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of and can grow up to in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger‚Äôs stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible. For a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births. Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (Panthera tigris tigris) as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies. Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos. == Stripeless tigers == A tiger with almost no stripes at The Mirage in Las Vegas, the United States of America An additional genetic condition can result in near-complete absence of stripes, making the tiger almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as \\"A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light.\\" Naturalist Richard Lydekker said that, \\"a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820.\\" Hamilton Smith said, \\"A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.\\", and John George Wood stated that, \\"a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights.\\" Edwin Henry Landseer also drew this tigress in 1824. The modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother‚Äìsister matings of Bhim and Sumita at Cincinnati Zoo. The gene involved may have come from a Siberian tiger, their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the Czech Republic (Liberec), Spain and Mexico. Stage magicians Siegfried & Roy were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from Cincinnati Zoo (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar- Kabul) and Guadalajara, Mexico (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo. In 2004, a blue-eyed, stripeless white tiger was born in a wildlife refuge in Alicante, Spain. Its parents are normal orange Bengals. The cub was named \\"Artico\\" (\\"Arctic\\"). == Genetics == (video) A tiger in a zoo in Japan melanistic white tiger A white tiger's pale coloration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pheomelanin pigments that normally produce the orange coloration. This had long been thought to be due to a mutation in the gene for the tyrosinase enzyme. A knockout mutation in this gene results in albinism, the ability to make neither pheomelanin (red and yellow pigments) nor eumelanin (black and brown pigments), while a less severe mutation in the same gene in other mammals results in selective loss of pheomelanin, the so-called Chinchilla trait. The white phenotype in tigers had been attributed to such a Chinchilla mutation in tyrosinase, and in the past white tigers were sometimes referred to as 'partial albinos'. However, whole genome sequencing of normal and white tigers demonstrated instead that a naturally-occurring point mutation in the SLC45A2 gene is responsible. The resultant single amino acid substitution introduces an alanine residue that protrudes into the transport protein's central passageway, apparently blocking it, and by a mechanism yet to be determined this prevents pheomelanin expression in the fur. Mutations in the same gene are known to underlie the cream coloration of horses, and play a role in the paler skin of humans of European descent. This is a recessive trait, meaning that it is only seen in individuals that are homozygous for this mutation, but that white tigers can be bred from any colored Bengal tiger pair each possessing the unique mutation. Inbreeding promotes recessive traits and has been used as a strategy to produce white tigers in captivity, but this has also resulted in a range of other genetic defects. The stripe color varies due to the influence and interaction of other genes. Another genetic characteristic makes the stripes of the tiger very pale; white tigers of this type are called snow-white or \\"pure white\\". White tigers, Siamese cats, and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to temperature, causing them to grow darker in the cold. A white tiger named Mohini was whiter than her relatives in the Bristol Zoo, who showed more cream tones. This may have been because she spent less time outdoors in the winter. Kailash Sankhala observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa State, even when they were born in New Delhi and returned there. \\"In spite of living in a dusty courtyard, they were always snow white.\\" A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced pigmentation in white tigers. === Defects === Outside of India, inbred white tigers have been prone to crossed eyes, a condition known as strabismus, due to incorrectly routed visual pathways in the brains of white tigers. When stressed or confused, all white tigers cross their eyes. Strabismus is associated with white tigers of mixed Bengal x Siberian ancestry. The only pure-Bengal white tiger reported to be cross-eyed was Mohini's daughter Rewati. Strabismus is directly linked to the white gene and is not a separate consequence of inbreeding. A deformed tiger The orange litter-mates of white tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.Gorham, Mary Ellen, DVM. Genetic defects do little to mar beauty of India's rare white tigers. March 1986 Other genetic problems include shortened tendons of the forelegs, club foot, kidney problems, arched or crooked backbone and twisted neck. Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by \\"tiger man\\" Kailash Sankhala in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to inbreeding depression. A condition known as \\"star-gazing\\" (the head and neck are raised almost straight up, as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars), which is associated with inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers. There was a male cross-eyed white tiger at the Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo in Hawaii, which was donated to the zoo by Las Vegas magician Dirk Arthur. There is a picture of a white tiger which appears to be cross-eyed on just one side in the book Siegfried and Roy: Mastering the Impossible. A white tiger, named Scarlett O'Hara, who was Tony's sister, was cross-eyed only on the right side. A male tiger named 'Cheytan', a son of Bhim and Sumita who was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, died at the San Antonio Zoo in 1992, from anaesthesia complications during root canal therapy. It appears that white tigers also react strangely to anaesthesia. The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744, but a few tigers, white ones in particular, undergo a re-sedation effect 24‚Äì36 hours later.Bush, Mitchell; Phillips, Lindsay G.; & Montali, Richard J. (1987) \\"Clinical Management of Captive Tigers\\", p. 186 in Ronald Lewis Tilson, Ulysses S. Seal (eds.) Tigers Of The World, Biopolitics, Management, and Conservation of an Endangered Species, Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, New Jersey, USA, . This is due to their inability to produce normal tyrosinase, a trait they share with albinos, according to zoo veterinarian David Taylor. He treated a pair of white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo at Fritz Wurm's safari park in Stukenbrock, Germany, for salmonella poisoning, which reacted strangely to the anaesthesia. Mohini was checked for Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome in 1960, but the results were inconclusive.Maruska, Edward J. (1987) \\"White Tiger Phantom Or Freak?\\", Chapter 33, Part IV White Tiger Politics, in Ronald Lewis Tilson, Ulysses S. Seal (eds.) Tigers Of The World, Biopolitics, Management, and Conservation of an Endangered Species, Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, New Jersey, USA, . This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery. Also, in the event of an injury, the blood is slow to coagulate. This condition has been observed in domestic cats, but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white tiger having central retinal degeneration, reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo, which could be related to reduced pigmentation in the eye. The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo. There is a myth that white tigers have an 80% infant mortality rate. However, the infant mortality rate for white tigers is no higher than it is for normal orange tigers bred in captivity. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska said: \\"We have not experienced premature death among our white tigers. Forty-two animals born in our collection are still alive. Mohan, a large white tiger, died just short of his 20th birthday, an enviable age for a male of any subspecies, since most males live shorter captive lives. Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions...in 52 births we had four stillbirths, one of which was an unexplained loss. We lost two additional cubs from viral pneumonia, which is not excessive. Without data from non-inbred tiger lines, it is difficult to determine whether this number is high or low with any degree of accuracy.\\" Ed Maruska also addressed the issue of deformities: \\"Other than a case of hip dysplasia that occurred in a male white tiger, we have not encountered any other body deformities or any physiological or neurological disorders. Some of these reported maladies in mutant tigers in other collections may be a direct result of inbreeding or improper rearing management of tigers generally.\\" == Inbreeding and outcrossing == A captive tiger in Birmingham, the United Kingdom A captive tiger in Yerevan Zoo, Armenia Because of the extreme rarity of the white tiger allele in the wild, the breeding pool was limited to the small number of white tigers in captivity. According to Kailash Sankhala, the last white tiger ever seen in the wild was shot in 1958. Today there is a large number of white tigers in captivity. A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers. A man named Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he sold to Marwell Zoo in England developed white spots, and bred them accordingly. The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa Bay had four of these white Amur tigers, descended from Robert Baudy's stock. It has also been possible to expand the white-gene pool by outcrossing white tigers with unrelated orange tigers and then using the cubs to produce more white tigers. The white tigers Ranjit, Bharat, Priya and Bhim were all outcrossed, in some instances to more than one tiger. Bharat was bred to an unrelated orange tiger named Jack from the San Francisco Zoo and had an orange daughter named Kanchana. Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from Knoxville Zoo, and Ranjit was bred to this tiger's sister, also from Knoxville Zoo. Bhim fathered several litters with an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi at the Cincinnati Zoo. ankam Ranjeeth had several mates at the Omaha Zoo. The last descendants of Bristol Zoo's white tigers were a group of orange tigers from outcrosses which were bought by a Pakistani senator and shipped to Pakistan. Rajiv, Pretoria Zoo's white tiger, who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo, was also outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo. Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain. The New Delhi Zoo loaned out white tigers to some of India's better zoos for outcrossing, and the government had to impose a whip to force zoos to return either the white tigers or their orange offspring. A Bengal tiger at the Cincinnati Zoo Siegfried & Roy performed at least one outcross. In the mid-1980s they offered to work with the Indian government in the creation of a healthier strain of white tigers. The Indian government reportedly considered the offer; however, India had a moratorium on breeding white tigers after cubs were born at New Delhi Zoo with arched backs and clubbed feet, necessitating euthanasia. Siegfried & Roy have bred white tigers in collaboration with the Nashville Zoo. Because of the inbreeding and resulting genetic defects the Association of Zoos and Aquariums barred member zoos from breeding white tigers, white lions and king cheetahs in a white paper adopted by the board of directors in July 2011. The first person to speak out against the displaying of white tigers was William G. Conway, General Director of the New York Zoological Society, which later became known as the Wildlife Conservation Society when he said, \\"White tigers are freaks. It's not the role of a zoo to show two headed calves and white tigers.\\" He warned AZA in 1983 of the harm to the zoo's credibility in catering to the public's fascination with freaks, but went unheeded until 2008 when AZA issued a request to their members to stop breeding white tigers and then later in July 2011 when the AZA formally adopted that stance as policy. Conway was attacked by Ed Maruska of the Cincinnati Zoo for his observation, but in the end Conway's belief was validated. == In popular culture == A white tiger in Tobu Zoo A White tiger in Liberec Zoo White tigers appear frequently in literature, video games, television, and comic books. Such examples include the Swedish rock band Kent, which featured a white tiger on the cover of their best-selling album Vapen & ammunition in 2002. This was a tribute to the band's home town Eskilstuna, as the local zoo in town had white tigers from the Hawthorn Circus as its main attraction. The white tiger has also been featured in the video for the song \\"Human\\" by the popular American synth-rock band The Killers. White Tiger is also the name of an American glam metal band from the 1980s. In the live action version of Disney's 101 Dalmatians, Cruella de Vil kills a white tiger for its fur. Seto Bagh (or 'White Tiger' in English) is a Nepali language novel by Diamond Shumsher Rana about an encounter with a white tiger. Aravind Adiga's novel The White Tiger won the Man Booker Prize in 2008. The central character and narrator refers to himself as \\"The White Tiger\\". It was a nickname given to him as a child to denote that he was unique in the \\"jungle\\" (his hometown), that he was smarter than the others. White Tigers is also the name of an Czech hockey team, that competes in the Czech Extraliga. Video games including white tigers include Zoo Tycoon, the Warcraft universe, and Perfect World International. White tigers are featured as a wild, tamable \\"pet\\" companion in Guild Wars Factions. White tigers are also seen in Heroes of Might and Magic IV. The protector of the mystical world of Shangri-La in Far Cry 4 is a white tiger that allies with the protagonist to defeat demons. Both the Power Rangers and the Japanese Super Sentai series on which the Power Rangers series is based, have had white tiger themed Rangers and mecha. A trained white tiger from the Bowmanville Zoo in Ontario, Canada, was used in the Animorphs TV series. A superhero named White Tiger appears in \\"The Justice Friends\\" in Dexter's Laboratory. A white tiger named White Blaze is frequently shown in the anime Ronin Warriors. Tigatron from the animated TV series Transformers: Beast Wars is based on the white tiger. There have been at least four heroes in Marvel comics called \\"The White Tiger\\": two gained powers from a group of three mystic amulets that they possessed, one was actually a tigress evolved by the High Evolutionary, and one was given an artificial version of the \\"Black Panther's Heart Shaped Herb\\". Kylie Chan's Dark Heavens series incorporates the four winds of Chinese mythology ‚Äì including The White Tiger. In Hayate the Combat Butler, Tama, Nagi Sanzenin's pet tiger, is a white tiger. In Colleen Houck's series beginning with the novel Tiger's Curse, one of the main characters, Ren, is shown as a white tiger. In 2013, a white tiger used for an election campaign in Lahore, Pakistan, died of dehydration. A white tiger named Mantecore was used as part of Siegfried & Roy's Siegfried & Roy at the Mirage Resort and Casino magical show. In 2014, Mantecore died at the age of 17 due to illness. The Simpsons episode \\"$pringfield\\" had parodies of Siegfried and Roy named Gunter and Ernst, with their own white tiger named Anastasia. Not as tame as Mantecore was, Anastasia turns on Gunter and Ernst and attacks them. == See also == * White Tiger (mythology) * Black tiger * Captive white tigers * Conservation genetics * Golden tabby tiger * Inbreeding * Inbreeding depression * Mainland Asian tiger * Marcan Tiger Preserve * Maltese tiger * Mutant * Outbreeding * Outbreeding depression * White panther == References == == External links == * Tigerlink.org * White Tigers (with genealogy charts) *White tigers * Indian Tigers Welfare Society * White Bengal Tiger Category:Tiger color morphs Category:Rewa, Madhya Pradesh Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Fauna of Madhya Pradesh Category:Inbred animals ","title":"White tiger"},{"id":"7780542","text":"\\"Personal Notes of an Infantryman\\" is a short story by J.

He was educated at Winchester College, where he was Head Boy and played cricket for the school, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he obtained a double first in classics (1965‚Äì7: Classical Honour Moderations: First Class Honours; 1967‚Äì9: Literae Humaniores: First Class Honours, BA). After graduating he served as a lecturer at Pembroke College, Oxford for a year. In 1971 he became a lecturer at Keele University, becoming professor there in 1991. After being mentioned by his daughter-in-law, American actress Claire Danes, during an appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Dancy appeared as a guest on the program on 1 April 2010.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VthiiIhN3wg He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2016. ==Philosophical work== After having worked on problems of epistemology, and more particularly on the nature of perception (argument from illusion), he emerged as the leading proponent in ethics of moral particularism, the idea that all moral reasons are particular and context-sensitive, rather than general. He also defends what he calls the holism of reasons, namely the idea that a consideration that is a reason for acting in a certain way in one case may not be a reason for acting in that way, or even a reason for not acting in that way, in other cases. In this sense, reasons are context-dependent. Dancy argues that the holism of reasons provides a major support for the main claim of his particularism, i.e., that there are no moral principles but that morality can get on perfectly well without them. Dancy edited some of George Berkeley's writingsSilvia Parigi. Berkeley Bibliography (1979-2010) and dedicated a book to the Anglo-Irish thinker. ==Personal life== In 1973 he married Sarah Birley; they have three children: the actor Hugh Dancy (husband of actress Claire Danes); Jack Dancy, who runs a travel company; and Kate Redman,https://www.twitter.com/rougewoman who works for UNESCO. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== * \\"On Moral Properties\\", Mind, 1981, XC, pp. 367‚Äì385. *‚ÄúEthical Particularism and Morally Relevant Properties.‚Äù Mind, n.s.; 92, 368 (Oct., 1983): 530 ‚Äì 547. *‚ÄúThe Role of Imaginary Cases in Ethics.‚Äù Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 66 (1985): 141 ‚Äì 153. * ‚ÄúAn Ethic of Prima Facie Duties.‚Äù In A Companion to Ethics, ed.

Even before its opening, the Roads and Traffic Authority was criticised for its lack of planning and broken promises on the T-way's construction. Parramatta Council complained during construction that noise walls had not been built next to the homes of residents who lived along the T-way route, causing them distress. The planned cycleway alongside the T-way was not built in its entire length, and included a large deviation which Council complained would erode the cycleway's effectiveness.City of Parramatta, \\"News: RTA urged to reconsider noise walls and cycleway route\\", 11 November 2005.

On the opening of the initial route several other problems were raised. Comments were made concerning the initial patronage of the T-way. While the New South Wales State Government refused to say how many people used the T-way in its first week, a local newspaper discovered that the commuter carpark attracted as few as ten cars a day in the first week of operation.Campise, Kirsten, \\"Commuters Ignoring T-Way\\", The Northern News, 28 March 2007.

While work on the aircraft proceeded to the test flying phase, the project never progressed beyond experimental purposes. The Col√©opt√®re was one of multiple efforts to produce a viable VTOL aircraft being conducted around the world throughout the 1950s. SNECMA had previously experimented with several wingless test rigs, known as the Atar Volant, which influenced the design. In terms of its general configuration, the Col√©opt√®re was a single-person aircraft with an unusual annular wing; the aircraft was designed to take-off and land vertically, therefore requiring no runway and very little space. Performing its maiden flight during December 1958, the sole prototype was destroyed on its ninth flight on 25 July 1959. While there were intentions at one stage for a second prototype to be produced, financing was never sourced. ==Development== ===Background=== During the 1950s, aircraft designers around the world engaged in programmes to develop fixed-wing aircraft that could not only perform both a vertical take-off and vertical landing, but transition into and out of conventional flight as well. As observed by the aviation author Francis K. Mason, a combat aircraft that possessed such qualities would have effectively eliminate the traditional reliance on relatively vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach.Mason 1967, p. 3. Accordingly, the development of viable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft was particularly attractive to military planners of the early postwar era. As the thrust-to-weight ratio of turbojet engines increased sufficiently for a single engine be able to lift an aircraft, designers began to investigate ways of maintaining stability while an aircraft was flying in the VTOL stage of flight. One company that opted to engage in VTOL research was the French engine manufacturer SNECMA who, beginning in 1956, built a series of wingless test rigs called the Atar Volant. Only the first of these was unpiloted and the second flew freely, both stabilized by gas jets on outrigger pipes The third had a tilting seat to allow the pilot to sit upright when the fuselage was level and had the lateral air intakes planned for the free flying aircraft, though it always operated attached to a movable cradle. The pilot for these experiments was Auguste Morel. However, the Atar Volant was not an end onto itself; its long term purpose was to serve as precursors to a larger fixed-wing aircraft. Separately to the internal work, substantial influence on the direction of development came from the Austrian design engineer Helmut von Zborowski, who had designed an innovative doughnut-shaped annular wing that could function \\"as power plant, airframe of a flying wing aircraft and drag- reducing housing\\". It was theorised that such a wing could function as a ramjet engine and propel an aircraft at supersonic speeds, suitable for an interceptor aircraft. SNECMA's design team decided to integrate this radical annual wing design into their VTOL efforts. Accordingly, from this decision emerged the basic configuration of the C.450 Col√©opt√®re. ===Flight testing=== During early 1958, the completed first prototype arrived at Melun Villaroche Aerodrome ahead of testing. The eye-catching design of the Col√©opt√®re rapidly made waves in the public conscious, even intentionally; author Jeremy Davis observed that the aircraft had even influenced intentional efforts, having allegedly motived the United States Navy to contract American helicopter manufacturer Kaman Aircraft to design its own annular-wing vehicle, nicknamed the Flying Barrel. In December 1958, the Col√©opt√®re first left the ground under its own power, albeit while attached to a gantry; Morel was at the aircraft's controls. Several challenging flight characteristics were observed, such as the tendency for the aircraft to slowly spin on its axis while in a vertical hover; Morel also noted that the vertical speed indicator was unrealistic and that the controls were incapable of steering the aircraft with precision while performing the critical landing phase. Dead-stick landings were deemed to be an impossibility. Morel conducted a total of eight successful flights, attaining a recorded maximum altitude of . One of these flights involved a display of the aircraft's hover performance before an assembled public audience. The ninth flight, on 25 July 1959, was planned to make limited moves towards entering horizontal flight; however, hindered by insufficient instrumentation and a lack of visual benchmarks, the aircraft became too inclined and too slow to maintain its altitude. Morel was unable to regain control amid a series of wild oscillations, opting to activate the ejection seat to escape the descending aircraft at only . He survived but was badly injured, while the aircraft itself was destroyed. While plans for a second prototype had been mooted at one stage, such ambitions ultimately never received the funding to proceed. ==Design== The Col√©opt√®re featured a central core akin to the Atar Volant, but differed in that the fuselage was surrounded by an annular wing greatly resembling the proposals made by von Zborowski. Aerodynamic control and stability was regulated by a series of four triangular winglets, which were installed upon the outwards side of the annual wing; however, these were only effective during conventional horizontal flight. Instead, control while hovering was provided by a series of deflecting vanes within the engine exhaust. The undercarriage of the Col√©opt√®re consisted of four relatively compact castored wheels. The pilot controlled the aircraft from within an enclosed cockpit; however, the pilot's position was somewhat unorthodox. To accommodate the changing orientation of the aircraft between vertical and horizon flight, the pilot was seated upon an ejector seat that would tilt appropriately to match the flight mode of the aircraft, moving so that they would be seated nearly-upwards during the vertical phase of flight, such as landing and taking-off. The intakes for the powerplant, a single SNECMA Atar axial-flow turbojet engine were positioned on either side of the cockpit. While the aircraft had been designed by SNECMA, the majority of the manufacturing process was performed by another French aircraft company, Nord Aviation. ==Specifications== ==See also== * Bell X-14 * Hunting H.126 * Short SC.1 * Hawker P.1127/Kestrel * A√©rospatiale Ludion ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * Mason, Francis K.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula. ==Location== Padinska Skela is located in the northern, Banat section of the municipality, 15 kilometers north of downtown Belgrade, on the Zrenjaninski put road which connects Belgrade with the town of Zrenjanin, in Vojvodina. It is built right in the middle of the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, major floodplain between the rivers of Danube and Tami≈°. ==History== In the early 20th century, Slovak cattle-breeders from the village of Padina were taking land in Panƒçevaƒçki Rit on lease. As the area was a marshland, to reach their land they had to use flatboats (in Serbian skela), thus giving the name to the area (Padinska Skela = Padina‚Äôs Flatboat). Few short streets in the middle of the large marsh existed prior to 1944. They were sparsely inhabited by the Germans, Ruthenians and Czechs. The settlement originates from the late 1940s when melioration of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit began. The settlement became important immediately, being in the center of the area which was turned from marshy floodplain into a very fertile arable land for the PKB company. While other parts of the country lacked many communal and modern infrastructure, Padinska Skela soon had elementary school, kindergarten, sports clubs, ambulance and cinema. During the period of colonization (‚ÄûThe 8th offensive‚Äú), it was mostly populated with the settlers from the South Serbia (Vranje, Surdulica), Bosnian Krajina and, to the lesser extent, from the Ra≈°ka. It was part of the municipality of Borƒça until May 30, 1952, when it became seat of its own municipality. In 1955 it merged into the municipality of Krnjaƒça which, in turn, became part of the municipality of Palilula in 1965. ==Demographics== Originally the settlement grew slowly, as many smaller settlements were scattered all over the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, growing around the solitary and outer farms. In the 1970s however, most of those settlements were administratively merged into the central one, Padinska Skela, even though some of them are kilometers away from it and separated by vast fields. As a result of this administrative measures, the population of Padinska Skela apparently boomed, but almost right away began experiencing depopulation. Population of Padinska Skela according to the last official census in 2011 was 9,263. Ethnic structure (2002): Serbs 88,21%, Romani 4,04%, Macedonians 0,83%, Yugoslavs 0,55%, Muslims 0,52%, Gorani 0,50%. The local community of Padinska Skela encompasses two neighboring settlements, Kovilovo and Dunavac. Together they had a combined population of 10,679 in 2011. ==Neighbourhoods== Some of sub- settlements of Padinska Skela are far away from it, like Glogonjski Rit, Jabuƒçki Rit, ≈†iroka Bara or Vrbovski. In a strange administrative decision, ten times smaller Kovilovo, which almost makes a continuous built-up area with Padinska Skela, is officially classified as a separate settlement. Urban core of Padinska Skela consists of several neighborhoods, like Tovili≈°te, Novo Naselje, Staro Naselje, Srednje Naselje or Industrijsko Naselje. ===Tovili≈°te=== One of oldest sections of Padinska Skela, consisting of some 30 concrete buildings of very bad quality, built 1950‚Äì1970 for first settlers with PKB's farms in the vicinity of the neighborhoods. The name, tovili≈°te, is Serbian for cattle feeder. ===Staro Naselje=== Older section, consisting of some 30 concrete buildings of very bad quality, built 1950‚Äì1970. Mostly old warehouses and depots turned into a residential apartments. Today almost exclusively inhabited by the Roma people. The name means Old Settlement in Serbian. ===Srednje Naselje=== Consists of some 15 five-store buildings built 1974‚Äì1978. The name means Middle Settlement in Serbian. ===Novo Naselje=== The largest neighborhood, with some 50 buildings mostly built in the 1980s, with some constructed in the 2000s. The name means New Settlement in Serbian. ===Industrijsko Naselje=== Location of the PKB's dairy branch, IMLEK factory for milk production. The name means \\"Industrial Settlement in Serbian. ===≈†iroka Greda=== Located near the \\"Rasova\\" canal. ==Characteristics== Padinska Skela is still statistically classified as a rural settlement (village). It covers and area of 6,500 hectares. For the Belgraders, Padinska Skela gained a certain level of notoriety as it is a location of both Special psychiatric hospital Dr Laza Lazareviƒá and one of the major correctional facilities in Serbia, the Padinska Skela prison. Settlements nickname, Padinjak, is used for both institutions in colloquial conversation. –ê sports and agricultural Lisiƒçji Jarak Airport is located near Padinska Skela, so as a modern BG Sport and Olympic Centre in the nearby Kovilovo, opened in 2005. Near Padinska Skela, along the Zrenjaninski put, there is a large, unfenced hunting ground of Rit. It covers an area of , of which is a pheasantry.

He invented the eponymous G-network, a mathematical model of the performance of distributed systems and networks with complex node to node interactions, used to analyze dynamic resource allocation in interconnected systems. He has pioneered research concerning the performance of multiprogramming computer systems, virtual memory management, data base reliability optimisation, distributed systems and network protocols. He formed, led, and trained the team that designed the commercial QNAP Computer and Network Performance Modeling Tool. He introduced the Flexsim Object Oriented approach for the simulation in manufacturing systems leading to a widely used commercial product. He published the first work on adaptive control of computer systems to optimise time-sharing systems, and published seminal papers on the performance optimisation of computer network protocols and on diffusion approximations for network performance. He invented the product form queueing networks with negative customers and triggers known as G-networks. He introduced a new spiked stochastic neural network model known as the random neural network, developed its mathematical solution and learning algorithms, and applied it to both engineering and biological problems. His inventions include the first Voice-Packet Switch SYCOMORE for Thales, the random access fibre-optics local area network XANTHOS, a patented admission control technique for ATM networks, a neural network based anomaly detector for brain magnetic resonance scans, and the Cognitive Packet Network routing protocol to offer quality of service to users . From 1984 to 1986 he served as the Science and Technology Advisor to the French Secretary of State for Universities. He founded the ISCIS (International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences) series of conferences that since 1986 are held annually in Turkey, the USA and Europe to bring together Turkish computer scientists with their international counterparts.https://projekty.iitis.pl/iscis2016 According to the Mathematics Genealogy project, Gelenbe is ranked 9th world- wide among PhD supervisors in the Mathematical Sciences, including Computer Science, having graduated some 90 PhD students. 24 of his former PhD students are women, including Prof. Catherine Rosenberg, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering of Canada, and Prof. Brigitte Plateau, the former Director General of Higher Education in France. ==Latest research interests== Gelenbe pursues his work on Machine Learning and Neural Networks and Cybersecurity He also currently works on energy efficient computer systems and self-aware networks, and on network security and on networked auctions.

From 1974 to 1981 he studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and London. Houstoun returned to live in New Zealand in 1981; he lived in Feilding. He regularly plays with New Zealand's professional music-ensembles as well as giving solo recitals and recording. Aged 40, he performed and recorded the complete Beethoven-sonata cycle, and collaborated with Tainui Stephens on a television documentary about Franz Liszt entitled Icon in B minor. In 1987 he launched the Kerikeri competition which became the Kerikeri International Piano Competition in 2012, attracting outstanding pianists and teachers from around the world. In 1999 Houstoun received an honorary doctorate in literature from Massey University. Houstoun started suffering from focal hand dystonia, which could easily have ended his career. The condition was treated with physiotherapy and acupuncture, and he had splints made, used rubber bands, and learned braille as sensory retraining, but Houstoun believes that his relaxation technique helped him overcome the condition. In 2001 a documentary was filmed about his condition. After five years he started performing again as a soloist. In the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours Houstoun was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services as a pianist. In 2013, he repeated his achievement from 20 years earlier of performing all 32 Beethoven piano-sonatas. ==References== ==External links== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:People from Timaru Category:Prize- winners of the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition Category:Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:People educated at Timaru Boys' High School Category:Curtis Institute of Music alumni Category:Massey University alumni Category:21st-century classical pianists Category:21st- century male musicians ","title":"Michael Houstoun"},{"id":"7781273","text":"Managed Network Systems Inc.

It comes in two versions, called small and big; in general, the latter is more complicated and contains more information than the former. In each, the choice of coefficient ring (typically a Novikov ring, described below) significantly affects its structure, as well. While the cup product of ordinary cohomology describes how submanifolds of the manifold intersect each other, the quantum cup product of quantum cohomology describes how subspaces intersect in a \\"fuzzy\\", \\"quantum\\" way. More precisely, they intersect if they are connected via one or more pseudoholomorphic curves. Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, which count these curves, appear as coefficients in expansions of the quantum cup product. Because it expresses a structure or pattern for Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, quantum cohomology has important implications for enumerative geometry. It also connects to many ideas in mathematical physics and mirror symmetry. In particular, it is ring-isomorphic to symplectic Floer homology. Throughout this article, X is a closed symplectic manifold with symplectic form œâ. ==Novikov ring== Various choices of coefficient ring for the quantum cohomology of X are possible. Usually a ring is chosen that encodes information about the second homology of X. This allows the quantum cup product, defined below, to record information about pseudoholomorphic curves in X. For example, let :H_2(X) = H_2(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) / \\\\mathrm{torsion} be the second homology modulo its torsion. Let R be any commutative ring with unit and Œõ the ring of formal power series of the form :\\\\lambda = \\\\sum_{A \\\\in H_2(X)} \\\\lambda_A e^A, where * the coefficients \\\\lambda_A come from R, * the e^A are formal variables subject to the relation e^A e^B = e^{A + B}, * for every real number C, only finitely many A with œâ(A) less than or equal to C have nonzero coefficients \\\\lambda_A. The variable e^A is considered to be of degree 2 c_1(A), where c_1 is the first Chern class of the tangent bundle TX, regarded as a complex vector bundle by choosing any almost complex structure compatible with œâ. Thus Œõ is a graded ring, called the Novikov ring for œâ. (Alternative definitions are common.) ==Small quantum cohomology== Let :H^*(X) = H^*(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) / \\\\mathrm{torsion} be the cohomology of X modulo torsion. Define the small quantum cohomology with coefficients in Œõ to be :QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) = H^*(X) \\\\otimes_\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\Lambda. Its elements are finite sums of the form :\\\\sum_i a_i \\\\otimes \\\\lambda_i. The small quantum cohomology is a graded R-module with :\\\\deg(a_i \\\\otimes \\\\lambda_i) = \\\\deg(a_i) + \\\\deg(\\\\lambda_i). The ordinary cohomology H*(X) embeds into QH*(X, Œõ) via a \\\\mapsto a \\\\otimes 1, and QH*(X, Œõ) is generated as a Œõ-module by H*(X). For any two cohomology classes a, b in H*(X) of pure degree, and for any A in H_2(X), define (a‚àób)A to be the unique element of H*(X) such that :\\\\int_X (a * b)_A \\\\smile c = GW_{0, 3}^{X, A}(a, b, c). (The right-hand side is a genus-0, 3-point Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariant.) Then define :a * b := \\\\sum_{A \\\\in H_2(X)} (a * b)_A \\\\otimes e^A. This extends by linearity to a well-defined Œõ-bilinear map :QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) \\\\otimes QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) \\\\to QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) called the small quantum cup product. ==Geometric interpretation== The only pseudoholomorphic curves in class A = 0 are constant maps, whose images are points. It follows that :GW_{0, 3}^{X, 0}(a, b, c) = \\\\int_X a \\\\smile b \\\\smile c; in other words, :(a * b)_0 = a \\\\smile b. Thus the quantum cup product contains the ordinary cup product; it extends the ordinary cup product to nonzero classes A. In general, the Poincar√© dual of (a‚àób)A corresponds to the space of pseudoholomorphic curves of class A passing through the Poincar√© duals of a and b. So while the ordinary cohomology considers a and b to intersect only when they meet at one or more points, the quantum cohomology records a nonzero intersection for a and b whenever they are connected by one or more pseudoholomorphic curves. The Novikov ring just provides a bookkeeping system large enough to record this intersection information for all classes A. ==Example== Let X be the complex projective plane with its standard symplectic form (corresponding to the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric) and complex structure. Let \\\\ell \\\\in H^2(X) be the Poincar√© dual of a line L. Then :H^*(X) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{Z}[\\\\ell] / \\\\ell^3. The only nonzero Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants are those of class A = 0 or A = L. It turns out that :\\\\int_X (\\\\ell^i * \\\\ell^j)_0 \\\\smile \\\\ell^k = GW_{0, 3}^{X, 0}(\\\\ell^i, \\\\ell^j, \\\\ell^k) = \\\\delta(i + j + k,2) and :\\\\int_X (\\\\ell^i * \\\\ell^j)_L \\\\smile \\\\ell^k = GW_{0, 3}^{X, L}(\\\\ell^i, \\\\ell^j, \\\\ell^k) = \\\\delta(i + j + k, 5), where Œ¥ is the Kronecker delta. Therefore, :\\\\ell * \\\\ell = \\\\ell^2 e^0 + 0 e^L = \\\\ell^2, :\\\\ell * \\\\ell^2 = 0 e^0 + 1 e^L = e^L. In this case it is convenient to rename e^L as q and use the simpler coefficient ring Z[q]. This q is of degree 6 = 2 c_1(L). Then :QH^*(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}[q]) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{Z}[\\\\ell, q] / (\\\\ell^3 = q). ==Properties of the small quantum cup product== For a, b of pure degree, :\\\\deg (a * b) = \\\\deg (a) + \\\\deg (b) and :b * a = (-1)^{\\\\deg (a) \\\\deg (b)} a * b. The small quantum cup product is distributive and Œõ-bilinear. The identity element 1 \\\\in H^0(X) is also the identity element for small quantum cohomology. The small quantum cup product is also associative. This is a consequence of the gluing law for Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, a difficult technical result. It is tantamount to the fact that the Gromov‚ÄìWitten potential (a generating function for the genus-0 Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants) satisfies a certain third-order differential equation known as the WDVV equation. An intersection pairing :QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) \\\\otimes QH^*(X, \\\\Lambda) \\\\to R is defined by :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sum_i a_i \\\\otimes \\\\lambda_i, \\\\sum_j b_j \\\\otimes \\\\mu_j \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i, j} (\\\\lambda_i)_0 (\\\\mu_j)_0 \\\\int_X a_i \\\\smile b_j. (The subscripts 0 indicate the A = 0 coefficient.) This pairing satisfies the associativity property :\\\\langle a * b, c \\\\rangle = \\\\langle a, b * c \\\\rangle. ==Dubrovin connection== When the base ring R is C, one can view the evenly graded part H of the vector space QH*(X, Œõ) as a complex manifold. The small quantum cup product restricts to a well-defined, commutative product on H. Under mild assumptions, H with the intersection pairing \\\\langle, \\\\rangle is then a Frobenius algebra. The quantum cup product can be viewed as a connection on the tangent bundle TH, called the Dubrovin connection. Commutativity and associativity of the quantum cup product then correspond to zero-torsion and zero-curvature conditions on this connection. ==Big quantum cohomology== There exists a neighborhood U of 0 ‚àà H such that \\\\langle , \\\\rangle and the Dubrovin connection give U the structure of a Frobenius manifold. Any a in U defines a quantum cup product :*_a : H \\\\otimes H \\\\to H by the formula :\\\\langle x *_a y, z \\\\rangle := \\\\sum_n \\\\sum_A \\\\frac{1}{n!} GW_{0, n + 3}^{X, A}(x, y, z, a, \\\\ldots, a). Collectively, these products on H are called the big quantum cohomology. All of the genus-0 Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants are recoverable from it; in general, the same is not true of the simpler small quantum cohomology. Small quantum cohomology has only information of 3-point Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, but the big quantum cohomology has of all (n ‚âß 4) n-point Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants. To obtain enumerative geometrical information for some manifolds, we need to use big quantum cohomology. Small quantum cohomology would correspond to 3-point correlation functions in physics while big quantum cohomology would correspond to all of n-point correlation functions. ==References== * McDuff, Dusa & Salamon, Dietmar (2004).

The notion was introduced by Sergei Novikov in the papers that initiated the generalization of Morse theory using a closed one-form instead of a function. The notion is used in quantum cohomology, among the others. The Novikov ring \\\\operatorname{Nov}(\\\\Gamma) is a principal ideal domain. Let S be the subset of \\\\Z[\\\\Gamma] consisting of those with leading term 1.

Let X be a connected polyhedron with a base point. Each cohomology class \\\\xi \\\\in H^1(X,\\\\R) may be viewed as a linear functional on the first homology group H_1(X,\\\\R); when composed with the Hurewicz homomorphism, it can be viewed as a group homomorphism \\\\xi\\\\colon \\\\pi=\\\\pi_1(X) \\\\to \\\\R.

Since X is a connected polyhedron, a local coefficient system over it corresponds one-to-one to a \\\\Z[\\\\pi]-module.

UltraPin is built in a traditional style pinball cabinet to look and feel like a real pinball machine. It has two LCD screens, a 19 inch LCD for the back glass and DMD, and a 32 inch LCD for the playfield, and it uses Windows XP Embedded for its operating system. ==History== David R. Foley had the original idea for UltraPin and began research on the idea in the beginning of 2000. In 2004 he discovered a motion controller chip that enabled the idea of a player being able to nudge and bump the ball in play which is unique to any digital pinball game before its time. In 2005 David began development on the UltraPin project with Aaron Hightower under David¬¥s company UltraCade Technologies. The development team at UltraCade Technologies created a patch for the existing Visual Pinball engine to use a new custom Physics Engine created by Buen Diseno and some new rendering features, based on DirectX 7. UltraPin also used a customized version of Visual PinMAME to emulate the hardware of various pinball games. In 2006 UltraCade Technologies was sold to Global VR and the UltraPin project continued development under Global VR. A new development team was assigned to the UltraPin project along with a new producer Brian Matthews. Brian used the original software from UltraCade Technologies and lead his team to fine tune the physics engine and game play to adhere to the strict game play standards set forth by Roger Sharpe of Williams Electronics pinball division. Williams Electronics had final approval of the UltraPin project and how each of the games played in UltraPin before the game could be sold. In 2007 UltraPin was approved by Williams Electronics to be sold to the public. HyperSpin later released an emulation frontend for the UltraPin named HyperPin. In 2010, the source code of this updated Visual Pinball version (by then 9.0.7) was released under a license that allows free use for non- commercial purposes. ==Costs== On June 4, 2007 Global VR announced that they will offer UltraPin Video Pinball at a significantly lower price. Additionally, the base unit included twelve of the most highly recognizable pinball games, as opposed to six previously.: GLOBAL VR :: News Releases : This 12 game package included a flipper feedback board. This consisted of one printed circuitboard and wires to connect to the main flipper buttons.

Logan Point quarry is visible to the left, and the suburb of Ravensbourne to the right The view looking south across central Dunedin and the head of the Otago Harbour, from the New Zealand Centennial monument on Signal Hill Signal Hill (Maori: Te Pahuri o te Rangipohika) is a prominent landform in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. It is located close to, and due north of, the head of the Otago Harbour and reaches an elevation of 393 m (1289 ft). The suburbs Ravensbourne, St. Leonards, and Opoho lie on its southern, eastern, and northwestern flanks, respectively. To the northwest is North East Valley, the thalweg of Lindsay Creek, a tributary of the Water of Leith. The southernmost spur of Signal Hill, Logan Point, has been extensively quarried for road gravel. State Highway 88 skirts the foot of the hill close to the edge of the Otago Harbour. A secondary summit of the hill (height 329 m) is capped by a monument to the New Zealand Centennial of 1940, a large structure including two large bronze figures representing \\"History\\" and \\"The Thread of Life\\" designed by F. W. Sturrock and F. W. Staub. Although commissioned for the centenary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the monument was not constructed until the 1950s, owing to the enforced strictures of World War II. A large stone from Edinburgh in Scotland is also incorporated in the monument, symbolising the ties between Dunedin and its sister city. The monument is surrounded by a scenic reserve 180 hectares in extent. This park was inaugurated as a much smaller park in 1926, and has gradually been extended to its current size. The reserve, located only five kilometres from central Dunedin, is a popular site for both locals and visitors, and affords an excellent panoramic view over the city. In October 2006, a series of bush fires caused extensive damage to the plantations of forest which cover the western slopes of the hill. ==References== *Bishop, G. & Hamel, A. (1993).

It may have been Donald Gurnett, University of Iowa Professor of Physics, who invented the Plasma receiver. Gurnett has been intimately involved in the key space probes sent since 1962 (Ijun III, Voyager I and II, Galileo and Cassini‚ÄìHuygens amongst others). Vibrations in the audible frequency range are perceived by humans when air vibrates against their eardrum. Air, or some other vibrating medium such as water, is indispensable in the perception of sound by the human ear. Without it acting as a transmitter, the sound produced by the source will not be perceived by a human. There is no air in outer space, nor there is any other type of medium capable of transmitting any vibration from a source to a human ear. However, there are sources in outer space that do vibrate at frequencies that would be audible by a human, if only there were some sort of transmitting media to carry those vibrations from the source to a human eardrum. One such source, capable of vibrating at audible frequencies (45 to 20,000 vibrations per second) is plasma. Plasma is a collection of charged particles, such as free electrons or ionized gas atoms. Examples of plasma are solar flares, solar wind, neon signs and fluorescent lamps. Plasma interacts with electrical and magnetic fields in ways that can result in vibrations in many frequencies, including the audible range. It appears that Gurnett designed the first plasma receiver, an instrument capable of detecting the vibrations in outer space plasma. These interplanetary plasma vibrations can be transformed into sound waves or air vibrations audible to a human ear. NASA provided recordings of these interplanetary and outer space plasma vibrations to composer Terry Riley and Kronos quartet founder David Harrington, which inspired the composition of \\"Sun Rings\\", a multimedia 85-minute piece for string quartet and choir. \\"Sun Rings\\" was performed November 3, 2006, at the Veteran's Auditorium, in Providence, Rhode Island. ==See also== *List of plasma (physics) articles ==External links== * NASA page describing use of a plasma receiver Category:Plasma physics ","title":"Plasma receiver"},{"id":"7781613","text":"Teracolini is a tribe of pierid butterflies in the subfamily Pierinae. ==References== Category:Pierinae Category:Butterfly tribes ","title":"Teracolini"},{"id":"7781628","text":"Pareronia is a genus of butterflies of the subfamily Pierinae within the family Pieridae.

He is also the former bassist for the heavy metal band Tremonti. At years old, he is currently the youngest member of Van Halen. ==Personal life== Named in homage to the classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, he is the son of Dutch American guitarist Eddie Van Halen and American actress Valerie Bertinelli, and the nephew of Dutch-Indonesian American drummer Alex Van Halen. Wolfgang has said that he did not know his father was a famous musician until he \\"started picking up CDs and saw his father's [Eddie's] picture on them\\". Following the completion of the 2007/2008 Van Halen tour, Wolfgang returned to school. Planning to graduate by the summer of 2009 he would graduate in 2010. Van Halen appears as the bassist for Van Halen in Guitar Hero: Van Halen, even replacing Anthony in the band's past incarnation.Eddie Van Halen considering New Tunes with David Lee Roth, 2009-02-02, www.spinner.com. ==Career== Van Halen had an indirect effect on his father's career from the very beginning of his life. The instrumental \\"316\\" refers to his birthday. For a 13-year period ending in 2004, Eddie Van Halen collaborated with Peavey on a line of guitars, the Wolfgang series, named after his son. In 2008, his father named a custom guitar after him, the Fender EVH Wolfgang. Wolfgang started his musical career as a drummer. He often watched his father rehearse, and at times would try to play his uncle Alex's drum kit, whereupon the latter would give him a few lessons. Wolfgang started playing drums at the age of nine, mostly self-taught with only few lessons from his uncle, and got his first drum set from his father as a present for his tenth birthday. Some time later he moved on to guitar and bass. He can also play keyboards and \\"figure things out by ear\\". Wolfgang later began actively participating in Van Halen, the band. He also made guest appearances during some dates of Van Halen's 2004 tour, appearing during his father's extended guitar solo spot and playing \\"316\\" with him. In late 2006, in an interview with Guitar World, Eddie Van Halen confirmed that his son would replace Michael Anthony as Van Halen's bassist. Wolfgang first toured with Van Halen in his new capacity in 2007. In August 2010, Van Halen announced that they would record a new album, with Wolfgang playing bass. In early 2008, Van Halen appeared on the cover of the April issue of Guitar World with his father, in the magazine's first father-son issue. He recorded his first album with Van Halen, A Different Kind of Truth, in 2011. The album was released on February 7, 2012. On September 10, 2012, Alter Bridge and Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti announced that Van Halen would be filling in for Brian Marshall as bassist for the first tour of Tremonti's eponymous band. Tremonti's first album, All I Was, was released on July 17 of that year. Van Halen became an official member of Tremonti in 2013, replacing previous bassist Brian Marshall. He appears on the band's 2015 studio album Cauterize and its 2016 follow-up Dust. In a February 2015 interview with the National Museum of American History, Eddie Van Halen indicated that Wolfgang is working on a solo album. On June 9, 2019 Van Halen appeared as a guest on his mother's Food Network television show and announced that he had completed his solo album. Sevendust guitarist Clint Lowery revealed in a June 2019 post on Twitter that Wolfgang will play on his upcoming solo debut. \\"[Wolfgang] will be playing drums, maybe some bass,\\" he says. \\"I'll do the rest. Just not good enough on the kit myself to pull it off in [the] studio.\\" ==Musical style== Van Halen started playing the bass as his father started asking if he wanted to play with him. Van Halen first viewed bass as \\"an easier version of guitar, but as soon as I started playing it I realized how wrong that was\\", but stated that his experience with a guitar made it easier for him to deal with the instrument. His style was described by Eddie as a \\"rhythm bassist, like I'm a rhythm guitarist and a bassist put together.\\" When he first began playing bass, his inspirations were Les Claypool of Primus and Justin Chancellor of Tool. He also enjoys Chris Wolstenholme of Muse, John Entwistle of The Who, Jack Bruce of Cream \\"and all of the classic players\\". ==Equipment== Most of Van Halen's basses are custom-built, and are based on his father's Frankenstrats and EVH Wolfgangs by Fender Master Builder and EVH engineer Chip Ellis. Two of them, one red and one blue, have Fender Jazz Bass shaped bodies and are loaded with active EMG pickups and electronics. These were used for the Van Halen 2007‚Äì2008 North American Tour. For the A Different Kind of Truth Tour in 2012, Ellis built Van Halen 3 more basses, another Jazz bass based on his father's black-and-white Frankenstrat, and two based on his father's EVH Wolfgang guitar. Both are satin black, while one has silver stripes and one has yellow stripes similar to his father's \\"Bumblebee\\" Frankenstrat. All three feature Fender N3 Noiseless pickups. For amplification, he uses EVH 5150s and Fender Super Bassmans. He uses one Super Bassman on the clean channel to provide a clean low end, while another Super Bassman and the 5150, both on channel 2, provide an overdriven sound on top of the clean Bassman. For effects, Van Halen uses an MXR EVH signature Flanger and Phase 90, MXR Fullbore distortion, Strymon TimeLine delay, Electro-Harmonix POG, and Way Huge Pork Loin overdrive, and a Dunlop Cry Baby bass wah. ==Discography== with Van Halen * A Different Kind of Truth (2012) * Tokyo Dome Live in Concert (2015) with Tremonti * Cauterize (2015) * Dust (2016) with Clint Lowery * God Bless the Renegades (2020) == Trivia == * Van Halen is apparently a friend of Arin Hanson and Dan Avidan of the YouTube comedy duo Game Grumps. ==References== ==External links== *Official Van Halen Website *Official Twitter Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:Musicians from Santa Monica, California Category:Van Halen members Category:Guitarists from California Category:Tremonti (band) members Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American bass guitarists Category:American_people_of_Dutch-Indonesian_descent Category:American musicians of Italian descent ","title":"Wolfgang Van Halen"},{"id":"7781802","text":"Eleanor \\"Miss Ellie\\" Ewing Farlow (maiden name Southworth) is a fictional character from the primetime CBS television series Dallas, a long-running serial centered on the lives of the wealthy Ewing family of Dallas, Texas. Created by writer David Jacobs, the character of family matriarch Miss Ellie was an important part of the show's structure and conflict. The dynamic role was originated by stage and screen actress Barbara Bel Geddes who was awarded both the Emmy Award and Golden Globe award for Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series. Half-way through the show's historic 13-year run, real-life drama impacted the character of Miss Ellie when, only days after filming wrapped for the 1982‚Äì1983 season, Bel Geddes was confronted with emergency quadruple bypass surgery. Consequently, the character of Miss Ellie went unseen until the 12th episode of the 1983‚Äì1984 season when Bel Geddes returned. Facing continued health issues, she was replaced by movie and television actress Donna Reed for the entire 1984‚Äì1985 season. In better health, Dallas producers asked Bel Geddes to return to the role again for the 1985‚Äì86 season, where she remained through the character's final appearance in the 1989‚Äì90 season. The character of Miss Ellie appeared on Dallas in a total of 300 episodes, 276 episodes played by Barbara Bel Geddes, and 24 episodes played by Donna Reed. Miss Ellie's storylines focus on her family's troubles. As the matriarch of the Ewing family, she is portrayed as a strong and loving mother. Miss Ellie's marriage to oil baron Jock Ewing was central to the character for the first few years she appeared in the show, until his death in an episode in 1981, following the real-life death of actor Jim Davis. ==Character creation== ===Casting=== Miss Ellie Ewing Farlow is one of the original characters invented by the creator of Dallas, David Jacobs. Before the creation of the show, Jacobs originally had quite a different idea of what he envisioned the show to be. He wanted to create a television show based on \\"family issues and examining relationships at the middle-class level\\".Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap, pp. 4‚Äì5 The production company, CBS, initially turned down his original idea, as they wanted something more \\"glitzy\\" to put on the air, with wealthier characters. After the success of Dallas, Jacobs' initial idea later became the Dallas spin-off Knots Landing. ==Storylines== Born in 1915, Miss Ellie Ewing is the daughter of rancher Aaron Southworth (Hoyt Axton), who instills in her a fierce pride in her heritage, deep-seated courage, and a strong belief in the strength of family. During the first half of the 1930s, Miss Ellie was the sweetheart of Willard \\"Digger\\" Barnes (David Wayne, Keenan Wynn). When the Great Depression hit, Miss Ellie's family came dangerously close to losing Southfork Ranch, and Miss Ellie began dating Digger's business partner and friend, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis), who had just begun making his fortune in the oil business and building Ewing Oil. On the day that her family was going to lose Southfork, Miss Ellie married Jock, as he was the only man in Texas known to have enough money to save the ranch. While she initially married Jock to save Southfork and for Jock's dependability, she grew to love him and they remained married for well over forty years until his death in a helicopter crash in 1982. Together, Jock and Miss Ellie had three sons: J.R. (Larry Hagman), Gary (David Ackroyd, Ted Shackelford) and Bobby (Patrick Duffy). As the years and decades pass, Jock builds Ewing Oil into one of the biggest and most powerful independent oil companies in Texas, and Southfork grew into a very successful ranch again under Jock's leadership. Jock takes over raising his eldest son J.R., showing him \\"tough love\\" and grooming him to be the heir of Ewing Oil, thus making him one of the most ruthless oilmen in the oil business. Miss Ellie has more influence on their second son Gary, who is Miss Ellie's favorite son, as Gary is more like the Southworths than the Ewings in loving ranching and the land over the oil business. Miss Ellie resents Jock's treatment of Gary, whom Jock considers weak, and Gary is regularly bullied by J.R., causing pressures which drive Gary to alcoholism, and to walk out on his family and baby daughter, Lucy (Charlene Tilton). Jock and Miss Ellie's youngest son, Bobby, is Jock's favorite son, and is spoiled by both Jock and Miss Ellie. In 1979, Miss Ellie is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes a mastectomy, from which she fully recovers. In 1980, she learns that ranch foreman Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly) is Jock's illegitimate son from an affair with an Army nurse named Margaret Hunter in England during World War II. This revelation caused tension in Miss Ellie and Jock's marriage, as she felt that Jock had replaced Ray for their second son Gary. The tension almost leads Miss Ellie and Jock to divorce. However, they reconcile in 1981 and have a second honeymoon in Paris. Miss Ellie also accepts Ray into the family, though she is not his biological mother. Shortly thereafter, Jock goes to Venezuela on a mission to help the U.S. government explore oil in the jungle. In 1982, on his return to Texas from Venezuela, Jock is involved in a helicopter crash and is reported to have died, although his body is never recovered. In 1983, Miss Ellie goes to court to overturn the terms of Jock's will, which set up a fierce and bitter competition between J.R. and Bobby for control of Ewing Oil. Miss Ellie loses the case after failing to convince the court that Jock was mentally incompetent at the time he wrote his will. Before Jock's death, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) leaves J.R., taking John Ross to live at the Southern Cross Ranch near San Angelo, Texas, the home of her new boyfriend, rodeo cowboy Dusty Farlow (Jared Martin). In an attempt to steal back John Ross, J.R. takes Miss Ellie on a visit, where she first meets Dusty's father Clayton (Howard Keel). Later, Clayton and she settle a problem caused by J.R. involving Clayton's refineries. When Clayton helps Sue Ellen as she reconciles with J.R., Miss Ellie and he become friendly and eventually start dating. In 1984, Clayton and Miss Ellie marry, despite the attempts of J.R. and Clayton's sister Jessica Montfort (Alexis Smith) to stop the wedding. In 1986, a man named Wes Parmalee (Steve Forrest) claims that he is in fact her presumed late husband, Jock, who had actually survived the helicopter crash but underwent extensive plastic surgery which drastically altered his appearance. Miss Ellie is torn over whether to believe Wes' claims, and this puts a strain on her marriage to Clayton. Eventually, Miss Ellie tells her family that Wes told her that he was not Jock. In 1988, Ellie accepted her husband Clayton as co-owner of Southfork Ranch. In 1990, Miss Ellie and Clayton go on a tour of the Orient. While overseas, Miss Ellie decides not to return to Dallas because she is tired of dealing with all the headaches and heartaches from J.R. and Bobby's lives. She deeds Southfork to her youngest son, Bobby. Miss Ellie died in 2001 and is buried on Southfork. ==Dallas (2012 TV series)== When her son J.R. died in 2013, Bobby's new wife Ann revealed that Miss Ellie had cut J.R. out of her will because \\"he was not a rancher\\", which greatly angered a bitter J.R., and left Bobby with enormous guilt. A final part of her will gave half of Southfork to her grandson John Ross Ewing III, to Bobby's dislike. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *http://www.barbarabelgeddes.com *Miss Ellie Ewing Biography at Ultimate Dallas.com Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Fictional socialites Category:Television characters introduced in 1978 Category:Fictional characters with cancer ","title":"Miss Ellie Ewing"},{"id":"7781832","text":"Tagiades, commonly known as snow flats, is a genus of spread-winged skipper butterflies.

Spotted gar have an elongated mouth with many needle-like teeth to catch other fish and crustaceans. It is one of the smallest of the seven species of gar found in North America, growing 2‚Äì3 ft (0.61‚Äì0.91 m) in length and weighing 4-6 lb (1.8‚Äì2.7 kg) typically. Gars have diamond-shaped, thick, enamel (ganoid) scales. The name Lepisosteus is Greek for \\"bony scale\\". Gars are almost never eaten in the central and northern United States. They have high levels of mercury and are considered a cancer risk. Gar larva at 22 days, stained for cartilage (blue) and bone (red) ==Distribution and habitat== The spotted gar is native to North America and its current range is from southern Ontario to the west from the Devils River in Texas east to the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and southeast to the lower Apalachicola River in Florida. The gar population is small in the north and is being threatened in Lake Erie by the destruction of their habitat and pollution. The gar is more common in the southern waters like the Mississippi River basin from southern Minnesota to Alabama and western Florida. Historical records indicate the spotted gar resided in the Thames and Sydenham Rivers in Ontario, Canada. Also, the fish was once common in Illinois in the Green and Illinois Rivers to the swamps in Union County; though sporadic, the population has dwindled in these water systems because of the loss of specific habitat they need to live, clear pools with aquatic vegetation. Habitats for spotted gar are clear, slow- moving, shallow waters of creeks, rivers, and lakes. It occasionally enters brackish or more salty waters. In response to the low oxygen levels created by slow-moving water, the gars have developed the ability to gulp air and send it to a primitive lung called a gas bladder. In one study, most spotted gar were shoreline oriented, preferred submerged branches as cover, and avoided areas of exposed bank.[3] During a flood pulse, a floodplain provides habitat for spawning and nursery habitat for gar eggs. A specimen caught in Kentucky Lake by ecology students from Murray State University ==Ecology== The spotted gar is a voracious predator. Its sharp-toothed beak is very effective at catching fast moving prey. A diet study of the spotted gar reported the diet of a spotted gar consists of four species of fish; golden topminnow, warmouth, bluegill, and spotted sunfish, which adds to 18.1% of total food volume in the stomach, while 57.5% of the stomach content was shrimp.[2] Other invertebrates filled the remaining 23.6% of the stomach. Gar are also known to eat insect larvae and algae. Gar are a main predator in the aquatic food chain in lakes and rivers. In one example of a food chain herbivorous fish eat algae and are eaten by gar. Another food chain example is herbivorous invertebrates eat algae, are eaten by carnivorous fish, then the fish is eaten by the gar.[2] Gar do not have many predators, only carnivorous fish would eat them, mainly at an early life stage. The fish would compete with other carnivorous fish such as the bowfin (Amia calva). Movement rates were higher during the summer than during the fall and winter, and rates were greater at night than at dawn during both seasons. The temperature greatly affects their moving rates and their ability to range their home turf. When the water is warmer during the spring and summer, they travel more often than during the cold seasons. Spotted gars eat 70% of their food intake at night compared to dusk and dawn.[3] Abiotic factors that affect the spotted gar by humans include destruction of habitat and increased sedimentation in the water. In 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, in coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency, took fish tissue samples in the Lower Mississippi River to test for heavy metals and organic compounds.[4] Spotted gar was found to be a cancer risk with high concentrations of heavy metals and organic compounds.[4] ==Life history== Spotted gar spawn in the spring in April, May, and June, or when the water temperature is between 21.0 and 26.0 ¬∞C (69.8 and 78.8 ¬∞F), depending on the location. Gar spawn in shallow water with abundant vegetation and cover. A female can have multiple mating partners and the female is usually larger than the male. The female can lay up to about 20,000 eggs, but on average about 13,000 eggs are laid. They lay their eggs on leaves of aquatic plants. The eggs are green in color and have an adhesive coating to keep them attached to aquatic vegetation. They are highly toxic to prospective predators. After 10 to 14 days, the eggs hatch. At this stage, the gar are most vulnerable. Males mature at the age of two or three, whereas females mature at three or four years old. The male's average lifespan is 8 years and the female's average lifespan is 10 years. Females have lower annual mortality rates.[6] The maximum lifespan for a gar is 18 years. ==Current management== Today, humans are affecting this fish species by destroying habitat and aquatic vegetation, and creating sedimentation in the waters of North America. Waste and chemical drainage into lakes and rivers causes chemical buildup and contamination of the water. Consequently, the water becomes murkier and causes predatory fish to have high mercury levels or accumulate carcinogenic compounds into their bodies.Hayer, Cari-Ann. (2008). Influence of Gravel Mining and Other Factors on Detection Probabilities of Coastal Plain Fishes in the Mobile River Basin, Alabama. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 137: 1606-1620. Spotted gar desire clear pools of water, and anthropogenic factors can decrease their survivability. This species is not on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service federally endangered species list, although in some northern states it is on special concern lists. In Canada, the fish is designated as threatened by the Committee on the Status of endangered wildlife in Canada. For Canadian waters the spotted gar is protected by the Species at Risk Act and the federal Fisheries Act. The Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk works to protect the spotted gar and its habitat. Current management plans for spotted gar include: increasing water quality, minimizing or avoiding pollution, analyzing contaminated samples.Brim, M.S., D. Bateman, R. Jarvis. (2000). Environmental Contaminants Evaluation of St. Joseph Bay, Florida. Publication No. PCFO-EC-00-01. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Panama City Field Office, Panama City, Florida. Vol 1 - Vol 2. The most important biological decline of the species is habitat destruction. ==References== ==External links== * Animal Diversity Web: Lepisosteus oculatus spotted gar * Texas Parks and Wildlife: Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) *View the spotted gar genome in Ensembl Category:Lepisosteidae Category:Fish described in 1864 ","title":"Spotted gar"},{"id":"7781926","text":"Fiji competed in the Summer Olympic Games for the first time at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. ==References== *Official Olympic Reports Category:Nations at the 1956 Summer Olympics 1956 Category:1956 in Fijian sport ","title":"Fiji at the 1956 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7781929","text":"Fiji competed at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. ==Athletics== ===Track and road=== {class= style=font-size:90% - !rowspan=2Athlete !rowspan=2Event !colspan=2Heat !colspan=2Quarterfinal !colspan=2Semifinal !colspan=2Final -style=font-size:95% !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank -align=center align=left rowspan=2 Sitiveni Moceidreke align=left Men's 100 m  10.8  3 Q  10.7  7  colspan=4  Did not advance -align=center align=left Men's 200 m  21.8  4  colspan=6  Did not advance } ===Field=== {class= style=\\"font- size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Qualification !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank -align=center align=leftMesulame Rakuro align=leftMen's discus throw  47.18 32  colspan=2  Did not advance } ==References== *Official Olympic Reports Category:Nations at the 1960 Summer Olympics 1960 Category:1960 in Fijian sport ","title":"Fiji at the 1960 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7781937","text":"Fiji competed with only one person at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico.

He earned an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay he wrote for the film Kiss of the Spider Woman. ==Early life and college== Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Schrader was brought up in a strict Dutch Calvinist family and did not see his first film until he was an adult. In 1968, he finished his MFA at the University of Iowa's Writer's Workshop where he studied with Nelson Algren, Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Yates, Robert Coover, Jos√© Donoso and Jorge Luis Borges. ==Japan== After graduating, Schrader left Grand Rapids in the Midwest and escaped the draft by moving to Japan to teach. (According to Peter Biskind, in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Schrader left the U.S. when he received a draft induction notice and didn't return until he was 28 years old - and thus ineligible for the draft.) Between 1969-73 Schrader escaped even further, slipping by night into the subculture of the Yamaguchi-gumi (the dominant Yakuza gangster organization in the Kansai area of Japan, which includes Kobe, Kyoto and Osaka), while by day teaching American Literature at Doshisha University and Kyoto University. During his time in Japan he met his future wife, Chieko Schrader. They married in 1977. His living family includes brother Paul Schrader, niece Molly, and nephew Sam. ==Film career== His experiences with the Yakuza in Japan led to a collaboration on a story with his brother, Paul Schrader. This resulted in the film The Yakuza (1974), starring Robert Mitchum and directed by Sydney Pollack. Leonard and Paul also co-wrote Blue Collar (1978), a story of defiant auto-workers in Detroit, directed by Paul Schrader starring Richard Pryor and Harvey Keitel, and Old Boyfriends (1979), about a woman's cross-country trek to visit old flames, directed by Joan Tewkesbury and starring John Belushi, Talia Shire, Keith Carradine, John Houseman. Schrader's other screenplay credits include such popular Japanese-language films as Tora-san's Dream of Spring (1979), The Man Who Stole the Sun (Japan's Best Film of the Year in 1980), and Shonben Rider (1983). In 1982, with wife Chieko Schrader, he co- wrote The Killing of America, a documentary tracing the origins of U.S. violence. During this production, Leonard Schrader collaborated with New York experimental filmmaker, David Weisman. Schrader's background in Latin American literature and Weisman's experience with Brazil led them to develop Kiss of the Spider Woman together. Schrader's screenplay adaptation, based on the avant-garde novel by Argentinian Manuel Puig, earned him an Academy Award nomination in 1986. (It also earned William Hurt an Academy Award for Best Actor.) Schrader met renowned Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima while living in Japan. For a decade after the author's ritual suicide in 1970, Schrader pursued the rights to Mishima's life, and working with his wife Chieko and brother Paul, he co-wrote the Japanese-language bio-pic Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters executive-produced in 1984 by George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, and directed by Paul Schrader. Schrader made his directorial debut with Naked Tango (1991) for which he also wrote the screenplay. Produced in Argentina, with the 1925 period 'look' overseen by Oscar-winning designer Milena Canonero, the independent film starred Vincent D'Onofrio, Mathilda May, Esai Morales, and the late Fernando Rey. ==Death== Schrader died in 2006 in Los Angeles, California. ==Selected filmography== *The Yakuza (1974) (writer) *Blue Collar (1978) (co-writer) *Tora-san's Dream of Spring (1979) (co-writer) *Taiy≈ç o Nusunda Otoko (English title: The Man Who Stole the Sun) (1979) (writer) (Japan's Best Film of the Year, 1980) *The Killing of America (1982) (writer, producer, director) *Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985) (writer, associate producer) *Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985) (writer) (Academy Award- nominee) *Naked Tango (1990) (writer, director) ==Teaching== *From 1996 to 1999, Schrader taught the screenwriting Master's Thesis class at the University of Southern California. *From 1999 to 2003, Schrader taught at Chapman University where he was an associate professor of film. *From 2003 until his death, Schrader was Senior Filmmaker-in-Residence at the American Film Institute where he chaired the Screenwriting Department and taught graduate screenwriting. ==External links== * *Leonard's legendary collection of rare Lobby Cards *Obituary in The New York Times Category:1943 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American male screenwriters Category:Writers from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni Category:American expatriates in Japan Category:Chapman University faculty Category:Film directors from Michigan Category:Screenwriters from California Category:Screenwriters from Michigan Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Leonard Schrader"},{"id":"7781953","text":"Eddie Davis (born January 27, 1973 in St. Louis, Missouri) is a former defensive halfback who played 15 seasons in the Canadian Football League, mainly with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

The song peaked at number 23 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles chart and number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Soon after, they released an EP, but it had very little success and the group quickly disbanded. General Hospital revisited the group's iconic single in an episode that aired on April 28, 2013, as part of the series' 50th anniversary. The song was co-written by Harry King (local producer) and Lisa (Lips) Tedesco, a soap updater for Medford-based station Kiss 108. The song was integrated into a movie, Young Doctors in Love, which had a successful run on cable channels in the US and abroad. It sold 850,000 7-inch singles and 250,000 12-inch copies. ==References== Category:Musical groups from Boston Category:American girl groups ","title":"The Afternoon Delights"},{"id":"7781969","text":"Fiji competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States.

Prosseda began composing for the piano at the age of four, and took his first private piano lessons at six. In 1985, he entered the Conservatorio Ottorino Respighi in Latina, where he studied piano with Anna Maria Martinelli, graduating in 1994. He went on to study with Alexander Lonquich, Boris Petrushansky and Franco Scala at the Accademia Pianistica \\"Incontri col Maestro\\" in Imola, and with Dmitri Bashkirov, Leon Fleisher, William Grant Nabor√©, Charles Rosen, Karl Ulrich Schnabel, Fou Ts'ong at the International Piano Foundation in Cadenabbia (Lake Como, Italy). Prosseda has won major prizes in several piano competitions, including the Umberto Micheli competition in Milan, the Franz Schubert competition in Dortmund, the Alessandro Casagrande competition in Terni, and the Mozart competition in Salzburg. Prosseda completed his PhD in Italian Literature from La Sapienza University in Rome. Prosseda and his wife, concert pianist Alessandra Ammara, perform as a piano duo. Prosseda is particularly noted for his performances of newly discovered works by Felix Mendelssohn. He has recorded a nine-CD series for Decca of the piano works of Mendelssohn, including a Mendelssohn Discoveries album of formerly unknown works. Prosseda discovered a manuscript of Mendelssohn's uncompleted third piano concerto in the Bodleian Library, and asked Marcello Bufalini to complete the score. Prosseda subsequently performed the reconstruction publicly and recorded it commercially. Prosseda has prepared critical editions of rare piano works by Mendelssohn, including 6 Fugues (1821‚Äì26), 4 Sonatas (1820), and Fantasia for piano four hands (1824). Prosseda is founder and president of the Associazione Mendelssohn, which promotes the music and the heritage of Felix Mendelssohn. Prosseda dedicated the early part of his career to the discovery of piano works by several neglected Italian composers, such as Antonio Salieri, Gioachino Rossini and Roffredo Caetani. He published the first edition of Salieri's Sonata in C major in 2004 for Boccaccini & Spada. In September 2011, Prosseda gave his first public performance on the piano-p√©dalier (pedal piano), the modern premi√®re of Charles Gounod's concerto for piano-p√©dalier and orchestra in E flat major (1889), with the Orchestra Filarmonica Toscanini conducted by Jan Latham Koenig. Subsequently, contemporary composers have written piano pedal pieces for Prosseda, including Cristian Carrara, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Giuseppe Lupis, Alessandro Solbiati and Michael Glenn Williams. Prosseda has commercially recorded four works by Charles Gounod for piano-p√©dalier and orchestra (Concerto, Suite Concertante, Fantaisie sur l'Hymne Russe and Danse Roumaine) for Hyperion. In June 2012, Prosseda made his debut recital on the piano-p√©dalier at the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza. ==Career== Prosseda is a host on the Italian National Radio (RAI), Radiotre, and a contributor to the \\"Lezioni di Musica\\" series on RAI. He is also the author of \\"Lezioni di Musica - il Pianoforte\\", a listening guide to piano repertoire, published in Italian by Edizioni Curci in 2013. He co-produced three documentaries: \\"Mendelssohn Unknown\\", \\"Fryderyk Chopin\\", and \\"Liszt: The Years of Pilgrimage\\". Prosseda is also a co-founder and artistic coordinator of \\"Donatori di Musica\\", a network of musicians and doctors who organise concert series in Italian hospitals. ==Experiments with technology== Since 2012, Prosseda has also given lecture-concerts with the robot pianist TeoTronico, as educational or family concerts, to demonstrate differences between a literal production of music and human interpretation. On 23 August 2012 at the Philharmonie in Berlin, he appeared as a ghost pianist, playing a Clavinova digital piano from backstage, connected in real time via Midi with TeoTronico. The robot, onstage, mirrored Prosseda's performance of Chopin's Polacca Brillante op. 22, reproducing it on a normal grand piano with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. This was the first experiment of a live teleconcert with a ghost pianist. He repeated the experiment in Palermo in November 2012, performing Mozart's concerto K. 488 backstage, with TeoTronico on stage with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana. ==Honours and awards== * Supersonic Award by Pizzicato (March 2013) for Prosseda's Decca CD \\"Piano con Fuoco\\" * Diapason d'Or of the Month (November 2009) awarded for the Mendelssohn Discoveries Decca CD. * Premio Petrassi per la Musica, 2010.

After emigrating from England in 1910, he roamed the United States from Maine to California in search of landscape subjects. He eventually settled in Laguna Beach, California in 1940. ===Robert Wood reproductions=== Wood's work was widely published by a number of publishers, the most prolific being Donald Bonnist's Donald Art Company, which distributed more than one million copies of October Morn, Wood's most popular print, in less than two years. Wood was at the peak of his fame in the 1950s through 1970s when his scenes of the Catskill Mountains in New York, the California coast, the Grand Tetons, the Rocky Mountains, the Texas Hill Country and the Cascades were most popular. His popularity made him a household name in America. Millions of his reproductions were printed in large editions by a number of publishers. Titles like Autumn Bronze, Early Spring, Pine & Birch, Texas Spring, and The Old Mill are found in homes across North America.Donald Art Company was a leading American art publisher from the 1950s through the 1980s.

On a large parcel of land with its own trout pond, they built studios for each of them. While in Bishop, the Woods became friends with landscape painters Robert Clunie and Richard Coons. The Woods sold the property to move to San Diego, where they restored a Victorian home.Images of both these homes are reproduced on the official robertwood.net website. After a few years in San Diego, they returned to Bishop, where they purchased a smaller property. Wood died in Bishop at the age of ninety, just a month before a large retrospective exhibition was mounted at the Morseburg Galleries in Los Angeles, by Howard Morseburg and the Newport Beach gallery owner Raymond Hagen.Gaston, Godfrey, Robert Wood Retrospective, Exhibition Catalog, Morseburg Galleries, Los Angeles, California, 1979 ==Productivity== Wood was an extremely facile painter and his artistic production was substantial, in excess of 5,000 completed works.

He was originally played by Jim Davis on the show from 1978 to 1981, and later as a young man by Dale Midkiff in the made-for-TV movie prequel The Early Years. Jock founded Ewing Oil in 1930 and was the patriarch of the Ewing family. ==Character biography== ===Early life and career=== John Ross \\"Jock\\" Ewing Sr. was born in 1909, the younger of two sons born to Leander Ewing and his wife. Through his older brother Jason, Jock got his first job in an oil field in east Texas. While riding in a train boxcar, Jock met Willard \\"Digger\\" Barnes and the two became friends. Jock, Digger and Jason all became wildcatters and began drilling their own fields. Digger had a unique ability to smell oil underground and with Jock's business skills they began making a fortune. Jason and Digger didn't get on much, while Jock stood up for Digger in those days. Jason eventually left Texas to wildcat in Alaska, marrying a woman named Nancy Shaw, with whom he had a son Jack (played by Dack Rambo) and a daughter Jamie (played by Jenilee Harrison). Jock and Digger returned to Texas from Alaska, where Jock met Digger's girlfriend, Ellie Southworth. In the long run, Digger's drinking and undependability made Miss Ellie see that Digger would never change and that Digger was not the type of man to marry, and she left Digger for Jock. Digger started to wander across the country after Ellie left him but Jock and Digger continued with their oil business ventures for a few more years. Even as late as 1939, Jock and Digger both signed a deal to share the profits of Ewing 23 between themselves and their heirs in perpetuity. However, when Ewing 6 came in, Jock put the field in his name only, to prevent Digger from gambling and drinking his half away. Digger was furious and he claimed that Jock had stolen the wells for himself, ending their friendship and business relationship. ===Marriages and children=== Ellie Southworth was desperate to save Southfork, which was hit hard by the Great Depression, but Jock was reluctant to marry, even after Miss Ellie chose him over Digger, because unbeknownst to Miss Ellie, Jock was previously married to a woman named Amanda Lewis and looked after her psychiatric needs. Amanda had suffered a mental breakdown shortly after she and Jock were married and Jock put her in a mental hospital. The doctor told Jock that Amanda would never recover and advised Jock to divorce her, which he eventually did in 1930. In 1936, Jock and Miss Ellie married on the day that Miss Ellie's family was about to lose Southfork and it was well known that Jock was the only man in Dallas with the money to save the ranch. Jock had a fragile and stormy relationship with Miss Ellie's father, Aaron Southworth and with her brother Garrison; however, Barbara Southworth seemed to accept her new son-in-law, if only for Miss Ellie's sake. On his deathbed, Aaron accepted Jock as part of his family by giving him his favorite gun. Jock and Miss Ellie had three sons together, J.R., Gary and Bobby. Jock served in World War II, where he and an old army buddy, Tom Mallory, were shot down in a mission in Holland. They later returned to save the families who sheltered them. During his term in Britain, Jock had an affair with an Army nurse from Emporia, Kansas, named Margaret Hunter. Jock was shipped off to France and Margaret returned to the United States. She married her fianc√©, Amos Krebbs and soon thereafter gave birth to Jock's illegitimate son, Ray Krebbs. After the war, Jock returned to Southfork and confessed to Miss Ellie about his affair with Margaret Hunter. She forgave him and they moved on. In 1948, Amos Krebbs left Margaret Hunter, leaving her to raise Ray as a single parent. In 1960, a 15-year-old Ray Krebbs showed up at Southfork with a note from his mother asking Jock to help Ray. Jock made Ray a hand on Southfork. Neither Jock, Miss Ellie nor Ray knew that Jock was Ray's father until 20 years later, when Amos Krebbs came to Dallas and revealed that Jock was Ray's father, bringing proof to back up his claim. Jock then welcomed Ray into the Ewing family and personally explained it all to his family. As the years passed from the 1930s onwards, Jock built Ewing Oil into one of the most powerful independent oil companies in Texas, much to the bitterness and jealousy of his former friend and business partner, Digger Barnes. Jock also became a successful rancher. Jock \\"took over raising\\" his eldest son J.R., showing him \\"tough love\\" and made him one of the most cunning and ruthless oil barons in the oil business. Jock came to heavily rely on J.R. in the management of Ewing Oil giving J.R. \\"the fever for big business\\" but \\"never taught him when to stop\\". Jock, for the most part, ignored his second son Gary, whom Jock considered weak and lacking the Ewing character, as Gary ran away from responsibility, began drinking excessively to handle the pressures of being a teenage husband and father and couldn't stand up to J.R.'s bullying. Jock generally spoiled his youngest son, Bobby, who Jock considered to be \\"the best of the lot\\". Bobby had the morals that J.R. lacked and embraced Jock's favoritism. However, Bobby was often emotional, short-tempered and lacked the intelligence, drive, and focus to succeed in the oil business preferring football, women, ranching and enjoying the social benefits of being a Ewing, which was earned by the hard work of Jock and J.R. ===Retirement and death=== In 1977, Jock retired as president of Ewing Oil. He made J.R. his successor and took a more active role in running Southfork with foreman Ray Krebbs. Jock and Ellie briefly separated in 1981 after Miss Ellie learned that Jock was the power behind Takapa, a land development deal that she was fighting against on the grounds of conservationism. After Ellie refused his order to back down and stay out of the matter, Jock left Southfork. However, they quickly reconciled and went on a second honeymoon to Paris. Upon returning to the United States, Jock and Miss Ellie arrived in Washington, D.C., where they were met by the U.S. State Department with a request for Jock to lead the development of the oil industry in Venezuela. Ellie returned to Southfork alone, while Jock attend conferences in Washington. Jock briefly returned to Dallas for a few hours before leaving for Venezuela. While flying back from Venezuela to Texas, the helicopter Jock was in collided with a small plane and crashed into a lake. Jock's body was never found, but he was declared dead in 1982. The storyline involving Jock's death was necessitated by the death of actor Jim Davis. A tribute to Davis was shown at the end of the episode \\"The Search\\"; a picture of Davis and the words \\"Jim Davis 1909-1981\\" was displayed for some moments as the final seconds of musical score played out before the final commercial break. A memorial headstone to Jock stands on Southfork Ranch, beside Miss Ellie's headstone and grave. ===Wes Parmalee storyline=== In a storyline during the 1986‚Äì87 season of the show, a man named Wes Parmalee (portrayed by Steve Forrest) came to Dallas, where Clayton and Ray hired him as ranch foreman on Southfork. One day, Miss Ellie found Jock's belt buckle, knife, letters and photo of a young Miss Ellie in Parmalee's room. Wes then claimed to be Jock Ewing, and that he had survived the helicopter accident, which necessitated plastic surgery and rehab in a South American hospital. After passing a series of tests set by J.R. and Bobby, including X-ray tests, a polygraph test and knowledge about the Ewing family, including Jock's first wife Amanda and Ray being Jock's son, Wes convinced many in Dallas, in addition to Miss Ellie, Ray and several other members of the Ewing family, that he could be Jock. However, Clayton, Bobby and J.R. utterly refused to believe any suggestion that Wes was Jock. Bobby flew down and talked with the doctor who had treated Jock for a severe fever while he was in South America. Bobby returned to Southfork and revealed this information at a Ewing barbecue, where Jock's best friend Punk Anderson said that while he had the fever, Jock was telling the history of the Ewing family. This small piece of evidence against Wes Parmalee being Jock Ewing was seized upon. By then, Ray had told Wes that his presence was causing a lot of trouble to the family, just before Wes went to see Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie told her family that Wes had told her that he wasn't Jock but this was moments after Bobby arrived from South America in the helicopter. Wes arrived at the barbecue where upon he went to meet with Miss Ellie played by Barbara Bel Geddes. However, the scene where this meeting with Miss Ellie supposedly happened only occurred off screen. Additionally, with hindsight the fact that his X-ray tests showed he had identical bone breakage scarring identical to Jock's, X-rays would seem to support his claim that he was actually Jock. The producers left Wes's departure deliberately ambiguous. This particular storyline was an experiment to gauge an attempt to restore the late Jim Davis's character to the show, because the Producers had decided not to recast immediately after the actor's death. The intentions by the Producers in season ten were for Wes Parmalee to actually be revealed as Jock Ewing. Ultimately, viewer reaction to this storyline was mixed but not favorable, as Miss Ellie had found happiness with her re-marriage to Clayton Farlow (Howard Keel) and that the actor contracted to play Wes/Jock, Steve Forrest (then at 61), was sixteen years younger than his predecessor, Jim Davis. The Lorimar producers reluctantly yielded to viewers and reneged on the original outcome of the storyline, which would have restored the character of Jock Ewing to the series, leaving the character of Jock supposedly dead for good by the end of the tenth season. However because of the ambiguous nature that the character of Wes departed in, there was a possibility they could bring the character back in the future. However, the character of Wes was not referred to in any of the future seasons. Additionally, although the evidence presented by Bobby was only hearsay there was actually no concrete evidence to disprove that he was actually Jock. Since the tenth season was broadcast and with the ambiguous ending to Wes Parmalee's departure, some fans have speculated that Wes may have actually been Jock Ewing, but left to spare Miss Ellie and his family any more pain. It is also interesting to note that Wes disappeared after meeting with Jeremy Wendell, who was interested in acquiring Ewing Oil, and who told Wes that he did not care if he was Jock or not, as he was only concerned about defrauding the Ewings. ===Legacy=== Jock Ewing's Lincoln Mark V in a Southfork gift shop After Jim Davis' death, artist Ro Kim painted a portrait of the actor in his role as Jock Ewing. The portrait became a focal point of the Dallas set and was featured in a number of episodes. The painting hung in the home of Dallas star Larry Hagman, who played antagonist J.R. Ewing for many years until he decided to sell the portrait at auction in spring 2011. The Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas, where Dallas exteriors were shot, features a different Jock Ewing portrait as a focal point of its \\"Jock's Living Room\\". Jock Ewing as played by Jim Davis drove the same 1978 Lincoln Mark V with the license plate EWING 1 for all four seasons in which he starred, the vehicle is still on the grounds of the Southfork ranch to this day, parked in one of the gift shops. ==References== ==External links== *Jock Ewing Biography at Ultimate Dallas.com Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1978 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional World War II veterans ","title":"Jock Ewing"},{"id":"7782126","text":"Royal Air Force Crosby-on-Eden or more simply RAF Crosby-on-Eden was a former Royal Air Force station located north east of Carlisle, Cumbria and west of Brampton, Cumbria.

With appeal for reluctant and advanced readers, this novel is a rare gem.\\" Kristi Elle Jemtegaard reviewing the audiobook for Horn Book Magazine described it as \\"breakneck plotting, pungent descriptions studded with vivid period details (like the carpet of lice on the floor of Newgate prison), and the desperate plight of the two children trapped in another century give Doyle ample opportunity to display his dramatic skills. The last- minute change of heart that sets up the sequel in the final moments will leave listeners anxious for more.\\" Gideon the Cutpurse was shortlisted for the 2007 Branford Boase Award. ==The Time Thief== Kate and Peter's father try to rescue Peter, but land in 1792, 29 years forward.

They appeared later in some crossovers: * In Total Eclipse The Seraphim Objective, a Total Eclipse one-shot tie-in. * In Jack Kirby's TeenAgents #3, in the Secret City Saga as a part of the Kirbyverse. ==Plot synopsis== The series told the story of a team of four (later five) former criminals, all of whom incidentally had super powers. After the U.S. government quickly learns that the cost of locking up super-powered criminals is prohibitive, the original four team members‚ÄîCimarron, Crackshot, Slick, and Burnout‚Äîare offered an early parole in exchange for protecting their country against other super-powered criminals. Members of the Liberty Project are: *Burnout (Beatrice Keogh) ‚Äì an angry, angst-filled youngster who can generate flames with a mere thought. Arrested for multiple counts of arson, she was kept sedated and floating in a sensory deprivation tank at a high-security juvenile facility until she became a member of the Project. *Cimarron (Rosalita Vasquez) ‚Äì a feisty, short- tempered Latina from Texas. She has super strength and limited invulnerability. She was originally arrested for destroying the Las Vegas strip after losing her last dollar at slots. *Crackshot (Lee Alexander Clayton) ‚Äì While he was arrested for a string of petty thefts and misdemeanor crimes, Crackshot's real power is the preternatural ability to hit anything he aims at; he also shows extraordinary mechanical ability, inventing a miniature particle accelerator while he was still in high school. As the only team member who sought to rehabilitate himself, he was offered a position with the Project in order to keep him from returning to a life of crime. *Slick (Nicholas Walcek) ‚Äì His name reflects both his slippery powers and his slippery personality. He is the reluctant leader, with the power to render surfaces with a very low coefficient of friction (i.e. make very slippery).

The Osaka Conference of 1875 attempted to address this issue by the establishment of the Genr≈çin, a national assembly whose members (theoretically appointed directly by the Emperor) were drawn from the peerage, upper ranks of the bureaucracy and various scholars.

FEMIS () is an acronym for Fondation Europ√©enne pour les M√©tiers de l'Image et du Son. Based in Paris, it offers courses balanced between artistic research, professional development and technical training. In 2012, The Hollywood Reporter rated La f√©mis no.6 in its best international film school rankings (it included U.S.-based film schools) and no.3 in its 2014 best international film school rankings (it excluded U.S.-based film schools). Its alumni have won three of the world's most prestigious film prizes - Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm, Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and Berlin International Film Festival's Golden Bear - ten times, making it the most rewarded film school in the world, preceding the Beijing Film Academy and the Tisch School of the Arts of New York City, in winning those three prizes. ==History== La F√©mis From 1944 to 1985, the IDHEC (Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques) was the main French film school ‚Äî training 1,439 French and foreign film professionals. In 1985, the school was restructured under the supervision of the then Minister of Culture Jack Lang and La F√©mis was created in 1986. Originally, scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carri√®re was its president and Jack Gajos was its director. When La F√©mis was created, the school had seven teaching departments: direction, screenwriting, picture, sound, editing, production, and set design. A script continuity course was added in 1992 and a distribution/exploitation course in 2003. Lastly the master-class workshop, a European production training program, was co-created with the Filmakademie Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Ludwigsburg, Germany in 2002. La F√©mis is a full member of CILECT, the international network of film schools. The school is now a public establishment under the responsibility of the Ministry of culture and communication. The school first opened in the Palais de Tokyo (Paris 16e), moving on February 15, 1999 to the old Rapid Film - Path√© Studios at 6, rue Francoeur (18e). Their founder and French prime class producer Bernard Natan was deported by the Nazis 1942. In 2019 the French director Michel Hazanivicius was appointed as chairman of the board. ==Curriculum== La Femis (film set 1) The main curriculum students follow a four-year training course. During the first year, they all follow the same general course: initiation into the various jobs involved in filmmaking, experimenting in every technical position within a film crew. During the second and third year, they follow a specific curriculum depending on the department they have chosen, including theoretical classes, exercises, days devoted to film analysis, analytical seminars and collective exercises making films. They spend their fourth year fulfilling an individual end-of-studies project (known as \\"travail de fin d'√©tudes\\" or TFE) and taking part in their classmates' projects. In sum, the school is designed to foster an applied cinephilia, in which the study of films past and present underwrites advanced skills in the practicalities of filmmaking; returning alumni, like Jean Paul Civeyrac, who come back to themselves lead seminars, carry on this tradition of encouraging advanced auteurist ambitions among the new students.Palmer, Tim (2011). Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema, Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT. . The school is the subject of a 2016 French film called Le Concours (The Graduation), directed by Claire Simon about the exhaustive application process to be accepted as a student. ==Alumni== La F√©mis has trained over 700 students in all filmmaking trades: directors, screenwriters, producers, editors, cameramen, sound engineers, decorators, script supervisors, distributors and exhibition managers/executives.

The character is played by Charlene Tilton and first appeared in the series premiere on April 2, 1978. Tilton left the show at the end of season 8 in 1985, before returning for the last two episodes of season 11 in 1988, becoming a series regular again in season 12. Lucy was then written out again in 1990. Lucy appeared in one episode of the Dallas spin-off Knots Landing - Season One, Episode 6: \\"Home is for Healing\\" (1980). She returned as a guest star in the continuation of Dallas in 2012. ==Background== Lucy is the eldest daughter of Gary Ewing and wife Valene Clements Ewing. She is also the elder sister of twins Bobby and Betsy Ewing (born in 1984, Knots Landing) and half- sister to Molly Whittaker (born in 1993, Knots Landing), though she has never had any onscreen interaction with her siblings. Because her father had a drinking problem, her parents' marriage collapsed. Gary then abandoned Valene at Southfork Ranch while Lucy was still an infant. Valene intended to raise the child by herself but was run out of town by Gary's older brother J.R. Ewing, who then returned Lucy to Southfork Ranch where she was raised by her grandparents, Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. ==Storylines== When the show started, she was the show's teenaged troublemaking, confused vixen and involved with ranch foreman Ray Krebbs, who would later turn out to be her uncle. She would skip school and spend her time with him in the hayloft. Eventually, they were caught by her uncle Bobby's young bride, Pam. If Lucy would start going to school, Pamela would not tell anyone about them. However, briefly, Lucy got the upper hand by framing her math tutor for sexual assault. In exchange for clearing him, she wanted Pamela to lie for her and tell her grandparents she was doing well in school. However the plan backfired and Lucy was made to finish school. After Ray decided to end things with Lucy, she fell in love with Kit Mainwaring, a man her own age. They were briefly engaged in 1979, but they ended their relationship after Kit revealed to Lucy that he was gay. When Valene and Gary remarried in the same year and moved to the Californian suburb of Knots Landing, Lucy went to visit them with the possibility of living with them permanently. However, after spending a week with them in California, Lucy opted to return to Dallas. Shortly after, Lucy developed and overcame a drug problem. After quitting cold turkey, she developed a relationship with a young attorney named Alan Beam - unbeknownst to Lucy, one of J.R.'s flunkies - in 1979; they became engaged, and the engagement was broken when Lucy realized that she did not love Alan. For a short time after this engagement, she was involved with her literature professor, Greg Forrester, whom was married. Lucy married med student Mitch Cooper in 1981, but their goals in life differed; Mitch was from a poor background, but wanted to become a doctor, while Lucy had no goals. Lucy's wealthy background was a huge problem in their marriage, and after a few months of marriage they separated. Lucy started modeling and became involved with psychopath Roger Larsen, her photographer. Roger became obsessed with Lucy and eventually kidnapped her, planning to force her to leave Dallas with him. However, Pam and Bobby rescued her. In quick succession in 1982, Lucy divorced Mitch, but realised she was pregnant with Roger's baby after he had raped her, and she had an abortion. In the 1982-83 season, following the death of her grandfather Jock, Lucy inherited $5 million. She then became involved with Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter, a relationship that ended with Mickey's death. Supposedly, the death was caused only by Sue Ellen's DUI. Actually, Sue Ellen was driving J.R.'s car when Mickey Trotter climbed into the car to try to stop her. The car was intentionally hit by Walt Driscoll, an enemy of J.R.'s who wanted to kill him. After finding out he had caused severe injuries to an innocent young man (Mickey was left paralysed and later became braindead), Driscoll then committed suicide. Mickey later died when Ray turned off his life support machine at his mother's request. Over time, Lucy changed her ways and matured. Mitch and Lucy got back together and remarried in 1985. They then moved to Atlanta. However, their second marriage collapsed due to Mitch's work load as a doctor, and she decided to split up while visiting her family in Dallas in 1988. Lucy and Mitch divorced for the second time in January 1989. In April 1990, Lucy decided to move to Italy. Lucy is briefly mentioned in the series finale \\"Conundrum\\", where it is revealed that in a life without her scheming and power-hungry uncle J.R., Lucy would never have been born. She is also briefly mentioned in the 1996 television movie Dallas: J.R. Returns, but appears in neither the last episode nor the reunion film. ==Dallas (2012 TV series)== Lucy appears as an occasional guest star in the 2012 continuation of Dallas. In 2012, Lucy attends her cousin Christopher's wedding to Rebecca Sutter (aka Pamela Rebecca Barnes). She also attends Bobby's final family barbecue, which at the time is thought to be the last time they will ever step on Southfork Ranch while it is Ewing-owned. Later, Lucy has lunch with John Ross, who asks her to help him convince her father, Gary Ewing, to sign over his Southfork mineral rights to J.R. but she refuses. In 2013, Lucy attended the funeral of J.R. which is held at Southfork. Later, Lucy shows up at Southfork with her mother, Val, to see her father, Gary (the first time the three of them have appeared onscreen together since Lucy's wedding in 1981). She appeared again in 2014 when she attended the wedding of her cousin John Ross to Pamela Rebecca Barnes. Lucy's personal life and romantic status are not addressed on the new series. ==In popular culture== Lucy was nicknamed \\"The Poison Dwarf\\" by Terry Wogan on his BBC Radio 2 show in the 1980s.

Though he is a \\"Company Man,\\" he deeply cares for his family and will do anything to protect them, particularly his adopted daughter Claire, and puts their safety above all else. He is also known as \\"Glasses Man\\". Bennet has had a number of associates, most notably a mysterious man most commonly known as \\"The Haitian,\\" who has the power to prevent other heroes from exercising their powers in his presence, as well as to remove select memories from people's minds. Bennet's other known associates have been Eden McCain, a woman with the power of mind control who kills herself to keep Sylar from gaining her ability; Claude Rains, Bennet's first partner who has the power to turn invisible; and a romantic couple composed of Hank, a doctor with unknown abilities and his significant other, Lisa, who also has unknown abilities. Rains is the first person to question Bennet's actions and those of The Company. Bennet is charged with executing Rains for his insubordination on moral grounds, but Rains escapes by literally disappearing into thin air. Bennet's true agenda and overall affiliation are mysterious. In response to Matt Parkman's inquiries as to whether he works for the FBI or the CIA, Bennet said he doesn't work for \\"any organization that has initials.\\" Furthermore, he has worked for and against The Company and for and against Mr. Linderman. These factors cloud his true allegiances. His one allegiance that is clear, however, is that to his daughter, Claire; his son, Lyle; and his wife, Sandra. Bennet loves his daughter profusely, but is also overprotective of her. This sometimes leads him to use his authority and associates in unsavory ways. Past, present and future events all indicate that Bennet has lied about Claire's biological origins multiple times. According to his driving license, his previous address is 9 Juniper Lane, Odessa, Texas. Noah Bennet speaks Japanese and also appears to speak at least some Ukrainian. Although he does not seem to possess any powers, his extensive experience in dealing with beings with superpowers allows him to be able to handle them effectively. Also, he displays considerable prowess in hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship. == Beginnings == In the episode \\"The Wall\\", Samuel uses the ability of Damien to reveal Noah's life before joining The Company to Claire. In 1985, Noah lived in Los Angeles with his first wife Kate as a used car salesman. Soon after learning Kate is pregnant, the two are attacked by a telekinetic named Richard in their home resulting in Kate's death. Before wanting to find the killer, Noah develops signs of psychotic depression and paranoia before he spends the next year mapping and tracking people with abilities. After encountering one of the people he is tracking, Noah demands that he tell him where he can find Richard, but is attacked and is forced to kill him in self-defence. Soon after, Noah is approached by Eric Thompson Sr. with an offer to join Primatech and assistance in finding Richard. After two years and several deaths on his cases Noah is encouraged by Thompson to marry to calm him so there are fewer incidents, suggesting to Noah to look at the waitress working at the restaurant, who turns out to be Sandra. Soon after, the two meet and then marry; they spend their honeymoon in West Berlin, Germany where Noah acts as informant for Thompson's assignment (From the Files of Primatech, Part 5: 1988). In \\"Company Man\\", a flashback episode, it is revealed that Noah Bennet's former partner years ago was Claude, with whom he rescued Claire from the fire her biological mother caused by pyrokinesis. However, because Claude was hiding \\"one of them\\", Bennet was forced to kill him. However, Claude later turned out to be alive‚Äîhe had used his powers to become invisible when Bennet shot him, disappearing from view. In \\"Company Man\\", an episode that takes place over 16 years before \\"Genesis\\", Kaito Nakamura arranges for Noah to adopt Claire as an assignment and Bennet later allows them to plant the catalyst of the genetic modification formula‚Äî a formula that can grant superpowers to any and all who are injected with it‚Äî into Claire's body. In Six Months Ago, he turns the wanted criminal and mind controller Eden McCain into one of his operatives. At about the same time, he is contacted by Chandra Suresh, who has found Claire's picture on her high school's web site after identifying her as having potential powers. After Chandra leaves, Bennet orders Eden McCain to become a neighbor of Chandra Suresh and remove Claire's name from Chandra's list of superpowered humans. == Character history == === Genesis === Noah Bennet first appears in \\"Genesis\\", the first episode. He is found in the apartment of Chandra Suresh in Madras, India. Chandra's son Mohinder enters the apartment, but leaves quickly after realizing Bennet is there as well. Bennet seems to notice Mohinder, and later follows him to New York. There, Bennet is one of Mohinder's afternoon passengers during his job as a taxicab driver. Bennet begins pleasantly referencing his travels, and stating that he'll be happy to see his family again. The conversation turns as he mentions personal facts about Mohinder, ultimately resulting in Mohinder fleeing his own cab. Finally, Bennet comes home to Odessa and greets his family. The next morning in \\"Don't Look Back\\", Claire states her desire to meet her biological parents. Bennet is reluctant, but doesn't outright say \\"no.\\" After Claire gets home from school, Bennet says he'll start contacting the adoption agency and look for her biological parents. After a happy Claire leaves the room, Bennet is seen watching a video tape of Claire demonstrating her healing abilities. In \\"Collision\\", Bennet is first seen standing over Matt Parkman, who is strapped to a gurney. Bennet calmly converses with Matt, advising him to relax. Bennet also checks the readout of a machine used to gauge when Parkman is trying to read Bennet's mind. Bennet explains that the Haitian is blocking Matt's powers. Nevertheless, Matt is able to pull the name \\"Claire\\" from Bennet's mind. Bennet is impressed by Matt's growing ability, and then tells the Haitian to \\"go deep\\" with Matt, who is last heard screaming. That morning, back at the Bennet house, Bennet finds that a distraught Claire has just come home. Bennet assumes from Claire's bare, mud-covered feet that she was out all night. Bennet has to get to work, but states that they'll talk later. He is then seen monitoring Nathan Petrelli, who has just had a one-night stand with Niki/Jessica Sanders. Bennet tells the Haitian to kidnap \\"just the one\\" (Nathan). In the next episode, \\"Hiros\\", Bennet and the Haitian attempt to force Nathan into a car, but he escapes by flying away. Bennet is then seen at Texas hospital visiting Claire. Claire explains that Brody is a rapist and attempted to force himself on her. After speaking to one of his victims, Claire was motivated to do something. She only wanted to \\"scare\\" Brody, but as he sat in the passenger seat and said he wouldn't stop raping girls, she ultimately crashed his car intentionally. Claire begs her father not to tell anyone, and Bennet merely says he'll take care of it. Bennet then appears in Brody's room, followed by the Haitian. He says that she is going through 'a confusing time', telling that he knows of her powers. He tells the boy that he is being given a chance to start over in life and Bennet then tells the Haitian to \\"hollow him out\\" and \\"take everything\\" (erase all of Brody's memories, including that of his own name). Finally, in \\"Better Halves\\", Bennet has set up a meeting between Claire and his two associates, Hank and Lisa. Bennet presents the two as Claire's biological parents. While carefully watching the two with his wife Sandra, Bennet receives a call from Eden McCain, his spy in New York. Eden relays information about Mohinder, Isaac Mendez (\\"the precog\\") and the message \\"save the cheerleader, save the world.\\" Bennet is disturbed by the last part, but regains his composure. Bennet tells Eden to prevent Mohinder from leaving New York and to \\"bring in the precog.\\" After Hank and Lisa exit the Bennet home, Noah Bennet follows the two outside and thanks them for their service. At this point his wife, Sandra, lets slip to Claire that they'd had problems finding her parents in the past and that she was surprised that Noah Bennet managed to do it now. Bennet asks Isaac, whom Eden \\"persuaded\\" to come with her, to help him to prevent Claire from being murdered by Sylar at her homecoming game the next night. Bennet has collected three previous paintings Isaac created depicting a terrified Claire close-up, running up the bleachers in a football stadium, and lying dead on the ground with the top of her skull removed. When Isaac is unable to paint without the use of heroin and resists taking the drug, Bennet orders Eden to use her powers to make Isaac believe he wants to use the drug. Bennet becomes frustrated after Isaac is unable to paint something that makes sense to him. When Eden protests his actions, Bennet shows her a series of photographs depicting Sylar's dead victims‚Äîall with their brains removed from their heads‚Äîand says he is determined to save his daughter from such a fate. He orders Eden to go to the homecoming game and look for Sylar and grounds Claire to prevent her from being killed. Bennet discovers later, however, that Claire snuck out and worriedly runs to the school to find her. When he arrives, he is too late to stop Sylar from attacking the cheerleader in the pictures. Bennet soon discovers that the victim was not Claire; rather, it was Jackie Wilcox, one of Claire's fellow cheerleaders. A relatively relieved Bennet soon reunites with his daughter and insists they go home while the police handle things. Claire says that she has something to tell her father regarding her uncanny survival. In the episode \\"Fallout\\", Claire's father reveals that he knew about her powers long before she was aware of them. He acknowledges doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him. In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him \\"tick.\\" Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. When Claire finds out that the two of them have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so. In \\"Godsend\\", Bennet believes Claire's memory has been erased. Claire acts as if it has, as well. However, Bennet and Claire are slowly drifting apart. At Primatech Paper, the FBI investigates the building as well as Bennet and his associates. Though they find nothing, Officer Parkman knows Bennet's up to something and has realized that Bennet kidnapped him. Bennet is unfazed, however, and simply tells Matt \\"good luck\\" in regards to his vendetta. Next, Bennet shows up at the apartment of Mohinder Suresh in New York. Mohinder is defensive, recalling Bennet's past actions. However, Bennet means him no harm, and even mentions Eden. Soon, he makes a proposition. Bennet tells Mohinder that together they could make a difference, and asks Mohinder to join him. Mohinder says he isn't interested, but Bennet leaves his card anyway. Bennet returns to Sylar's holding area in \\"The Fix\\". There, he finds Hank telling him that Sylar's vital signs are highly irregular and he may be dying. Bennet tells Hank to keep him alive, referencing orders from his superiors to that effect. Furthermore, he states that Sylar will \\"die on [Bennet's] terms,\\" not his own. At home, Bennet finds Claire and Zach are \\"working on a school project\\" together, according to Claire. Claire also acts as if she'd rather not spend time with Zach. Bennet, however, tells her that she had been friends and encourages her to see if they might not find something in common. After Zach and she go upstairs, Bennet gets a call from Hank. Hank states that Sylar has died, which Bennet replies is \\"less than ideal.\\" Bennet then tells Hank to prepare Sylar \\"for shipping.\\" Back at Sylar's cell, Bennet finds the body of a dead Hank where Sylar should be. Bennet then turns around to find Sylar calmly standing in front of him. Sylar asks about Claire, then states his intentions to kill her. After telekinetically throwing Bennet against a wall and playing with the lights, Sylar leaves Bennet trapped in the cell. Later, at the Bennet home, he and the Haitian narrowly save Sandra from Sylar. Although Sylar escapes, Bennet is confident he will catch the killer. After the Haitian wipes Sandra's memories yet again, Bennet is called by Isaac Mendez. Mendez is revealed to be working with Bennet, as he relays information about Peter Petrelli. In \\"Unexpected\\", Bennet and the Haitian manage to track down Peter and Claude. They fire Tasers at Claude, but Peter unexpectedly utilizes his powers to stop the electrodes and fly away from them. Bennet is then called by Claire, who tells him that Sandra has collapsed for unknown reasons. Bennet heads back home, and is confronted by Claire in the hospital, where she reveals that she remembers everything that the Haitian was supposed to erase. Afterwards, the Bennet family returns home, where they are confronted by Ted Sprague and Matt Parkman. The episode \\"Company Man\\" begins with the hostage- taking of the Bennet family by Sprague and Parkman, who are in search of answers. Noah Bennet has revelations about his company during this situation, showing that he initially came to work for \\"The Company\\" under the supervision of a man named Thompson, and partnered with Claude. He is eventually ordered to kill Claude, because Claude apparently was hiding \\"one of them\\" from The Company. During the confrontation with Sprague, Thompson comes through the back door and shoots Ted, who goes into an uncontrolled radioactive state. Noah Bennet and Matt escape the house, while Claire tranquilizes Sprague. After this, Matt and Ted are taken to the paper factory. Thompson asks Bennet when Claire should be showing up at the factory. It is at that moment that Bennet realizes he's too attached to Claire. The graphic novel \\"Family Man\\" reveals that, at this point, Noah Bennet decides that he must do what he can to save Claire and \\"bring down the people [he] work[s] for.\\" Having noticed that he is being followed by someone from The Company, Noah Bennet drives to a cybercaf√© and sends a message to Hana asking for help, which she agrees to do. The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then \\"Go deep\\" and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead \\"them\\" to Claire. The Haitian follows the order, then takes Claire away to protect her, as instructed. In \\"Parasite\\", Bennet is questioned by Thompson; he claims that the last thing he remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to \\"clean up\\" Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that they have no idea what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. \\"Sandra\\" then transforms back into Candice, and other members of the Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her. In \\".07%\\", Bennet is now in the custody of Primatech, in a solitary cell. His will to protect Claire is challenged by Candice, who shapeshifts into Claire's form; Bennet recognizes the ruse right away and tells her and Thompson that he does not know where Claire is and will never give her up to them. Thompson threatens to kill Bennet, but Bennet notes that if they really wanted him dead, they'd have killed him by now. Thompson tells Bennet that he is merely waiting on orders to do so. Realizing that the only hope of stopping Thompson and his superiors will be to escape from Primatech, Bennet telepathically gives instructions to Matt Parkman, who is also being held prisoner, on how to break out of his cell. Matt is then told to fetch Sprague from his cell so that Sprague can generate an EMP to shut down the power at Primatech, which will then allow them to break Bennet out of his cell. Matt is reluctant to go along with the plan, and Sprague doesn't trust Bennet, but eventually the three of them work together to escape. Over breakfast at the Burnt Toast Diner, Bennet reveals that the only way to stop Thompson is to get to New York City to destroy the tracking device that tracks heroes tagged with the neck tattoo, and he produces bus tickets to take them there. When Matt asks if Mr. Linderman is in New York, Bennet seems surprised by Matt's knowledge of the name. Matt guesses correctly that Bennet was \\"middle management\\" and is somewhat incredulous that Bennet seems not to know who was signing his paychecks all those years. Bennet tells Matt to forget about Linderman and that it is more important that they get to New York and destroy the tracker. Sprague casts the deciding vote to go to New York City, and Matt reluctantly agrees to join them on their destination. After escaping from Primatech Paper with Sprague and Parkman, the three of them head for New York to destroy the tracking system and the company. In \\"The Hard Part\\", Bennet, Parkman and Sprague steal a car and head for New York. Bennet reveals that the Company has a new tracking system called the Walker system. He reveals that this system doesn't need radio isotopes or tracers to find you; it just knows where you are. Unbeknownst to Bennet, the Walker tracker system is later revealed to be Molly Walker, who has the ability to mentally find anyone in the world, just by thinking about them. The three arrive at Kirby Plaza, where Micah Sanders and Molly Walker are located. Claire sees the trio coming, and father and daughter reunite. Peter then notices his hands beginning to glow. Bennet realizes that Peter is absorbing Ted's power, and Peter and Claire look at each other worriedly. After Peter controls himself, the group splits in two, with Peter, Claire, and Sprague going to a remote town in Nebraska, and Parkman and Bennet continuing with their mission to destroy the tracking system. Bennet knows where they need to go, but he needs Parkman's powers to allow them access. Matt confronts a security guard and convinces him that they know each other and had spoken outside of work the previous night. Upon revealing an embarrassing secret of the guard's, the man lets them in without hesitation. While waiting for the elevator, they bump into Jessica and D.L., with Jessica surprised to see Matt still alive. The four go up in the elevator together, with Bennet telling them where to find Linderman. Bennet and Parkman then get off at the floor where the tracking system is, only to find Thompson waiting for them. Parkman saves Bennet from getting shot, only to have Bennet leave him defenseless against Thompson. Thompson then comes up behind Parkman, puts a gun to his head, and asks him, \\"What am I thinking now, Parkman?\\" Bennet comes from the side and says, \\"Your last thought.\\" killing Thompson with two point blank gunshots to the head. The two then proceed to find the tracking system, where both are surprised to find it's a young girl ‚Äî though only Matt is completely surprised: Bennet claims he knew it was a person, just not a little girl ‚Äî whom Matt had previously rescued from Sylar, and who thought of Matt as \\"my hero.\\" Matt protests killing her, but Bennet says it must be done in order to save the others. The two continue to argue until Matt is suddenly knocked out by Mohinder from behind. The episode ends with Mohinder pointing a gun on Bennet while the latter points his gun on Molly, both men threatening to shoot. Parkman wakes up, ending the standoff. Bennet asks Molly to locate Sylar, which she does - he's nearby. He later finds Peter after he passed out from nearly exploding, thanks him for saving Claire and agrees to kill him if it comes to that. He also reveals his first name, telling Peter to \\"Call me Noah.\\" In the climax of \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man,\\" Peter, Noah, and Matt confront Sylar in the plaza. Bennet is immediately thrown against a wall, rendering him incapable of stopping Peter if he explodes. === Generations === Four months after the incidents in New York, the Bennets have gone into hiding, having moved to Costa Verde, California, and assumed the last name of \\"Butler.\\" Noah takes a subordinate job at a copy store called Copy Kingdom, and makes it very clear that he won't stand for his younger superior's bullying management style. Despite going into hiding, he is still working to take down \\"the Company\\" with the help of Mohinder Suresh. In \\"Lizards\\", Noah tells his wife about a series of eight paintings done by the late Isaac Mendez, each depicting the death of a single person. He possesses the first, which predicts the death of Kaito Nakamura, and intends to locate the other seven. At the end of the episode, Noah is reunited with the Haitian; the accompanying graphic novel shows that Mohinder directed the Haitian to Bennet. In \\"Kindred\\", Mohinder finds the last of the eight paintings, this one depicting Noah's death. He is lying on the ground with a bullet hole through the left lens of his glasses. A girl resembling Claire is in the background, apparently being held by someone. In \\"Fight or Flight\\", Noah and the Haitian travel to Odessa, Ukraine, to find the remaining paintings. While there, he receives a call from Mohinder explaining that Molly Walker has fallen into a catatonic state and he wishes to take her to the Company for observation. Noah is unable to talk him out of it, though he warns that they'll have Mohinder as soon as he relinquishes that which he cares about. In \\"The Line\\", Noah tracks down his old mentor, Ivan. He has the Haitian remove precious memories (marriage day, kids being born, etc.) from the old man one by one until Ivan succumbs and reveals where the paintings are. Knowing that his method of interrogation, as well as trying to use the Haitian to cover his tracks, will alert the Company, he instead opts to kill his mentor, making the affair appear to be a simple home invasion. In \\"Out of Time\\", Noah and Suresh attempt to make sense of the paintings Noah and the Haitian have just found. The one in question is a painting of Suresh holding a Company-issue gun that has just been fired. Noah takes pictures of the paintings in an effort to send them to Suresh, but Suresh refuses stating his life may be in danger. Afterwards, Noah and the Haitian burn the entire collection and Noah returns home. West has dropped by without notice that same morning and made breakfast for Claire. As Noah walks into the house, West sees Noah and remembers who he is. West runs outside and abruptly flies away without being seen by Noah. Having left behind a newspaper detailing the incident with the drunk cheerleader, it ends up in hand of Noah, who sees it as a threat to the family. He confronts Claire and tells her she is putting the life of their family in danger. Furthermore, he tells her and the family to pack their things, and they are leaving immediately. Claire then calls her father out, stating that he was not being honest about his \\"trip\\" he took for \\"management training\\". Claire defiantly tells her father that she is not moving anywhere else and walks out of the room. In \\"Cautionary Tales\\", Bob, Elle, and Mohinder arrive in Costa Verde to take Claire. Though they are eventually successful, Noah manages to capture Elle. Noah brokers a trade with Bob, getting his daughter back in exchange for Bob's. When Elle breaks free and tries to kill West and Claire, Noah shoots her in the arm. He then prepares to execute Bob, citing that Claire will never be free so long as the Company survives. But Mohinder shoots Noah, mimicking Isaac's painting exactly, and Noah is struck in the left eye and dies. While his family believes him to be dead, the episode ends with Noah in a Company facility, strapped to a gurney and being given a transfusion of Claire's blood; his destroyed eye subsequently regenerates and he returns to life. In \\"Truth & Consequences\\", Mohinder tells him that he was revived with Claire's blood and that Claire is at home, thinking he is dead. During the episode, with Noah still in the hands of The Company, Bob visits the Bennets' home with an urn telling them that it contains Noah's ashes. In \\"Powerless\\", Noah returns to his family, clearly shocking them all as he is allegedly dead. He tells them that he was brought back using Claire's blood, and that he made a deal with The Company which will allow his family to lead a normal life with one condition; he must stay with the Company. Noah then leaves his family. === Villains === In \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", Noah is imprisoned by the Company. Elle releases him from his cell so that he can help in the apprehension of Sylar during the attack on the Level 5 facility. After Elle inadvertently knocks out Sylar and causes a breakdown of the complex security system, Noah ---fearing the worst after seeing Sylar demonstrate Claire's ability---places Sylar in a cell and makes his own escape. Later, when Noah visits the house and sees Claire alive but traumatized, he explains that he cannot stay as he has to recapture the superhumans who escaped during Sylar's attack, stating \\"They're villains, Claire, and I'm one of the only people on the planet who knows how to stop them,\\" and even showing her some info on the escapees. Before leaving, Noah tells her that he's enlisted Claire's biological mom, the pyrokinetic Meredith Gordon, to help protect the family. Going back to the Company to bring the escapees in, Noah, on orders from new CEO Angela Petrelli, is partnered with Sylar, much to his chagrin. When they arrive at the bank where a group of escapees are causing trouble, Noah orders Sylar to stay out of his way and let him handle the escapees, but Sylar uses his sharp tongue to convince the police that they are FBI agents so they can get through. Noah manages to free the hostages, but is then taken hostage himself. Just as Knox and Jesse Murphy (now free of Peter's influence) are about to start beating him up, Sylar enters and stops them both with his telekinesis, also neutralizing Jesse's power. Noah reminds him of the \\"plan\\", and Sylar replies \\"You just said that to make sure I didn't.\\" Soon afterwards, Sylar loses control, locks Noah out of the bank, and kills Jesse for his power, allowing Knox to escape. Back at Level 5, Noah mentions to the Haitian that he only plans to be partnered with Sylar long enough to ascertain a weakness, to which then he'll kill him. When he chastises Sylar for the death of Jesse, he merely states that \\"rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight.\\" Later on, he and Sylar arrive at the home of Stephen Canfield and discover Claire there, having already attempted to capture him, only to find out that he is not truly evil. After Canfield opens up a vortex, which Claire, Noah, and Sylar barely avoid getting sucked into, and escapes, Noah orders Sylar to shut up after he attempts to apologize for what he did, and Claire tells him of Canfield's true colors. He assures her that he would not put someone in Level 5 who didn't belong there, and Claire tells him about Canfield's whereabouts. When they find Canfield, Noah attempts to force him to kill Sylar in exchange for his freedom, clearly convinced that Sylar cannot be redeemed, but Canfield instead opens up a vortex and sucks himself in, preferring death to becoming a monster. Noah and Sylar take Claire home, and the former assures her that he only does these things to protect her. When Claire, Meredith, and Sandra take down the puppet man Eric Doyle, they call Noah to take him in. Noah is impressed that Claire was able to help take out a very dangerous man, but Claire brushes him off, still angry with him about the Canfield incident and his partnership with Sylar. Noah then asks Meredith to accompany him as a partner. Following a phone call from Nathan Petrelli in \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", he and Meredith travel to Mohinder Suresh's laboratory in the loft of Isaac Mendez, where he advises Nathan and Tracy Strauss to get checked out by the Company. In \\"The Eclipse\\", when Pinehearst begins looking for the catalyst needed to perfect Mohinder's genetic modification formula, which is assumed to be Claire, Noah goes into hiding with her at the now-abandoned Canfield house and begins to teach her how to fight, but the father-daughter duo are soon attacked by Sylar and Elle. As their (and everyone else's) powers are negated due to a solar eclipse, Noah is more than a match for them, even dislocating Sylar's arm, but is ultimately forced to retreat when Claire takes a bullet from Elle that was meant for him. Angered and worried, Noah takes her home where he and Sandra treat her wound, and he decides against going to a hospital, believing it to be minor and unwilling to take the risk of her powers returning while they are there. He then leaves to get revenge on Sylar and Elle for Claire's injury. Noah tracks Sylar and Elle down at the Canfield household and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks into the house and shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult (\\"Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody.\\"), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet household and are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her. When Claire is returned to the present by Arthur Petrelli, she, Noah, Meredith, and Angela are trapped in Primatech when Sylar initiates the lockdown mode. Noah sends three escaped Level 5 inmates (Echo DeMille, Eric Doyle, and Danny Pine) after Sylar as bait, promising freedom to the first one to kill Sylar. However, Echo and Danny are killed by Sylar, and Doyle is incapacitated. Soon afterwards, Noah is led into a trap by Sylar, who locks him in a cell with Meredith, who has been injected with adrenaline, her ability becoming increasingly uncontrollable, and leaves him with a handgun with one bullet. Sylar tells him that he will have to choose between killing Meredith to save himself and explaining her death to Claire, or doing nothing and being burnt to death. However, Claire arrives at that moment, and Meredith, as per Noah's orders, superheats the bulletproof glass of the cell to weaken it, and then Noah shoots the glass to no avail. Claire then bodily throws herself through the window to help Noah escape, which he does. After Claire \\"kills\\" Sylar, she escapes with Noah and Angela just as Meredith finally loses control of her ability and unleashes a massive explosion. Afterwards, Noah comforts a tearful Claire as they watch Primatech burn to the ground. === Fugitives === In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\", Noah is seen to be working with Nathan Petrelli. When Mohinder Suresh is running away from Homeland Security, Noah arrives in a SUV and rescues him. As they escape, Noah asks him who he's been in contact with. They get to the exit only to discover that the hunter and his men have cut them off. Noah apologizes and then tasers Mohinder. When Peter Petrelli arrives at his apartment, Nathan is waiting for him. After he and Peter talk, Nathan smiles and asks for a hug, and Noah tasers Peter from behind. At the end of the episode, Noah is revealed to be the co-pilot of the cargo plane. In \\"Trust and Blood\\", Noah survives the crash of the plane like almost everyone else. He is retrieved by Danko and his soldiers. Bennet chases after the captured heroes and finds Claire and Peter running together. Bennet quickly grabs Claire but wants to shoot Peter, but Claire manages to convince Bennet to let Peter run. Bennet takes Claire back to Nathan. However, after a brief interrogation, Claire gets rescued by Daphne and she gets reunited with Hiro, Ando, Mohinder and Matt. Though Danko's soldiers quickly find Claire and her friends and shoot Daphne. Matt then uses his powers to take over the soldiers and have them kill themselves. Danko wants to shoot Matt, but Claire takes the bullets for him and gets arrested instead while the others flee. Nathan and Bennet finally convince Claire to return home to Costa Verde, where her mom is revealed to think Claire just spent 2 days looking to college brochures. Bennet in the meantime stays behind looking for the fugitives. When having another shot to take down both Tracy Strauss and Peter, Bennet again chooses not to shoot down Peter and allowing him to escape. After arresting Tracy, Nathan even thanks Bennet for it. In \\"Building 26\\" Claire reveals to her mother Sandra that Noah has been hunting down individuals with powers, and Sandra forces him to move out. He tells Claire that he will be around, and expresses a desire to be more honest with the family. He is later shown at a bar, where he is drugged and kidnapped by Peter Petrelli, Matt Parkman, and Mohinder Suresh. In \\"Cold Wars\\" Noah is being interrogated by Matt Parkman, Mohinder Suresh, and Peter Petrelli. Matt Parkman manages to pluck out memories at the expense of Noah being in pain, learning about the operation hunting people with abilities, this is also where we lurn Noah is colorblind. Noah is rescued by Danko's men, and tells Danko that he will henceforth cooperate with Danko's more heavy-handed approach to their job. However, he later meets with Angela Petrelli, where it is implied that he is working with her against Danko. Their precise goals are unclear. In \\"Shades of Gray\\", Nathan fires Danko as his second-in-command and appoints Noah to the position. Noah takes a call from Claire, who is asking how he managed to live a two- faced life for all this time, but Noah simply tells her he is the worst person to ask, and because she doesn't know which path to take, he doesn't know either. He later warns Angela that Danko is coming for her, but Angela says she is prepared. When Danko witnesses Nathan's ability of flight, he demands to know if Noah knew about it. In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\", Noah is accosted by Sandra in his hotel room, where she forces divorce papers on him and tells him she doesn't love him anymore. Noah discovers that she isn't really \\"Sandra,\\" but Sylar pretending to be her, as \\"Sandra's\\" signature on the papers is different from all of her other signatures. Discovering this, Noah confronts who he believes to be Sylar masquerading as Sandra in his hotel room, only to discover that it's the real Sandra, who is now scared to death of him and orders him out of the room. After being branded insane by Danko and his men, Noah is forced to run for his life and leave the operation. He is next seen driving up to Coyote Sands, meeting up with Claire and the Petrelli family. In \\"1961\\", he is seen digging graves in \\"Coyote Sands\\" alongside with Claire, Peter and Nathan by orders of Angela, due to her dreams about finding her sister. When the sandstorm hits the place, he is out looking for Claire and then is taken down by Mohinder, who later explains his father's involving in the relocation project. After finding and losing Alice again, he is seen together with Claire and the Petrelli family eating at a diner, when Angela decide they should form a new company; minutes later, they witness another Nathan at a live press conference, and Noah recognize him as Sylar. Followed in \\"I Am Sylar\\", as Nathan leaves the diner and Peter follows him, Noah, Claire and Angela decide to leave too, only to be intercepted in the road by Danko's agents. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", Noah is captured by the agents operating Building 26 shortly before Danko is framed for murdering several of his soldiers by Sylar. While captured, the two share a brief discussion about forming a partnership, which is ultimately short-lived. Once the two are freed from their cell by Hiro Nakamura, Danko waits for Noah to reveal what he knows about Sylar's plans and attempts to tranquilize him. Saved by Hiro, Noah intercepts Claire and Peter shortly after their encounter with Sylar and assists in convincing the Secret Service to help Peter save the President. Later, once Sylar is defeated, he works with Angela Petrelli and Matt Parkman to bring Nathan's personality to the forefront of Sylar's mind, thereby allowing Sylar to assume Nathan's life posthumously. After disbanding Building 26's personnel, the money is reallocated on \\"Nathan\\" and Noah's advice by the President into a new supervisory branch. When asked what to call this branch, Noah suggests, \\"The Company.\\" === Redemption === In the wake of the events from \\"An Invisible Thread\\", \\"Orientation and Jump, Push, Fall\\" shows that Noah Bennet has begun to revive the Company under the auspices of the United States government, but with a slow start. Tracy Strauss is still unaccounted for and appears to be murdering anyone who had a hand in her incarceration. Despite her attempt on his life, which Bennet survived with the help of Emile Danko, he refuses to start hunting down superhumans as a vigilante, preferring instead to try and start the new Company under better pretenses. While eating in the restaurant underneath his apartment, Tracy Strauss approaches him, apparently to taunt him of his impending death. However, Bennet offers her a unique opportunity to simply walk away; if she does, he pledges to get Danko off her trail‚Äîpermanently. After recruiting The Haitian to erase Danko's memories, Tracy shows up to kill him, only to find that Danko no longer remembers her. As she leaves, she hears Danko being attacked by an unknown assailant, Edgar, from the carnival, only to be attacked herself. Afterwards, she calls Bennet who discovers a key the assailant was after on Danko's body. Throughout these events, Bennet also tries to help Claire adjust to her new life in college while managing his own divorce from Sandra. Bennet calls Peter Petrelli to help him check out the safe deposit box that it opens, which Peter agrees to for the opportunity to gain the attacker's power of super speed. They are attacked only once they find a single, antique compass in the safe deposit box, though Peter gains the upper hand and forces a retreat. Afterwards, Bennet holds onto the compass halfheartedly, feeling that it is a dead end. After being attacked later for the compass and barely surviving it, Noah calls Tracy both to talk about her new adjustments and for her company. The two share a meal together that Peter left behind to console Noah. In \\"Acceptance\\", after a visiting Claire imparts some sage advice, Noah begins to realize that he wants to return to doing what he's good at, namely investigating superhumans. Then, Tracy seeks Noah advice as well, and he gives her the same message Claire told him: return to the basics to understand where to go from there. In \\"Tabula Rasa\\", Peter comes to Noah looking for a healer to save Hiro's life; Noah drops the name of Jeremy Greer, a past target of a bag & tag mission, so both teleport to Cainan, GA. After finding Jeremy's power change from heal to kill when he got angry at his parents, killing them, Noah helps him conquering his fear of killing anyone else, and then he is able to heal Peter; Noah states that his own power is to understand people with abilities. Peter leaves once he mimicked Jeremy's healing touch, but Noah stays to assure Jeremy will get the help he needs, mainly because Noah feels he let Jeremy down in the past. In \\"Strange Attractors\\", despite Noah's effort to cover up Jeremy's parents death, the local sheriff holds him, so Noah enlists Tracy Strauss to help Jeremy start over. Once Jeremy is out, the townspeople believe Jeremy is guilty of charge, and frightened by them Jeremy accidentally kills a man, so he is taken by the police again, away from Noah and Tracy. They come across his dead body that night and lament their failure. Tracy tells Noah to never call her again, and both agree to go their separate ways. In \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\", 3 years ago, during the time he worked for Primatech Paper as the events of Volume One \\"Genesis\\" unfold (Seven Minutes to Midnight), Noah is shown to share a special bond with fellow company agent Lauren Gilmore, who was his confidante when Noah cannot tell his family about what his job really entails, especially Isaac's paintings involving Claire. Noah and Lauren share a kiss at Lauren's motel room while wrapped in a romantic moment, however Noah stops the kiss, feeling that he is cheating on Sandra, and he and Lauren apologize for letting it get out of hand. Once back at the headquarters, Lauren gives him an envelope, in which he finds a note from her telling she got the Haitian mind-wiped any memory of her crush on Noah, so they could work together without any concern, and then writes a note to Noah to let him know this. In \\"Shadowboxing\\", Noah appears at Becky's sorority house with the Haitian. Claire notices her friends have been mind-wiped and argues with Noah about what he is able to do with people around her, fearing they will erased Gretchen's memory as well. Once Claire and the Haitian go to check on Gretchen, Noah is out to find Becky at her room, and despite her being invisible, he states he knows how to deal with her because he once had an invisible partner (Claude). Becky confesses why she attacked Claire; Noah killed her father while she was a kid during a bag & tag mission. Noah misses her when two girls enter the room. Back to Claire, he found Samuel Sullivan with her. Getting protective, he handcuffs Samuel, but Becky comes in taking down Claire and Noah. Samuel takes Noah's taser and shocks Becky stating he knows she is messed up. Noah tries to attack him, pushing Claire away. After Samuel and Becky are gone, Noah apologizes to Claire, and then leaves. Once at his apartment, he looks at several files labeled to being Samuel's including the mysterious sinkhole that destroyed a manor (Ink). In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Noah gets home to find Claire and Tracy sharing a quality moment, and notices a frozen foot at the coffee table. Both girls state nothing happened. In \\"Thanksgiving\\", Noah invites Claire to his first Thanksgiving dinner so he won't be alone with Sandra and her new boyfriend. At the grocery store, he runs into Lauren Gilmore, whom he jokingly admits to be \\"stalking\\"; she then helps Noah shopping. Once Claire arrives at Noah's apartment, Claire notices Lauren, referring to her as Noah's date, which he refutes; once Sandra and Doug arrive, Sandra mistakes Lauren for a maid; after correction, Sandra believes Lauren to be Noah's date too. During dinner, Claire confesses her decision to drop out college, which Noah is immediately opposed to. After Claire cuts herself and Doug faints, she and Noah discuss the clippings on Noah's wall; Noah insists Samuel and the carnival are dangerous and shows her the compass. Gretchen then appears, and tells Claire she was invited by Noah as Claire was feeling bad those days. Once everyone is leaving, Noah assures Claire she has many options, unknowing she later takes this advice to visit the carnival. Before leaving, Lauren asks Noah to go out and watch a movie some day. In \\"The Fifth Stage\\", Lauren appears at Noah's apartment ready to go out in their date, but Noah noticed Claire took the compass and must be heading to the \\"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\\", so Lauren decides to help him using her CIA contacts. Later that night, Eli shows up at the place looking for the Primatech files, surrounding Lauren and Noah with clones; both attack the clones and hide in the bathroom to arm themselves. Once out again, they notice Eli and clones are gone, and they took the files with them. In \\"Upon This Rock\\", Noah is seen at Nathan's funeral. In \\"Let It Bleed\\", Noah offers to take Claire to Nathan's wake but she becomes upset with him and realizes that Sylar killed Nathan and Noah transformed Sylar into Nathan. Noah admits that he did the wrong thing and that he thought he did it to keep Sylar detained and Nathan alive at the same time but Claire is angry and tells him she needs some to time to grieve, without being reminded of the truth. In \\"The Wall,\\" in order to turn Claire against her father, Samuel has Damien use his powers to project Noah's memories in the House of Mirrors. It's shown that Noah started out as a too-honest used-car salesman who had a pregnant wife until she was killed by a man with telekinetic powers during a robbery which sent Noah after him looking for revenge. He also becomes a lot less honest. When he finds a man with powers, Noah demands the location of the killer's location which the man doesn't know and attacks him. Noah is forced to kill the man, the first time he ever killed anyone and this brings him to the attention of the Company who recruits him. In order to curb his more violent tendencies towards specials, they have him marry Sandra who is a waitress at a restaurant where he and Thompson eat together. Though Claire is horrified by the origin of her parents marriage, Noah assures her he really did love Sandra despite their arranged marriage and her opinion of Noah doesn't change for the worse, so Samuel locks them in a trailer together and buries them underground in order to force Claire to witness his death while she survives due to her powers. In \\"Brave New World,\\" after being rescued from near-death by Tracy Strauss, Noah, Claire and Lauren travel to the Carnival to stop Samuel's plan to kill thousands of people. While Claire tries to convince the carnies of the truth, Noah tries to find Samuel, but is caught by Edgar. Once he clarifies that he is there to stop Samuel and not to hurt anyone else, Edgar, who also wants to stop Samuel, teams up with him to do so. The two arrive in time to back up Claire's allegations that Samuel killed Joseph and was responsible for the death of Lydia and what he plans to do. When a brainwashed Eli backs them up, the carnies believe them and abandon Samuel who starts his earthquake while Noah and Claire try to get everyone to safety. Thanks to Peter battling Samuel, Noah and Claire have enough time to locate Hiro and Ando and have them teleport all of the carnies away. Noah stays behind to finish the job and arrives after Peter defeats the powerless Samuel who collapses in despair at everyone's abandonment of him. Noah has him arrested and covers up the incident with the help of Lauren until Claire climbs the Ferris Wheel to expose her powers to the world which he tells Lauren is breaking his heart. Noah watches as Claire jumps off the Ferris Wheel in front of all the news cameras. === Heroes Reborn === Bennet is a central character in the 2015-16 miniseries Heroes Reborn, first seen in the web series Dark Matters, living as a car salesman four years after Claire's public reveal. He is tracked down by Quentin Frady, who has been researching Primatech and Renautas following the Odessa disaster and his sister's abduction. It is revealed that Bennet was present in Odessa on June 13 when the Evo Summit was bombed. Noah was there to meet Claire, whom he believes to have died in the attack. Since then, he has been living under the identity of Ted Barnes and has attempted to move on with his life. Once confronted by Quentin, he begins to question what really happened at the summit and resumes his old identity to investigate. He follows a clue to an ophthalmology clinic in Dallas run by the Haitian. The Haitian returns to Noah his trademark glasses just before attempting to kill him. The two struggle before Bennet shoots him, killing him. Bennet then decides to team up with Quentin to discover the truth behind the summit. The two travel to Primatech to recover Noah's old files in hopes of reuniting with Molly Walker. After rescuing Hiro Nakamura in \\"Game Over\\", Noah has Hiro take him back to the Evo Summit to save Claire and stop the bombing. After watching his past self be taken away by Erica Kravid, Noah is found by Angela Petrelli who informs him that Claire has been rushed to the hospital and is in surgery. While Hiro attempts to stop the bomb, Noah rushes to the hospital with Angela only to learn that Claire has died giving birth to twins. Noah says a tearful goodbye to Claire who doesn't revive for some reason. Hiro appears to him afterwards and informs him that he can't stop the bomb, there are too many variables and any attempt to stop it results in a worse future. As Hiro and Noah prepare to return to their own time, Phoebe Frady unleashes a massive wave of darkness that drains Hiro's powers shortly before Harris bombs the summit. Returning to Claire's children, Angela informs Noah that the Earth's magnetic poles will soon reverse and solar flares will wipe out all life on Earth. Erica Kravid only intends to save those she wants and Angela has foreseen that one or both of Claire's children hold the key to saving the world. Noah realizes he had his memory wiped to protect Claire's children from Erica Kravid and decides that the safest place for them is in the past where they can grow up and prepare for their destiny. When they reach the correct time, Erica will be looking for toddlers, not teenagers. Hiro reluctantly agrees to take Angela back to 1999 to fulfill Noah's request while Noah intends to erase all security footage of the babies. Before Hiro and Angela leave, Noah and Angela name the babies as Claire never got to: Angela names Claire's son Nathan after Nathan Petrelli while Noah names Claire's daughter Malina after his own mother. After Angela, Hiro and the children are gone, Noah realizes that Erica is in the hospital and goes after her to kill her. His past self, having escaped with the help of Caspar Abraham, spots Noah and chases him down. In \\"11:53 to Odessa\\", Noah tries to get Malina to Odessa to stop the H.E.L.E. but during a massive storm, a car is flung right at him. Noah suddenly disappears leaving behind only his broken glasses. In \\"Project Reborn\\", Tommy learns that in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to sacrifice themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. \\"a thousand times\\", he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy to take him to the present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy takes his hand. With the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah sitting on the ground, near death. Noah looks at his grandchildren one last time and tells them that he's proud of them before dying. == Alternate futures == * In the alternate future of \\"Five Years Gone\\", Noah Bennet (who is not wearing his trademark horn-rimmed glasses) works together with Hana Gitelman to protect people with superpowers from being persecuted by a now fearful government. It is revealed that he is trying to keep Claire hidden from the registry. Though he is estranged from Claire, he visits her at the diner to warn her to get away. When he arrives back at work, he discovers Hana has been killed, and Matt Parkman, now head of the Department of Homeland Security, and his men are waiting for him. He does not realize Parkman has murdered Hana and broken their agreement, and hands Parkman a picture drawn by his son. Parkman holds a gun to him and demands to know where Claire is. Bennet refuses to answer, so Parkman reads Bennet's mind to extract Claire's location. Parkman then shoots Bennet in the head. * In the alternate future of \\"I Am Become Death\\", as depicted in the graphic novel \\"Resistance\\", Claire notes that she has lost both of her parents. == Name == Mr. Bennet actually wears browline glasses (left), as opposed to horn-rimmed glasses (right). Noah Bennet is initially introduced as \\"the man in the horn-rimmed glasses,\\" based on his distinctive eyewear. The glasses Coleman wears in most scenes are actually browline, not horn-rimmed, but none of the characters seem aware of the distinction. In the third episode, \\"One Giant Leap\\", his name was confirmed as \\"Mr. Bennet\\" and he has been occasionally referred to as such since. Still, \\"Horn-Rimmed Glasses\\" (or a variant of it) is the more often used name by the characters, albeit indirectly. For example, characters who don't know him personally usually describe him as \\"the man with horn-rimmed glasses.\\" With regard to Bennet's given name, Coleman has admitted that it was intentionally avoided. This is evident in \\"Distractions\\", where Mrs. Bennet remarks that she is amused that everybody called him \\"Mister\\", and almost states his first name before being interrupted. His driver's license, displayed by Sylar in the same episode, did not show a first name. According to Coleman, the character's first name was written out of a draft script because \\"it stopped the scene cold.\\" In the final episode of season one, \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\", Mr. Bennet tells Peter Petrelli to call him \\"Noah.\\" Ironically, likely in a nod to the character's inaccurate name, Bennet tries on an actual pair of horn-rimmed glasses in a flashback sequence at the end of \\"Company Man\\". He decides not to wear them when Claire describes them as \\"grandpa glasses.\\" Claire subsequently selects the browline glasses (declaring that he now looks \\"like my dad\\"), which he then wears from that point forward. In an interview with TV Guide, Jack Coleman was asked \\"were the horn-rimmed glasses your idea, or the writers?\\" Coleman responded: == References == == External links == * Interview: \\"Jack Coleman Feels That Heroes is Something Special\\", MediaBlvd Magazine, February 27, 2007.

The Germans head for the coast and burn their escape lorry, which is seen by a reconnaissance plane. Drawn by the burning lorry, Connor (now in an aircraft) locates the Germans attempting to paddle towards a surfaced U-boat at dusk. Connor calls in a Royal Navy motor torpedo boat (MTB) with depth charges to engage the U-boat.

He distinguished himself by gaining five victories during the First World War, and was present during the air battle when Lanoe Hawker was shot down and killed by Manfred von Richthofen, the \\"Red Baron\\". He is chiefly remembered for his role as Deputy Air Officer Commanding-on-Chief Bomber Command under Sir Arthur Harris during the latter part of the Second World War. ==Early life== Robert Henry Magnus Spencer Saundby was born on 26 April 1896 at 83A Edmund Street in Birmingham. He was the son of Professor Robert Saundby FRCP and Edith Mary Saundby ( Spencer). Educated at King Edward VI School, Saundby left in 1913 and joined the Traffic Department of the London and North Western Railway. ==First World War== Saundby began the First World War serving in the British Army. On 15 June 1914 he was commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, Territorial Force. An attack of cerebrospinal meningitis in February 1915 saw Saundby out of action for 8 months. It was not until 11 October that he was passed fit and on 23 October he applied to the Royal Flying Corps. It was January 1916 when Saundby was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps. Saundby's flying career began at Thetford in Norfolk as part of No. 12 Reserve Squadron on 28 February 1916. He flew solo just over a month later on 31 March and gained further experience flying with the squadron at Dover. Saundby then attended the Central Flying School (CFS) at Upavon. He saw further service with No. 40 Squadron at Gosport. Of his experiences in this period, Saundby wrote - Saundby became a qualified pilot and joined Britain's first single-seater fighter squadron, No. 24 Squadron RFC, in its original complement under famous Major Lanoe Hawker, flying the Airco DH2 on the Western Front.http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/gbritain/rfc/24.php Retrieved on 17 August 2010. His initial successes began on 31 July 1916; he drove down a Fokker Eindekker out of control, and was slightly wounded in the process. On 17 November 1916 Saundby's brother, Second Lieutenant William Spencer Fitz- Robert Saundby, also of the Royal Flying Corp, was killed in action at 19 years of age. It was initially hoped he had been made a prisoner of war following a forced landing but it turned out not to be the case. He is remembered on the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Saundby transferred from No. 24 Squadron to No. 41 Squadron on 26 January 1917. On 4 March, while flying FE.8 Serial No. 6431, he shared a victory over an Albatros. Following this win, he transferred to Home Defence in Britain. He had shot down 9 aircraft over the Western Front by this point. On 13 April 1917 Saundby was at Orford Ness RFC Experimental Station, England. On 17 June 1917 he was flying one of three aircraft, one of 37 Squadron RFC and two others from the Experimental Station that intercepted the Zeppelin L48 after she got lost trying to bomb London. As a result of their attacks, L48 crashed near Theberton. The victory was shared among the three air crews. Saundby not only became an ace with this win, he was awarded the Military Cross. One of only two German survivors of the engagement, Otto Mieth, died in Iringa, Tanganyika in 1956. He had lived there since 1928 and had his own construction company. In the preface to Saundby's book Flying Colours (1919), Major General E. B. Ashmore wrote that Saundby was \\"one of a very gallant band of pilots who fought under the late Major Lanoe Hawker VC DSO during the Somme offensive of 1916.\\" ==Interwar period== In 1919 Saundby received a permanent commission into the Royal Air Force (RAF). This period also saw him taking the sea plane course at Lee-on- Solent, studying at the RAF and Naval Cooperation School at Calshot and being awarded the Air Force Cross. Between 1919 and 1925, Robert Saundby moved slowly through the ranks of the newly formed RAF, while gaining experience of command. Between 1922 and 1925 he served as a Flight Commander in No. 45 Squadron, based at Almaza, Cairo. Flying the Vickers Vernon transport aircraft. He flew as co-pilot for the then Squadron Leader Arthur Harris, when the latter developed a locally improvised bombing capability for the Vernon.Johnson Brian & Cozens H. I. Bombers The Weapon of Total War London Methuen 1984 p38 April 1922 was Saundby's first flight to Baghdad. In February, March, November and December 1923 he participated in bombing operations. This was a policy known as 'aerial policing'. He moved on to become an instructor in Egypt with No. 4 Flying Training School at Abu Sueir, Egypt. This however only lasted for two months when he was given command of the Aden Flight. This was due to a sudden illness affecting the sitting commander. Saudby initially disliked the posting but grew to appreciate the experience. It proved to be the only command of his career. Saundby's move towards the upper command ranks of the RAF was initiated when he joined No. 58 Squadron as a Flight Commander on 15 October 1926. With the squadron he flew the Vickers Virginia and Vickers Victoria aircraft at RAF Worthy Down. His squadron commander was Wing Commander Arthur Harris, and the squadron concentrated on developing night bombing techniques such as target-marking in their 70 mph machines. The other squadron at Worthy Down at the time, No. 7, was commanded by Wing Commander Charles Portal, later to become Chief of Air Staff during the Second World War and the direct superior and sometimes opponent of Harris. In 1927‚Äì28 Saundby attended the RAF Staff College before being posted to the Wessex bombing area staff. By this period he had logged over 2000 flying hours, however his flying career was drawing to a close as he rose into more staff positions. At the rank of wing commander, Saundby attended the Imperial Defence College in 1933. He also worked for two years at the RAF Staff College, Andover as an instructor. In 1937, Saundby was appointed Deputy Director of Operations. From there he became Deputy Director (and subsequently Director) of Operational Requirements and Assistant Chief of Staff (Operational Requirements and Tactics). He held these posts between 1938 and 1940, also rising to Air Vice-Marshall in this period. ==Second World War== Arthur Harris studies a map of Germany with Air Vice Marshal Ronald Graham (left), the Air Officer Administration at BCHQ, and Air Vice Marshal Saundby (right), Harris's Senior Air Staff Officer. By 1940, Saundby had become Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO), HQ Bomber Command. He served under Air Marshal Richard Peirse, and continued in this position when Peirse was replaced with Arthur Harris in February 1942. February 1943 saw Saundby appointed to the post of deputy air officer commanding-in-chief. He was an advocate for the strategy of attacking German military industries and the morale of the German population by bombing German industrial areas and cities. He was a key deputy for Harris throughout the remainder of the war. On behalf of Harris he selected 94 German towns which were \\"fitted\\" for carpet bombing and gave codenames to each of them known as 'Fish code'; for example Nuremberg was codenamed Grayling and Berlin was Whitebait. It is thought that he chose this coding because he was a keen fly fisherman. He retired on medical grounds from the RAF on 22 March 1946. The medical grounds for Saundby's retirement were the result of injuries (osteoarthritic lumbar spine and an osteoarthritic hip) sustained in a crash 30 years previously. Saundby was awarded the Order of Leopold II with Palme and Croix de Guerre for services in the liberation of Belgium. ==Retirement== Saundby devoted much of his retirement to his role as Vice-Chairman, Council of Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Association, for which he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Saundby was the chair of the council of Royal Air Forces Association (as well as life vice-president), president of the Royal British Legion (metropolitan area) and in 1960 was appointed deputy-lieutenant for Berkshire. Fly-fishing was a great passion and Saundby also became the president of the Piscatorial Society, editing their centenary publication The Book of the Piscatorial Society 1836‚Äì1936. Saundby was also a keen lepidopterist and a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. In retirement at Burghclere he made light-trap records in his garden and entomologized the woods of West Berkshire. His work in this field saw him record 44 species of butterfly and 501 larger moths. His collection was described as \\"a model of good arrangement and documentation\\", and was presented to the Natural History Museum in London. Saundby had many hobbies, and wrote several books on differing subjects including his role in the RAF during the war (Air Bombardment, The Story of its Development, How the Bomber and the Missile Brought the Third Dimension to Warfare) and Steam Engines (Early British Steam 1825‚Äì1925: The First 100 Years). Saundby died on 26 September 1971 at Edgecombe Nursing Home, Hamstead Marshall in Berkshire. His ashes were scattered by the River Avon at Netheravon. ==Family== On 10 January 1931, Saundby married Joyce Mary Rees-Webbe. They met when she came with her father, Major Marmaduke Oswald Norman Rees-Webbe, on a fly-fishing trip. Together they had a son and two daughters. ==Popular culture== Saundby appears in the wartime propaganda file Target for Tonight. Saundby was portrayed in the 1989 television drama Bomber Harris by Bernard Kay. ==References== ==Further reading== * Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915‚Äì1920.

It houses two theaters: a 350-seat main stage theater (The Joan and Robert Rechnitz Theater), and a 99-seat black box theater (The Marion Huber Theater). On its main stage, Two River Theater produces a multi-play subscription season and family shows. It is located in Red Bank, New Jersey, on the peninsula between the Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers that gave the theater its name. The company received \\"Theatre of the Year\\" awards from the New Jersey Theatre Alliance in 2006, and from The Star- Ledger in both 2006 and 2008. At the July 2009 meeting of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, Two River Theater was designated as a Major Impact Organization.

Each year, more than 55,000 patrons and guests come through the doors to see exceptional productions in two intimate performance spaces, the Joan and Robert Rechnitz Theater and the Marion Huber Theater. Audiences come knowing that whether Two River Theater is producing a beloved classic, something brand new, or a rediscovered masterpiece, they are invited on an adventure: to experience great stories on stage, engage in conversation, and encounter the life of the human spirit in all its shifting modes. Two River Theater is recognized in the national theater community for their new-play commissioning program, launched in 2010 to create a pipeline for developing work that contributes to the vitality and future of the American theater. Commissions currently in development include plays by Madeleine George (author of Seven Homeless Mammoths Wander New England), Lisa Kron (writer and performer of 2.5 Minute Ride), Tony Meneses (author of Guadalupe in the Guest Room), Martin Moran (writer and performer of The Tricky Part and All the Rage), and Tanya Saracho, and new musicals by the teams of Joe Iconis and Joe Tracz (Be More Chill), and Daniel Mat√© and Marshall Pailet.

The \\"A Little Shakespeare\\" series, launched during Two River's 20th Anniversary Season, showcases an annual production of a Shakespeare play performed by high-school students and includes both public performances and student matinees. Each year, Two River's education programs and student matinees serve students in 50 schools throughout the state of New Jersey. Classroom residencies support academic achievement and, in partnership with schools and community organizations across the central New Jersey region, the theater offers multiple programs that introduce at-risk adolescents to theater. Two River Theater was founded by Joan and Robert Rechnitz in 1994. The theater is easily accessible by car, train, or bus, with restaurants, shopping and hotels within walking distance. ==The building== Stairs inside the theater The Two River Theater new building has a futuristic lobby with -high glass walls with a sweeping roof evoking waves of a river. The building was designed by New York architect Stewart Jones, of Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer & Associates, who also designed the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The main Rechnitz Theater seats 350 patrons, and features a modern lighting system. Centered around a thrust stage, the theater was built so as the furthest seats would be no more than from the performers. The facility includes the Marion Huber Theater - a fully convertible, 99-seat black box space, that hosts more experimental works, readings, classes, and rehearsals, and provides an intimate experience for audience members. Two River Theater contains a costume and prop shop, as well as a production warehouse where all sets are made on location. ==Production history== ===2016/2017 season=== Two River Theater's 2016/2017 season featured seven productions. \\"These plays dive deep into essential elements of our contemporary lives‚Äîlove, honor, racism, family conflict, climate change, war, and more,\\" said artistic director John Dias in a statement. \\"And yet they do so in a joyously human way, painting indelible, moving, hilariously funny, and most of all, deeply honest portraits of people at their best, worst, and everything in between.\\" The season began with August Wilson's Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom (Sept. 10‚ÄìOct. 9), about singer Ma Rainey and the music scene in 1920s Chicago. The production featured Branden Dirden, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson directed. Next was James Goldman's The Lion In Winter (Nov. 12‚ÄìDec. 4), about Henry II of England, and his royal family's dysfunctional Christmas in 1183. Following, the company presented Lightwire Theater's A Very Electric Christmas (Dec. 27‚Äì30), about a young bird trying to head South for the winter, featuring the neon lights, puppets, and the music of Nat King Cole, Mariah Carey, Tchaikovsky, and more. The season continued with Madeleine George's Hurricane Diane (Jan. 14‚ÄìFeb. 12, 2017), a comedy about a gardener who wreaks havoc on a group of New Jersey housewives and their landscapes. Leigh Silverman directed. Next was Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor (Feb. 25‚ÄìMarch 26, 2017), a comedy about the raucous Sir John Falstaff and his attempts to seduce two wives of the wealthiest men in Windsor.

Two River Theater's Metro Scholar program is an exploration of professional theater for advanced students. The program offers an opportunity for high school juniors to play a role in the life of Two River Theater. Selected students receive two free subscriptions, take workshops in aspects of professional theater, complete assistantships with Two River artists and staff, and work with other creative students from all over New Jersey. PlayBack is a program in which selected high school students work with Two River Teaching Artists who guide them in the creation and performance of their own original play inspired by, in response to, and in conversation with a production on the theater's main stage. This is an intensive twelve-week program, which culminates with performances on the set of that production. Summer Ensembles is a three-week summer program offered to students from first to twelfth grade. Teaching artists channel students‚Äô natural energy and vitality into creative thinking, teamwork, and performance skills through theater games, songs and devising original material. Not only do students get the opportunity to perform for their peers, they are able to see the inner-workings backstage with the Two River production staff. Young Voice's 732 is an educational project to collect stories from those that work, live or play in the 732 area code, and offer those stories back to the community.

It is surrounded by various districts in Sumida, Ch≈´≈ç, and Tait≈ç wards: Yokoami, Midori, Chitose, Higashi Nihonbashi, and Yanagibashi. In 1659, the Ry≈çgoku Bridge was built, spanning the Sumida River just upstream of its confluence with the Kanda River. Its name, meaning \\"two provinces,\\" came from its joining Edo (the forerunner of Tokyo in Musashi Province) and Shim≈çsa Province. The district derived its name from that of the bridge. The Forty-seven r≈çnin avenged the death of their lord, Asano Naganori, by breaking into the mansion of his enemy, Kira Yoshinaka, in 1703. Part of the mansion has been preserved in a public park in Ry≈çgoku. Ry≈çgoku Station in the neighboring Yokoami district was opened in 1904, bringing rail transportation to the area. It is regarded as the heartland of professional sumo. Most training stables or heya are based there. The first Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan stadium for sumo was completed in 1909. The present one was built in 1985 in the Yokoami district north of Ry≈çgoku. Three of professional sumo's six annual official tournaments take place there. ==Notable people from Ry≈çgoku== Famous people connected with Ry≈çgoku include Katsu Kaish≈´, who was born there in 1823. Novelist Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa was raised in the district. Television personality and former member of the House of Councillors Kyosen ≈åhashi was born there. Ry≈çgoku is home to the Edo-Tokyo Museum. == Sumo == Because the Ry≈çgoku bridge was developed in the region, during the Edo period this part of Tokyo became as significant as Ueno and Asakusa. Sumo wrestling began to grow very popular due to the Kanjin sumo, which were championships organized to raise money for the construction of temples. These tournaments were held at the Eko-in temple. Most of the biggest Sumo tournaments are held in January, May and September at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena. ==References== Category:Districts of Sumida, Tokyo ","title":"Ry≈çgoku"},{"id":"7782632","text":"Idaea, sometimes called Hyriogona (among other synonyms), is a large genus of geometer moths.

From his father's first marriage to Lady Arabella Cavendish, daughter of the 2nd Duke of Newcastle, he was a half brother to Lady Frances Spencer, the wife of the 4th Earl of Carlisle. From his parents' marriage, his older full siblings were: Robert Spencer, who died young; Robert Spencer, 4th Earl of Sunderland; Lady Anne Spencer, who married Viscount Bateman; Charles Spencer, 5th Earl of Sunderland, who succeeded their aunt, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, as 3rd Duke of Marlborough. His younger sister, Lady Diana Spencer, married the 4th Duke of Bedford. His paternal grandparents were Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, and Lady Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol. His mother was the third daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Spencer was only seven when his mother died, and he was brought up by his grandmother Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. He was educated at Eton College in about 1722, and he undertook a Grand Tour through France, Switzerland and Italy between 1725 and 1727. His grandmother determined on a political career for him. ==Career== In 1732, Spencer succeeded his cousin, William Godolphin, Marquess of Blandford, as Member of Parliament (MP) for Woodstock, a seat he held until 1746. He was involved in the foundation of the Foundling Hospital, famously championed by Thomas Coram, William Hogarth and others. Spencer is listed alongside these gentlemen as one of the organisation's founding governors. In mid-January 1733, Spencer inherited his father's family's estates in Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire (including Althorp) and Warwickshire and his grandmother, the Duchess of Marlborough's property, including Wimbledon Park. ==Personal life== On 14 February 1732, a month after inheriting his family's estates, he married Georgiana Caroline Carteret (the third daughter and co-heir of Viscount Carteret, later Earl Granville). The couple were the parents of two children, one son and one daughter: * John Spencer, who was later created Earl Spencer in 1765. * Diana Spencer, who died at eight years old. Spencer died in 1746, three years after their daughter. After his death, his widow remarried four years later to the 2nd Earl Cowper. The Althorp estate remains the seat of the earls, but the Wimbledon estate was later sold by the 4th Earl in 1846. ==Ancestry== ==References== *R.H. Nichols and F A.

Jacula's music was considered innovative for the time in progressive circles but considered dark and strange by most fans and analysts of the genre, especially in an era that included the development of groups such as Pink Floyd, Genesis and Gentle Giant, bands which were the basis of the new progressive rock scene. Because the band was experimental, and had been labeled by founder Antonio Bartoccetti as a youth mistake, Jacula's discography is relatively small. The group completed two albums: In Cauda Semper Stat Venenum, released in 2001 in a highly altered version, which has a superposition of an organ, piano and other sound effects, and Tardo Pede In Magiam Versus which features Fiamma Dello Spirito's vocals, with a sound influenced by bands of the Italian underground scene such as Le Orme. In the 1970s, Jacula changed their name to Antonius Rex, maintaining the same lineup.

Unlike the others in the family, Kiso created only a few woodblock prints, but she excelled in the older, traditional arts of Japan. She had a quiet noble bearing and she played a key role in the Yoshida enterprise along with her husband. Kiso was born in Niitsu, Niigata, into the Katsura family that long had ties to Japan's imperial family. Her father, who had been a part of the government there, owned large tracts of land noted for their rice production. Kiso learned all of the traditional feminine arts of the upper class, such as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, and others, but she excelled especially in bonseki. Bonseki is the ancient art of arranging pure white sand and small white rocks on a black lacquer tray, thus forming miniature landscapes and seascapes. The sand and rocks were carefully manipulated with feathers, small brushes, and spoons. Each scene was temporary, only for the moment. The sand and rocks would then be brushed together and returned to their small storage containers to be used again. In addition, Kiso learned a technique for mixing glue with the sand so that the miniature scene would adhere to paper, and thus have a more permanent form. About 1950 in Tokyo, Kiso helped initiate an association for the cultivation and perpetuation of bonseki art. T≈çshi and Kiso married in 1940 in Tokyo, and had five sons. Kiso helped her husband in the development of the Yoshida Studio by being its business manager, responsible for keeping record of the prints produced, carrying out basic business operations, and mailing prints to clients in Japan and other countries. Almost incidental to that she produced a few woodblock prints of her own, some clearly echoing her bonseki scenes. When the T≈çshi Yoshida family built their own combined museum and vacation home in 1991-92 at Atami overlooking the ocean, a large glass case was installed to display the scroll on which is recorded the Katsura family history going back hundreds of years. Other rare objects from Kiso's parental home are also there. One room in the Atami building was designed especially for Kiso to make and display bonseki. ==References== * Allen, et al., A Japanese Legacy: Four Generations of Yoshida Family Artists, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 2002; Skibbe, Yoshida Toshi: Nature, Art, and Peace, Seascape, 1996.

With about 150 described species, this is one of several smallish skipper butterfly subfamilies.

In Coeliadinae the second segment of the palpi is erect and densely scaled, and the third segment is perpendicular to it, long, slender and without scales. ==Genera== There has only been limited phylogenetic study of this subfamily, and several issues still need to be resolved. For example, the genus Burara is here included in Bibasis, because they are both not monophyletic if their traditional delimitation is maintained. However, they may well consist of two different lineages, but where to draw the line between them and what name to use for the second genus all remain to be determined.

The character of Gary Ewing was first played by actor David Ackroyd in a 2-part Dallas season two episode \\"Reunion\\" in 1978. Gary Ewing was the middle son of oil baron Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing, the father of Lucy Ewing and the ex-husband of Valene Ewing. Over a year later, the part of Gary Ewing was recast for the spin-off Knots Landing with actor Ted Shackelford in the role, and Gary became one of the main stars of the series in 1979. Shackelford played Gary Ewing in Knots Landing for its entire fourteen seasons (1979-1993), while continuing to make occasional appearances in Dallas during that time. The character of Gary made his last Knots Landing appearance in 1997, in the reunion series Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac. Shackelford reprised his character for the new, updated version of Dallas in 2013. ==Development== ===Casting and creation=== From the outset, Dallas was centered on the lives of the wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas, Texas. Once the show became a success after the 5 episodes that made up season 1, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced the parents of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who had not been shown on-screen until that point.Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap, pp. 28 After the success of Dallas, Jacobs' presented his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: \\" Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then he pulled out the pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it.\\" Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and the role was recast to Ted Shackelford.Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap, pp. 49 ==Character arc== ===Dallas=== Gary Ewing was born in early January 1944 to oil baron Jock Ewing and his wife Miss Ellie Ewing of Dallas, Texas. Gary was their second son having been conceived just before Jock went off to Europe to fight in World War II. As Jock was not with Miss Ellie during her pregnancy with Gary, she tended to view him as more hers than Jock's and Gary became her favorite son, while the relationship between Jock and Gary was always distant. Gary was often considered the black sheep of the family, as he was mostly influenced by his mother and embraced the Southworth tradition of ranching on Southfork and had no interest in Ewing Oil. Gary also tended to run away from the expectations placed on him as Jock Ewing's son, secretly married a woman from \\"the wrong side of the tracks\\" just 3 days after meeting her, before bringing his pregnant wife home to meet his family. He became a teenage father, and an alcoholic due to the pressures that were put on him. Jock and older brother J.R. viewed Gary as weak and lacking the Ewing character but Gary was very friendly with his younger brother, Bobby. Gary married Valene Ewing (Joan Van Ark) in January 1961, when Gary was 17 and Valene was 15. Valene was soon pregnant, and many months into the pregnancy, Valene pestered Gary to take her to visit his family at the Southfork Ranch. They settled at Southfork, much to J.R.'s annoyance. Unlike J.R., Jock liked Valene, but demanded that Gary face up to all his responsibilities as a husband and father. To help the newlyweds out, Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy, was born in the fall of 1961. However, J.R. kept harassing the young couple, and Gary and Valene were soon fighting. Under the pressure, Gary took to heavy drinking, became violent, and eventually walked out on his family. With Gary gone, J.R. then forced Valene out of Southfork. Valene fled to Virginia with baby Lucy, and later to her home state of Tennessee, hoping to have her mother, Lilimae Clements, care for her child, but was refused. Valene and Lucy were tracked down by heavies hired by J.R., who ripped Lucy out of Valene's hands and took Lucy back to Southfork, to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she returned to the state of Texas. In 1978, Gary bumped into his brother, Bobby, and Bobby's wife, Pam, in Las Vegas. Bobby persuaded Gary to visit Texas. While Gary was visiting, Lucy, his teenage daughter, surprised him by reintroducing him to Valene. For the sake of his ex-wife and daughter, Gary tried to make things work in Texas, but soon came under the old pressures of living up to Jock's expectations and J.R.'s deviousness. J.R. had set Gary up in an office equipment machinery firm in a hope that Gary would fail as usual. To ensure his new found sobriety, he knew he had to leave Southfork and his family once again. Valene tracked Gary down and they reunited, eventually remarrying.Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap As a wedding present, Gary's mother Miss Ellie bought the couple a house in California. Originally, their daughter Lucy was to join them, but this event did not materialize, and she remained at Southfork. Gary made a few more appearances in Dallas after his move to California; namely the 2 episodes after J.R. was shot, Lucy's first wedding to Mitch Cooper, 2 episodes where Gary received 10 voting shares in Ewing Oil from an absent Jock and Gary then giving these 10 voting shares to Lucy, the reading of Jock's will, Bobby's \\"funeral\\" in the first episode of the dream season, and in the final episode \\"Conundrum\\" in which J.R. was shown how the world would have turned out if he had never been born. Gary meets Valene for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other. ===Knots Landing=== Gary and Val began their new life in Knots Landing just after the start of their second marriage in 1979, where they met their new neighbors, Sid and Karen Fairgate, where Gary was offered a job at Knots Landing Motors by Sid. Gary settled down into his new life in California, had a great marriage and was good at his job. However, after being given more responsibility by Sid, who promoted Gary to the position of vice-president of Knots Landing Motors, Gary had a few glasses of champagne, at the urging of his neighbors, who didn't know Gary's past problems with alcohol. It was the first time that Gary had drank alcohol in over 2 years. After the initial glasses of champagne, Gary's drinking quickly turned into nasty mood swings and a full blown alcoholic binge. Gary's drinking quickly caused him to hit rock bottom, where he would become extremely aggressive and violent in his desperation for more alcohol, even to the point of possibly killing somebody, and stealing a small bottle of beer from a sleeping homeless man. Val has Gary committed to a rehab facility, lying that Gary had tried to commit suicide in order to get Gary committed. Gary's aggression and violence from falling off the wagon, eventually made Gary admit out loud to himself and to other members of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, that he was an alcoholic. With the arrival of Sid's sister, Abby Cunningham (Donna Mills), Gary soon found himself lusting after her, as she did for him. After initially rejecting Abby's advances, Gary and Abby eventually slept together and had an affair, until Val discovered it. With Gary being thrown out of his marital home by Val, he moved in with Abby. Gary also became close friends with an up-and-coming singer he discovered, called Ciji Dunne, until Ciji was tragically murdered. Gary initially believed that he might have killed her while heavily drunk, but he later realized that he didn't, and he was acquitted. When Jock was declared legally dead as a result of a plane crash in South America, Gary stood to inherit millions of dollars. He started a company called Gary Ewing Enterprises. A possible reconciliation with Val failed to materialise around this time, and Gary and Val eventually divorced for the second time. Gary also went on to buy a ranch, called Westfork. Gary soon married Abby, as she secretly started her own company, Apolune. After his marriage to Abby, Gary became the stepfather to Abby's children, Olivia and Brian, from Abby's first marriage to Jeff Cunningham. Gary then met Cathy Geary, who looked a lot like Ciji and began a new friendship with her and had her dress and sing like Ciji too. He also later had a relationship with Cathy. During a moment of weakness, Gary had a one night stand with his ex-wife, Val, and she became pregnant with twins, but Gary assumed that Val's fianc√© and future husband, Ben Gibson, was the father. Val eventually named her twin babies as Bobby and Betsy in the 1985‚Äì86 season, after Gary's late brother Bobby and Ben Gibson's mother Betsy. Gary's marriage to Abby eventually broke down, and he got engaged to Jill Bennett, who later tried to kill Val. Gary and Val eventually reunited again, 8 years after their second divorce. Gary and Val also lived together with their children, Bobby and Betsy, for the first time, going on to marry each other for the third time in 1991 (Gary's fourth marriage, and Valene's fifth). In 1992, after Val was kidnapped by mafia gangsters in Florida and supposedly killed in a car crash after Gary had tracked her down, a grieving Gary entered into a short-term relationship with a much younger, Kate Whittaker, as she supported him and his children through their grief of losing Val. However, in the 2-part finale to Season 14 in 1993, Val turned up alive, revealing that she was never in the car that she was presumed to have died in. Gary was extremely happy at his wife still being alive, and they got back together. In the 1997 series Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac Kate reveals to Gary that he is the father of her young daughter, Molly Whittaker. At this time, Kate was in a relationship with Gary's former stepson, Brian Cunningham, and was pregnant with Brian's baby. ===Dallas (2012 TV series)=== Gary returned to Dallas in 2013 to help his brother, Bobby, stop their nephew, John Ross, from drilling for oil on Southfork. Gary informs Bobby that he fell off the wagon again and he and Valene had separated. After his brother J.R.'s death, Gary is very conflicted about his feelings toward J.R. He realizes though that every step he took in life, forward or backward, was because of J.R. In J.R.'s will, he gives Gary an old bottle of Scotch, knowing that Gary is a recovering alcoholic. Later, Sue Ellen calls Valene and she comes to Dallas, where she and Gary reunite. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== *Gary Ewing Biography at Ultimate Dallas.com Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1978 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Gary Ewing"},{"id":"7782836","text":"Conganchnes mac Dedad (\\"the horny-skin\\" in Irish) is a hero mentioned in the legend of the death of Celtchar mac Uthechair; he does not, however, kill him, but is killed himself.

The base, situated on the Silver Strand, between San Diego Bay and the Pacific Ocean, is a major Navy shore command, supporting over 30 tenant commands, and is the West Coast focal point for special and expeditionary warfare training and operations. The onbase population is 5,000 military personnel and 7,000 students and reservists. The base is one of the eight components of Naval Base Coronado (NBC). ==History== Naval Amphibious Base Coronado Formally commissioned in January 1944, Naval Amphibious Base (NAB), Coronado provides a shore base for the operations, training, and support of naval amphibious units on the West Coast. It is one of only two Navy amphibious training bases in the United States. NAB is approximately 1,000 acres (4 km¬≤) in size and is composed of the Main Base, training beaches, California least tern preserve, recreational marina, enlisted family housing, and state park. State Highway 75 separates NAB into surfside (ocean) and bayside sections. The majority of the bayside is composed of fill materials dredged from San Diego Bay in the early 1940s. Amphibious training is conducted on both surfside and bayside beaches. To the south of the Main Base, the majority of amphibious training activities takes place on about of ocean beachfront property, leased from the State of California. A least tern nesting preserve is located on North and South Delta Beach between the NAB Marina and Main Base. NAB is located within the city of Coronado, California, a community of approximately 30,000. The city of Coronado covers nearly of land, and NAB lies south of the main residential and commercial portions of the city. Another naval facility, Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island, is located northwest of the city of Coronado. South of NAB is the Silver Strand. In June 1943, the Secretary of the Navy authorized the establishment of the Amphibious Training Base in the San Diego area to meet wartimes demands for trained landing craft crews. These crews were deployed to the South Pacific area of operations, where their successful and historical efforts were contributory to the conclusion of World War II. Training for infantry coordination with naval artillery and attack aircraft was provided at the Naval Gunfire Liaison School and Support Air Control School. The streets of the base bear the names of those famous battles which led to the Empire of Japan's defeat: Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Tulagi, and Bougainville, to name a few. The base has also provided training for Underwater Demolition Teams, United States Navy SEALs, brown-water Navy personnel, and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen. In 1946, the base was renamed Naval Amphibious Base (NAB) Coronado and its primary mission was changed to that of providing major administrative and logistical support to the amphibious units which are located on the base. The base also conducts research and tests of newly developed amphibious equipment.http://www.nbc.navy.mil/index.asp?fuseaction=NBCInstallations.NABC ==Current operations== NAB Coronado is the home to over 30 tenant commands with a population of approximately 5,000 personnel, including major commands such as Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific (COMNAVSURFPAC), Commander Naval Special Warfare (SPECWAR) Command and the Commander Expeditionary Warfare Training Group (EWTG) Pacific. ==Major commands== *Amphibious Construction Battalion One *Assault Craft Unit One *Beachmaster Unit One *Expeditionary Warfare Training Group Pacific *Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group One **Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit One **Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Three **Explosive Ordnance Disposal Operational Support Unit Seven (decommissioned) *Naval Special Warfare Command **Naval Special Warfare Center *Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group One **SEAL Team One **SEAL Team Three **SEAL Team Five **SEAL Team Seven *Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group 11 (Navy Reserve) ** SEAL Team 17 (Navy Reserve) ** SEAL Team 18 (Navy Reserve) *Naval Special Warfare Group Three *Special Boat Team 12 *Commander, Tactical Air Control Group One **Tactical Air Control Squadron Eleven **Tactical Air Control Squadron 1194 (Navy Reserve) **Tactical Air Control Squadron Twelve **Tactical Air Control Squadron 1294 (Navy Reserve) ==In the media== Pictogram-shaped buildings at the base (the upper right corner is true north) Buildings 320, 321, 322, and 323, at , have a swastika- shaped plan view.

Contr- would go to Welsh cythr- straightforwardly according to historical phonology, and the form 'cythraul' not *cythraur is the result of dissimilation. It is likely to be an early Christian borrowing from Ecclesiastical Latin, like numerous other words in the Welsh and Irish languages. Diawl (from Latin diablos) is usually used for the Devil (Satan) today, cythraul usually being used as a pejorative, e.g. \\"y cythraul bach!\\" '(you) little devil/rascal!'. ==Modern Druidic interpretation== Cythraul has been mislabelled as a 'spirit of Chaos' by some modern Druids, an error which dates back as far as Iolo Morganwg's Barddas. It has found its way into various sourcebooks for neo-Druidry, usually by authors who do not speak Welsh and quite unaware of its history or origin. According to this error, 'Cythraul' is supposed to be a synonym for Chaos, in some way known to the ancient Druids, which is historically impossible and linguistically extremely unlikely. ==Further reading== *Piggott, Stuart (1975) The Druids.

The series was later sold to other countries including the UK. The British version was adapted by Anne Wood at FilmFair and broadcast in the UK. Series 1 was first shown on Monday 24 January 1983 at 4:15 pm and series 2 on Monday 7 January 1985 at 4.15pm on Children's ITV, and series 2 was repeated in 1986. The series was last repeated in its entirety in 1988. It was narrated by British actor Richard Murdoch. This series was the third series to be made based on the Moomin books. Two more were subsequently made. It is one of the two best- known Moomin series (along with the Japanese-made anime version Moomin (1990)). The 1977‚Äì1982 stop-motion version has been criticised for being scary in places and rather dark in tone for the young audience at which it was aimed. It is, in contrast to the 1990s series, widely believed to be the most faithful TV adaptation of Tove Jansson's stories, and much closer to her vision. Tove herself had a great deal of involvement during the series' production and was very happy with it (as revealed in an interview with Anne Wood in Simon Sheridan's 2007 book The A to Z of Classic Children's Television). The scripts for each episode were translated from Polish into Swedish and sent to Tove and Lars Jansson, who, if they felt that anything needed to be changed, corrected the script, expanding or rewriting it; afterwards, the scripts were sent back and only then did production of the particular episode begin. The opening titles featured a bouncy theme tune consisting of flutes and synthesizers composed by Graeme Miller and Steve Shill, and a popular still of Moomintroll holding a hat. In 2010, an HD version of the series was released. It was later followed by a new US-produced English dub in 2017. ==Episode list== The UK adaptation consisted of 100 five- minute episodes. Series 1 consisting of 50 episodes was first broadcast Mondays to Fridays at 4:15 pm, 24 January to 1 April 1983 on Children's ITV. Series 2 consisting of another 50 episodes first aired Monday to Fridays at 4:15 pm, 7 January to 15 March 1985 on Children's ITV. ===Series one=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" !UK Broadcast Date !Title !Novel Inspiration -

Released in July 2006, the song saw Ludacris return to music after some time off to concentrate on his acting career. ==Synopsis== In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to firing guns in his songs, isn't as rich as Ludacris himself and likes to give himself titles; these allegations are directed toward T.I.. T.I. responds to this song on the remix of \\"Umma Do Me\\" by Rocko saying: Money you say u get 30 mil. in six years Listen, Forbes put me down fa 20, dat was dis year And let's get dis clear just between you and me Dat apology was for B.E.T not D.T.P Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it's showing that he isn't just the 'cartoon entertainer' type rapper that he has been portrayed as. When asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at, he said \\"The guilty will speak\\". Later, in SOHH.com's Pre VMA Interview, Ludacris was asked if the song was self-referential. Ludacris replied, \\"Man, somebody misquoted me talking about...they misquoted me saying it was about me. What I was telling them was that I devote a lot of information about myself, and I think they're taking that in. I'm not battling myself on the record, that's ridiculous. What happens is you got a lot of people taking subliminal shots, but nobody ever says my name. I'm not for sure, so that record is like my way of taking subliminal shots right back. Don't get it misquoted, don't get it messed up. That's basically what it is man. It's like, you know, like I said I do devote a lot of information about myself on there. I started to wreck it up by saying I'm the best, and there's nothing you could do about it. [They say] I've never done this I've never done that, so you know when you look into it, it's a lot more records where it comes from on the album, September 26, Release Therapy, where it's the most personal album I've done. It's nothing but honesty so you can criticize it all you want to but at the end of the day you got to respect it cause I'm coming straight from the heart.

His father, cousin of Ferdinand II King of Aragon, abdicated in favour of his legitimate son Ferdinand II of Naples. ==Early life== Alfonso received a thorough education in the humanities. His first tutor was Giuniano Maio who was then followed by the Florentine poet Raffaele Brandolini (also known as \\"Lippus Brandolinus\\" because of his blindness). From an early age Alfonso was involved in the crisis that hit the Aragonese dynasty of Naples. In 1495, during the French occupation, his father fled and later died in Sicily. Alfonso, aged 14, fought for the return to the throne of his half-brother Ferdinand, who became king of Naples in 1495 but died one year later. In 1497, with the restoration of the Aragonese control under his uncle Frederick IV of Naples, Alfonso was assigned to the first position of responsibility and became the Lieutenant general of Abruzzo. ==Marriage== In order to strengthen ties with Naples, Pope Alexander VI arranged marriages between the House of Borgia and the royal family of Aragon. Alfonso's sister Sancha of Aragon was already given to the Pope's youngest son Gioffre Borgia in 1494. Alexander VI's idea was for his son Cesare Borgia to marry Carlotta of Naples, legitimate daughter of the newly crowned King Frederick IV of Naples, but Carlotta would not agree to marry him. To appease the Pope, King Frederick eventually consented to a match between the Pope's daughter Lucrezia Borgia, aged 18, and the 17-year-old Alfonso of Aragon. On 15 July 1498 Alfonso entered Rome in disguise. Alfonso and Lucrezia were married in the Vatican on 21 July with the celebrations being held behind closed doors. With Alfonso came the princely cities of Salerno, Quadrata and Bisceglie. Lucrezia brought with her a dowry of 40,000 ducats. It was part of the agreement that they would remain in Rome for at least one year and not be forced to live permanently at the Kingdom of Naples until her father's death. According to Gregorovius, \\"the youthful Alfonso was fair and amiable\\", \\"the most handsome young man ever seen in the Imperial city.\\" By all evidence, Lucrezia was genuinely fond of him. In February 1499, Lucrezia reportedly lost her first baby with Alfonso. However, she was soon pregnant again. As the political situation changed, Pope Alexander VI looked to align with France, enemy of Alfonso's family. To this end he arranged a marriage between Cesare Borgia and Charlotte of Albret, sister of King John III of Navarre. Alfonso sensed betrayal when France planned to invade Naples and on 2 August 1499 left Rome without his wife, who was six months pregnant. His flight incensed the Pope who sent troops after him but failed to find him. Meanwhile, Lucrezia was awarded the governorship of Spoleto and Foligno, meaning that Alfonso was a consort without formal responsibilities. Eventually Alfonso was discovered through the letters he was sending to his wife in an attempt to persuade her to join him in Genazzano. With this discovery her family ordered her to lure Alfonso to Rome. Lucrezia met her husband in Nepi. They then returned to the Vatican in September 1499. On the night of 31 October/1 November, Lucrezia gave birth to their son, who was christened Rodrigo after her father. ==Murder== Lucrezia Borgia (left) with Rodrigo (on the right next to her) and Alfonso of Aragon (to the very right), 1500 On the evening of 15 July 1500, at the top of the steps before the entrance to St. Peter's Basilica, Alfonso was attacked by hired killers and stabbed in the head, right arm, and leg. When the assassins attempted to take Alfonso with them, his own guards put them to flight. The prince was residing in the palace of Santa Maria in Portico, but so desperate was his condition that he was taken to the chamber of the Borgia Tower where he was cared for by his doctors from Naples, his sister, Sancha, and his wife, Lucrezia. On the night of 18 August, as Alfonso was still recovering from his wounds, Michelotto Corella and a group of armed men entered his room and strangled him in his bed until he was dead. Following his death, his body was carried to the Basilica of St Peter and there placed in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary of the Fever. In the political context of a French campaign against Naples, Cesare Borgia was primarily accused of being behind the assassination. However, Alfonso's death remains shrouded in mystery. In his own defence, Cesare argued that Alfonso had attempted to kill him with a crossbow shot as he walked in the garden, but not many believed him. Alfonso, given his sympathy for the Colonna family, had enemies at Rome amongst the Orsini too, and it seems possible that the Orsini could have engineered the attempt on his life in July 1500. Among the accused was also Alfonso's uncle Giovan Maria Gazzera, mysteriously killed in Rome shortly after, and even Pope Alexander VI, because Alfonso, in May 1500, showed his discontent with the Pope's decision to nullify the marriage between Alfonso's cousin Beatrice of Naples and the Vladislaus II of Hungary. Two years later Lucrezia was given in marriage to Alfonso I d'Este. Lucrezia was obliged to simulate the appearance of a virgin spouse in order to marry d'Este. Accordingly, she was forced to leave Rodrigo of Aragon, her only child by Alfonso of Aragon, behind forever. Rodrigo Borgia of Aragon died of a disease in Bari at the age of 12. ==Portrayals== *Alfons Fryland in Lucrezia Borgia (Film, US, 1922) *Max Michel in Lucr√®ce Borgia (Film by director Abel Gance, France, 1935) *John Sutton in Bride of Vengeance (Film, US, 1949) *Massimo Serato in Lucr√®ce Borgia (Film, France, 1953) *Fred Robsahm in Lucrezia Giovane (Film, Italy, 1974) *Robert Allman (singer) in Lucrezia Borgia (Opera by Donizetti, La Scala, 1977) *Ryan Michael in The Borgias (BBC Two and RAI Series, England-Italy, 1981) *Alexander Katsapov (dancer) in Lucrezia Borgia (Opera at the National Theatre Ballet, Prague, 2003) *Giorgio Marchesi in Los Borgia (Film by director Antonio Hern√°ndez, Spain, 2006) *Alejandro Albarrac√≠n in Borgia (Canal+ Series, France, 2011) *Sebastian de Souza in The Borgias (Showtime Series, US, 2013) ==References== Category:1481 births Category:1500 deaths Category:House of Trast√°mara Category:15th-century Neapolitan people Category:Princes of Salerno Category:Assassinated Italian people Category:Deaths by strangulation Category:Dukes of Italy Category:Illegitimate children of Neapolitan monarchs Category:15th-century Italian people ","title":"Alfonso of Aragon (1481‚Äì1500)"},{"id":"7783042","text":"Kissy is a neighborhood on the eastern end of the capital Freetown in Sierra Leone.

The Sheriff of London, The Case of Carrier Who Broke Bulk) (1473) was a landmark English court case in the history of the definition of larceny.Rethinking Criminal Law, 68, (1978), FletcherCriminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Until this ruling, when an owner voluntarily handed over physical possession of property to the custody of another, and it was then converted (in title: made that of another), there was no felonious larceny as larceny required trespass of the owner's or bailee's place or person (violence or the threat of violence). The English courts henceforth adopted the \\"breaking bulk\\" doctrine. If someone transporting a bulk or bale (bundle) of merchandise (the carrier) on behalf of someone else, and breaks it open without permission, express or implied, (thus converts them to the carrier's own use), it is the crime of larceny. The case was significant because in common law at that time, larceny required a trespass by force and arms (vi et armis) or against the peace, which did not occur if the person was willingly handed the bulk or bales of items. The breaking of the bulk was found to be the required force needed in the element of trespass. In the underlying case, one justice (Chokke [J.C.P]) stated that if the carrier sold the entire bale unbroken, then kept the proceeds for his own use, the act would not have the (at the time) element of (violent) trespass, so would not be larceny, but the breaking of the bulk satisfied the trespass element. ==Facts== A carrier was hired by a Flemish merchant to transport bales of woad (a type of dye) to the port in Southampton. He opened the bales and took the goods for himself. Some of it came into possession of the Sheriff of London. The sheriff gave it to the King (forfeited as \\"waif\\", a word to signify runaways or stolen goods). The merchant sued the sheriff to return the goods; he argued that the goods were not stolen, that the carrier only had temporary property rights and so the goods could not be given to the King. The Sheriff argued that the goods were stolen, that it was a felony and therefore properly forfeited to the King as waif. The legal relationship between the carrier and the merchant, as now, would have been seen as one of bailee and bailor, such that bailees have a duty of reasonable care for others' property they possess. The merchant had royal safe conduct covering his goods. This meant that if the goods were stolen they would not be given to the Crown by the use of a waif. This happened in medieval times when a good was stolen. When the stolen goods were found, they became property of the King. ==Judgment== The judges all agreed that the actions of the carrier constituted larceny but they could not agree on a rationale. The prevailing reason was provided by Lord Chokke who concluded that the carrier had lawful possession of the bales only. The merchant retained constructive possession of the contents. Therefore, when the carrier broke open the bales and removed the contents, he committed the crime of larceny because he had taken the contents from the possession of the merchant. The merchant had a royal safe conduct covering his goods. The merchant argued that this protection meant that even if his goods were stolen, as the court had determined, they would not be forfeited to the King as waif. The court agreed with the merchant on this second point and the Sheriff was required to return the goods to the merchant.As Fletcher notes in his book, Rethinking Criminal Law, the courts could have obtained the same result by following established precedent. There was no apparent need to create the legal fiction of breaking bulk or to consider the consequent issue of whether \\"safe conduct\\" protected the merchant whose property had been stolen from seizure as waif. The carrier had temporary possession of the goods with permission of the merchant so had no right to 'break bulk', i.e., he broke up the bales and began to sell them. The fact that he broke bulk shows the intention to commit larceny. He was therefore guilty; the goods would ordinarily forfeit to the king absolutely (in that era). However, due to the royal safe conduct that the merchant had, he was entitled to his goods back. ==See also== *English law ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1470s in law Category:1473 in England Category:15th century in England Category:English property case law Category:English criminal case law Category:Star Chamber cases ","title":"Carrier's Case"},{"id":"7783138","text":"Fourah Bay College (first half of the 19th century) Fourah Bay is a neighbourhood in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

The Oku people, an ethnic group predominately of Yoruba descent, make up the majority of the population of Fourah Bay. The Oku are virtually all Muslims based on the Sunni tradition of Islam. Fourah Bay is widely known for its conservative Muslim population. Fourah Bay is also home to a prominent minority of Salafi Muslims, a deeply conservative branch within Sunni Islam. The Jamiatul Atiq Masjid is the main mosque that serves the local Muslim community; it is one of the most prominent mosques in Sierra Leone. The community at Fourah Bay has been a source of many expert Muslim scholars, including renowned Salafi Sunni Islamic scholar Sheikh Alhaji Sulaiman Alpha Carew. Many contemporary Muslim scholars from here were once students of Carew, including such men as Sheikh Mohamed Sanusi Tejan, Sheikh Muhammad Alpha Macauley, Sheikh Alpha Musa Nabie, Sheikh Muhammad Sanusi Savage, Sheikh Alpha Teslim Williams, and Sheikh Nasim Sahid. Fourah Bay Muslim scholars are widely known for maintaining neutrality in Sierra Leonean politics and its rare for Fourah Bay Muslim leadership to publicly criticize Sierra Leonean government. There is a small Christian minority community here. They maintain a couple of churches. The Pentecostal Church of Fourah Bay serves part of the community. Muslims and Christians have had an amicable history here. Fourah Bay College was founded here in the nineteenth century by the British and settlers, to serve the new communities of Freetown and others. It was started as a kind of seminary or boys' academy, and gradually developed with a full academic curriculum. ==Politics== Since independence in 1961 to present, Fourah Bay has traditionally been a stronghold of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), the current ruling party. The SLPP is popular in Fourah Bay, and maintains majority support among its residents. Mohammed Sanusi Mustapha (widely known as M.S. Mustapha) is known as one of the founding fathers who led Sierra Leone to Independence. He was also a prominent member of the Sierra Leone People's Party. He was a very close ally and personal friend of Sir Milton Margai, Sierra Leone's first prime minister after independence. Mustapha was highly popular here. Other notable politicians from Fourah Bay include Abdul Tejan Cole, Haja Afsatu Kabba and Madina Rahman. The current president, Juda Bio is popular in Fourah Bay.

This genus is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the New World, from South America as far north as the southern United States. The larvae of these butterflies eat passion flower vines (Passifloraceae). Adults exhibit bright wing color patterns which signal their distastefulness to potential predators. Brought to the forefront of scientific attention by Victorian naturalists, these butterflies exhibit a striking diversity and mimicry, both amongst themselves and with species in other groups of butterflies and moths. The study of Heliconius and other groups of mimetic butterflies allowed the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, following his return from Brazil in 1859, to lend support to Charles Darwin, who had found similar diversity amongst the Gal√°pagos finches. == Model for evolutionary study == Heliconius butterflies have been a subject of many studies, due partly to their abundance and the relative ease of breeding them under laboratory conditions, but also because of the extensive mimicry that occurs in this group. From the nineteenth century to the present day, their study has helped scientists to understand how new species are formed and why nature is so diverse. In particular, the genus is suitable for the study of both Batesian mimicry and M√ºllerian mimicry. Because of the type of plant material that Heliconius caterpillars favor and the resulting poisons they store in their tissues, the adult butterflies are usually unpalatable to predators. This warning is announced, to the mutual benefit of both parties, by bright colors and contrasting wing patterns, a phenomenon known as aposematism. Heliconius butterflies are thus M√ºllerian mimics of one another, and are also involved in M√ºllerian mimicry with various species of Ithomiini, Danaini, Riodinidae (Ithomeis and Stalachtis) and Acraeini as well as pericopine arctiid moths. They are probably the models for various palatable Batesian mimics, including Papilio zagreus and various Phyciodina. === Convergence === Heliconius butterflies such as Heliconius numata benefit from mimicking other unpalatable species of butterfly in their local habitat, such as Melinaea, because doing so spreads the cost of educating predators. Such mimicry is termed M√ºllerian and may result in convergent evolution. Work has been done to try to understand the genetic changes responsible for the convergent evolution of wing patterns in comimetic species. Molecular work on two distantly related Heliconius comimics, Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, has revealed that homologous genomic regions in the species are responsible for the convergence in wing patterns.Counterman, B A, Araujo-Perez, F, Hines, H M, Baxter, S W, Morrison, C M, Lindstrom, D P and Papa, R, 2010. Genomic hotspots for adaptation: The population genetics of M√ºllerian mimicry in Heliconius erato. PLOS Genetics 6:-. Also, Supple had found evidence of two co-mimics H. erato and H. melpomene having no shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which would be indicative of introgression, and hypothesized the same regulatory genes for color/pattern had comparably changed in response to the same selective forces.Supple, M., Hines, H., Dasmahapatra, K., Lewis J., Nielsen D., Lavoie, C., Ray, D., Salavar, C., Mcmillan, O., Counterman, B. 2103. Genomic architecture of adaptive color pattern divergence and convergence in Heliconius butterflies. Genome research (2013): gr-150615. Similarly, molecular evidence indicates that Heliconius numata shares the same patterning homologues, but that these loci are locked into a wing patterning supergene that results in a lack of recombination and a finite set of wing pattern morphs. One puzzle with M√ºllerian mimicry/convergence is that it would be predicted the butterflies to all eventually converge on the same color and pattern for the highest predator education. Instead, Heliconius butterflies are greatly diverse and even form multiple 'mimicry rings' within the same geographical area. Additional evolutionary forces are likely at work.Mallet, J. & Gilbert, L. (1994). \\"Why are there so many mimicry rings? Correlations between habitats, behaviour, and mimicry in Heliconius butterflies\\". Biological Journal of the Linnean Society (1995), 55: 159-180. === Speciation === Heliconius butterflies are models for the study of speciation. Hybrid speciation has been hypothesized to occur in this genus and may contribute to the diverse mimicry found in Heliconius butterflies. It has been proposed that two closely related species, H. cydno and H. melpomene, hybridized to create the species H. heurippa. In addition, the clade containing Heliconius erato radiated before Heliconius melpomene, establishing the wing pattern diversity found in both species of butterfly. In a DNA sequencing comparison involving species H. m. aglope, H. timareta, and H. m. amaryllis, it was found that gene sequences around mimicry loci were more recently diverged in comparison with the rest of the genome, providing evidence for speciation by hybridization over speciation by ancestral polymorphism.Joel Smith and Marcus R. Kronforst. \\"Do Heliconius Butterflies species exchange mimicry alleles?\\" Biology Letters. 2013 9, 20130503, published 17 July 2013. Hybridization is correlated with introgression. Results from Supple and her team have shown SNP's being polymorphic mostly around hybrid zones of a genome, and they claimed this supported the mechanism of introgression over ancestral variation for genetic material exchange for certain species. Selection factors can drive introgression to revolve around genes correlated with wing pattern and color.Nadeau, N., Martin, S., Kozak, K., Salazar, C., Dasmahapatra, K., Davey, J., Baxter, S., Blaxter, M., Mallet, J., Jiggins C. 2012. Genome-wide patterns of divergence and gene flow across a butterfly radiation. Molecular Ecology (2013) 22, 814-826. Research has shown introgression centering on two known chromosomes that contain mimicry alleles.The Heliconius Genome Consortium. 2012. Butterfly genome reveals promiscuous exchange of mimicry adaptations among species. Nature (2012) vol. 487. Assortive mating reproductively isolates H. heurippa from its parental species. Melo did a study on the hybrid H. heurippa to determine its mating habits regarding preference between other hybrids and its parental species. The results showed H. heurippa chose to reproduce via backcrossing, while the parental species were highly unlikely to reproduce with the backcrosses. This is significant, because hybrids' mating behavior would relatively quickly isolate itself from its parental species, and eventually form a species itself, as defined by lack of gene flow. His team also hypothesized that along with a mixed inheritance of color and pattern, the hybrids also obtained a mixed preference for mates from their parental species genes. The H. heurippa likely had a genetic attraction for other hybrids, leading to its reproductive isolation and speciation. Although rare, Heliconius butterflies are an example of homoploid hybrid speciation, i.e. hybridization without changing the number of chromosomes. Aposematism, using warning colors, has been noted to improve species diversification, which may also contribute to the wide range of Heliconius butterflies. === Sexual selection of aposematic colors=== For aposematism and mimicry to be successful in the butterflies, they must continually evolve their colours to warn predators of their unpalatability. Sexual selection is important in maintaining aposematism, as it helps to select for specific shades of colours rather than general colors. A research team used techniques to determine some the color qualities of a set of butterflies. They found that color was more vivid on the dorsal side of the butterflies than on the ventral. Also, in comparing the sexes, females appeared to have differing brightness in specific spots. It is important to select for specific colors to avoid subtle shades in any of the species involved in the mimicry. Unsuccessful warning colors will reduce the efficiency of the aposematism. To select for specific colours, neural receptors in the butterflies' brains give a disproportionate recognition and selection to those shades.Vane-Wright R.I, P.R. Ackery eds. (1984). The Biology of Butterflies. Symposium of the Royal Entomological Society of London. Number 11. Academic Press, London, U.K. To test the importance of these neural and visual cues in the butterflies, researchers conducted an experiment wherein they eliminated colours from butterflies' wings. When a colour was eliminated, the butterfly was less successful in attracting mates and therefore did not reproduce as much as its counterparts === Mating and offspring === Heliconius has evolved two forms of mating. The main form is standard sexual reproduction. Some species of Heliconius, however, have converged evolutionarily in regard to pupal mating. One species to exhibit this behavior is Heliconius charithonia. In this form of mating, the male Heliconius finds a female pupa and waits until a day before she is moulted to mate with her. With this type of mating there is no sexual selection present. H. erato has a unique mating ritual, in which males transfer anti-aphrodisiac pheromones to females after copulation so that no other males will approach the mated females. No other Lepidoptera exhibit this behavior. Heliconius female butterflies also disperse their eggs much more slowly than other species of butterflies. They obtain their nutrients for egg production through pollen in the adult stage rather than the larval stage. Due to nutrient collection in the adult rather than larval stage, adult females have a much longer life than other species, which allows them to better disperse their eggs for survival and speciation. This form of egg production is helpful because larvae are much more vulnerable than adult stages, although they also utilize aposematism. Because many of the nutrients needed to produce eggs are obtained in the adult stage, the larval stage is much shorter and less susceptible to predation. == Cyanic characteristics == In order to be unpalatable, the Heliconius butterflies use cyanic characteristics, meaning they produce substances that have a cyanide group attached to them, ultimately making them harmful. Research has found that the amino acids needed to make the cyanic compounds come from feeding on pollen.Nahrstedt A, R.H. Davis. 1980. The occurrence of the cyanoglucosides linamarin and lotaustralin, in Acraea and Heliconius butterflies. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.68B:575-577. Although feeding on pollen takes longer than nectar feeding, the aposematic characteristics help to warn predators away and give them more time for feeding. While Heliconius larvae feed on Passifloraceae which also have cyanic characteristics, the larvae have evolved the ability to neutralize cyanic molecules to protect them from the negative effects of the plant.Price P.W., T.M.

Fifth of 16 vessels in the class, Confidence was designed for search and rescue, law enforcement, and alien migrant interdiction operations (AMIO). She originally was assigned to the Seventeenth Coast Guard District for operations in the waters of Alaska, with her home port at Kodiak, Alaska, and began operating there in 1966. In 1968, she came to the aid of the three-man crew of the fishing vessel Chirikof, who had abandoned ship into a skiff without oars when Chirikof sank off Kodiak Island on 29 February and then drifted until sighted by the cargo ship Chena on 1 March; they were too weak from hypothermia to climb Chenas Jacob's ladder, so Confidence arrived on the scene and rescued them from the skiff.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (C) On 14 September 1981, Confidence rescued the six-man crew of the crab-fishing vessel City of Seattle after City of Seattle burned and sank in the Shelikof Strait south of Cape Uganik () on the coast of Uganik Island in Alaska‚Ä≤s Kodiak Archipelago. In the spring of 1983, following 17 years in Alaskan waters, Confidence was reassigned to the Thirteenth Coast Guard District and was home-ported in Port Angeles, Washington. During her time in the Pacific Northwest, Confidences crew seized 17 foreign and U.S. vessels for violations of U.S. law. In January 1986, Confidence and her crew seized the Panamanian freighter Eagle 1 and her cargo of of cocaine. This was the largest maritime seizure of cocaine on the United States West Coast at the time.United States Coast Guard. Confidence History. Accessed November 14, 2006. Confidence was decommissioned and sent to the United States Coast Guard Yard in February 1987 for a major overhaul, referred to as a Midlife Maintenance Availability. Modifications included the installation of a new electronics package to increase the ship's effectiveness, new engines and smokestacks to increase efficiency, and habitability was improved. In October 1988, Confidence was commissioned back into service and sent to her new home port at Port Canaveral, Florida. Now the ship is normally assigned to patrol the waters off the southern coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. Her primary missions are Counter Drug operations, Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Homeland Security Operations, fisheries law enforcement, and Search and Rescue (SAR). Since the fall of 1991, Confidence has been heavily involved in AMIO, including the interdiction of Haitian, Cuban, and Dominican Republic migrants attempting to illegally enter the U.S. One highlight of these operations was Confidences participation in Operation Able Vigil in 1993, and rescued 1,123 Cuban migrants in less than four weeks. The busiest day resulted in the interdiction of 346 migrants from 46 separate rafts and boats in just 16 hours. In Spring 1992, Confidence participated in Operation Able Manner, interdicting 428 Haitian migrants. Later that year, the ship was the primary platform for Operation Restore Dignity off the coast of Haiti, recovering 78 Haitians who perished when their ferry sank. In 2001, Confidence was outfitted with an Over the Horizon rigid hull inflatable boat, designed to transport law enforcement teams at high speeds for long distances independent of the cutter. From January 2003 until June 2005, Confidence interdicted over 1,100 Cuban, Haitian, and Dominican migrants with several noteworthy cases. In November 2004, Confidence rescued 82 migrants from a Haitian sailing vessel taking on water off the coast of the Bahamas. In January 2005, Confidence crewmembers rescued 127 migrants in seas from a , grossly overloaded Dominican yola. In June 2005 during a ten-day period, Confidence safely intercepted 162 Haitians from a vessel on the Great Bahama Bank, seven Cubans from a makeshift vessel sinking in the Old Bahama Channel and 111 Haitians in a vessel in seas north of Great Inagua, Bahamas. The year 2006 was the 40th anniversary of Confidence‚Äôs initial commissioning. The original life expectancy of this cutter class was 30 years, but it is expected she will remain in service an additional 10‚Äì15 years. During her service, Confidence has been awarded the United States Secretary of Transportation‚Äôs Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement, 6 Coast Guard Unit Commendations, 5 Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendations, 3 National Defense Service Medals, 4 Humanitarian Service Medals, and 4 Special Operations Ribbons.

Ron Hubbard. All entries are by L. Ron Hubbard or are \\"based on the Works of L. Ron Hubbard\\", unless otherwise noted. ==Basic Books== The following are known as the Basic Books. These were written within the first years of Dianetics and Scientology development and are not compiled, but rather authored in their entirety by L. Ron Hubbard. * Dianetics: The Original Thesis (1948) : Originally circulated in manuscript form to a few friends, it was soon copied and passed hand-to-hand. It later became widespread and generated a large inflow of correspondence filled with questions, prompting Hubbard to write Dianetics: The Modern Science to Mental Health. Included in this book: The Primary Axioms of Dianetics‚Äîaxioms upon which the entire subject is built; the discovery of the Dynamic Principle of Existence that drives all life forms‚ÄîSURVIVE!; the Four Dynamics by which life is compartmented and which determine one's survival; the discovery and anatomy of the Reactive Mind; engrams, the single source of all irrational behavior; the powerful command in every engram which prevented their discovery and handling before Dianetics; the Analytical Mind, its function and operation; the first description of the state of Clear; its attributes and potentials and the Laws of Returning‚Äîcontaining the explanation of both how and why auditing works. : This book is the result of the first compilation of Hubbard‚Äôs thoughts on his personal research aimed at discovering a technology of the human mind. James R. Lewis writes that the book ‚Äúcontained his basic conclusions concerning the nature of human aberrations and his early ideas about handling them through the counseling technique called auditing.‚Äù * Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (May 1950) : Regarded as \\"Book One\\" by Scientologists, this book set forth Hubbard's principles about the \\"Reactive Mind\\" and the \\"dynamic principle of existence\\". * Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science (April 1950) : Reprints the original Astounding Science Fiction article from (May 1950) that introduced Dianetics prior to Book One. This book contains the only account of how the optimum computing machine‚Äîthe mind‚Äîworks, how Hubbard discovered Basic Personality, how the Dynamic Principle of Existence‚ÄîSURVIVE!‚Äîwas first isolated, how wrong answers enter into the mind and are held down (giving further wrong answers), how there seem to be \\"Demons\\" of the mind, how the engram was discovered, and how Dianetics techniques were developed. * Science of Survival (June 1951) : In this book, Hubbard introduced concepts that were later to become key elements of Scientology: theta, the tone scale, and the possibility of past lives. It contains a description of how theta interacts with the physical universe of matter, energy, space and time‚Äîtermed MEST. The book is written around a Chart of Human Evaluation, providing a complete description of the tone scale and the components of emotion‚Äîthe triangle of Affinity, Reality and Communication and how these components work together (ARC). * Self Analysis (August 1951) : Included in this book: The laws of survival and abundance, The most embracive description of consciousness, Our efforts for immortality and its relationship to matter, energy, space and time, Essays describing a broad array of discoveries including time, remembering, forgetting, imagination, valences and special auditing lists for each. This book also includes self-processing lists that provide the most powerful of auditing and which can be done anywhere and at any time. * Advanced Procedure and Axioms (November 1951) : This is a Dianetics book with theory later developed and has such basic subjects as the Dianetic Axioms‚Äîall of the axioms on which the theory of Dianetics is structured; the Dianetic Logics, a system of thought and analysis based on infinite-valued logic and through which any situation may be evaluated, which Hubbard used from that point on in his research. This book also introduces such concepts as \\"Self-Determinism\\", \\"Absolute Responsibility\\", and the \\"Service Facsimile\\"‚Äîa mechanism by which the individual seeks to make himself right and others wrong by suffering from some inability, illness etc. * Handbook For Preclears (December 1951) : This Dianetics book shares much of the theory of Advanced Procedure and Axioms and is dedicated to self- processing. * A History of Man (July 1952) : Also known as History of Man, Scientology: A History of Man, and its original title What to Audit, this book Hubbard gives ample general case data and rudimentary instructions on how to audit the \\"Whole Track\\" (all of the incidents lived by the individual‚Äîknown as the thetan) and certain common incidents found in all genetic entities (the theta entity apart from the individual himself, which has been found to play a key role in the evolution and development of the body). Among the genetic entity case stories are some of single-celled organisms, clams, sloths and neanderthals. On the thetan's whole track are incidents loosely called \\"space opera,\\" including \\"implants,\\" which are strong engrams deliberately inflicted on the victim for political purposes. :One of Hubbard's first documented writings on the process of \\"theta clearing\\" was in the book, where Hubbard states, \\"Theta clearing is about as practical and simple as repairing a shoelace. It has nothing to do with hypnotism, voodooism, charlatanism, monkeyism or eosophy. Done, the thetan can do anything a stage magician can do in the way of moving objects around.\\" (p.59) * Scientology 8-80 (November 1952) : This book contains the basic laws by which the thetan is able to create energy and therefore influence the environment around him. It also therefore includes newly developed processing related to energy production and stuck or uncontrolled energy over which the thetan isn't taking responsibility. * Scientology 8-8008 (December 1952) : This is one of the most important books in Scientology. The number 8-8008 is a symbolism for the reduction of the MEST universe to zero and expansion of one's own universe to infinity. This book deals in the subject of postulates, considerations and the way in which the individual perceives and therefore creates the physical universe and also his own universe. Processing here deals with the complete rehabilitation of one's own universe so that one can cause an effect on the shared physical universe. * The Creation of Human Ability (July 1954) : This book contains all of the processes derived from previous data and the newly introduced objective processes‚Äîwhich deal in directly perceiving and affecting objective, present-time reality both with the person either interior or exterior to his body. Theologian Marco Frenschkowski comments that the book was created as a reference guide for auditors, to address the practical necessity of orienting them to a ‚Äúmore technical, less philosophical side of Scientology.‚Äù It was compiled by Hubbard‚Äôs office and starts with a bible quotation from the gospel of Luke, one of the longest biblical quotations in the founder‚Äôs writings. The quotation considers Scientology as similar to early Christian missions, because of the common sense of urgency and experience of being in a mission. * Dianetics 55! (December 1954) : This book deals with a very large range of processes all centering around the subject of the individual's communications with his environment. It is the 1955 answer to Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. * Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought (1956) : This book contains all basic Dianetics and Scientology principles and processes developed to the individual and his life as a game. A basic concept in the book is that life is a game no matter what, and that the basic variable is the degree to which the individual knows what games he is playing and the degree to which he can knowingly come up with new ones. ==Additional books on Scientology== These books are not part of the Basics and are either written directly by or compiled from other works by L. Ron Hubbard. * Excalibur (1938) (Unpublished) * How to Live though an Executive (1953) * Brain-Washing Manual (1955, Black Propaganda) * Problems of Work (October 1956) * All About Radiation (1957) : Written by Hubbard, Gene Denk, and Farley R. Spink. Some editions list Hubbard as sole author. Some editions fallaciously refer to Hubbard as a nuclear physicist on the cover. * Have You Lived Before This Life (1958) (No longer published) : A collection of \\"forty-one actual case histories\\" of reincarnation and past-life experiences, gleaned from auditing with an e-meter at the Church of Scientology's \\"Fifth London Advanced Clinical Course\\" held in October‚ÄìNovember 1958. * The Book of E-Meter Drills (1965) : Written by Mary Sue Hubbard; post-1988 editions were credited to L. Ron Hubbard. * Introduction to Scientology Ethics (1968) : Written by Hubbard. * Scientology: A New Slant on Life (1976) : Compiled from works by Hubbard, it contains such Scientology articles as \\"Is It Possible to Be Happy?\\", \\"Two Rules for Happy Living\\", \\"Personal Integrity\\", and \\"'The Anti-Social Personality.\\" \\"A New Slant On Life is a highly practical handbook for the reader seeking to understand himself or herself, and discover his or her own answers.\\" * The Way to Happiness (1981) : In this book, Hubbard wrote a set of relatively loose, common-sense guidelines to achieving happiness. ==Books published after Hubbard's death in 1986== * Clear Body, Clear Mind (1990) : Also known as Purification. Compiled from earlier Hubbard bulletins. Related to the effect harmful chemicals, particularly those lodged in the fatty tissues of the body have in the mind and how these can be removed to solve the problem. * Art (1991) : Art was originally a technical bulletin on the theory of art, Hubbard's attempt at codification of an aesthetic theory. Hubbard's approach focuses on the overlap between communication and art. The three axioms of art that he proposed in the book was that first, \\"too much originality throws the audience into unfamiliarity and therefore disagreement\\". Second that \\"technique should not rise above the level of workability for the purpose of communication\\". Third, \\"perfection cannot be attained at the expense of communication\\".https://wrldrels.org/2017/05/08/scientology-and-the-visual- arts/ * The Scientology Handbook (1994) : The Scientology Handbook is an 871-page handbook published by the Church of Scientology.

He was killed in action at the Battle of Fair Oaks during the Peninsula Campaign. ==Early life== John L. Riker was born in Manhattan in New York City. His father, James Riker (Sr.) was a merchant, landowner and, at one stage, a New York City alderman. His mother, Elizabeth Van Arsdale, was the daughter of Captain John Van Arsdale of Revolutionary War and Evacuation Day fame. John Lafayette was the younger brother of James Riker, the New York genealogist who wrote A Brief History of the Riker Family, from Their First Emigration to This Country in the Year 1638, to the Present Time (1851), History of Harlem (1881) and Evacuation Day, 1783, with Recollections of Capt. John Van Arsdale, of the Veteran Corps of Artillery (1883). John L. Riker is said to have been given his second name, \\"Lafayette\\", by his grandfather, John Van Arsdale, in honor of Gen. Lafayette, who had arrived at Staten Island on the day that Riker was born. Van Arsdale had served with Lafayette during the Revolutionary War and had met with him on August 16, 1824, the day after Riker's birth. Van Arsdale and the Veteran Corp of Artillery, of which he was a member, had received Gen. Lafayette at the Battery, on that day. Despite a lapse of forty-four years, Van Arsdale was recognized by Gen. Lafayette, which so pleased him that later that day when he visited his newborn grandson, he named him \\"John Lafayette\\".Riker, James, \\"Evacuation Day\\" 1783, Its Many Stirring Events: With recollections of Capt. John Van Arsdale of the Veteran Corp of Artillery, by whose efforts on that day the enemy were circumvented, and the American flag successfully raised on the Battery, New York, 1883, p. 49. Sometime in the 1840s Riker married his first cousin Anna E. Elder. Anna was the eldest daughter of Hannah E. Riker, who was the younger sister of his father, James. About 1848 Anna gave birth to Riker's first child, Anna E. Riker. A year or two later she gave birth to a son, John L. Riker Jr. In 1851 Riker's wife, Anna, died of \\"hysteria\\". The following year his father James Riker Sr. died and in 1854 his young son, John L. Riker Jr. died of congestion on the brain. John L. Riker studied law and passed the New York state bar exam in 1860. He began the practice of law, but stopped shortly after the Civil War erupted and he answered President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms to put down the rebellion.New York Public Library Note that researcher John Tierney suggests that while Riker had passed his bar exam in 1860 there is not yet any clear evidence that he practised as an attorney. However, the New York Times, from the same period, often mentions a John Lawrence Riker, also of New York City, who did practice law and was related to John Lafayette Riker. It is possible that the two could be confused. ==Civil War== Riker enlisted in the Union Army April 19, 1861, at Saltersville, New Jersey, where his regiment was soon to be encamped. He was appointed the colonel of a volunteer regiment, initially known as the Anderson Zouaves, that he had raised in New York under the auspices of Major Robert Anderson \\"the hero of Fort Sumter.\\" Riker and his regiment left \\"Camp Astor\\", on his namesake Riker's Island, for Washington, D.C. on August 21, 1861, for service in what became the Army of the Potomac. In early 1862 Riker was courtmartialled for creating a false roster, for extorting money from sutlers and for keeping a woman in his headquarters. However, he was found innocent of the charges, this despite the court having established that a woman, posing as soldier of the regiment, had in fact been with the regiment since it started recruiting in Union Square in 1861 and had spent time with Riker's daughter, Annie, in his headquarters at Tennallytown, DC. Due to his court martial, Riker was unable to lead his regiment during the advance on Manassas in early March 1862, but was able to lead his men later that same month to Fortress Monroe, with the rest of the Army of the Potomac, as part of McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. Riker led his regiment into action at the Battle of Williamsburg and the Battle of Fair Oaks in May 1862. Riker was killed in action at the head of his regiment on the right wing of the Federal line at the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862. His last words were \\"Boys, we're surrounded--give them the cold steel!\\"Townsend, page 312. Several officers of the regiment, including Lieutenant James H. Bradley, Riker's aide- de-camp, and, it is assumed, the regimental chaplain, John Harvey, accompanied the body back to New York City. At a meeting of the friends of Colonel Riker held on June 7, 1862, at the Everett House, New York, which was attended by, amongst others, George W. Morton, Ex-recorder Frederick A. Tallmadge, Mr. E. B. Wood of Kings County and several officers of the Anderson Zouaves, arrangements were made for his funeral. At the meeting Lieut. Bradley gave a long and interesting account of the part played by the regiment in the battle of Fair Oaks from which Riker's coolness under the most trying situations was evident. Bradley incidentally remarked that the Colonel was not struck while waving his sword, as he never drew his sword at all, but spent most of the time quietly smoking his cigar.New York Times, June 8, 1861, p.5. With Riker's death David John Nevin, lieutenant colonel of the regiment, was promoted to colonel, on the field, a position which became effective on June 20 and which he held until he was mustered out on June 29, 1864. The regiment's major Oscar Veniah Dayton, was in turn, promoted to lieutenant colonel. Riker's body lay in state at the Governor's Room of New York's City Hall and on June 10 his body, along with that of Colonel James Miller of the 81st Pennsylvania who had been killed in the same battle, was escorted by the New York State Militia (specifically the Fifth Regiment, a battalion of the Fifty-fifth Regiment, a troop of horse, a troop of Lancers and the Harlem Chasseurs), to Green-wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, where Riker's body was placed in a temporary vault while it awaited permanent interment. While it is not certain, it is possible that prior to the war Riker was a fire fighter and a member of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7, which had its headquarters on Third Ave and 126th Street, close to the Riker family home near the corner of Fifth Ave and 125th street, Harlem. It is known that a number of the recruits of the Anderson Zouaves were members of New York fire companies and representatives of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7 attended his funeral in June 1862. A newspaper report says that Riker was an honorary member of the company, while another report says that when Riker left New York for the seat of war he wore a scarlet shirt under his Zouave jacket. ==Honors== New York‚Äôs Grand Army of the Republic Post #62 was chartered in May 1873 in his name. ==Notes== ==References== *New York Public Library * Townsend, Thomas S., The Honors of the Empire State in the War of the Rebellion, New York: A.

Ju 52/3m, with the motto \\"The southernmost line of the world\\". Aeroposta Argentina S.A. was an early pioneering airline in Argentina established in the late 1920s, and a subsidiary of the French airmail carrier A√©ropostale. It was created on September 5, 1927, as a subsidiary of the A√©ropostale (formally, Compagnie g√©n√©rale a√©ropostale). In 1929, A√©ropostale started expanding its airmail service within South America, and provided the first domestic air services on routes to Asuncion, Paraguay, Santiago de Chile, plus Bah√≠a Blanca, Comodoro Rivadavia and Rio Gallegos in southern Argentina. The task to open the new air routes was given to, among others, two well-known French aviators: Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry as the director of the newly formed company based in Buenos Aires, and to Jean Mermoz, as the company's chief pilot. Saint-Exup√©ry conducted Aeroposta's inaugural flight on November 1, 1929, flying from an airfield at Villa Harding Green to Comodoro Rivadavia. In the early days of commercial aviation, which was still in its infancy, its pioneers had to scout routes and sites for everything from potential emergency landing strips to gasoline depots. Saint- Exup√©ry's experiences in Argentina would inspire his novel Night Flight, winner of the Prix Femina literature award in 1929 and later made into an identically named Hollywood movie. That same year regular flights commenced to other Argentinian cities: Posadas and Mendoza. The following year service was further expanded to include Comodoro Rivadavia and San Antonio Oeste, closely followed by R√≠o Gallegos. Aeroposta Argentina remained Argentina's only airline until 1946, when several new ones were created.McCloskey, Erin. Argentina: 2 Bradt, part of Bradt Guides: Bradt Travel Guide Series, Publisher Bradt Travel Guides, 2011, , . In 1949 Aeroposta Argentina merged with three other air carriers, ALFA (Sociedad Mixta Aviaci√≥n del Litoral Fluvial Argentino), FAMA (Flota Aerea Mercante Argentina) and ZONDA (Zonas Oeste y Norte de Aerolineas Argentinas), giving rise to the county's new national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas. == Ancestral parent: Lignes A√©riennes Lat√©co√®re == A Breguet 14 aircraft used on the Casablanca‚ÄìDakar route. Founded at the end of the World War I, the \\"Lignes A√©riennes Lat√©co√®re\\" was established in September 1919. The France‚ÄìMorocco postal route became its first scheduled air service between Toulouse and Morocco, and which traveled along the cities such as Barcelona and Alicante on the east coast of Spain. On that same time its founder, Pierre-Georges Lat√©co√®re, created the \\"Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Entreprise A√©ronautique\\" and in May 1922, the \\"Soci√©t√© Industrielle des Avions Lat√©co√®re\\". In order to extend the line between Casablanca and Dakar, Captain Joseph Roig departed on May 3, 1923, with a group of three biplanes, Br√©guet XIVs which flew between Agadir, Cap Juby, Villa Cisneros, and Port Etienne, on the west coast of Africa. The arrived at their destination on May 22. According to the plan he had conceived during the war by Pierre G. Lat√©co√©re, Captain Joseph Roig was sent to South America in May 1924 in order to consider extending the line between Natal, Brazil and Buenos Aires. In the capital city Joseph Roig met with officials of the Department of Civil Aviation of the War Office and explained that the aim of the directors of the Compagnie g√©n√©rale d'entreprises a√©ronautiques (CGEA) was that Buenos Aires would become terminal site of a future South American airmail line between that continent and France, and later to become a clearinghouse of airmail between Argentina, and its neighboring countries. President Dr. Marcelo Torcuato Alvear was excited about the idea and gave his approval for the company to send a mission to civil aviation. This time, Captain Roig and his group of three biplanes Br√©guet XIV Renault, made a reconnaissance flight from Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires, landing on 14 January 1925, in El Palomar, accompanied by Paul Vachet pilots, Etienne Lafay and Victor Hamm and mechanics Gauthier, Estival and Chevalier. In unfavorable weather conditions in March 1925, they started back conducting aerial surveys between Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco (Recife), that would be useful for future pilots of the Atlantic line. Two months later, in June 1925, regular air mail service between Toulouse, Casablanca and Dakar was established. In order to raise the capital required for the development of the line on the South American continent, Pierre Georges Lat√©co√®re travels to Rio de Janeiro on December 3, 1926, to meet with French businessman living in Brazil, Marcel-Lafont Bouilloux . Immediately, in January 1927 and accompanied by the Argentine aviator Vincent Almandos Almonacid, meet both in Buenos Aires with the President of the Republic, Dr. Marcelo Alvear and the urgent request submission of a contract that allows the country to service the proposed use Aeropostal with France. Representative in his capacity as Trustee of the \\"Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Entreprises A√©ronautiques\\" Vicente Almandos Almonacid writes and signs a document with the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Arthur Goyeneche, the February 8, 1927, establishing an agreement for the transport of mail by air within and neighboring countries, which would be ratified by the Decree of the National Executive 10 June 1927, signed by the President of the Argentina, Dr. Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear and his interior minister, Jos√© P. Tamborini. Meanwhile, negotiations between Pierre Georges Lat√©co√®re and Marcel Bouilloux-Lafont culminated when the latter purchased, on April 11, 1927, 93% of the shares of \\"Compagnie Generale d'Entreprises A√©ronautiques\\" at the cost of 30 million francs, taking over the company's directorships, and agreeing to buy Lat√©co√®re 25s, 26s and 28s manufactured by the \\"Soci√©t√© Industrielle des Avions Lat√©co√®re\\". As a result of the transfer of functions, at a special meeting held in Paris on December 12, 1927, they resolved to change the name of Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Entreprises A√©ronautiques with the new name of Compagnie G√©n√©rale A√©ropostale. == Birth of Aeroposta Argentina S.A. == A Lat√©co√®re 25, preserved in the National Aeronautical Museum of Argentina. Surprisingly, on August 13, 1926, an Executive Order amended the Regulations for Navigation on the Argentine Territory, which did not allow the use of Argentine airspace by foreign companies and where the War Office should adopt positions Defense, civil aircraft to peaceful use. In order to conform to these Regulations, Vicente Almandos Almonacid proposes the establishment of a national corporation, a proposal that has the approval of the Chairman Dr. Marcelo T. Alvear and prestigious Argentine jurists. The Constitutive Act of the Aeroposta Argentina S. A. was signed into law on September 5, 1927, with Argentina being an affiliate of the \\"Compagnie G√©n√©rale A√©ropostale,\\" by Agustin Melian gentlemen, on behalf of Marcel Bouilloux-Lafont, Alberto Dodero, Gaston Fouvell Lleau Rigo, Alejandro Behety Menendez, Luis Nicol, Guillermo Padilla (Aeronautical Radio Head, Department of Civil Aviation), Raul A. Razzio, Emmanuel Sieyes and Mr. Almonacid, with headquarters on Calle Reconquista No. 240 of the Federal Capital. On November 1, 1927 Paul Georges Pivot inaugurated the Vachet Natal‚ÄìRio‚ÄìBuenos Aires route using a Lat√©co√®re 25 registered as F-AIOZ, which was extended on March 1, 1928, when Jean Mermoz, aboard a Lat√©co√®re 25 loaded with 36 bags of mail, inaugurated the world's longest (13,600 km), from Toulouse to Dakar connecting Buenos Aires‚ÄìNatal by sea until 1935. This route was called the \\"Mermoz line.\\" After considering several locations, he chose Almonacid Pacheco, 35 km from Buenos Aires, where he built the airfield in 1928. In one corner of the field, there were three antennas 30 metres tall and housing material which had been used to build the LPD Radio Station \\"General Pacheco\\", a powerful multimedia station which was later transferred to the Post and Telecommunications and from where communications were made first with the other bases, since at that time the aircraft had no radio, and later with the company aircraft and ships overseas. == Buenos Aires to Asuncion, Paraguay route == There are two flights of exploration for studies of this route: * On April 3, 1928, Peter Ficarelli departed aboard a Br√©guet XIV (Renault 300 HP) biplane from the General Pacheco Aerodrome in Buenos Aires at 08:00 Hrs in the morning, and after a stopover at the Aeroclub of Rosario, continuing on to Entre Rios, Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa, while taking note of the airfields and flying clubs that might be suitable as airfields. * On October 31, 1928, Paul Vachet, Chief Traffic Company, departed the General Pacheco Aerodrome aboard a Breguet XIV biplane at 07:00 Hrs carrying several copies of the newspaper La Prensa and arriving at the airport of Asuncion, Paraguay at 18:00 Hrs, defining the final layout of the air route from Buenos Aires to Asuncion, Paraguay. On Tuesday, January 1, 1929, Argentina Aeroposta started mail services and passenger transport, still without official authorization, at 06:00 Hrs in the morning, leaving the General Pacheco Aerodrome with two Lat√©co√®re 25 (Renault 450 HP) monoplanes: * Paul and Peter Ficarelli Vachet aboard the No. 619, registration F-AIFX led to Ms. Lidia Vachet, engineer Padilla (company director) and the mechanic Gutierrez. * The Aviator Leonardo Selvetti Argentina, accompanied by mechanical Ferrando and Mr. Di Sandro aboard the No. 631, registration F-AIJZ, named \\"Colonel Bogado\\" carried a small number of letters and copies of the newspaper La Prensa. After stopping at Corrientes, both aircraft landed at the military airport of Campo Grande Paraguay, in the presence of authorities and large audience, but the correspondence had not been transported not released an official capacity for lack of authorization of government Argentina, these historic flights are considered \\"trial airmails\\". Finally, after reforming the \\"Regulations on Navigation on the Argentine territory,\\" on February 27, 1929, the national government gave the anticipated authorization and thus, Pedro Ficarelli departed aboard an aircraft Lat√©co√®re 25 from the General Pacheco Aerodrome on Friday at 06:00 Hrs on March 22, 1929, this being the first official postal flight from Argentina. Ficarelli Peter lost his life near Asuncion, Paraguay on August 16, 1929, after colliding with a mountain in the Lat√©co√®re 25, No. 619, registration F-AIFX, amid thick fog. == Buenos Aires ‚Äì Mendoza ‚Äì Santiago de Chile route == Henri Guillaumet's crashed Potez 25, F-AJDZ, on the frozen surface of Laguna del Diamante in the Andes. In order to explore the best routes to cross the Andes mountain range, which extend down the length of South America, Jean Mermoz and his mechanic Alexandre Collenot conducted the first test flights between Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. They began on November 19, 1928, and continued until March 9, 1929, flying towards Mendoza, Argentina aboard their Lat√©co√®re 25 (No. 603, registration F-AIEH). At one point they had to land on the narrow ledge of a mountain range and then, after making adjustments to their engine carburetor, managed to take off and reach the safely of Copiap√≥, Chile. This experience convinced them that the aircraft best suited to fly the airmail route between Argentina and Chile over the Andes would be a Potez 25, because of its superior climbing ability‚Äîneeded to rise above the Andes. Five such planes were purchased, registered as: F-AJDX (No. 1520), F-AJDY (No. 1521), F-AIDZ (No. 1522), F-AJZR (No. 2035) and F-AJZS (No. 2036). Finally, on July 14, 1929, Jean Mermoz and Henri Guillaumet conducted the first Santiago de Chile to Mendoza airmail flight in a Potez 25. Later, on June 13, 1930, Guillaumet crashed his Potez (registration F-AJDZ) on the surface of a frozen lake, Laguna del Diamante, but was found on June 20 by 14-year-old Juan Garcia (a future Argentinian pastor) after a harrowing, death-defying walk out of the Andes. (Garcia would later be decorated with the Legion of Honour for this 71 years after the event by French President Jacques Chirac.)

In February 1929, Paul Vachet continued exploration flights and began building the infrastructure of future scales. Between October 29 and November 1, 1929, the final inspection flights were performed by the company's director Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, accompanied by pilot Rufino Luro Cambaceres aboard a Lat√©co√®re 25, registration F-AIQF, along with the other pilots Prospero Palazzo and Richard Gross in another Lat√©co√®re 25, registration F-AIQL. On November 1, 1929, the Buenos Aires‚ÄìBah√≠a Blanca‚ÄìComodoro Rivadavia line opened, with stops in San Antonio Oeste (now Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry Airport) and Trelew. Without prejudice to the first flight was made by Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry aboard the Lat√©co√®re 25, F-AIQL, carrying as passengers for journalists from bahienses: Enrique Julio \\"La Nueva Provincia,\\" Emilio J. Fence \\"The Atlantic\\" and Augustus Hunter \\"Morning\\", delivering and receiving mail in each of the scales, \\"the official inauguration flight\\" was conducted by Jean Mermoz, accompanied by Richard Gross pilot on board Lat√©co√®re 28 aircraft that started in the early morning hours at the General Pacheco Aerodrome, carrying Captain Almandos Almonacid, Director of Aeroposta Argentina, plus officials and journalists. At Bah√≠a Blanca, was replaced by Richard Gross Palazo Prospero, who was in charge of 'the line' to Comodoro Rivadavia. During the first six months, the head of the line was located in the area of Villa Harding Green, Bah√≠a Blanca, where they had built a metal hangar, two towers for the radio station, a weather station and a villa for office and attention to the passenger. The connection to Buenos Aires, Bah√≠a Blanca was made by rail, from the Constitution Station, traveling all night to arrive at Bah√≠a Blanca in the morning. In May 1930 he began operating from General Pacheco Aerodrome, becoming White Bay on a scale of travel. Meanwhile, in March 1930, Mermoz flew the first transatlantic airmail in 21 hours aboard a pontoon equipped Lat√©co√®re 28 and carrying 130 kg of correspondence, on Wednesday 31 of that month Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, Director of Operations of the Company, made the inaugural flight to Rio Gallegos in the Lat√©co√®re 28 aircraft, registration F-AJLO, \\"El Pampero\\", carrying passengers as Chairman of the Aeroposta, Mr. Marcel Boilloux Lafont, the Technical Director of the Company, Captain Vicente Almandos Almonacid, and the Viscount Jacques Delalot (Havas Agency Director), Julian Pranville (official Aeropostale) and journalist The reason, Mr. Enrique Gutierrez, being accompanied by Luro Cambaceres in the Lat√©co√®re 25, registration F-AIQF.

Horat: Palazzo: El H√©roe Olvidado (Jorge J. Horat, The Forgotten Hero), SeguridadSolidaria.com website == The National Aeroposta == Because of the Great Depression, Bouilloux-Lafont, who ran a major banking consortium and transport companies, was irretrievably affected. From early 1930, the French Government refused to release the loan approval that had been agreed in an agreement signed the previous year, and the company's financial situation was aggravated by the Argentinian coup of September 1930, in a revolution that would lead Get√∫lio Vargas to power in Brazil in October of that year. In December of the same year some ministerial changes that are occurring in France to renew the lease prevent you from operating and guaranteed by the State to get new loans. For the Compagnie G√©n√©rale A√©ropostale is the end, the 31 March 1931 the company is liquidated, which would later be absorbed into the group of companies that would later give rise to Air France in 1933, continuing the activities of its A√©ropostale and its other sibling predecessors. The situation for Argentina Aeroposta was not very different, with the Argentine government also denying funds, and in June 1931 it ceased operations. However, the Director of Postal Services and the Director of Civil Aviation joined the claims of the press and the general public and finally convinced the President of Argentine's provisional government to authorize Aeroposta Argentina SA to resume their services. By decree of 29 September 1931, the Company is subject to a lease and control of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the General Post and Telegraph, for the operation of the line between Bah√≠a Blanca and Rio Gallegos, on an experimental basis for a period of six months, leasing its flight equipment and facilities that the Company had, at a cost of $7,000 per month. Legally, the company was designated as National Aeroposta, although at the corporate level it was still operated as Aeroposta Argentina S.A. Services were restarted on October 2, 1931, until May 31, 1932, when a new decree extends the authorization from the June 1, 1932, until December 31, granting for the first time, a fixed monthly allowance and the provision of fuel needed to account for YPF, while a third decree, that of March 24, 1933, fixed the operating agreement a term of 10 years, increased the amount of the grant and contemplated the possibility of extending the route to Ushuaia. In October 1933 Rufino Luro Cambaceres made a reconnaissance flight and promotion by the Patagonia, explaining the authorities and population, the benefits of air transport for both mail and passenger, causing several southern regions of the requests sent to Buenos Aires for the line include its cities like scales. In early 1935, Argentina Aeroposta purchased obsolete aircraft from Air France that had once belonged to A√©ropostale, and in September 1935 and continued service to Rio Grande. In November 1935 the bylaws of the company were amended, allowing the entry of a group share Argentina. == The Pueyrred√≥n consortium == When, in 1936, new financial difficulties threatened the operations of the line, a new group of Argentine businessmen, headed by Dr. Ernesto Pueyrred√≥n formed a consortium which acquired 97% stake in the company, which ultimately rests with nationals. Officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and by Decree 99,184 of 1 February 1937, authorized the company to extend its flights departing from Buenos Aires and replaces the cash grant and fuel for a monthly contribution of $1.50 per every mile flown for the trip. In this new contract, which provided for a period of 10 years, the Company must make a 50% discount in the price of tickets for Posts and Telegraphs and the Aeronautics Directorate, had seats available, and reserve up to 2 kg charging for official correspondence, to be carried free of charge and commitment to renew the existing flight material. In a pivot to Germany, the company bought the first three Junkers Trimotor Ju 52/3m in 1937, registered LV-AAB \\"Patagonia\\", LV-BAB \\"Pampa\\" and LV-CAB \\"Tierra del Fuego\\", plus spare parts, BMW engines and Lorenz and Telefunken radios, in order to modernize its operating equipment.

The \\"Nazi Menace\\" in Argentina, 1931-1947, Stanford University Press, 1992. where, in October of that year, the first regular flights between Buenos Aires and Rio Grande were started, on board the \\"Patagonia\\". They were piloted by Paul Selvetti Rohlandt and the Argentines Gross and Irigoyen. In April 1938, another decree authorizing Aeroposta Argentina S.A. to combine the national and international operating with Air France and Condor Ltda Union in December 1939 decree changing the frequency Buenos Aires ‚Äì Rio Gallegos and Rio Grande.

Sev. 68) which, either from interpolation or from the inaccuracy of the author, abounds with anachronisms, Callistratus is stated to have been a disciple of Papinian, and to have been one of the council of Alexander Severus. This statement may be correct, notwithstanding the suspicious character of the source whence it is derived. ==Works== The numerous extracts from Callistratus in the Digest occupy eighteen pages in Hommel's Palingenesia Pandectarum; and the fact that he is cited by no other jurist in the Digest may be accounted for by observing that this work contains extracts from few jurists of importance subsequent to Callistratus. The extracts from Callistratus are taken from works bearing the following titles: * Libri VI de Cognitionibus * Libri VI Edicti Monitorii * Libri IV de Jure Fisci, or de Jure Fisci et Populi * Libri III Institutionum * Libri II Quaestionum The titles of the first three of these works require some explanation. ===de Cognitionibus=== This treatise relates to those causes which were heard, investigated, and decided by the emperor, the governor of a province, or other magistrate, without the intervention of judices. This departure from the ordinary course of the civil law took place, even before Diocletian's general abolition of the ordo judiciorum, sometimes by virtue of the imperial prerogative, and in some cases was regularly practiced for the purpose of affording equitable relief where the strict civil law gave no remedy, instead of resorting to the more tortuous system of legal fictions and equitable actions. ===Edictum Monitorium=== What is meant by the title of this work is by no means clear. Haubold (de Edictis Monitoriis ac Brevibus, Leipzig, 1804) thinks that monitory edicts are not special writs of notice or summons directed to the parties in the course of a cause, but those general clauses of the edictum perpetuum which relate to the law of procedure, giving actions and other remedies on certain conditions, and therefore, tacitly at least, containing warnings as to the consequences of irregularity or nonfulfilment of the prescribed conditions. The fragments of Callistratus certainly afford much support to this view. Haubold distinguishes the edictum monitorium from the edictum breve, upon which Paulus wrote a treatise. The latter he supposes to consist of those new clauses, which, in process of time, were added as an appendage to the edictum perpetuum, after the main body of it had acquired a constant form. ===de Jure Fisci (et Populi)=== The phrase de Jure Fisci et Populi appears anomalous, but it occurs elsewhere. (See Paulus, Recept. Sent. 5.12.) The Augustan History also (Alex. Sev. 15) says that Alexander Severus \\"leges de jure populi et fisci moderatas et infinitas (?) sanxit.\\" Probably under the phrase \\"jus populi\\" must here be understood the law relating to the aerarium, or to the arca publica (which latter, practically as well as theoretically, was at the disposal of the senate) as distinguished from the fiscus, which was the emperor's own, not as res privata, but as property attached to the imperial dignity.

O'Hara's character was dropped after the fourth episode. Though counted as a single season, the show aired in discrete blocks of episodes. The show aired four weekly episodes on Wednesday nights in August and September, technically before the 1979/80 TV season actually began. Then the show was off the air for six months, returning in March through early May for a run of seven episodes. (The initial episode was a special presentation on Wednesday right after Diff'rent Strokes; the show then moved to Fridays.) After a month off, the series moved back to Wednesday nights for the season's one final episodes aired in June. ===Season 2 (1980‚Äì81)=== The main cast is reduced to five main characters: Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel), Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), Tootie Ramsey (Kim Fields), and new girl Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon). Mr. Parker (Roger Perry) is a recurring character as the school's new headmaster. The casting will stay the same through season 4. ===Season 3 (1981‚Äì82)=== Linda Marsh and Margie Peters join Jerry Mayer as producers. Jack Elison and Jerry Mayer were the executive producers. ===Season 4 (1982‚Äì83)=== ===Season 5 (1983‚Äì84)=== Blair and Jo start college, and Mrs. Garrett quits Eastland and opens her own gourmet food shop and catering business. Blair, Jo, Tootie, and Natalie all move in with her. Pamela Segall joins the cast this season, beginning with the episode \\"Just My Bill\\". Her final appearance is in the episode \\"Seems Like Old Times\\", and her character is dropped following that episode. ===Season 6 (1984‚Äì85)=== Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) was absent from several episodes in season 6 per Rae's request for reduced appearances. ===Season 7 (1985‚Äì86)=== Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) was again absent from several episodes per Rae's request for reduced appearances. Starting this season, Mackenzie Astin, who plays Andy Moffett, and George Clooney, who plays George Burnett, receive billing in the opening credits. ===Season 8 (1986‚Äì87)=== Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) remarries and leaves the series after the two part season premiere. Her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle (Cloris Leachman), moves in to care for the house and business. George Burnett, played by George Clooney, becomes a recurring character. ===Season 9 (1987‚Äì88)=== Pippa McKenna, played by Sherri√© Austin, is introduced as a recurring character. ==TV movies== ==NotesFacts of Life, The Episodes ","title":"List of The Facts of Life episodes"},{"id":"7783480","text":"Clayton Farlow is a fictional character in the popular American television series Dallas, played by Howard Keel from 1981 to 1991. ==Background== Clayton Farlow, along with his sister Jessica (Alexis Smith), was raised on the Southern Cross Ranch (Co-ordinates: 32¬∞43'N 96¬∞30'W) in San Angelo, Texas. Clayton and Jessica's father was described as a \\"big man that liked the oil business, but ranching was his real love\\". Clayton's father took him to his first cattle auction when he was six years old and began teaching him ranching and the oil business. Like his father, Clayton became a successful oilman and rancher. Jessica was wild in her teenage years and developed a serious violent mental condition. She gave birth to a son Steven \\"Dusty\\" Farlow (Jared Martin) in London, England. Clayton and his new wife, Amy, became Steven's legal parents when they listed themselves on Steven's birth certificate, while Jessica married an English lord and remained in England. Clayton and Amy returned to Texas with Steven. Jessica, thinking Amy wanted to replace her as Steven's mother, set the house on fire while Amy was sick in bed - and Clayton was in Galveston on business with his oil refineries. Clayton returned home too late to save Amy. Steven, who was nicknamed Dusty, showed no interest in the oil business or the ranch, choosing instead to become a rodeo star. Steven (Dusty) Farlow met Sue Ellen Ewing at the Ewing Rodeo, and they soon began an affair. When Dusty was on a private flight to Fort Worth to meet Sue Ellen, his plane crashed. He survived and recovered at a home in Denton. ==Storylines== Clayton was helping Dusty recover from his plane accident when he first met Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) and the rest of the Ewing family; Sue Ellen found Dusty after he secretly put up her bail when she was accused of shooting her husband, J.R. (Larry Hagman). Sue Ellen filed for a divorce, taking their son John Ross with her to Southern Cross. When he found out, Jock (Jim Davis) was furious and told J.R. that he wanted John Ross back on Southfork no matter what. After failed attempts to get John Ross back, J.R., with Jock's full support, bought all of the oil that went into Clayton's refineries. J.R. agreed to give it back if Clayton kicked Sue Ellen off the Southern Cross. Clayton refused, but Sue Ellen left on her own, returning to Dallas, and eventually remarried J.R. and moved back to Southfork. The oil was sold back to him by Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), and they became friends. During this time, Clayton became romantically attracted to Sue Ellen and defended her against J.R. Later, after Jock was killed in a helicopter crash in South America, Miss Ellie dated and eventually married Clayton. During his courtship of Miss Ellie, Clayton became very jealous of the life Jock had: having sons carry on his legacy in the oil business, a devoted wife, and a big family with sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. Shortly before her marriage to Clayton, Miss Ellie was kidnapped by Clayton's mentally unstable sister Jessica, who conspired with J.R. to stop the wedding. Clayton and Miss Ellie honeymooned in Greece, and returned to Southfork, in spite of Clayton's reservations about living in Jock's home and his constant \\"shadow\\". To ease his transition, Miss Ellie redecorated Jock and Miss Ellie's bedroom, but Clayton went on business trips to avoid staying at Southfork. Finally, Miss Ellie had J.R. and Bobby (Patrick Duffy) move Jock's portrait from the living room at Southfork to Ewing Oil. Clayton became very good friends with his stepson Bobby and Ray, but remained a self-imposed enemy of eldest stepson J.R., getting into many arguments and fights with him. Clayton has a brief infatuation with a young British model named Laurel Ellis (Annabel Schofield), mirroring Jock's near-affair with his former secretary Julie Grey (Tina Louise), after feeling neglected by Miss Ellie. He also suffered from amnesia and nearly left Miss Ellie until recovering. Clayton sold his refinery businesses to Ewing Oil and at one point began a cutting horse breeding enterprise with Ray. In 1990, Clayton, unable to live with the shadow of Jock's memory, and Miss Ellie left Southfork to travel extensively. In the final season, he returned to Dallas briefly, without Miss Ellie, to convey sole ownership of Southfork to Bobby, much to the objection of J.R. ==Dallas (2012 TV series)== In the updated Dallas series, Clayton died after a heart attack in 1999. According to the Dallas Facebook page, he died on March 17, 1999. ==Trivia== Clayton appeared in nearly every episode after joining the cast full-time in 1984, after a recurring role during the 1981‚Äì82 season (semi-replacing the late Jim Davis as the senior family patriarch), missing 26 episodes altogether (three of these due to Keel's 1986 open-heart surgery) and appearing briefly in the final season. ==References== ==External links== Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1981 Category:Fictional businesspeople ","title":"Clayton Farlow"},{"id":"7783506","text":"Andrea Day (born September 19, 1968) was a reporter at WNYW-FOX 5 New York City from 1997 through 2011, where she appeared on both Good Day New York and \\"FOX 5 News at 10.\\" http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/about_us/personalities/Andrea_Day My Fox NY Currently, she is a freelance reporter handling the financial crime and punishment beat for CNBC and a mother of 4. ==Career== Before joining FOX 5, Andrea was a reporter at News 12 Long Island.

Cynddylan is attested only in literary sources: unlike many kings from Brittonic-speaking post-Roman Britain, he does not appear in the early Welsh genealogies or other historical sources.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 120 n. 1. The son of King Cyndrwyn, Cynddylan is described in the probably seventh-century poem Marwnad Cynddylan (Elegy for Cynddylan) and seems to have been a chieftain in Powys. ==Historical context== Some understanding of the historical context in which Cynddylan must have lived is afforded by Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, the Historia Brittonum, and early Welsh genealogies. With the collapse of the Roman Empire and the invasion of the Saxons, the remains of the civitas of the Cornovii held on to their lands in the lowland border regions of Wales (Herefordshire and Shropshire). By the beginning of the seventh century King Cystennin was the dominant ruler in the Old North, while King Cyndrwyn \\"the Stubborn\\" ruled Powys. Cyndrwyn died before 642 when his sons, chief of whom was Cynddylan, joined Penda of Mercia in the defeat of King Oswald of Northumbria at the Battle of Maserfield (), which may have taken place just outside Oswestry. It seems clear both from the poems and from a wider context of known alliances that Cynddylan worked, at least at key points in his career, in alliance with the kings of Mercia: Cadwallon ap Cadfan (d. 634) was allied with Mercia in 633; the Mercian king Penda seems to have lost partly because of the defection of a Welsh ally, Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw (d. c. 655).Patrick Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature in Western England 600-800, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 28; cf. Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 120-41. The Marwnad Cynddylan certainly mentions Cynddylan aiding Penda (l. 28). However, neither the occasion of Cynddylan's assistance to Penda nor of Cynddylan's death is known. Known possible battles include Penda's defeat of Oswald of Northumbria in 641 at Oswestry (the location of the battle being referred to in Old English as Maserfelth, and in Welsh sources as Cogwy): a stray verse appended to Canu Heledd in the manuscript National Library of Wales 4973 claims that 'Cynddylan was a helper' at a battle at Cogwy.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 445 (edition) and 494 (translation) [stanza 111). The Battle of the Winwaed (654/55), in which Oswiu defeated and killed Penda, is a popular suggestion for the battle in which Cynddylan died.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 135; John T. Koch, 'Cynddylan fab Cyndrwyn', in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), pp. 535-36. But Marwnad Cynddylan also refers (in lines 42-62) to a major fight near Lichfield, in Mercian territory, otherwise unknown but sometimes imagined to have taken place after Penda's death.Patrick Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature in Western England 600-800, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 29. Marwnad Cynddylan makes it clear that the Cadelling, the dynasty descending from Cadell Ddyrnllwg, were rivals to Cynddylan.John T. Koch, 'Cynddylan fab Cyndrwyn', in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), pp. 535-36. The later and less reliable Canu Heledd suggest that Cynddylan died defending Powys from English invaders at a place called Tren,'Marwnad Cynddylan', in Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 429-31 (edition) and pp. 483-84 (translation). generally understood as the River Tern in Shropshire.John T. Koch, 'Cynddylan fab Cyndrwyn', in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), pp. 535-36. ==Sources and their value== As mentioned, Cynddylan is attested only through literary sources. ===Marwnad Cynddylan=== The key source for Cynddylan is the lament for his death known as Marwnad Cynddylan ('). Marwnad Cynddylan is a seventy- or seventy-one-line awdl-poem (not to be confused with the englyn-poem of the same name in Canu Heledd). It is generally thought to have originated at around the time of Cynddylan's death.Patrick Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature in Western England 600-800, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 28. Strikingly, it is actually addressed not to a king of Powys, Cynddylan's home, but of Dogfeiling, a sub-kingdom of Gwynedd near to Rhuthun in the middle of Denbighshire, based in Aberffraw, which suggests a rather complex political context for its composition.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 135. The poem is first attested in the manuscript National Library of Wales 4973, pp. 108a-109b, a manuscript of ancient poetry compiled by Dr John Davies of Mallwyd around 1631-34. Other early copies (Panton 14 and British Library, Add. MS. 14867) derived from Davies's. Davies's copy includes a variety of old spellings consistent with the thirteenth-century conventions attested in the Black Book of Carmarthen, but the orthography is mostly modernised, not always accurately, making the poem particularly tricky to interpret.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 180.

The cycle includes another Marwnad Cynddylan, not to be confused with the more famous and probably more historically reliable awdl poem of the same name. While some historians have taken the cycle as reliable evidence for events in the sixth century, it is now thought to be a reimagining of historical people and places which owes much more to the political situation of its time of composition.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‚ÄòEnglynion‚Äô (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 120-41.

It is also known as the Anderson Zouaves. ==Organization== It was raised under special authority of the War Department in New York City by Col. John Lafayette Riker in May and June 1861, in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the insurrection in the rebellious Southern states of the United States of America. The regiment was named in honor of, and raised under the auspices of, Major Robert Anderson, \\"the hero of Fort Sumter\\". The regiment was later numerically designated the Sixty-second New York State Volunteers. The regiment was mustered in at Saltersville (now part of Bayonne), New Jersey on June 30 and July 1, 1861. ==Service== The regiment left New York from its Camp Astor on Rikers Island on August 21, 1861. The regiment embarked upon the steamer Kill Van Kull by which the men and the camp equipment were transported the Elizabethport New Jersey, from where the regiment was transported to Washington, D.C. by the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The regiment arrived in Baltimore at 9am the next morning where they disembarked in order to change trains. On their march through the town the regiment was cheered by the crowd. By 1pm the regiment and its equipment had been transferred to the carriages at the south bound depot and by late that day the regiment arrived in Washington. On August 23, the Anderson Zouaves marched through Washington and on to Meridian Hill where they were reviewed the next day by William H. Seward. On September 13, 1861, the regiment was brigaded with the 6th New Jersey, the 55th New York, aka the Gardes Lafayette and the 102nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment (the Old 13th Pittsburgh Washington Infantry), under the command of General John J. Peck. On September 26, the regiment broke camp in abeyance to an order received the previous evening and marched two or three miles to the village of Kalorama on Rock Creek, where, on the rocky, sloping ground of Swartz' Farm the brigade established Camp Holt. After two weeks in this location, October 9, 1861, the Anderson Zouaves along with the rest of Peck's brigade was moved to Tennallytown where it replaced McCall's Division of the Pennsylvania Reserves, which had crossed the Chain Bridge into Virginia the day previous. On October 1, 1861, while at Camp Tennally, the regiment's Lieutenant Colonel, William S. Tisdale, was discharged due to disability and was replaced by David J. Nevin, the captain of company \\"D\\". The Anderson Zouaves spent the winter in camp at Tennallytown, until it took part in the Advance on Manassas on March 10, 1862. The regiment marched to Prospect Hill where it lay for three days, before returning to its old camp at Tennallytown. On March 26, the regiment deployed to McClellan's Peninsula Campaign aboard transports at Georgetown harbor. The Anderson Zouaves fought at Gettysburg. The regiment was mustered out at Fort Schuyler, New York Harbor, on August 30, 1865. It lost during its term of service 3 officers and 85 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 2 officers and 82 enlisted men by disease; total 172.

He is most famous for leading the reconquest of the territory in 1692 following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This reconquest is commemorated annually during the Fiestas de Santa Fe in the city of Santa Fe. ==Pueblo revolt and reconquest== On 10 August 1680, Pueblo people from various pueblos in northern New Mexico staged an uprising against Spanish colonists.Warren A. Beck, New Mexico; a History of Four Centuries, University of Oklahoma Press, 1962 They laid siege to the city of Santa Fe, forcing the Spanish to retreat on 20 August. The colonists fled south to El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico), where they remained in exile for the next 16 years.Warren A. Beck, New Mexico; a History of Four Centuries, University of Oklahoma Press, 1962 In 1688, Capitan General y Governador Don Diego de Vargas was appointed Governor of New Mexico, though he did not arrive to assume his duties until 22 February 1691.Warren A. Beck, New Mexico; a History of Four Centuries, University of Oklahoma Press, 1962 He was assigned with the task of reconquering and pacifying the New Mexico territory for Spain. In July 1692, de Vargas and a small contingent of soldiers returned to Santa Fe. They surrounded the city and called on the Pueblo people to surrender, promising clemency if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. After meeting with de Vargas, the Pueblo leaders agreed to surrender, and on 12 September 1692 de Vargas proclaimed a formal act of repossession. De Vargas‚Äô repossession of New Mexico is often called a bloodless reconquest, since the territory was initially retaken without any use of force. Later, when de Vargas returned to Mexico in early 1693 to retrieve a group of settlers, they had to fight their way into Santa Fe. Warriors from four of the pueblos sided with the colonists, but most opposed them. When the capital had been taken, Don Diego ordered some 70 of the Pueblo men killed. Women and children were distributed as servants to the colonists. Similar bloody fighting occurred at many of the other pueblos before the governor felt that the native people had truly submitted to his and the king's authority. The end of widespread hostilities did not mean an end to Pueblo resentment over continued heavy-handed treatment by the colonists. The plundering of Pueblo stocks of corn and other supplies, to sustain the struggling colony, was a periodic occurrence that inflamed animosity. By the end of the century the Spanish colonization was essentially solidified. De Vargas had prayed to the Virgin Mary, under her title La Conquistadora (The Conqueress), for the peaceful re-entry. Believing that she heard his prayer, he celebrated a feast in her honor. Today, this feast continues to be celebrated annually in Santa Fe as the Fiestas de Santa Fe. Part of those annual fiestas is a novena of masses in thanksgiving. Those masses are also done with processions, from the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi, to the Rosario Chapel. The actual statue of La Conquistadora is taken in the processions. After the novena is completed, she is taken back to the Basilica. This event includes participation by local tribes as well as European descendants of individuals that now reside in the area. In the second decade of the 21st century, members of Native American tribes and pueblos protested the pageant, recalling the actually blood-filled 1692 retaking of Santa Fe. The focus of these protests was The Entrada‚Äîa reenactment of de Vargas's re-entry into Santa Fe that has long been seen as inaccurate by historians and culturally offensive by Native Americans. The most recent round of protests against The Entrada started in 2015. That year, silent protestors raised placards citing historical facts at odds with the narrative annually given when the re-enactors reached Santa Fe's historic Plaza to portray the retaking of the city. In 2016, the protestors were quite vocal, and it became clear that The Entrada was likely headed for a serious change. In 2017, the protestors met heavy-handed police tactics resulting in 8 arrests; the charges were later dismissed. Replacing the fiesta with an \\"Indigenous Peoples Day\\" was suggested by some as a solution. After months of negotiation, however, The Entrada itself was simply removed from The Santa Fe Fiesta celebration. Extensive press coverage was key to The Entrada's demise. In addition, many local screenings of the documentary film Veiled Lightning, including two screenings at Santa Fe's New Mexico History Museum‚Äîonce during a Fiesta Symposium held at the Museum two days before the 2017 protests‚Äîdid much to educate the public and various stakeholders about the real issues surrounding The Entrada controversy, especially from the Native American perspective.

He is best known for his tenures in Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, Ring of Honor and the short-lived Wrestling Society X. ==Career== ===Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South=== ====2003‚Äì2005==== Raymond, under the ring name Josh Abercrombie, debuted for Ian Rotten's Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South promotion on October 23, 2003 in a match against Steve Stone. He continued competing across Midwestern independent promotions before returning to IWA Mid-South in October 2004. Between January and February in 2005, he began a feud against Ian Rotten, which included a match that Rotten won as part of the NWA Indiana State Championship tournament. The feud culminated in a barbed wire rope match the next day. Abercrombie, afraid of being hurt, humorously entered the contest covered in bubble wrap, which was removed by Rotten a few minutes into the match. During the match, Rotten broke his hand as he punched Abercrombie in the head. Abercrombie used that to his advantage and managed to win the bout via submission. Following his feud with Rotten, Abercrombie returned to singles competition while also teaming with Brandon Thomaselli in tag team matches. On April 9, he won the one-night \\"Simply The Best\\" tournament by beating Jonny Storm in the first round, and winning a four-way one fall bout by pinning El Generico that also involved Matt Cross and Sonjay Dutt. Abercrombie then faced Light Heavyweight Champion Delirious at the promotion's debut at The Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 10 in. Abercrombie would go on to win the match and thus win his first title in the promotion. It was also his first win over Delirious, as the two had competed against each other a few times earlier in the year for the promotion. During the summer of 2005, Abercrombie began a feud with Tyler Black over the title. The feud extended over several bouts, including a two out of three falls match on August 19, which Abercrombie won to retain his title as well as a highly praised Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match on September 9, which Abercrombie once again retained. While holding the Light Heavyweight Title, Abercrombie entered the Ted Petty Invitational. On September 23, Abercrombie won in the first round after defeating Jamie Noble before losing in the second round to Chris Sabin. Abercrombie then continued his feud with Black, leading to a title defense in a 30 Minute Iron Man tables match on October 15. During the last few seconds of the match, Black was able to superplex Abercrombie through two tables and managed to pin him, thus giving Black the win and the title. Following the match, Black offered a handshake, which Abercrombie accepted only to follow it up by spitting in Black's face. At the end of the night, Abercrombie fully turned heel as he and tag team partner Brandon Thomaselli interfered in the main event match of the Iron Saints (Sal and Vito Thomaselli) versus Ian Rotten and Justin Credible, as Abercrombie and Thomaselli aligned themselves with the Iron Saints and attacked Rotten, Credible, and many of the IWA Mid-South staff. The new group of the Thomasellis and Abercrombie were later joined by Eddie Kingston, and even aligned for a short period with Heavyweight Champion Jimmy Jacobs. Abercrombie and Brandon explained their actions by stating that they were the hot homegrown act in the promotion during the first half of the year, but during the summer, Tyler Black and his tag team partner Marek Brave \\"took their spot\\" in the eyes of the fans and promoters. Annoyed by this, the pair went back to their family (specifically Brandon's) and decided to join the Iron Saints' war against the promotion. ====2006==== On January 12, 2006, Black retained the title by pinning Abercrombie with one of Abercrombie's own moves: the corkscrew 450¬∞ splash. Abercrombie demanded a rematch, stating that Black received multiple shots at him during his (Abercrombie's) title reign. Black and promoter Ian Rotten agreed with Ian making two stipulations for the match, the first being that no matter the outcome, the title rematch would be the last between the two for at least six months, and the second being that it could only end in pinfall by one competitor immediately after he hit his opponent with the corkscrew 450¬∞ splash. The match took place eight days later on January 20. After hitting two corkscrew 450¬∞ splashes, Abercrombie scored the pinfall and won his second Light Heavyweight Championship. Abercrombie would later go on to hold the title a record breaking 449 days, the longest reign in the title's history and the longest title reign of any kind in the history of the promotion. Though still a heel, the crowd started getting more behind Abercrombie, and he soon split away from the Thomasellis and Kingston with his last interaction with them occurring on February 18 when he was forced to defend the title against Brandon, which he did. Abercrombie then reignited his feud with Tyler Black and on August 11, both took part in a \\"hair versus mustache match\\". In the weeks proceeding the match, Black grew a mustache of his own in mockery. Black would go on to win the match, but Abercrombie pointed out that a line in the contract for the match stipulated it was his hair versus Tyler's mustache. Abercrombie allowed Tyler to cut his hair, but when Black went for his mustache, Josh ran off, leaving him sporting a mullet. Josh then challenged Tyler to one last match, with the title on the line, stipulating that this time the loser would leave the promotion for six months. Black accepted and the match took place on September 30, which effectively pulled Josh out of that weekend's Ted Petty Invitational. During the bout, IWA Mid-South staff member Jim Fannin pulled the referee from the ring while Black had a pinfall. In a major surprise, Jimmy Jacobs (who had left the promotion on January 20, 2006) ran in through the crowd and helped Abercrombie secure the victory. That, as well as the contract line that allowed him to keep his mustache, was part of a deal that Abercrombie and Fannin worked together, which in the same moment allowed Fannin an opportunity to get his hands on Jacobs. Fannin's hired guns, Mitch Page and Bull Pain, attacked Jacobs, who Fannin hated for tossing the IWA World Heavyweight Championship in the trash back in late 2005. Abercrombie felt horrible about double-crossing his friend and trainer, but did what he felt he had to do to stay on top. ===Wrestling Society X (2006)=== Abercrombie was part of the first season of Wrestling Society X, a promotion that aired on MTV. While in WSX, he competed under his real name as a part of a redneck tag team with Nate Webb and \\"White Trash\\" Johnny Webb known as the \\"Trailer Park Boyz\\". ===Fight Sports Midwest (2007)=== On March 17, 2007, Abercrombie was part of the debut event for Fight Sports Midwest, a promotion run out of Portage, Indiana. He pinned Austin Aries in a singles bout, and later interfered in a match between Arik Cannon and former rival Tyler Black, where he helped Cannon attack the Black. Abercrombie and Cannon were then challenged to an impromptu tag match by Black and S.A.M. (Super Amazing Monkey), a man in a gorilla outfit. Abercrombie and Cannon won, and after the match, they unmasked S.A.M. and revealed him to be Jimmy Jacobs before viciously attacking Jacobs' leg. ===Return to IWA Mid-South (2009‚Äì2010)=== Abercrombie returned to IWA Mid- South and reformed his WSX tag team The Trailer Park Boyz with \\"Spyder\\" Nate Webb. ===Ring of Honor (2009‚Äì2010)=== Raymond with Christian Abel (right) in 2010 In late 2009, Raymond began wrestling at Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings under his real name, along with Christian Abel and Truth Martini as part of The House of Truth. He hasn't appeared for the promotion since August 2010. ==Championships and accomplishments== *All American Wrestling **AAW Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Christin Able **Fate of Eight (2005) *Juggalo Championship Wrestling **JCW Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with The Weedman *Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South **IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship (2 times)[*IWA Mid-South Wrestling Title Histories **IWA Mid- South Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Mickie Knuckles and Devon Moore **Simply The Best (2005) *Mr. Chainsaw Pro Wrestling **MCPW World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Platinum Pro Wrestling **PPW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Price of Glory Wrestling **POG Chaotic Championship (1 time) **POG Heavyweight Championship (3 times) **Glory Cup (2006) *Superior Wrestling Alliance **SWA Light Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Thunderzone Wrestling **TW Cruiserweight Championship (1 time) *Tri-Cities Championship Wrestling **TCCW Cruiserweight Championship (1 time) *Underground Championship Wrestling / NWA Underground **UCW/NWA Underground Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Westside Xtreme Wrestling **wXw Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Absolute Andy *Xtreme Intense Championship Wrestling **XICW Light Heavyweight Championship (3 times) ==Footnotes== The IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship was held jointly between Abercrombie, Knuckles and Moore using the Freebird Rule. ==References== ==External links== * *Online World of Wrestling profile Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Kalamazoo, Michigan ","title":"Josh Abercrombie"},{"id":"7783670","text":"Gabal Elba ( ' , \\"Mountain Box\\"), or Elba Mountain, is a peak and, in general, includes the associated mountainous area in the Hala'ib Triangle of Northeast Africa. Despite being claimed by both Egypt and Sudan, the area is currently under Egyptian control. ==Geography== The mountains The higher peaks in the area are Gabal Elba itself (), Gabal Shellal (), Gabal Shendib () and Gabal Shendodai (). Average annual rainfall in the region is less than , but orographic precipitation in and around Gabal Elba itself amounts to as much as . in the upper areas. This phenomenon owes to the vicinity of the Red Sea coast (some east of the mountains) and also to the fact that the coast, slightly curved to the east at this point, presents an unusually broad front to the sea across a strip of relatively flat land, which facilitates interception of moisture-laden north-east sea winds. This phenomenon is registered at its best in the northeast of the region, where Gabal Elba is located, which explains the fact that Gabal Elba receives higher precipitation than other coastal mountains in the range, including higher ones. Aridity gradually increases to the southwest of the area. ==Ecology== Goats or sheep grazing Gabal Elba's summit is a \\"mist oasis\\" where much of the precipitation is contributed in the form of dew, mist and clouds, creating a unique ecosystem not found anywhere else in the country. Indeed, Gabal Elba is a \\"biodiversity hotspot\\", with a biological diversity unparalleled in any terrestrial environment in Egypt proper. The relative abundance of moisture supports a diverse flora of some 458 plant species ‚Äì almost 25% of plant species recorded for the entire country. Many Afrotropical elements have their northern limits at Gabal Elba, and the dense cover of acacias and other scrubs represents the only natural woodland in Egypt. There is at least one endemic species of plant (Biscutella elbensis). ===National park=== The Gabal Elba National Park (), declared by Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif in 1986, covers some , including most of the disputed Hala'ib Triangle (except its westernmost corner), and an area of comparable size just north of it. It is also known to potentially hold the last population of the Nubian wild ass. However, the purity of these animals is questionable. On December 16, 2014 an adult male leopard was killed by group of shepherds after it attacked their camel in Wadi Shalal, within in the region of Hala'ib in the extreme southeast of Egypt.

Accessed February 26, 2015. It is located in ZIP code 08526. The community is accessible from Exit 11 of Interstate 195. ==History== Founded in 1690, the community was once the social, economic and political focus of Upper Freehold. It consists of approximately 30 buildings from the mid-19th century. Most were rebuilt in 1898 after a fire which destroyed much of the town. It takes its name from the Imlay family, the area's major landowners in the colonial period. The Imlaystown post office was established on April 16, 1832, and discontinued on November 28, 2009. ==Sites of interest== Ye Olde Yellow Meeting House was built in 1737 by a congregation begun in 1720. The most recognizable building in Imlaystown is Salter's Mill situated on a millpond that once supported an ice business as well as the mill. The Happy Apple Inn is the community's only restaurant. Built as a stagecoach stopover between Trenton and the Jersey Shore in the mid-19th century, the current structure was rebuilt following a fire in 1904. The Happy Apple was opened in 1972 by the father of its present owners, Buddy Westendorf and wife Donna. ==Preservation== Since the community's addition to the state and national registers of historic places in 1985, portions have suffered from neglect. While the community was somewhat revitalized in the 1990s, including the restoration of the millpond in 1995, many of its buildings are now dilapidated. Some are currently uninhabitable due to septic issues created by the proximity to Doctor's Creek.

Russia has been described as an energy superpower, as have Saudi Arabia, Canada, Venezuela, and Iran. The United States is said to be a potential energy superpower because of its large shale gas reserves. Energy superpower status might be exercised, for example, by significantly influencing the price on global markets, or by withholding supplies. The status of \\"energy superpower\\" should not be confused with that of \\"superpower\\". ==Energy superpowers== Iran's oil and gas production (1970‚Äì2009 data, 2010‚Äì2030 projected) Countries dependent on Russian natural gas (2006) Russia's reserves of natural gas have helped give it the title of energy superpower.How Sustainable is Russia's Future as an Energy Superpower?, by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 16 March 2006Russia: The 21st Century's Energy Superpower? , by Fiona Hill, The Brookings Institution, 5 October 2002 However, this status has been called into question by some. As Vladimir Milov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says: > The \\"energy superpower\\" concept is an illusion with no basis in reality. > Perhaps most dangerously, it doesn‚Äôt recognize the mutual dependence between > Russia and energy consumers. Because of political conflicts and declining > production, future supply disruptions to Europe are likely. As a result, > European gas companies may likely someday demand elimination of the take-or- > pay conditions in their Russian contracts. This would threaten Gazprom‚Äôs > ability to borrow. Putin‚Äôs attempt to use energy to increase Russian > influence could backfire in the long run. According to Manik Talwani, a geophysicist at Rice University, there are two countries that are most likely to join Saudi Arabia in attaining the status of oil superpower: Venezuela and Canada.Canada: The next oil superpower? , by Manik Talwani. The New York Times 2003 Citing their enormous potential reserves (1.2 trillion potential barrels for Venezuela and 1.75 trillion for Canada's oil sands), Talwani believes that they have the reserves to become energy superpowers in the next few decades as oil production declines elsewhere. However, as Talwani notes, both need US$100 billion or more to increase their production levels up to those of true energy superpowers. ==Threats to energy superpowers== Countries where natural gas fields are located. In 2007, al-Qaeda announced a new strategy for fighting the United States. Rather than only targeting U.S. interests directly in an attempt to cripple it, al-Qaeda considers cutting off the supply of energy to the U.S. to be a high priority. As reported after a failed 2006 attempt in Saudi Arabia: : \\"A major supply disruption would send energy prices soaring. Had the Abqaiq attack been successful ‚Äì guards fired on cars driven by the bombers, detonating the explosives inside ‚Äì some experts say oil prices would have likely broken all records.

He studied law at the universities of Gent, Strasbourg, Leipzig, and Berlin, and was a member of the Verein Deutscher Studenten. Afterwards, he obtained a position in the Prussian civil service. In 1892, Gerlach retired from the civil service, to work full-time on politics and journalism. At first, he was close to the Christian Social, but also anti-Semitic, politics of Adolf Stoecker and his Christian Social Party. He would later leave this party though, and join Friedrich Naumann's National-Social Association, becoming more entrenched with political liberal ideas. From 1892-1896, he worked as an editor of the Christian-social daily newspaper Das Volk. From 1898 to 1901, and from 1906 onwards, Gerlach was editor of the Berlin weekly Die Welt am Montag.

They are particularly associated with the narrow gauge Festiniog Railway (FR) in Wales where they were used between 1836 and 1863. == The challenge == The challenge on the FR was to move slate from an elevated location to a harbour for shipping, in this case from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog, Wales. In 2006 this is a 28-minute drive over 11.9 miles (19.1 kilometers), but in 1832 it was a remote mountain area. The railway was laid on an average grade of about 1 in 80. Trains running downhill were powered by gravity, with 3 stops. The total journey time was about an hour and a half. Trains were moved uphill by horses until 1863, the journey taking almost 6 hours. It was therefore necessary to find a way to bring the horses back down again. == Horse dandies == George Stephenson is credited for having proposed a solution: build special cars for the horses to ride in on the way down for use on the Stockton & Darlington Railway which was opened in 1825. With improvements in the track, the horses were becoming increasingly hard-pressed. By 1827 the Stockton and Darlington Railway was in difficulties with its unreliable steam locomotives, and was on the point of giving them up. They returned to using horse-drawn vehicles operated by independent contractors. Each horse was expected to haul some twelve-and-a- half tons of coal, making three round trips in six days. The work was exhausting for them and they soon became lame. George Stephenson introduced the dandy wagon in 1828, which was simply a four-wheeled cart supplied with hay, attached to the rear of a four-chaldron train in which the horse could rest on the downhill sections. It was said that if the dandy wagon was missing the horse would try to jump onto the rearmost chaldron.Vaughan, A., (1997) Railwaymen, Politics and Money, London: John Murray On the FR this gave the horses a chance to eat and rest on the way down, and after the slate cars were unloaded refreshed horses were available to haul the empty cars back to the top. On other railways the downhill horse haulage was generally shorter, occurring only along some areas of the track, but still allowed the horses a rest before going back to work. According to the Traveller's Guide (Blue Cover) Wagon number 50, a 4- wheel Iron Horse Dandy, built at Boston Lodge c.1861 was still in existence and stored at the Ffestiniog Railway museum as of April 1992. Other names for horse-carrying cars are \\"dandy cart\\" and \\"dandy truck\\": they all refer to a vehicle on a horse-worked railway that a horse pulls to the top of the hill and rides down the hill in. The term \\"dandy cart\\" is also used to refer to horse-drawn passenger trains on occasion. == Horse- drawn trains == Almost all early railways used horses as the motive power for trains before the invention of the steam locomotive. The Ballochney Railway used a \\"dandy-cart\\" on the two \\"Ballochney Inclines\\" each having a grade of around 1 in 23 for distances of about 1000 yards. A descending train was connected by rope and pulley to an ascending train; the weight of the downhill train pulled the up hill train up the hill. The geography of the Ffestiniog Railway may have had some impact on allowing this imaginative solution to be applied to a large percentage of its total haulage; a relatively long section of track, running exclusively between two points, where a relatively constant and continuous downhill grade could be maintained. == Another proposal for dandy waggons == In 1828 Alfred Pocock, who was developing a non-rail horseless carriage propelled by a kite(s), proposed on a particular trip that the kite carriage should tow a dandy-cart to carry a pony in the event of the wind being unfavorable. == Spelling of \\"wagon\\" or \\"waggon\\" == In the UK, in the early days of rail and tramways, either spelling was acceptable. In the UK, today, in national rail operations, the spelling is \\"wagon\\". Within the Festiniog (note 1 F), during the 19th century the spelling was interchangeable. For commonality, now, a single g is often used. However, it is still common to use \\"waggon\\" to refer to goods stock. In England wagon is used for one wagon [singular] and waggon or waggons for more than one wagon e.g. a train. [plural] == Other dandy wagons == The term Dandy Wagon (regionally correct spelling) referred to a horse-drawn private buggy used in America during the 1800s. == References == Category:Ffestiniog Railway Category:Horse transportation Category:United Kingdom narrow gauge rolling stock Category:Horse-drawn railways ","title":"Dandy waggon"},{"id":"7783853","text":"Mario Beretta (born 30 October 1959 in Milan) is an Italian association football manager and former football player. He most recently served as head coach of Serie B club Latina. ==Career== ===Playing career=== Beretta had a short career as footballer, playing only in the season 1976-77 for Pro Sesto and in that 1978-79 for Rovellasca in Serie D. ===Coaching career=== In 1982, aged 23, he became a coach for amateur team Abbiategrasso's youth squad, and 1984 for Monza's. He was also a successful School Teacher in the mid eighties for Istituto Gonzaga and Istituto Leopardi in Milan. His first team role came in 1994 for amateur side Corsico, whereas his first professional appearance came the next year for Pro Patria, followed by Saronno, Como and Lumezzane. After three successful seasons with Varese of Serie C1, Beretta was signed by Ternana of Serie B. An exciting debut in 2002‚Äì03 was followed by a sacking the next season. In 2004‚Äì05, Serie A club Chievo Verona called him to replace Luigi Delneri. Despite a strong starting, Beretta's Chievo slowly but continuously fell down the table, and he was fired three matchdays to the end of the season, with Chievo fully involved in a tough relegation battle, to be replaced by caretaker Maurizio D'Angelo. In 2005‚Äì06 he coached successfully Parma, ending in tenth place, then turned out to be seventh following the 2006 Serie A scandal which consequently led Parma to a UEFA Cup qualifying. Then he coached Siena for the 2006‚Äì07 season, but he suffered in the relegation fight until the last matchday. Siena kept its place in Serie A after a dramatic win over S.S. Lazio. Some days later he agreed to leave the club, being replaced by Andrea Mandorlini; however he was reappointed at the helm of the Tuscan side after Mandorlini was sacked on 12 November 2007 following a 2‚Äì3 home loss to Livorno. On 18 May 2008, after Siena's 2‚Äì2 draw against Palermo in the final matchday, Beretta said in his press conference that he was quitting Siena. This was confirmed by the club a few days later; he left Siena after a very impressive season ended with a record 44 points, the best result in Robur's time in the Italian top flight. He was successively announced on 23 June as new head coach of Lecce, newly promoted in the 2008‚Äì09 Serie A. He was sacked on 9 March after a 0‚Äì0 home draw against bottom-placed Reggina in the Week 27 of Serie A that left Lecce in second-last place. On 29 November 2009, Beretta agreed to replace Stefano Colantuono at the helm of Serie B outfit Torino F.C. and in January 2010 Torino have fired the coach, who was replaced by his predecessor Stefano Colantuono. In June 2010, Beretta signed a two-year contract with Greek side Paok Salonicco, with this being his first experience outside his homeland. However, on 22 July 2010, just a month after his appointment at the helm of the squad, Paok chairman Thodoris Zagorakis decided to sack him due to poor pre-season results and rumoured complaints from some players. Mario Beretta was immediately replaced by Pavlos Dermitzakis. On 6 December 2010 Beretta was announced as new head coach of Serie A relegation- threatened Lombardians Brescia, replacing Giuseppe Iachini at the helm of the Rondinelle. His tenure as Brescia boss lasted less than two months, as he was dismissed on 30 January 2011 after a 0‚Äì3 home loss to relegation-battling rivals Chievo. Since 21 February 2012 to the end of the season he has been the coach of Cesena in Serie A. He successively served as head coach of financially stricken Serie B club Siena, narrowly missing, in the last minutes of the season, despite 8 points of penalization, on a promotion playoff spot only to oversee the club being excluded from professional football for good by the end of the season. After Siena, he agreed upon a contract with Latina of Serie B in July 2014, only to mutually end his deal just in October due to what the club considered poor results (7 pts in 7 matches). ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Milan Category:Parma Calcio 1913 managers Category:Ternana Calcio managers Category:A.C.

Donald. Essentials of Meteorology: An Invitation to the Atmosphere. C. Donald Ahrens. 7th ed. Stamford: Cengage Learning, 2015. 144. Print. This can occur in the absence of precipitation, and can even occur when the sky is clear. This is in contrast to \\"ordinary\\" blizzards, which are accompanied by heavy falling snow. They can be especially dangerous as they occur after a winter storm has passed, when it is assumed that all forms of severe winter weather has ended. ==Meteorological criteria== While the term \\"ground blizzard\\" is often associated with intense blowing and drifting snow conditions, there are specific criteria which must be met. Often such criteria will be determined by a country's governing weather agency or other similar body. In the U.S, according to the National Weather Service a blizzard is defined as having sustained winds or frequent gusts of 35 mph or more, visibility frequently below 1/4 mile in considerable snow and/or blowing snow, and the above conditions are expected to prevail for 3 hours or longer. Environment Canada similarly maintains that widespread reduction of visibility to less than 400 meters due to snow and/or blowing snow and sustained wind speeds or gusts of 40 km/h or more must be present for at least 4 hours (6 hours for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) ==Types== There are 3 different forms of ground blizzards: # In horizontal advection conditions, the winds blow across the surface of the earth with very little if any large-scale upward motion. # In vertical advection conditions, the winds exhibit large- scale upward motion lifting the snow into the atmosphere creating drifting waves of snow up to 500 meters in height. # In thermal-mechanical mixing conditions, massive convective rolls form in the atmosphere and the blizzard may be observed from space with the blizzards convective rolls creating waves of snow (also known as snow billows) resembling lake or ocean effect snow bands. The extreme conditions can quickly bury a two-story home and make breathing very difficult if not impossible if caught outdoors.Strong advection rolls during a ground blizzard in North Dakota, January 15th, 1997 ==Climatology== Ground blizzards occur throughout the world, however unlike other winter storms, topography either aids in their formation or prevention. The most important topographic element in a blizzard is the requirement for a vast amount of large open and relatively flat land. Any type of flora, especially coniferous forms, will catch any drifting snow significantly reducing the blizzards effects. The environment must also support temperatures cold enough to prevent any snow on the ground from melting and bonding the ice crystals together. Ground blizzards are common in the American great plains in the wake of snowstorms producing light, dry snowfall that is more easily picked up by strong winds. They are also common in the Canadian Prairies, Siberia, Northern China, and also Arctic and Antarctic regions during seasonal transition periods, such as the spring and fall. ==Famous ground blizzards== *Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977 ==References== ==External links== * Animation of an extreme ground blizzard as seen from space * Definition of various weather terms including a ground blizzard * CMISS Article dealing with the North Dakota ground blizzard satellite imagery Category:Snow or ice weather phenomena Category:Blizzards fr:Blizzard (m√©t√©orologie)#Blizzard de surface ","title":"Ground blizzard"},{"id":"7783902","text":"Best Pal (February 12, 1988 ‚Äì November 24, 1998) was an American Hall of Fame champion racehorse, who retired as the all time record for purses of any California-bred earning (since surpassed) for his owners, the Golden Eagle Farm, US$5.6 million over his lifetime. ==Background== Best Pal was a brown gelding bred by John & Betty Mabee.

It was not principled, or \\"revolutionary\\" against Wilhelmine Germany though. Important party members were Theodor Barth, Rudolf Breitscheid (first chairman) and Hellmut von Gerlach. Carl von Ossietzky joined the party in 1908, and from 1911 onwards published the party's weekly Das freie Volk. The First World War brought an end to the party.

In the Afrin District, it is part of the Aleppo Governorate. The total population of the district was recorded at 172,095 people, of whom 36,562 lived in the town of Afrin itself. The town and district are named after the Afrin River. The city is split into two distinct halves by the river. As a result of Operation Olive Branch, the Syrian Democratic Forces withdrew from Afrin on 17 March 2018, and the Syrian National Army and Turkish Armed Forces captured Afrin the next day, bringing it under the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. While thousands fled as the SDF retreated, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people remained in Afrin city after the Turkish capture. ==History== About 8 km south of the town of Afrin, there are the remains of a Neo-Hittite (Iron Age) settlement known as Tell Ain Dara. In a field northwest of the city, a 9th or 8th century BC Luwian stele (named the Afrin stele) was discovered; it is a fragment of a full stele as only the middle section survives, which in turn is damaged with the right side totally destroyed taking with it parts of the right edge of the front and left edge of the back. The stele's front shows a part of a relief; a short fringed kilt usually worn by the Hittite storm god is shown indicating that the stele was a storm god one. Cyrrhus overlooking the Afrin River once served as a military base for the Romans conducting campaigns against the Armenian Empire to the north. By the 4th Century it had become an important centre for Christianity with its own bishop. The Afrin valley was part of Roman Syria until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637. The Afrin river was known as Oinoparas (in Greek ŒüŒπŒΩŒøœÄŒ¨œÅŒ±œÇ) in the Seleucid era, in the Roman era the name became Ufrenus, whence the Arab vernacular  øAfrƒ´n,  øIfrƒ´n, adopted as Kurdish Efr√Æn. The area was briefly conquered by the Principality of Antioch, but again came under Muslim rule in 1260 following the Mongol invasions. In the Ottoman period, the area was part of the Kilis Province. Although it is not contiguous with the main area of Kurdish settlement, the Afrin valley seems to have seen Kurdish settlement by at least the 18th century, as by that time it is referred to as the Sancak of the Kurds in Ottoman documents. ===Modern era=== With the drawing of the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border in 1923, Afrin became detached from Kilis Province and was part of French-administrated Syria (i.e. the State of Aleppo, State of Syria (1924‚Äì30), Syrian Republic (1930‚Äì58)) and was eventually incorporated in modern Syria at the state's formation in 1961. The town of Afrin was founded as a market in the 19th century. In 1929, the number of permanent residents was 800, growing to 7,000 by 1968. The town was developed by France under the French mandate of Syria. The main square is Afrin bus station, and the old settlement area stretches northward on the slope of a hill, but more recently habitations have spread to the other side of the river and extend as far to the south-east as the neighboring village of Turandah. Since the Turkish annexation of Hatay Province in 1939, the Afrin District is now almost surrounded by the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border, apart from the border with the Azaz District to the east and a short border with the Mount Simeon District to the southeast. There was an outbreak of civil unrest on 21 March 1986, during which three people were killed by Syrian police. In 1999, the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan triggered renewed clashes between Kurdish protesters and the police. ===Syrian Civil War=== A PYD checkpoint in Afrin (August 2012 photograph) During the Syrian Civil War, Syrian government forces withdrew from the city in the summer of 2012. The Popular Protection Units (YPG) took control of the city soon afterward. Afrin Canton as a de facto autonomous part was declared on 29 January 2014, the town of Afrin being the administrative center. The assembly elected H√™v√Æ √ébrah√Æm Mustefa prime minister, who later appointed Remzi ≈û√™xmus and Ebdil Hemid Mistefa to work as deputies.√áƒ∞FTE DEVRƒ∞M in √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem Between 2012 and 2018, the YPG, the official defence force of the canton, was criticized for recruiting child soldiers, committing arbitrary arrests and failing to address unsolved killings and disappearances. According to the reports, the YPG and Asayish were also accused of forcibly recruiting civilians, arresting political activists and displacing Arabs whose homes were later stolen and looted. Displaced Arabs accused the Kurdish security forces of imposing taxes and restrictions on the population in order to force them to leave and change the demography. === Turkish military incursion === On 20 January 2018, the Turkish army began the Operation Olive Branch alleging that the Government ruling in Afrin were terrorists. On the same day, the Turkish Air Force bombed more than 100 targets in Afrin. On 28 January 2018 Syria's antiquities department and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Turkish shelling had seriously damaged the ancient temple of Ain Dara at Afrin. Syria called for international pressure on Turkey \\"to prevent the targeting of archaeological and cultural sites\\". On 20 February 2018, a Syrian army convoy consisting of 50 vehicles had arrived in Afrin through the Ziyarat border crossing and were deployed to different areas. Five vehicles reached the center of the city of Afrin. YPG against the Turkish invasion, 19 January 2018 SDF-controlled territory (green) and Turkish-occupied territory (red) in October 2019 On 12 March 2018, the British newspaper Independent published a video where Turkish-backed fighters leading the Turkish attack on Afrin in northern Syria threatened to massacre the Kurdish population unless they convert to Islam espoused by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al- Qaeda. The header the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdulrahman, confirmed the authenticity of the video and said that \\"international attention is entirely focused on Eastern Ghouta and nobody is talking about the potential slaughter of the Kurds and other minorities in Afrin\\". On 14 March 2018, Redur Xelil, the senior official of the Syrian Democratic Forces accused Turkey of settling Arab and Turkmen families in the villages captured by Turkish army. On 18 March 2018, on the 58th day of Operation Olive Branch, the Syrian National Army and the Turkish Armed Forces captured Afrin from the YPG and the YPJ. Shortly after its capture, SNA fighters looted parts of the city and destroyed numerous Kurdish symbols, including a statue of KƒÅve, as Turkish Army troops solidified control by raising Turkish flags and banners over the city. ==== During the Turkish led Government ==== After the capture of Afrin by the Turkish led forces, the Afrin came under the control of the Government of Turkey, which provides the administration and delivers education and security to the region. In June 2018, the United Nations published a report stating that the security situation under Turkish-backed rebel control remains volatile. The OHCHR had received reports of lawlessness and rampant criminality, such as theft, harassment, cruel treatment and other abuse, and murders committed by several Turkish-backed armed groups, especially by the Sultan Murad and Hamza Divisions. The OCHR stated that civilians, particularly ethnic Kurds from Afrin, are being targeted for discrimination by the same Turkish-backed fighters. On 2 August 2018, Amnesty International reported that the Turkish forces were giving Syrian armed groups free rein to commit serious human rights abuses against civilians in the northern city of Afrin. The research had found the Turkish-backed fighters have involved in arbitrary detentions, torture, forced displacement, enforced disappearances, confiscation of property, and looting. On 28 April 2020, a bombing in Afrin killed 40 people, including 11 children. No group claimed responsibility. Turkey blamed the YPG for the attack. According to the head of the British- based Observatory for human rights in Syria, at least six pro-Turkish Syrian fighters were among those killed in the blast with a possibility of increase in the death toll. At least 47 people were reported injured, according to Al Jazeera. According to the governor of the neighbouring Hatay province, across the Turkish border, the explosion was believed to have been caused by the rigging of a fuel tanker with hand grenades. Many people, alongside those who got trapped in their cars were burnt to death as a result of the blast, Syrian activists disclosed. ==Education== In August 2015, the University of Afrin started teaching, with initial programs in literature, engineering and economics, including institutes for medicine, topographic engineering, music and theater, business administration and the Kurdish language. In January 2018, the university closed due to Operation Olive Branch and did not open after the city was captured by Turkish-backed forces. In October 2019, Turkey announced that the University of Gaziantep will open a Faculty of Education in Afrin. On 12 April 2018, a Turkish-backed interim council was elected in Afrin, consisting of 20 \\"elders from the city\\" ‚Äì 11 Kurds, eight Arabs, and one Turkmen, Turkish state media reported. The council is headed by a Kurd named Zuhair Haider who, in an interview with the state-run Anadolu Agency, expressed his gratitude to Turkey and vowed to \\"serve\\" the local citizens. On 9 November 2018, Turkey's trade minister Ruhsar Pekcan announced the opening of a border gate with Afrin dubbed \\"Olive Branch\\" - after the operational name of the Turkish offensive that captured the city months before. On 26 March 2018, Turkish state media outlet Anadolu Agency published video showing children in Afrin attending a school with a large photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan near the front door. The video additionally shows children in Afrin waving Turkish flags and teachers instructing the students to chant pro-Erdogan slogans. In February 2019 it was reported that Turkey was assuming control over the educational matters in Afrin, providing training to teachers and turkifiying the curriculum taught in the schools, ==Economy== The olive tree is the symbol of Afrin. Afrin is a production center for olives. Since the Turkish army captured Afrin, the olives have been confiscated by the Turkish backed forces and exported to Turkey. Olive oil pressing and textiles are some of the city's local industries. ==Climate== Afrin has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool winters with moderate rain and occasional snow. The average high temperature in January is 9 ¬∞C and the average high temperature in July is 34 ¬∞C. The snow falls usually in January, February or December.

Roeckelein, Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories (2006) p. 111 By contrast, Carl Jung took the view that both males and females could have a father complex, which in turn might be either positive or negative.Mary Ann Mattoon, Jung and the Human Psyche (2005) p. 91 ==Freud and Jung== === Shared understanding === Use of the term father complex emerged from the fruitful collaboration of Freud and Jung during the first decade of the twentieth century‚Äîthe time when Freud wrote of neurotics \\"that, as Jung has expressed it, they fall ill of the same complexes against which we normal people struggle as well\\".Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 188 In 1909, Freud made \\"The Father Complex and the Solution of the Rat Idea\\" the centrepiece of his study of the Rat Man; Freud saw a reactivation of childhood struggles against paternal authority as standing at the heart of the Rat Man's latter-day compulsions.Sigmund Freud, Case Histories II (PFL 9) p. 80 and p. 98 In 1911, Freud wrote that \\"in the case of Schreber we find ourselves once again on the familiar ground of the father- complex\\";Case Histories II p. 191 a year earlier, Freud had argued that the father complex‚Äîfear, defiance, and disbelief of the father‚Äîformed in male patients the most important resistances to his treatment.Roger Perron, \\"Father Complex\\" The father complex also stood at the conceptual core of Totem and Taboo (1912-3). Even after the break with Jung, when \\"complex\\" became a term to be handled with care among Freudians, the father complex remained important in Freud's theorizing in the twenties;Ronald Britton, Belief and Imagination (1998) p. 207‚Äîfor example, it appeared prominently in The Future of an Illusion (1927).Sigmund Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 204 Others in Freud's circle wrote freely of the complex's ambivalent nature.Edward Timms ed., Freud and the Child Woman: The Memoirs of Fritz Wittels (1995) p. 118 However, by 1946, and Otto Fenichel's compendious summary of the first psychoanalytic half-century, the father complex tended to be subsumed under the broader scope of the Oedipus complex as a whole.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 95-6 After the Freud/Jung split, Jung had equally continued to use the father complex to illuminate father/son relations, such as in the case of the father-dependent patient who Jung termed \\"a fils a papa\\" (regarding him, Jung wrote \\"[h]is father is still too much the guarantor of his existence\\"),C. G. Jung, The Practice of Psychotherapy (London 1993) p. 155 or when Jung noted how a positive father complex could produce an over-readiness to believe in authority.C G. Jung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (London 1996) p. 214 However, Jung and his followers were equally prepared to use the concept to explain female psychology, such as when a negatively charged father complex made a woman feel that all men were likely to be uncooperative, judgmental, and harsh in the same image.Mattoon, p. 79 ===The Freud/Jung split=== Freud and Jung both used the father complex as a tool to illuminate their own personal relations. For example, as their early intimacy deepened, Jung had written to Freud asking him to \\"let me enjoy your friendship not as that of equals but as that of father and son\\".Quoted in Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (London 1989) p. 202 In retrospect, however, both Jungians and Freudians would note how Jung was impelled to question Freud's theories in a way that pointed to the existence of a negative father complex beneath the positive oneMattoon, p. 103‚Äîbeneath his chosen and overt stance of the favorite son.Gay, p. 227 It is perhaps no surprise that the complex ultimately led to and fuelled conflicts between the pair, with Jung accusing Freud of \\"treating your pupils like patients...Meanwhile you are sitting pretty on top, as father\\".Jung, quoted in Gay, p. 234-5 In his efforts to struggle free from his psychoanalytic father figure, Jung would reject the term \\"father complex\\" as Viennese name calling‚Äîdespite his own use of it in the past to illuminate precisely such situations.Gay, p. 234-8 ==Postmodernism: the absent father== Whereas the idea of the father complex had originally evolved to deal with the heavy Victorian patriarch, by the new millennium there had developed instead a postmodern preoccupation with the loss of paternal authority‚Äîthe absence of the father.Rosalind Coward, Sacred Cows (London 1999) p. 130 Alongside the shift from a Freudian emphasis on the role of the father to object relations theory's stress upon the mother, what psychoanalysis tended to single out was the search for the father, and the negative effects of the switched-off father.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1997) p. 68 and p. 116 It has even been suggested from a French perspective that the expression is almost completely absent from contemporary psychoanalysis. Although post-Lacanians certainly continue to debate the idea of the \\"Vatercomplex\\",Lila J. Kalnich,/Stuart W. Taylor, The Dead Father p. 48 a postmodern dictionary of psychoanalysis is nonetheless more likely to have an entry instead for James M. Herzog's (1980) term \\"Father hunger\\": the son's longing for and need of contact with a father figure.Salman Akhtar, Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (2009) p. 106 However, Jungians such as Erich Neumann continued to use the concept of the father complex to explore the father/son relationship and its implications for issues of authority, noting on the one hand how a premature identification with the father, foreclosing the generational struggle, could lead to a thoughtless conservatism, whereas on the other the perennial rebel against the father complex is found in the archetype of the eternal son.Erich Neumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness (1995) p. 190 They also applied a similar analysis to a woman with a negative father complex, for whom resistance to a man's suggestions and male authority can become endemic. ===Father hunger=== Eating disorders expert Margo D. Maine used the concept of \\"father hunger\\" in her book Fathers, Daughters and Food (Nov 1991),Father Hunger: Fathers, Daughters and Food (Carlsbad, CA: Gurze Books, Nov 1991) with particular emphasis on the relationship with the daughter. Such father hunger, as prompted by paternal absence, may leave the daughter with an unhealthy kind of narcissism, and with a prevalent search for external sources of self- esteem.Suzette A. Henke, Shattered Subjects (2000) p. 160 Maine further examined the longing that all children have for connection with fathers, and how an unmet father hunger influences disordered eating and other mental illnesses. In contemporary psychoanalytic theory, James M. Herzog's Father Hunger: Explorations with Adults and ChildrenFather Hunger: Explorations with Adults and Children (New York: Routledge, 2001) addresses the unconscious longing experienced by many males and females for an involved father. Also, the importance of fatherly provisions for both sons and daughters during their respective developmental stages is examined in the writings of Michael J. Diamond (see My Father Before Me, WW Norton, 2007).Psychology in perspective : The Complex Jungians have emphasised the power of parent hunger, forcing one repeatedly to seek out unactualised parts of the father archetype in the outside world.Anthony Stevens, On Jung (London 1990) p. 121; Archetype (London 1982) p. 115 One answer men have been offered is to move into generativity; to find the lost father within themselves, the internal father, and hand him on to their successors,Gail Sheehy, New Passages (London 1996) p. 284 thereby shifting from demanding parental guidance to providing it.Terence Real, I Don't Want to Talk About It (Dublin 1997) p. 321-2 ==Cultural examples== The notion of the \\"Father complex\\" still flourishes in the culture at large. For example, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz wrote of Albert Einstein, \\"everything about him appealed to my father complex, my yearning for a protector and leader\\".Czeslaw Milosz, Native Realm (1981) p. 282 Bob Dylan's choice of pseudonym has been linked to the father complex, as a rejection of his actual father and his paternal name.Daniel Karlin, in Neil Corcoran ed., Do You, Mr Jones? (London 2002) p. 41 After that choice, however, he would seek out a series of father figures, or \\"idols\\" as he called them, to act as father confessor,Craig McGregor ed., Bob Dylan: A Retrospective (1975) p.44 before leaving each one behind again in turn.bob dylan, poem to joannie (1972) p. 7-8 However, English novelist D. H. Lawrence dismissed the idea of the father complex as applied to himself, calling it a fool's complex.Witter Bynner, Journey with Genius (1974) p. 156 ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== *Elyse Wakerman, Father Loss (1984) *Beth M.

This also marks the first time actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel have worked together as each other's main love interest in a film, the second being (500) Days of Summer. ==Plot== After brutally beating another teen with a baseball bat during a baseball game, Lyle Jensen, an impulsive and aggressive teen, is admitted to the juvenile psychiatric ward of a hospital along with other troubled teens: Tracy, Chad, Michael, Kenny, and Sara. Lyle is placed in a room with Kenny, a reticent 13-year-old, and form some semblance of a sibling relationship. Lyle has problems adjusting to the confinements of the institution and it is Dr. David Monroe's job to get them to talk in group therapy sessions. Lyle finds himself attracted to Tracy. She is reluctant to become close to him due to her low self-esteem. Tracy has constant terrible nightmares. Lyle becomes curious about why she screams at night and later finds out she is a rape survivor. In their room, Kenny and Lyle begin a discussion about their fathers, at which point Kenny announces that his stepfather is going to visit him. After a disastrous visit, it is revealed that the stepfather sexually abuses him. Following a confrontation between Dr. Monroe, Kenny, and his stepfather, Kenny is transferred to another unit of the institution. A group meeting takes place in which the patients and Dr. Monroe discuss their worries about the situation with Kenny. Michael, a violent sociopath, feels no empathy for Kenny and states that he got what he deserved. At this point, Lyle jumps up and attacks Michael, but the guards pull them apart. Dr. Monroe becomes upset at Lyle and begins throwing chairs around the room, demonstrating to Lyle that reacting out of anger accomplishes nothing. The two later have a conversation in which the doctor apologizes. During his stay, Lyle forms a friendship with Chad, who suffers from bipolar disorder and agoraphobia. The two make plans to go to Amsterdam with the money from Chad's trust fund. Later, Chad and Sara have an argument over Van Gogh's painting Wheat Field with Crows; Sara states that the painting represents freedom, while Chad states that the painting represents depression and confinement. Sara is soon released and departs from the psychiatric ward, leaving Tracy heartbroken. When it comes close to Chad's eighteenth birthday, he backs out of the plan to go to Amsterdam stating that running off to another place will not change his life. However, he encourages Lyle to go ahead without him. The day before his release, Chad cuts himself while reading The Myth of Sisyphus. When discovered, he attacks one of the guards and cuts the guard's neck, causing him to be removed from the ward. During the scuffle between Chad and the guard, the guard drops his keys, which Lyle takes without notice. That night, Lyle uses the keys to get into Tracy's room. He apologizes and the two embrace and kiss. The day of his escape, Lyle searches for Tracy. Unable to find her, he asks Michael of her whereabouts. Michael inquires if Lyle has raped Tracy yet since \\"she wants it.\\" This enrages Lyle, and moments later he breaks into Michael's room and attacks him, leaving him lying bloody in a corner. When he leaves Michael's room, he sees Tracy and tells her that he was looking for her. She says nothing and does nothing as he unlocks the door of the institution and runs out the gate. Lyle leaves the institution and makes his way to a bus stop. He waits at the bus terminal and when it pulls up, there is a poster of the Van Gogh painting on the side of it. Seeing the painting, Lyle is reminded of the argument between Chad and Sara. Lyle does not board the bus and instead walks back to the institution. ==Cast== * Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lyle Jensen * Zooey Deschanel as Tracy * Michael Bacall as Chad * Don Cheadle as Dr. David Monroe * Cody Lightning as Kenny * Elden Henson as Mike * Sara Rivas as Sara ==Music== The film features music by Thurston Moore, Aphex Twin, Deftones, Squarepusher, Broadcast, and Sleater-Kinney. ==References* * Category:2001 films Category:2001 drama films Category:2001 independent films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bipolar disorder Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals Category:Films shot in California Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Bacall ","title":"Manic (2001 film)"},{"id":"7784156","text":"A list of episodes for Charlie's Angels (1976‚Äì1981). == Series overview == ==Episodes== ===Pilot (1976)=== ===Season 1 (1976‚Äì77)=== ===Season 2 (1977‚Äì78)=== ===Season 3 (1978‚Äì79)=== ===Season 4 (1979‚Äì80)=== ===Season 5 (1980‚Äì81)=== ==References== Category:Charlie's Angels (franchise) Category:Lists of American action television series episodes ","title":"List of Charlie's Angels episodes"},{"id":"7784159","text":"' (also written (119070) 2001 KP77') is a 4:7 resonant trans-Neptunian object (TNO) located in the Kuiper belt.

It was one of the forerunners of the American youth rights movement. == Formation == In 1976, Michigan's Office of Juvenile Justice Services (OJJS) experimented with youth representation and asked 16-year-old Linda Feldt of Ann Arbor to serve on a commission formed to evaluate juvenile justice in the State and make recommendations for change. The commission formed about seven task forces to focus on specific aspects of juvenile justice, and, at the urging of Ms. Feldt, one or two young people were recruited to serve on each of those task forces as well. After several months, Ms. Feldt arranged for all of the youth commissioners to meet and share their experiences. The ten or twelve young people at that meeting decided to form an organization, naming it The Three O'Clock Lobby, since it would operate after school hours. Among the individuals at that meeting was 16-year-old Christopher Jens Magnus, the future director of the organization. With the help of supportive individuals in the OJJS, the new group incorporated in January 1977 and held a conference for young people in March, with workshops on the rights of young people and working with legislators. Adults were permitted to attend only if they were accompanied by a youth. About 250 young people from around the state attended the conference. Linda Feldt wrote a proposal for a state grant to hire young people to staff a toll-free telephone number to assist youth in the state with questions about their rights, and make referrals. The state awarded the group $10,000. Since free space was available to the group in the OJJS offices in Lansing, the amount proved to be excessive, even though staff were always paid ten cents an hour over the minimum wage. Near the end of the year, the OJJS completed its work and closed down its offices, but free office space (a small back room) was promptly offered by the Michigan Council on Crime and Delinquency in Lansing. The toll-free line was manned by Chris Magnus, Peggy Hicks, Julie Powell, and several other volunteers from the Lansing area. As the group tried to spend the remainder of its money, it focused on promotion, and placed advertising in city buses. One of those bus signs was seen by Susan Wishnetsky, a student at Michigan State University, who promptly joined the group and helped in the creation of its newsletter. == Drinking age controversy == The state grant was renewed for 1978. The group continued to produce its newsletter, created buttons and bumper stickers, and held a second conference in June 1978, but the limitations of state money began to frustrate the group. The Three O'Clock Lobby's initial focus was on decriminalization of status offenses, acts that were illegal for young people only because of their age, such as running away, truancy, disobeying parents, or using alcohol. A bill that would have moved the state in this direction now seemed to be getting compromised away, and the group's public appearances and testimony on the issue (and some controversial newsletter articles) seemed to be insufficient. Further, a proposal to raise the state's drinking age from 18 to 21 had succeeded in getting onto state ballots, and the group, which had decided to work on the issue, had to be careful not to use state funds to do so. Members leafleted on college campuses, appeared on TV and radio shows, and spoke at churches and community centers, explaining how statistics on the issue had been distorted by the other side. But leaflets, travel, and other expenses had to be paid for with private donations. As the election neared, the Michigan Council on Alcohol Problems, the primary group promoting the raising of the drinking age, asked the state's attorney general to investigate the Three O'Clock Lobby for using state funds to oppose their ballot proposal. The investigation was quickly called off, but the group decided to pursue a private grant for the coming year. The vote on the drinking age on November 7, 1978 was a painfully close one for the group -- the ballot proposal passed with only 54%. Although the group had been sending out introductory letters to private foundations since June, in November it faced the prospect of no funds and no strong issue to mobilize supporters. Chris Magnus and Susan Wishnetsky spent many evenings in a local Mexican restaurant writing a grant proposal to the Playboy Foundation, which seemed to be the group's best hope for funding. A response and an invitation to visit the foundation came quickly, and before the end of the November, about six members of the Three O'Clock Lobby traveled to Chicago to answer questions about their proposal. The Playboy Foundation granted the Three O'Clock Lobby a one-time amount of $5,000. == Year of the Child and eventual dissolution == The year 1979 was named the International Year of the Child, and a state-sponsored conference was held to bring youth workers together to kick off the year and discuss youth issues. The conference was held on a school day. The planners were all adults, and only adults were being invited. Chris Magnus proposed that the Three O'Clock Lobby hold a protest outside the conference, so the group prepared leaflets entitled \\"What If the Year of the Woman Had Been Run By Men?\\" About six young people distributed the leaflets, which criticized the conference for discouraging youth participation, but also offered to work with youth agencies to promote positive change. The group also handed out badges reading \\"I Support Youth Participation,\\" one of which was worn by Governor Milliken as he made his opening address. The Three O'Clock Lobby received some favorable press coverage about the protest, but this did not seem to invigorate the organization. The group cancelled its toll-free telephone line and began a recruitment drive, but as members left for college or employment, membership dwindled. The private grant money was stretched to its limit, but at the end of 1981, the group allowed its incorporation to lapse, and the Three O'Clock Lobby was no more. ==See also== *Youth voice *Youth participation ==References== *\\"The Three O'Clock Lobby of Michigan: a New Designs interview with Chris Magnus\\".

The launch once again ended in failure when the booster suffered a failure of the yaw gyro and veered off its flight path. Ground control issued a manual shutoff command at T+153 seconds. The spacecraft was intended to conduct experiments during its flight towards the Moon. It would also have released gaseous sodium, in order to create a cloud of the metal which could be observed from Earth, allowing the spacecraft to be tracked. Prior to the release of information about its mission, NASA correctly identified that it had been an attempted lunar impact mission, however they incorrectly believed that it had been launched on 16 June, two days before its actual launch. ==References== Category:Luna program Category:Spacecraft launched in 1959 ","title":"Luna E-1A No.1"},{"id":"7784359","text":"Sunao Matsumoto (October 24, 1969 ‚Äì July 15, 2004), known professionally as Sunao Yoshida (ÂêâÁî∞Áõ¥ Yoshida Sunao), was a Japanese novelist.

It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon, including the far side. The E-3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E-2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission.

The core stage and strap-ons of the 8K72 booster performed perfectly and Blok E staging and engine start went well at first, but about halfway through its burn, engine thrust and fuel system pressure began dropping, followed by cutoff. Velocity was about 300 feet per second too low to escape the Earth's gravity, and the Blok E and probe fell back into the atmosphere and burned up. The cause of the failure was unclear until further examination of telemetry data found that the RP-1 tank in the Blok E stage was only partially filled, a careless mistake by pad crews that caused the booster to literally and figuratively run out of gas before it could escape Earth orbit.Soviet Robots In The Solar System, Wesley T.

It was presented by Marshall Naify, released by Magna Pictures Distribution Corporation on June 23, 1965. The film tells the story of Willy McBean, a young schoolboy who teams up with an anthropomorphic monkey named Pablo to prevent the villainous professor Rasputin Von Rotten from changing the history of the world, using the newly created and duplicated \\"magic\\" time machine. Written, produced and directed by Arthur Rankin, Jr., with Jules Bass and Larry Roemer as associate producers, the film uses a team of voice actors under the soundtrack recording supervision of Bernard Cowan in Canada, including Larry D. Mann as Von Rotten and Billie Mae Richards as Willy. ==Plot== Willy McBean is sick of trying to learn history for school. Meanwhile, an evil scientist called Rasputin Von Rotten is building a magical time machine so he can go back in time and be the most famous person in history. A Spanish-English talking monkey named Pablo climbs through Willy's window. He explains that he escaped from Von Rotten and he tells Willy what he is planning to do. Pablo stole the plans to the time machine. Willy builds his own machine to go back in time to stop Von Rotten. The machine isn't working properly. They end up with General George Armstrong Custer, and escape moments before Custer is killed. They then arrive in the Wild West, where they meet Buffalo Bill Cody and his Indian pal, Sitting Bull. Von Rotten plans to become the fastest gun in the west. Von Rotten asks Bill for a showdown, but both guns are sabotaged before anyone can be shot. Von Rotten moves onto his next target, Christopher Columbus. Once there, disguised as a Chinese trader, he convinces Columbus's crew that they should mutiny. Once more McBean and Pablo stop the evil professor by showing the crew that land is not far off. After that, Von Rotten goes back to England in the days of King Arthur in the kingdom of Camelot, but Pablo and Willy get Arthur to pull Excalibur the magic sword that can talk. A talking green dragon then crashes into Camelot in an effort to eat everyone, but King Arthur and Excalibur are able to drive him away. After a quick diversion to the Roman Colosseum, Willy and Pablo later go to Ancient Egypt to stop Von Rotten from building the Great Pyramid. Then they go back to prehistoric times to encourage cavemen to discover fire and invent the wheel before Von Rotten. As they return to the present, Von Rotten shows the students history through his magic machine (in the form of a movie projector) during history class. ==Voice cast== *Larry D.

The team's head coach was Mike Riley, with home games being played at Reser Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon. ==The upset== After a mediocre 4‚Äì3 start, the Beavers had a historic 33-31 upset win over #3 (AP, #2 coaches) University of Southern California that snapped the Trojans' 38-game regular season winning streak and 27 game Pac-10 winning streak. From plays in this upset win, the Beavers won the Pontiac game changing performance award for the week in the PAC-10 and nationally after Jeff Van Orsow batted down a two-point conversion attempt, which stopped any hope of bringing the game to overtime. ==110th Civil War== The 110th Civil War was a thriller played at Reser Stadium. After scoring first, the Ducks failed to gain the lead until the 4th quarter. With 3:07 left to play and the Beavers up 27‚Äì20, the Ducks scored a touchdown and successfully made the 2-point conversion, sparking celebrations on the Oregon sideline as the Ducks went up 28‚Äì27. With 1:12 left in the game, OSU's kicker Alexis Serna kicked a clutch 40-yard field goal, that ended up being the game winner. Alexis Serna was pivotal in the Beaver victory, as he connected on field goals from 49, 40, and 50 yards. OSU defensive lineman Ben Siegert, who earlier in the game blocked a point-after attempt by the Ducks, blocked a 44-yard field goal attempt by Oregon's Matt Evensen with 20 seconds left to play. The Beavers won the Civil War 30‚Äì28. ==Sun Bowl== The 2006 Sun Bowl, in El Paso, Texas, and against the Missouri Tigers, was another thrilling and close game for the Beavers this season. After being down 14 points in the 4th quarter, the Beavers proceeded to score 7 in a drive that took about 3 and a half minutes. They next held the Tigers, and got the ball back, now only being down 7. With less than 2 minutes, and the ball, the Beavers proceed again to score. Coach Riley elected to go for a two-point conversion instead of kicking the extra point. The extra point would have been enough to tie the game and send it to overtime. The two-point conversion was successful, giving the Beavers a one-point lead with only 22 seconds left in the game, and the eventual win.

Standing at 14 feet, the bronze statue features a log surrounded by three figures: a timber cruiser holding a compass, a sawyer with his saw slung over his shoulder, and a river rat resting his peavey on the ground. The granite base of the statue is engraved with a memorial that reads \\"Erected to perpetuate the memory of the pioneer lumbermen of Michigan through whose labors was made possible the development of the prairie states.\\"Lumberman's Monument, Plaque, Oscoda, MI It is also inscribed with the names of the logging families who dedicated their time and efforts to the industry in the area. It was built in 1931, dedicated in 1932 and is managed by the USDA Forest Service. It is located in the northeastern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan along the Au Sable River within Huron-Manistee National Forests. Access to the park is on River Road, which intersects M-65 west of Oscoda, Michigan. Monument Road, from East Tawas, also leads directly to the monument, which is in Oscoda Township in Iosco County. The monument is part of the River Road Scenic Byway, a drive between Oscoda and South Branch that runs parallel with the beautiful Au Sable River. It is a designated National Scenic Byway.River Road Scenic Byway at America's Byways. ==The area== The monument is located within the eastern part of the Huron-Manistee National Forests area. The nearest settlements are Tawas City and East Tawas to the south, Au Sable and Oscoda to the east and Hale to the southwest. In the late 19th century, the area was heavily logged for timber that was used in building houses and factories. After the logging industry settled down, much of the area was repopulated with trees, which is the forest we see today. ==Park facilities== Access to the park is granted year round and free of charge. The visitor's center and other facilities are staffed between May and October. Pathways are lined with exhibits with descriptive signs allowing visitors to learn about the history of the logging industry in Michigan. The monument overlooks Cooke Dam Pond and Horseshoe Island on the Au Sable river which was a major logging thoroughfare. ==Logging history== The monument is located in a forest that was heavily logged in the second half of the 19th century. The white pine that made up much of the forest was in high demand nationwide for housing, ships, and other manufacturing. In particular, much of the housing in the Midwest was built using lumber taken from Michigan forests. Once people began realizing how immense the forests of Michigan were, popularity of lumbering and its profitability increased. Timber cruisers, who worked for lumbermen, would survey the woods and reserve the best plots for their bosses in the land office. During this time, land could be bought for as little as $1.25 an acre. In the winter, Sawyers cut down the trees and swampers trimmed them. The logs were then loaded onto sleds and pulled to the nearest riverbank by horses or oxen, over paths in the ice, and dumped down stream towards the sawmill. Loggers downstream had to deal with log jams on a regular basis. Once the logs finally reached the sawmill, they were cut into boards for use in manufacturing buildings like houses and factories. The many rivers and lakes within Michigan as well as its huge stretches of pines and hardwoods gave it a great advantage in the lumber business. Not only was there plenty of timber to be farmed, there were also ample waterways to transport the logs. In 1867, mill property on streams that connected with Lake Michigan on the western side of the state had a total value of approximately two million dollars; property on the eastern side was valued over five million dollars. The total number of saw mills in Michigan was approximated to be 665. The logging industry led to the development of many towns including Grayling, Manistee, Muskegon and Alpena. With the decline of the lumbering business in the mid to late 1900s, it also led to many forgotten ghost towns such as Alcona and Killmaster‚Äînow Gustin Township, Michigan, and the 25 ghost towns in Benzie County. The \\"Lumbermen Monument\\" sculpture is a work of Robert Aitken. \\"On one corner you may notice the words ‚ÄòAitken Fecit‚Äô, meaning Aitken made it.

Highlights include: * Global Fund Advocacy: Members of the SGAC and SCCS campaigns have been involved for years in pushing for increased US funding for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which rose to over $100million in 2005. * \\"Kick Coke Off Campus\\": Global Justice's SGAC joined with other AIDS activists to pressure Coca-Cola to treat HIV+ workers in its African bottling plants. * 04.Stop.AIDS: a loose network of HIV and AIDS activists, many of them SGACers, who went to presidential candidates events and asked pointed questions until every democratic candidate adopted a progressive platform on global AIDS (President George W. Bush refused to talk with the activists or allow them into events). * Student March Against AIDS: on February 26, 2005, Global Justice's SGAC held the second largest HIV and AIDS mobilization in U.S. history. More than 4,000 students and young people from around the country rallied in DC for the Student March Against AIDS. * SACU & CAFTA: in 2006, Global Justice's STJC was involved in opposing the Free Trade Agreement with Southern Africa, which was put on hold, and before that in opposing CAFTA, which did go through. * Gilead Sciences Corporate Campaign: in spring 2006, SGAC took on its second corporate campaign, this time targeting the marketers of second-line AIDS drugs who had failed to make those medicines accessible to lower and middle income countries. The company Gilead Sciences eventually made major concessions to make its drug Tenofovir more available and allow generic competition. ==See also== *Anti-globalization *Alter-globalization *Democratic globalization *Global Citizens Movement *Global justice *Global Justice Movement *Movement of Movements *World Social Forum  European Social Forum ==External links== *Global Justice *Student Global AIDS Campaign *Student Trade Justice Campaign *Student Campaign for Child Survival Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2001 ","title":"Global Justice (organization)"},{"id":"7784562","text":"Claas Epp Jr. Age 38. Claas Epp Jr.A variant spelling, Claasz Epp, is used in some sources, including Smith. (September 21, 1838 ‚Äì January 19, 1913) was a Russian Mennonite minister known for leading his followers into Central Asia where he predicted Christ would return in 1889. ==Life== Epp was born in F√ºrstenwerder, Prussia. His family moved to the Trakt Mennonite settlement in the Russian province of Samara in 1853. He was married to Elisabeth Jantzen in 1862. Most of their twelve children died before reaching adulthood. His son, Claas Epp III migrated to Beatrice, Nebraska, in 1891, and his numerous descendants live in the United States. The 1870s were a time of stress and transition in the Mennonite settlements of Russia. The population of the colonies was more than could be supported by available land. The Russian government announced in 1870 that it would end all special privileges granted to colonists by 1880, including the exemption from military service, which was so important to nonresistant Mennonites. Those most concerned with these changes were looking toward North America as a resettlement option. There was widespread distribution of chiliastic writings by prophetic authors such as Jung Stilling and others among the Mennonite colonies. It was in this uncertain environment that Epp distributed a self-published book in 1877 in which he put forth his own prophetic interpretation of the Bible. Epp predicted that Christ would return in 1889 and meet the faithful in central Asia. According to Epp, his own congregation was Philadelphia of the seven churches of the Book of Revelation, which would become a doorway into heaven. Mennonite settlers at Aulie Ata in the late 1800s. As 1880 and the end of special privileges approached, a group of Epp's followers prepared for a trek east. A party traveled to Saint Petersburg where they obtained permission to settle near Tashkent from Konstantin Petrovich Von Kaufman, the first Governor-General of Russian Turkestan. Over a hundred families in four groups set out in summer and fall of 1880, arriving in the vicinity of Tashkent after an arduous fifteen-week journey. When they learned that the military exemption now no longer applied to Russia's Asiatic possessions, a disagreement arose among the group. Those willing to accept forestry service in lieu of military service, separated from the main group and settled at Aulie-Ata, northeast of Tashkent. Epp took his group of some sixty families to Bukhara, hoping to be out of the reach of Russian jurisdiction and the associated conscription requirements. The emir of Bukhara refused to accept the settlers, sending Epp and his followers back into Turkestan. After much traveling back and forth in the border area of Bukhara and Turkestan, the group was invited to settle near the Laudan canal on the upper Amu Darya river in the Khanate of Khiva. Their journey was at its end, but new problems arose. When nearby bandits learned that the Mennonites would not defend themselves their thievery advanced from taking horses and livestock to boldly coming into homes and taking possessions at will. As the violence escalated, a young Mennonite man was murdered, straining the group's nonviolent values. The khan offered a permanent solution by inviting the Mennonites to relocate in a walled garden called Ak Metchet a dozen kilometers southeast of Khiva. Epp became ever more fanatical. He predicted Christ's return on March 8, 1889. When the date came and nothing happened, Epp adjusted his calculations ‚Äî claiming the original date was based on a leaning clock ‚Äî and corrected the year to 1891. That year passed and Epp, ever more eccentric, declared himself to be Christ's son. His congregation dwindled over the decades. Epp died in 1913 in Ak Metchet, two days after his wife's death. The community survived until 1935, and is considered by historians as a successful Mennonite settlement that was dissolved under the Soviet collectivization program. ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==Further reading== * Dueck, A.

Within a few years, Mock Duck challenged Tom Lee and the On Leong Tong for control of criminal activities in Chinatown, and for the police and political protection of Tammany Hall. ==Chinatown kingpin== In 1900, Mock Duck demanded half of Lee's revenue from illegal gambling operations. When Lee refused, within 48 hours Mock Duck declared a Tong war against the On Leongs. Hip Sing men set one of Lee's boarding houses on fire, which resulted in the deaths of two men. In another incident, an On Leong man was decapitated by two Hip Sing hatchetmen, and open warfare began in Chinatown. One Chinatown historian describes Mock Duck in 1904 as \\"strutting around on Pell Street, covered in diamonds,\\" adding that, at that time, \\"Mock Duck is firmly in control of the Hip Sing, his sinister image bolstered by his long, lethal-looking fingernails, which signal he is too grand to do the dirty work he assigns to others.\\"Hall, Bruce Edward, Tea That Burns: A Family Memoir of Chinatown, The Free Press/Simon & Schuster, 1998, pp. 142-3.

He was named by the press the \\"Clay Pigeon of Chinatown\\" and the \\"Mayor of Chinatown\\". During several attempts on his life, Mock Duck reportedly squatted down in the street and fired at his attackers with two handguns with his eyes closed. Tie You in March 1906, wife of Sai Wing Mock, leader of Hip Sing Tong organization in Chinatown, New York City After Lee put a bounty on Mock Duck and the rest of the Hip Sings, Mock Duck formed an alliance with the rival Four Brothers Tong. Mock Duck took advantage of the reform crusade started by Charles Parkhurst. Duck posed as a businessman, and supplied information on the On Leong criminal operations to Parkhurst, including addresses. The authorities raided On Leong opium dens and gambling houses on Pell and Doyers Streets. However, Mock Duck held back the addresses of the more lucrative Mott Street operations for leverage against Lee. The warring Tongs signed a truce in 1906, but the Hip Sings and the On Leongs were again at war the following year. Mock Duck finally defeated Lee in the \\"Bow Kum\\" Tong war of 1909-1910. He was arrested several times during the next decade, during which time a number of attempts were made on his life. But he was convicted only once in 1912, for operating a policy game, and served two years imprisonment in Sing Sing Prison. ==Retirement and death== In 1932, Mock Duck agreed to an arrangement with the US and Chinese governments to declare a peace among the Tongs of Chinatown and he retired to Brooklyn where he lived until his death on July 23, 1941.Brooklyn Death Index: \\"Mock Sai 62 y July 23, 1941 15191 Kings County ==Footnotes== ==Notable Chinese tongs== *Bing Kong Tong *Hip Sing Tong *On Leong Tong *Suey Sing Tong *Hop Sing Tong ==See also== *Hui *Tong Wars *Triad (underground society) *Tiandihui *List of Chinese criminal organizations *List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates ==References== *Devito, Carlo.

It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the Moon, a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final E-6 spacecraft, Luna 9.

The spacecraft failed to achieve orbit, and reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean.

The powerplant consists of a two-stroke ' single-cylinder engine. ==History and development== The Cagiva Mito was the first bike of Valentino Rossi, eventual 9 time MotoGP world champion. In 1994, Rossi had been provided a factory Mito by Cagiva team manager Claudio Lusuardi and cruised to the Italian title. During the 1990s the Mito was the arch-rival to Aprilia's AF1 125 FUTURA and later the RS125, a similar 2-stroke 125 cc race-replica. In 2012, production of new Mitos was suspended. Increasingly stringent environmental emission requirements and the concentration of resources on MV Agusta's F3 were cited as reasons. The last few Mito SP525s produced were white in colour, and personally signed by MV Agusta CEO Giovanni Castiglioni. ==Models== ===Mk I/II and SP=== The Mito was introduced in 1989 as the Mk I. The Mk II followed with minor changes such as upside down forks and a new front mudguard. The SP versions featured Marchesini rims and uprated suspension. The SP models also featured different engine and ignition parts. ===Evolution I and II=== 1995 Cagiva Mito Evolution I In 1994 the bike was restyled by Massimo Tamburini with similar lines to the then new Ducati 916, a design he also penned. The similarity is particularly visible in the front and rear fairings. The Evo I is identified by the 3 spoke rims and the 7 speed gearbox, grey lower panels, solid colours on the tail section. The Evo II is identified by the 6 spoke rims and the 6 speed gearbox, solid colour lower panels, white area on the tail section. In February 2007, Malaysian company MOFAZ announced that they will be locally assembling the last batch of the Mito 125 Evolution for Malaysian buyers. The bike will be known as the Momos Cagiva Mito 125 Fauzy's Edition and only 300 will be made for the production run. In late 2009 Cagiva dropped the Evolution model, leaving just the Mito SP525 and Raptor 125 in the lineup. ===SP525=== Cagiva Mito SP525 In 2005, at the EICMA motorcycle show, Cagiva launched a limited production tuned competition version of the Mito known as the SP525. This is something of a homage to the Cagiva GP500 (C594) racing bike. Front and rear fairings were modified to look more like the C594, eight-spoke forged aluminium wheels were added, while speedometer, lights and mirrors were removed to reduce the overall weight. The bike is not road-legal. For 2008, Cagiva added the Mito SP525 road bike (not to be confused with the racing SP525 above) alongside the Mito Evo II. In terms of looks, the new bike inherits some stylistic traits from the competition SP525, essentially similar front and rear fairings. On a technical level, the bike retains much the same rolling chassis as the Evo and the engine is still a 125 cc two-stroke, but has had several changes, notably a new Electronic Carburetion System (developed in conjunction with Dell'Orto) governing both fuel-air, oil-mix and ignition, allowing it to pass tougher Euro 3 emissions regulations. ===Mito 500=== In November 2006 at EICMA, Cagiva unveiled the Mito 500 concept bike. The two-stroke 125 cc engine has been replaced with a fuel-injected, four- stroke ' DOHC single, courtesy of Husqvarna. Replacing the two-stroke's expansion chamber exhaust is a tiny, seemingly unbaffled system, its exit just visible at the rear of the underside fairing. With forged alloy wheels it weighs in at - just more than the Mito 125.‚ÄúCagiva's Bargain‚Äù, MCN, retrieved on November 22, 2006. ==Naked variants== Cagiva Planet ===Planet=== In 1998, Cagiva added a naked equivalent to the Mito Evo, named the Planet which bears some resemblance to the Ducati Monster. The Planet, unlike the Aprilia Tuono, has been given all new fairings including a fuel tank which can hinge upwards allowing access for space to store an open face helmet. ===Raptor 125=== In 2003, Cagiva discontinued the Planet and renamed the particular motorcycle in 2004 as the Raptor 125 which is essentially the same however with changes to the appearance. ==Performance== * Maximum Power: ::Evolution - @12,000 rpm ::Mito SP 525 ('09) - @12,000 rpm ::Mito 500 - 60 hp ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Official Cagiva Website Mito Category:Sport bikes Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1989 Category:Motorcycles designed by Massimo Tamburini Category:Two-stroke motorcycles ","title":"Cagiva Mito"},{"id":"7784676","text":"Branislav Bajiƒá (; born 5 May 1977) is a Serbian former professional footballer who played as a defender. ==Career== After playing for Zemun in his homeland, Bajiƒá moved abroad to Spanish club Xerez in 2003.

Directed by Jules Bass, it was written by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Romeo Muller, based on the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. It features seven original songs by Jules Bass and Maury Laws. The film's opening features the cast in puppet and live form plus caricatures of the cast by Al Hirschfeld. Among the cast were American actors Paul O'Keefe, Jack Gilford, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton (both from Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz), and Australian actor Cyril Ritchard as the voice of the Sandman. Some of the character voices were recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto, Ontario, under Bernard Cowan's supervision. The \\"Animagic\\" puppet sequences were staged by Don Duga at Videocraft in New York, and supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at MOM Production in Tokyo, Japan. The film was Videocraft's first theatrical feature production to be distributed by Embassy Pictures, located in Los Angeles, California and headed by executive producer Joseph E. Levine. Embassy Pictures later theatrically releases the company's two other films in 1967, Mad Monster Party? and The Wacky World of Mother Goose. As an association with Rankin and Bass, Ritchard also made his voice appearance in three of their studio's other animated productions: The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye: The Emperor's New Clothes in 1972, The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow in 1975, and The Hobbit in 1977 (his final film role shortly before his death). ==Plot== A teenaged Hans Christian Andersen the son of a poor shoemaker,daydreams instead of studying for school.

He was the son of Herbert Carlell of Bridekirk in Dumfriesshire, and the third of four brothers. He was not educated at university, though he did produce translations from French and Spanish during his lifetime; he probably had the informal though not always contemptible education of a courtier, which he was from about the age of 15. In his extra-literary life, Carlell was a courtier and royal functionary; he held the offices of Gentleman of the Bows to King Charles I, and Groom to the King and Queen's Privy Chamber. He was also Keeper of the Great Forest at Richmond Park. In the latter post, he assisted the King in his frequent hunts, and throughout the 1630s he lived in the Park at Petersham Lodge. In this same period he accomplished most of his dramatic authorship -- and his plays are notable for their forest scenes. He maintained his post at Richmond Park throughout the English Civil War, down to 1649. In this period he may have acted as a sort of undercover agent for the Royalist cause; he is thought to have sheltered Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle during this time. During the English Interregnum he is thought to have remained Keeper of both Richmond Park and St. James's Park. ==Playwright== Carlell began his dramatic career by the late 1620s. His early plays were acted by the King's Men and Queen Henrietta's Men. Thomas Dekker dedicated his Match Me in London to Carlell in 1631. His extant plays are: The Deserving Favourite (1629), The Fool Who Would be a Favourite (circa 1637) or The Discreet Lover (his most popular play), Osmond the Great Turk, or The Noble Servant (1638), Arviragus and Philicia, parts 1 and 2 (1639), The Passionate Lovers, Parts 1 and 2 (1655), and Heraclius, Emperor of the East (1664), the last a translation of the 1647 play by Pierre Corneille. Some critics have judged his plays to be significant in the evolution of serious drama in the 17th century, from the tragedy and tragicomedy of John Fletcher and his collaborators to the \\"heroic drama\\" of the Restoration era. In this view, Carlell is \\"one of the chief intermediaries between Beaumont and Fletcher, and Dryden and Settle\\".Allardyce Nicoll, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 229. ==Personal life== Lodowick Carlell's family tree from his biography by Charles Gray (1905) In 1626 he married Joan Palmer, the daughter of William Palmer, an official in the Royal Parks. A portrait painter, she was one of the first women to practise painting professionally. The couple had accommodation at Petersham Lodge. They moved to Covent Garden in 1654 but returned to Petersham two years later. They had two children, James (who was married to Ellen) and Penelope (married to John Fisher, a lawyer of the Middle Temple). ==Later years== Carlell continued in royal service into the Restoration period. On 6 June 1664, a warrant was issued to pay him ¬£150, three years' back pay as Keeper of His Majesty's house and walk at Petersham in Richmond Park. Lodowick died in 1675 and was buried on 21 August in Petersham churchyard. Joan died in 1679, and was buried beside her husband on 27 February. ==See also== * Match Me in London, a play written by Thomas Dekker and dedicated to Carlell ==Notes== ==References== * Gray, Charles Henry.

Once launched, a network of over 20,000 students from eighteen countries tracked the satellite by observing sunlight glinting off the mirrors and networked their observations via the Internet. The students used these observations to calculate air drag, solar activity, and other orbit related properties of the satellite.

The satellites were constructed largely from spare flight hardware. In November 2001, the amateur radio payload on STARSHINE-3 was designated STARSHINE- OSCAR-43, or SO-43.

It provides education for students years 7-12. ==History== The school opened as Flinders National Grammar School in January 1858. The foundation stone for the school was laid on 5 December 1856 by Lieutenant Governor Major General Edward Macarthur. It is believed that the architect involved was local (German) architect Frank Kawerau, of Ryrie St Geelong whom also designed many government buildings across Victoria - including Wilsmere (formerly Kew Lunatic Asylum 1864 - which has very similar architecture). The school was to be named the Geelong National Grammar School, but the Governor said that should be named after Captain Matthew Flinders, the first European explorer to visit the You Yangs.url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Kawerau When the school opened in January 1858, 116 boys were enrolled, but there was no room for girls. Falling enrolments forced the school to become coeducational in 1864. The school was extended and remodelled in December 1879 due to increased student numbers. When the extensions were opened in April 1880, it was then known as Flinders State School no. 260. The school was unofficially known as 'Link's School', after fifth headmaster George Link who was in charge from 1879 to 1894. During this time enrolments had increased to 1000 students. By 1938 enrolments were still increasing but there was not enough space. As a result, the decision was made in 1939 for it to become \\"Matthew Flinders Girls School\\" under Ada Knowles. The school was led by Frances Higgins from 1942 to 1947. In 1948 it was said to be \\"dilapidated\\" and \\"a dumping ground\\" for girls who would work in the mills as sonn as they were fourteen. At this point the school appointed Minnie Elizabeth Cawthorn as the new head. She decided that the students should not be trained for housewives but to have a life. The school became the \\"Matthew Flinders Girls School\\" and the grounds were pristine. In 1950 the first students to sit the \\"Girls' Leaving Certificate\\" in Victoria were at this school. In 1956 the new head of the school was Mary Lazarus. In 1966 the school gained High school status under Dr J S Bowden and it was renamed \\"Matthew Flinders Girls High School\\". The school is now called Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College. ==The School Song== * May this be the school of progress, through study and enterprise. * May ideals like a beacon shine, In youth's bright eager eyes. * *So, whether we're in the classroom, or whether outside at sport. *We'll show true concern for other's, and try as we know we ought. * *The quiet and busy classroom, The teachers that we knew, * Will show to us through-out the years, the worthwhile and true * *We lift our voices proudly!

The name \\"·∏§iyya\\" was given him during a dangerous sickness (·∏§iyya = \\"life\\"; \\"may he live!\\").

He died between 1603 and 1609. == Works == Even during his lifetime Boton was distinguished as a Talmudist of wide learning and acumen. His chief work is Lehem Mishneh (Double Bread; also Dispute of the Mishnah), Venice, 1609: it bears also the title Mishneh Torah. It is a commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, especially on those passages which apparently contradict the Talmud. He not only refers to such passages as had been previously noticed, but discovers a large number of others. At the same time, Boton endeavors to establish harmony between the seeming discrepancies by every possible method of interpretation. Le·∏•em Mishneh also contains many remarks on Maggid Mishneh, Don Vidal of Tolosa's commentary on the Mishneh Torah. The work is now widespread, and is incorporated with most editions of the Mishneh Torah that have appeared in the last two centuries. Conforte relates(ib. p. 45a that his teacher Mordecai Kalai told him and other pupils that the Le·∏•em Mishneh was the joint work of Kalai and Boton, who were fellow- students; and Kalai is even reported to have said that most of the observations in Le·∏•em Mishneh were his own. This aspersion loses force through the fact that though Kalai lived in the same city, he never made this claim against Boton publicly. Another work of Boton's was Le·∏•em Rav (Great Meal, or Great Dispute), responsa, published by his grandson Abraham (No. 4), Smyrna, 1660.

Although his name (Áæ©Â§Æ) has been long pronounced as \\"Yoshinaka\\" especially in dramas and novels, , written by an anonymous contemporary in 1703, recorded that his name was \\"Yoshihisa.\\" Recent findings on Ka≈ç marked on his own letter preserved in confirmed that his real name should be read as \\"Kira Yoshihisa.\\" ==Life== ===Family and early life=== Born in 1641, he was the eldest son of Kira Yoshifuyu. His mother was a member of the high-ranking Sakai clan. On the death of his father in 1668, Yoshinaka became the 17th head of the household, inheriting lands evaluated at 4200 koku. His wife was from the Uesugi clan, and his eldest son was adopted by Uesugi Tsunakatsu, the head of the Dewa Yonezawa han, taking the name Tsunanori. Yoshinaka named his second son as his heir, but when that heir died, Yoshinaka adopted Tsunanori's second son, strengthening the connection between the Kira and the Uesugi. ===Career=== As a k≈çke, Kira oversaw matters of protocol. In 1701, he was assigned the task of tutoring Asano Naganori in matters of protocol in preparation for an upcoming visit by representatives of the Emperor. According to the stories, Kira was corrupt and demanded bribes for the tutoring, which Asano refused to pay. Kira then began to publicly insult Asano, calling him an ignorant and unmannered rural boor. On the day when the envoys were scheduled to meet the sh≈çgun at Edo Castle, Asano drew his wakizashi and attempted to kill Kira in retaliation for the insults. For this, Asano was sentenced to commit seppuku, his house abolished and his retainers branded r≈çnin, while Kira went unpunished. ===Assassination=== On the night of January 30, 1703 (14th day, 12th month, year Genroku-15, according to the Japanese calendar), Asano's retainers broke into Kira's mansion, after almost two years of careful and secret planning, and killed him in revenge. They then surrendered themselves to the shogunate authorities and were ordered to commit seppuku for the murder. The Tokugawa shogunate condemned the grandson of Yoshinaka to death for being incapable of protecting his family like a samurai; the Kira were also dispossessed and lost the rank of koke. After the death of Uesugi Tsunakatsu, the revenues of the Uesugi were reduced from 300,000 koku to 150,000 koku. On the other hand, the brother of Asano Naganori was re‚Äìestablished, received a revenue of 5,000 koku and the rank of hatamoto. ==References== *Êñ∞‰∫ïÊîøÁæ©ÔºàÁ∑®ÈõÜËÄÖÔºâ„ÄéÊó•Êú¨Âè≤‰∫ãÂÖ∏„Äè„ÄÇÊù±‰∫¨ÔºöÊó∫ÊñáÁ§æÔºëÔºôÔºòÔºó(p. 115) *Á´πÂÜÖÁêÜ‰∏âÔºàÁ∑®Ôºâ„ÄéÊó•Êú¨Âè≤Â∞èËæûÂÖ∏„Äè„ÄÇÊù±‰∫¨ÔºöËßíÂ∑ùÊõ∏Â∫óÔºëÔºôÔºòÔºï(p. 314) Category:1641 births Category:1703 deaths Category:Samurai Category:Assassinated Japanese politicians Category:Assassinated military personnel ","title":"Kira Yoshinaka"},{"id":"7785017","text":"Stuart Webb (born 3 September 1980) is a former professional rugby league footballer who played for the St George Illawarra Dragons in the National Rugby League.

It is the highest point on the highway between the cities of Hope and Merritt. It is located just south of the former toll booth plaza on the Coquihalla Highway, about north of Hope, and south of Merritt and is the divide between the Coquihalla River and the Coldwater River. Coquihalla Summit is the Surrey Lake Summit at and is the highest point on the Coquihalla, which goes from Hope to the Highway 1 interchange outside of Kamloops. The ascent to the Coquihalla Summit is very steep, especially from the south, and is particularly steep north of the Great Bear snow shed. The pass is named after the Coquihalla River, from which the highway also derives its name. The Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area is located at the top of the pass on the Coquihalla Highway, approximately north of Hope. ==History== Kw'ikw'iya:la (Coquihalla) in the Halq'emeylem language of the St√≥:l≈ç, is a place name meaning \\"stingy container.\\" It refers to a fishing rock near the mouth of what is now known as the Coquihalla River. This rock is a good platform for spearing salmon. According to Sto;lo oral history, the skw'exweq (water babies or naiads, underwater people) who inhabit a pool close by the rock, would swim out and pull the salmon off the spears, allowing only certain fisherman to catch the salmon. The Coquihalla Valley has long been a major transportation route from the coast to the interior. in 1876, the Hope-Nicola Trail was built. The area retains some remnants of the Kettle Valley Railway which travelled this route from early 1900s until 1961. Modern use of the pass began in 1986 after construction of the first phase of the Coquihalla Highway (from Hope to Merritt). Construction of this part of the Coquihalla Highway was spearheaded by Tom Waterland as MLA for Yale-Lillooet. His \\"conviction that the route provided important benefits and an essential link to B.C.'s Interior... helped to convince reluctant Cabinet members of the necessity of the third route to the Interior\\". After 10 years in office, Waterland retired from the Cabinet in 1986 a few months after seeing this part of the project through to its completion. Some of the old railroad grade is now part of the Trans-Canada Trail network, including the Othello Tunnels of the Coquihalla River section, which are accessible via exits from the Coquihalla Highway. A series of protected areas were established along the route in 1986.British Columbia Parks Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area. Retrieved: 2013-08-13.

His style contained elements of impressionism with the influences of √âdouard Manet, Monet and of the Pointillists discernible in his work. Le Sidaner favoured a subdued use of colour, preferring nuanced greys and opals applied with uneven, dappled brushstrokes to create atmosphere and mysticism. A skilled nocturne painter he travelled widely throughout France and Europe before settling at Gerberoy in the Picardy countryside from where he painted for over thirty years.Yann Farinaux- Le Sidaner, Le Sidaner, (1989) L‚ÄôOeuvre peint et grav√©, √âditions Andr√© Sauret, Monaco. ==Early years== Le D√©part De Tobie (1894) L'Eau morte (1901) Henri Le Sidaner was born August 7, 1862 at Port Louis in Mauritius, where his Breton parents Jean Marie (1828 - 1880) and Am√©lie Henrietta (n√©e Robberechts) were living. His father Jean Marie was a ship inspector for Lloyd‚Äôs whose business took the family back to France in 1872His father was lost in a storm in the English channel on 15 September 1880 when Le Sidaner was 18 years oldThe remainder of his childhood was spent in Dunkerque where he attended the Coll√®ge et Lyc√©e Notre Dame des Dunes and where he met and befriended Eug√®ne Chigot who was to become a lifelong friend and supporter.Antoine Descheemaeker- Colle (2008),Eug√®ne Chigot, Sa Vie, Son Oevre Peint, Editions Henri, France. in french He showed aptitude for painting, in which he was supported by his parents, and attended art classes at the atelier of Alphonse Chigot and with a teacher who had been a pupil of Philippe-Jacques van Bree. Le Sidaner‚Äôs interests in the use of colour, softness of form and in painting in the gloaming light were formed during this period as he sort an artistic cure in naturalism and En plein air painting. √âtaples had a tradition of en plain air painting established by Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny (1817‚Äì1878), who retreated there from the outbreak of the Paris Commune in 1871 and of the local Deauville painter Eug√®ne Boudin (1824‚Äì1898), a leading post impressionist. In the late nineteenth- century numerous artists were drawn by the sand dunes, the atmospheric light and the remnants of an older France. In particular artists from the United States, Australia and the British Isles settled around √âtaples in a loose collective. Most left at the outset of Great War in 1914 as Flanders became part of the Western Front.Edith Marcq (2019), La C√¥te d'Opale et ses peintres au XIX √®me si√®cle √† la fin de l'entre-deux- guerres: l'individualit√© de son appellation √† ses diverses repr√©sentations picturales, in french. Le Sidaner stayed at √âtaples for twelve years preferring to work in isolation. In the meantime a febrile debate into the meaning of art was gathering apace in Paris. The Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants was founded in 1884 whilst movements such as Pointillism with their exuberant use of colour were undermining the foundations of academicism.Karl Ruhrberg, (1998). \\"Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists\\". Art of the 20th Century, Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, . Against this background in 1887 Le Sidaner sent his first painting to the Paris Salon followed in 1888 by La Promenade des Orphelines one of his most celebrated early works. La Benediction De La Mer exhibited in 1890 was awarded with a third place medal and a travel stipend to visit Rome where Le Sidaner made surviving copies of works by Giotto and Fra Angelico. La Benediction De La Mer is a painting with distinctly religious undertones. It is nostalgic and sentimental and the scene is set against an ethereal, atmospheric sky.http://henri.lesidaner.com/project/la-benediction-de-la-mer-etaples-1891/ La B√©n√©diction de la mer, √âtaples, 1891 Le Sidaner became close friends with the Norwegian landscape artist Frits Thaulow and they travelled to The Netherlands in 1891, a visit that produced a number of paintings including Jong meisje in de duinen (Young Woman in the Dunes)(1891)https://studio2000.nl/en/henri-le-sidaner/jong-meisje-in-de-duinen and Fillette au jardin (1894), an intimist painting of Thaulow's daughter unusual for the brightness of the colours that Le Sidaner choose for the little girl. https://studio2000.nl/en/henri-le-sidaner/fillette-au-jardin Le Sidaner's landscape paintings of the period reveal a fascination with the effect of light changes on the sensibilities, particularly at dusk. Whilst the impressionists and the pointillists favoured the use of bright colour to express emotion Le Sidaner began working in tonal, pastel colours and used a lighter palette to create moonlight landscapes. The theme had been explored by Jean-Charles Cazin (1840 - 1901), an older artist also from the Pas-de-calais, who became known for his views of uninhabited streets, often illuminated by a single light coming from a window. Le Sidaner used the same motif many times in the course of his career.American Art Association (2018) Catalogue of Paintings by Jean-Charles Cazin: Exhibited Under the Management of the American Art Association, Forgotten Books ==The Inspiration of Bruges== A Bruges Canal French art witnessed something akin to a schism in 1890 when a group of established artists that included: Puvis de Chavannes, Ernest Meissonier, Carolus-Duran and Carrier-Belleuse, frustrated at what they saw as the atavistic philosophy of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais, decided to revitalise, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. They organised an independent exhibition for the work of artists that did not fit the criteria for acceptance by the Paris Salon. The move received government support and the prestigious space of the Champs-de-Mars galleries originally built for the 1878 Exposition Universelle.http://www.artistes- independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&chlangue;=us Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, History]Le Sidaner was one of the younger artists who preferred to send work to the new Salon and in 1894 he sent two paintings Neige and the symbolist Le D√©part De Tobie. In 1895 Le Sidaner left √âtaples and moved to a suburb of Paris where he became part of an artistic clique that included the musician Gabriel Faur√© and the art dealer, George Petit, to whom Le Sidaner entrusted the sale of his future work.The move to Paris was likely made for career reasons. Le Sidaner much preferred a solitary existence in the French countryside. Whatever the prime reason the Paris stay was short but significant, as in 1898 he eloped to Bruges with the twenty two year old Camille Navarre, to whom he was subsequently married. Laura Gascoigne (2014), Henri Le Sidaner: the artist who fell between two schools, The Spectator magazine 10 May 2014The success of the Belgian Les XX group of artists had positioned Bruges as a city that was responsive to new ideas and ways of thinking Jane Block (1984), Les XX and Belgian Avant-Gardism 1868‚Äì1894, Studies in Fine Arts: The Avant garde, Ann Arbor: UMI Research press. and for Le Sidaner the years in Bruges were pivotal to his subsequent artistic career. It was in Bruges that Le Sidaner painted a series of nocturnes exploring the gloaming light around dusk. They possess a mysticism and convey the silence behind the walls and beneath the waters of Bruges' many canals. La Tour, Bruges (1890) is a strong example of his Bruges period. The Tower is displayed against a sombre blue sky whose light is fading fast. The bottom of the picture is in darkness save for the favoured motif of two solitary lights through a window. In another twi-light painting Cr√©puscule, Maisons Quai De Rosaire (1900)http://www.artnet.com/artists/henri-le-sidaner/cr%C3%A9puscule- maisons-quai-du-rosaire-QcCY0647ROPj3fqXP2dV_A2 the sombre palette is again off-set by the familiar motif of a lighted window casting its penumbra across the silent waters of the canal. ==The move to Gerberoy and international success.== The Grand Canal, Venice (1906) Le Sidaner held successful solo exhibitions at one of George Petit‚Äôs Galleries in 1897 and at the La Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels in 1898. He was keen to buy a country property where he could create a garden and work in reflective solitude. It was on the advice of ceramist Auguste Delaherche that he rented a neglected property at Gerberoy in the Picardy countryside that he subsequently bought in 1904. Yann Farinaux- Le Sidaner, Le Sidaner, (1989) L‚ÄôOeuvre peint et grav√©, √âditions Andr√© Sauret, Monaco. B00166TYK4 Once at Gerberoy, Le Sidaner rarely painted figures again preferring to create impressionistic moods through objects that imply human presence. Gali√®gue, Wittmer, Farinaux Le-Sidaner (2001), Henri Le Sidaner en son jardin de Gerberoy, 1901- 1939, Editions d'art Monelle Hayot, He also set upon the creation of a magnificent garden to rival Monet's at Giverny.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MWZ4qnG5FA Royal Academy Curator Ann Dumas introduces Henri Le Sidaner's garden at Gerberoy, Picardy, In 1902 Le Sidaner joined his old friend Eug√®ne Chigot for an extended visit to Gravelines and Gisors Antoine Descheemaeker- Colle (2008), Sa Vie, son oeuvre peint, Editions Henri, France. The preference for a few years was to avoid the harsh Oise winters and encamp to milder climes. In 1903 Le Sidaner spent the winter at Chartres and in 1906 in Venice where according to his biographer Mauclair he completed some of his greatest masterpieces. Initially displayed at the salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts they paved the way for a major exhibition in London in 1907/8 where Le Sidaner created a series of works featuring London and Hampton Court Palace and its gardens.Goupil Gallery, London, \\"Hampton Court and London: A Small Series of Pictures by Henri Le Sidaner,\\" 1908; The paintings from London possess a dreamlike quality.Marcel Proust.

Liddell noted that he was set in an ever-lasting , default twilight, the same moment eternally perpetuated in painting after painting to the detriment that the viewer never has a sense of Le Sidaner's true feelings.C.B.Liddle (2012), Henri Le Sidaner: The Painter Who Loved Roses and Moonlight at the Museum of Modern Art, Saitama, Japan Times Yet at the time of his death in Versailles on 16 July 1939 his work was f√™ted in France and abroad and Le Sidaner was a wealthy man.

It is based on the Hebereke series. Hebereke means drunk or untrustworthy. Popoon is an onomatopoeia for the sound made by the game pieces when they explode. ==Availability== According to the Video Arcade Preservation Society, via their website Killer List of Video Games, the arcade machine itself is very rare, if it still exists in cabinet form at all. The game is playable in emulation form using the MAME system and was also ported to the Super Famicom. ==Gameplay== Hebereke's Popoon is a block-grouping game closer in style to Dr. Mario and Puyo Puyo than Tetris. There are eight playable characters, each having different abilities. In one-player mode, the player is forced to choose Hebereke and must play against Oh-Chan. After defeating Oh-Chan, the player is allowed to choose between Hebereke and Oh-Chan in the next match against Sukezaemon, and so on, until the player has \\"unlocked\\" all the characters. Each match consists of a single-round. A defeated player may elect to resume play by using a continue. In two-player mode, all characters are immediately available to either player and each match is the best of three rounds. Players can also select a handicap level (from 1 - 5) to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game. In each round, pairs of Popoons of various colors (the set of colors varying with the character(s) chosen by the player(s)) descend from the top of the screen. These can be rotated and placed by the player. The immediate aim is to create groups of three blocks of the same color arranged either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When such a group is created, the member blobs blow up, disappearing from the screen. Any blobs above the disappearing group then drop to fill any resulting empty space. Each time a player successfully creates a group, a piece resembling the head of the player's character will drop on the other player's screen in a random position. These \\"heads\\" can be removed by the other player by placing a blob of the same color as the head such that it touches the head either horizontally or vertically. Both the head and the blob will disappear from the screen, in much the same manner as group of blobs, though no head will appear on the first player's screen as a result. A player can sometimes cause multiple groups to disappear. This can happen simultaneously if the placement of a pair of blobs immediately causes two groups of blobs (or heads) to form or it can happen in a chain reaction, as the formation and disappearance of one group causes the dropping of any pieces above it, which can result in the formation of another group, and so on. If the groups in either process are of different colors then this is said to be a combination or \\"combo.\\" The colors in a combo (or even a group) appear as small tiles in the lower of two panes in the middle of the screen and above the score-box. While a combo of one color (simply an ordinary group) causes a single head to appear on the opponent's screen, a combo of two colors causes a full row of heads to appear on the opponent's screen. Combos of three and four colors are much more dramatic, the precise effect depending on the player's character. Upcoming heads or special effects are kept track of by symbols placed by the players' characters in the upper of two panels in the middle of the screen. A notable feature in Hebereke's Popoon is the constant bevy of sound effects as each player's character celebrates each group or combo by making nonsense sounds or yelling Japanese phrases. ==Characters' Combo Abilities== When the player makes a combo of three or four colors different effects occur depending on the player's character: Hebereke *Head Color: Blue *3 colors: Head flies towards opponents screen attached to body via a tether. A double row of heads then drops onto the opponent's screen. *4 colors: Flies off the screen on fire. The player's pieces are removed and a proportionate number of heads are dropped on the opponent's screen. Oh-Chan *Head Color: Orange *3 colors: Uses magic electricity to turn pieces on opponent's screen into \\"frozen blocks\\" that can never be removed. *4 colors: Whisks away the bottom few rows of the player's pieces. A proportionate number of heads are dropped on the opponent's screen. Sukezaemon *Head Color: Pink *3 colors: A giant hammer smashes through the player's pieces, removing them from the screen. A proportionate number of heads is dropped on the opponent's screen. *4 colors: Hammers himself in the head popping his eyeballs out. Turns some of the opponent's pieces into heads. Jennifer *Head Color: Green *3 colors: Causes opponent's screen to freeze up for 10 seconds. All the heads from all the groups the player made are dropped at once on the opponent's screen at the end of this time. *4 colors: Pukes up an iridescent blob which descends from the top of the player's screen. Wherever this blob is placed, several rows disappear and a proportionate number of heads are dropped on the opponent's screen. Boo *Head Color: Light Purple *3 colors: Appears on the opponent's screen and turns it into an elevator which rises up and away. The opponent's screen then returns with many blobs having been turned into heads. *4 colors: A dragonfly flies from the top of her hat to the top of the opponent's screen. The beating wings of the dragonfly force all the opponent's pieces to drop at the maximum rate. Ufu *Head Color: Yellow *3 colors: Appears in a spaceship on the opponent's screen and drops several small copies of himself which proceed to walk around for a moment. Opponent's controls switch \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" for 10 seconds. *4 colors: Takes out a laser gun and fires a blast into the opponent's screen. The laser blast ricochets around several times, turning many blobs into heads. Pen *Head Color: Purple *3 colors: For 10 seconds the opponent's screen is filled with an image of the crying child which obscures the opponent's vision. *4 colors: Sings and dances on the opponent's screen for 10 seconds, randomly permuting all the blobs and heads. Unyo *Head Color: Grey *3 colors: Surrounds himself with a shield on the player's screen, preventing the player from doing anything. While this is happening, any heads that would have dropped on the player's screen drop on the opponent's screen instead. *4 colors: Shoots a rocket from his hat which blows up all the pieces on the opponent's screen and replaces them with a proportionate number of heads. == Reception == German game magazine M!

Its mission was > \\"dedicated to helping build a campus-based movement for political > empowerment and participatory democracy. Through education and organizing we > hope to encourage a radical political presence in our schools to transform > them and our communities into truly democratic spaces.\\" Its main goal was fighting against the corporatization of education, and subsequently aiming toward \\"campus democracy.\\" In its mission statement it said, > We oppose corporate control of the university and society, inequitable and > disempowering elementary education, shrinking access to higher education, > and the racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of systemic oppression > in our world. We support all efforts in these and other struggles for > democratic empowerment; the focus of our organizing will evolve in practice. > Our goal is to help build a mass movement to reinvigorate a political > culture of engaged democracy and social justice in our schools, in our > communities, across our country and beyond. MDE had its beginnings through the renewed anti-corporate sentiment that emerged in the mid-1990s, and took off in different forms of student activism, such as the Pepsi boycott in solidarity with Burma. In 1996, Democracy Unlimited of Wisconsin, Cooperative staffer Ben Manski, together with John E. Peck and others, coordinated the \\"National Teach-Ins on Corporations, Education, and Democracy.\\" This became the \\"Democracy Teach-Ins,\\" and in their first year occurred on over 120 campuses. Their central question was, \\"can we pursue democracy and social justice when corporations are allowed to control so much wealth and power?\\" The next year another series of teach-ins were organized on some 246 campuses, with more sentiment for a national campus organization coming up. At the Campus Democracy Convention at the UW-Madison in 1998, the 180/ Movement for Democracy and Education was founded. MDE was noted for confronting the transformation of the university into a corporate entity. The solution to corporatization, with the undemocratic nature of corporate structures, was to increase campus democracy. MDE also organized Teach-ins on campuses leading up to the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999, and analyzed the effects of WTO policies on higher education. During this time a new student activist organization was formed in the labor movement-financed United Students Against Sweatshops, and MDE chapters often were dually- affiliated. In 2000 the two organizations jointly organized a conference in Eugene, Oregon. In 2001, right after the attacks of September 11, MDE initiated what became the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition, the first major student anti-war coalition of the current moment. NYSPC organized the Books Not Bombs student walkouts on March 5, 2003, just before the Iraq invasion, showing student resistance to that upcoming war. At its peak at least 15 chapters were affiliated with MDE. It eventually collapsed in 2004 for lack of funding. It has been succeeded in spirit by the Democratizing Education Network, an initiative of the Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution. ==References== == External links == * Official website * National Youth and Student Peace Coalition website * Student Power Leaflet - based on MDE 180's Campus Democracy focus Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Student political organizations in the United States ","title":"180/Movement for Democracy and Education"},{"id":"7785304","text":"Leesthorpe is a hamlet in the English county of Leicestershire.

Proponents of Open Court Reading believe that its focus on phonics and reading comprehension strategy use, both taught with very explicit instruction, benefit children.

Scott was a highly successful forward, kicking 910 goals during his WANFL career. In 1953 he kicked 143 goals (including a career high of 15 in one game), but finished second in the League's goalkicking award to South Fremantle goalkicking legend Bernie Naylor, who posted a record 167 total goals, including 23 in one game. Scott was the WANFL leading goal kicker in 1951 and 1955 and he topped West Perth's goal kicking from 1948 to 1955. He kicked one hundred goals or more in a season four times. Scott represented Western Australia in 1948, 1949 and 1951 in matches against other States. He also played in West Perth premiership sides in 1949 and 1951. On 27 September 1954, Scott nearly lost his life when he fell from the ninth floor of the Royal Perth Hospital, being saved only by falling onto a construction lift.Atkinson, Brian; It‚Äôs a Grand Old Flag: a History and Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of the West Perth Football Club 1885‚Äì2007, p. 118 'West Perth‚Äôs Problem: Schofield May Replace Scott'; The West Australian, 28 September 1954, p. 19 Retiring from West Perth after the 1955 season, Scott played and coached in the Riverina Football League for three years, and after returning to Western Australia to play two more games with the Cardinals took up umpiring. ==Umpiring career== Scott made a rapid (by the standards then applying) rise through the ranks of umpiring. He umpired his first League game in 1961 and his first Grand Final in 1963. His first interstate match was the 1964 South Australia versus Victoria game in Adelaide. His status as a leading umpire was reinforced with WANFL Grand Final appointments in 1967 and 1968. In June 1968 Scott umpired the Victoria versus South Australia clash at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His performance impressed the Victorian officials as they made a special request of the Australian National Football Council for Scott to control the Western Australia versus Victoria match that was played in Subiaco in July. This was indeed remarkable as interstate matches were in those days always controlled by an umpire from a \\"neutral\\" State. Scott retired from on-field umpiring at the end of the 1970 season after 141 matches and three Grand Finals. In 1972 Scott became an umpires' coach and assistant to the WANFL Umpires Advisor. In 1977 he took on the role of WANFL Umpires Advisor. He remained as coach until 1979, and thereafter he continued with membership of the Umpires Appointment Board, chairing the board in 1981 and 1982. ==Awards== Scott's contributions to the WANFL totalled an impressive 38 years of service as an umpire, player and administrator. Combined with his playing totals, he participated in 331 WANFL matches, including six Grand Finals. This outstanding contribution to the WANFL, and the sport in general, was recognised in 1975 with the National Football League Award of Merit. The then national body gave only one award per year and the award was given for 'outstanding service to the game'. In 1995 Scott was awarded Life Membership of the West Australian Football League. He was inducted in the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 in recognition of his services to umpiring. In 2000 he was included in West Perth's Team of the Century. ==References== ==See also== * Category:1927 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:West Australian Football League umpires Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:West Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:West Perth Football Club players ","title":"Ray Scott (Australian rules football)"},{"id":"7785474","text":"Saint-Fargeau is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© in north-central France, in the historical region of Puisaye. == Main sights == * Saint-Ferr√©ol church, built in Gothic style in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The port was located at Misenum on a peninsula at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples. Portus Julius was named in honour of Octavian's (later to become Caesar Augustus) great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Caesar and the Julian clan.Suetonius, Life of Augustus 16.1. ==Construction of Portus Julius== During the civil wars, Octavian needed a safe naval harbour in which to build and train a fleet for a campaign against Sextus Pompeius (younger son of Pompey the Great) who was making frequent raids on Italy and upon the shipping routes for Rome's grain supply. To run the operation, Octavian turned to his closest and most able associate, Marcus Agrippa. Cape Miseno Agrippa knew that Lake Averno was invisible from the surrounding sea and bay waters, and reasoned that the fleet's existence there could be kept secret from Sextus' navy until it was ready to strike. Agrippa's plan, executed from 37-36BC, was to dig a canal to connect Lake Averno to Lake Lucrino and a second, shorter canal with a hidden entrance between Lake Lucrino and the sea.Casius Dio: Historiae Romanae XLVIII.50 A long road access tunnel, the Grotta di Cocceio, was also dug from Lake Averno north to the town of Cumae.Everitt, A. (2006). Augustus: The life of Rome's first emperor. New York: Random House. p.130 Agrippa's innovative strategy was validated as construction of the new fleet remained unknown to Sextus' roving fleet. When it was complete, fully outfitted and trained, Agrippa's fleet left its secret base and defeated Sextus at the Battle of Naulochus (off the north coast of Sicily), the decisive naval battle of the campaign. ==Abandonment and new harbour at Misenum== Submerged remnants of the Roman harbour. Shortly after the successful conclusion of the war with Sextus, the first Portus Julius was abandoned, owing to accumulations of silt that compromised its navigability. With secrecy no longer a requirement, nearby Misenum became home to a second and larger version of the naval base.Meyer Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa (1933), p. 32 The Romans built new breakwaters and the base was fed by the Aqua Augusta (Naples), an aqueduct which also supplied Cumae, Neapolis, Pompeii and other towns around the bay. The outer harbour behind Cape Misenum served the active vessels of the Roman navy and provided room for training exercises, while its inner counterpart (to which it was connected by a canal crossed by a wooden bridge) was designed for the reserve fleet and for repairs, and as a refuge from storms. Because of its location, the area controlled the entire Italian west coast, the islands and the Straits of Messina. ==Present state== The waters of Portus Julius may still be seen today, though much smaller since one of the original lakes of the Roman port, Lake Lucrino, was greatly reduced in size by the volcanic appearance of a large hill in the middle of the lake in the 16th century, a hill now called \\"Monte Nuovo\\" (New Mountain).

In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Rado graph, Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graph, or random graph is a countably infinite graph that can be constructed (with probability one) by choosing independently at random for each pair of its vertices whether to connect the vertices by an edge. The names of this graph honor Richard Rado, Paul Erd≈ës, and Alfr√©d R√©nyi, mathematicians who studied it in the early 1960s; it appears even earlier in the work of . The Rado graph can also be constructed non- randomly, by symmetrizing the membership relation of the hereditarily finite sets, by applying the BIT predicate to the binary representations of the natural numbers, or as an infinite Paley graph that has edges connecting pairs of prime numbers congruent to 1 mod 4 that are quadratic residues modulo each other. Every finite or countably infinite graph is an induced subgraph of the Rado graph, and can be found as an induced subgraph by a greedy algorithm that builds up the subgraph one vertex at a time. The Rado graph is uniquely defined, among countable graphs, by an extension property that guarantees the correctness of this algorithm: no matter which vertices have already been chosen to form part of the induced subgraph, and no matter what pattern of adjacencies is needed to extend the subgraph by one more vertex, there will always exist another vertex with that pattern of adjacencies that the greedy algorithm can choose. The Rado graph is highly symmetric: any isomorphism of its induced subgraphs can be extended to a symmetry of the whole graph. The first-order logic sentences that are true of the Rado graph are also true of almost all random finite graphs, and the sentences that are false for the Rado graph are also false for almost all finite graphs. In model theory, the Rado graph forms an example of a saturated model of an œâ-categorical and complete theory. ==History== The Rado graph was first constructed by in two ways, with vertices either the hereditarily finite sets or the natural numbers. (Strictly speaking Ackermann described a directed graph, and the Rado graph is the corresponding undirected graph given by forgetting the directions on the edges.) constructed the Rado graph as the random graph on a countable number of points. They proved that it has infinitely many automorphisms, and their argument also shows that it is unique though they did not mention this explicitly. rediscovered the Rado graph as a universal graph, and gave an explicit construction of it with vertex set the natural numbers. Rado's construction is essentially equivalent to one of Ackermann's constructions. ==Constructions== ===Binary numbers=== and constructed the Rado graph using the BIT predicate as follows. They identified the vertices of the graph with the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, ... An edge connects vertices x and y in the graph (where x < y) whenever the xth bit of the binary representation of y is nonzero. Thus, for instance, the neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd- numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers. Vertex 1 has one smaller neighbor, vertex 0, as 1 is odd and vertex 0 is connected to all odd vertices. The larger neighbors of vertex 1 are all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4, because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1.; . ===Random graph=== The Rado graph arises almost surely in the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model of a random graph on countably many vertices. Specifically, one may form an infinite graph by choosing, independently and with probability 1/2 for each pair of vertices, whether to connect the two vertices by an edge. With probability 1 the resulting graph is isomorphic to the Rado graph. This construction also works if any fixed probability p not equal to 0 or 1 is used in place of 1/2.See , Fact 1 and its proof. This result, shown by , justifies the definite article in the common alternative name \\"the random graph\\" for the Rado graph. Repeatedly drawing a finite graph from the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model will in general lead to different graphs; however, when applied to a countably infinite graph, the model almost always produces the same infinite graph. For any graph generated randomly in this way, the complement graph can be obtained at the same time by reversing all the choices: including an edge when the first graph did not include the same edge, and vice versa. This construction of the complement graph is an instance of the same process of choosing randomly and independently whether to include each edge, so it also (with probability 1) generates the Rado graph. Therefore, the Rado graph is a self-complementary graph., Proposition 5. ===Other constructions=== In one of Ackermann's original 1937 constructions, the vertices of the Rado graph are indexed by the hereditarily finite sets, and there is an edge between two vertices exactly when one of the corresponding finite sets is a member of the other. A similar construction can be based on Skolem's paradox, the fact that there exists a countable model for the first-order theory of sets. One can construct the Rado graph from such a model by creating a vertex for each set, with an edge connecting each pair of sets where one set in the pair is a member of the other., Theorem 2. The Rado graph may also be formed by a construction resembling that for Paley graphs, taking as the vertices of a graph all the prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 4, and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever one of the two numbers is a quadratic residue modulo the other. By quadratic reciprocity and the restriction of the vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4, this is a symmetric relation, so it defines an undirected graph, which turns out to be isomorphic to the Rado graph. Another construction of the Rado graph shows that it is an infinite circulant graph, with the integers as its vertices and with an edge between each two integers whose distance (the absolute value of their difference) belongs to a particular set S. To construct the Rado graph in this way, S may be chosen randomly, or by choosing the indicator function of S to be the concatenation of all finite binary sequences., Section 1.2. The Rado graph can also be constructed as the block intersection graph of an infinite block design in which the number of points and the size of each block are countably infinite. ==Properties== ===Extension=== The extension property of the Rado graph: for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices U and V, there exists another vertex x connected to everything in U, and to nothing in V The Rado graph satisfies the following extension property: for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices U and V, there exists a vertex x outside both sets that is connected to all vertices in U, but has no neighbors in V. For instance, with the binary-number definition of the Rado graph, let :x=2^{1+\\\\max(U\\\\cup V)} + \\\\sum_{u\\\\in U} 2^u. Then the nonzero bits in the binary representation of x cause it to be adjacent to everything in U. However, x has no nonzero bits in its binary representation corresponding to vertices in V, and x is so large that the xth bit of every element of V is zero. Thus, x is not adjacent to any vertex in V.Essentially the same construction, described in set-theoretic terms rather than using binary numbers, is given as Theorem 2 of . With the random-graph definition of the Rado graph, each vertex outside the union of U and V has probability 1/2U + V of fulfilling the extension property, independently of the other vertices. Because there are infinitely many vertices to choose from, each with the same finite probability of success, the probability is one that there exists a vertex that fulfils the extension property. With the Paley graph definition, for any sets U and V, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the numbers that are quadratic residues modulo every prime in U and nonresidues modulo every prime in V form a periodic sequence, so by Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions this number-theoretic graph has the extension property. ===Induced subgraphs=== The extension property can be used to build up isomorphic copies of any finite or countably infinite graph G within the Rado graph, as induced subgraphs. To do so, order the vertices of G, and add vertices in the same order to a partial copy of G within the Rado graph. At each step, the next vertex in G will be adjacent to some set U of vertices in G that are earlier in the ordering of the vertices, and non-adjacent to the remaining set V of earlier vertices in G. By the extension property, the Rado graph will also have a vertex x that is adjacent to all the vertices in the partial copy that correspond to members of U, and non-adjacent to all the vertices in the partial copy that correspond to members of V. Adding x to the partial copy of G produces a larger partial copy, with one more vertex., Proposition 6. This method forms the basis for a proof by induction, with the 0-vertex subgraph as its base case, that every finite or countably infinite graph is an induced subgraph of the Rado graph. ===Uniqueness=== The Rado graph is, up to graph isomorphism, the only countable graph with the extension property. For example, let G and H be two countable graphs with the extension property, let Gi and Hi be isomorphic finite induced subgraphs of G and H respectively, and let gi and hi be the first vertices in an enumeration of the vertices of G and H respectively that do not belong to Gi and Hi. Then, by applying the extension property twice, one can find isomorphic induced subgraphs Gi + 1 and Hi + 1 that include gi and hi together with all the vertices of the previous subgraphs. By repeating this process, one may build up a sequence of isomorphisms between induced subgraphs that eventually includes every vertex in G and H. Thus, by the back- and-forth method, G and H must be isomorphic.. Because the graphs constructed by the random graph construction, binary number construction, and Paley graph construction are all countable graphs with the extension property, this argument shows that they are all isomorphic to each other., Fact 2. ===Symmetry=== Applying the back-and-forth construction to any two isomorphic finite subgraphs of the Rado graph extends their isomorphism to an automorphism of the entire Rado graph. The fact that every isomorphism of finite subgraphs extends to an automorphism of the whole graph is expressed by saying that the Rado graph is ultrahomogeneous. In particular, there is an automorphism taking any ordered pair of adjacent vertices to any other such ordered pair, so the Rado graph is a symmetric graph. The automorphism group of the Rado graph is a simple group, whose number of elements is the cardinality of the continuum. Every subgroup of this group whose index is less than the cardinality of the continuum can be sandwiched between the pointwise stabilizer and the stabilizer of a finite set of vertices., Section 1.8: The automorphism group. The construction of the Rado graph as an infinite circulant graph shows that its symmetry group includes automorphisms that generate a transitive infinite cyclic group. The difference set of this construction (the set of distances in the integers between adjacent vertices) can be constrained to include the difference 1, without affecting the correctness of this construction, from which it follows that the Rado graph contains an infinite Hamiltonian path whose symmetries are a subgroup of the symmetries of the whole graph. ===Robustness against finite changes=== If a graph G is formed from the Rado graph by deleting any finite number of edges or vertices, or adding a finite number of edges, the change does not affect the extension property of the graph. For any pair of sets U and V it is still possible to find a vertex in the modified graph that is adjacent to everything in U and nonadjacent to everything in V, by adding the modified parts of G to V and applying the extension property in the unmodified Rado graph. Therefore, any finite modification of this type results in a graph that is isomorphic to the Rado graph., Section 1.3: Indestructibility. ===Partition=== For any partition of the vertices of the Rado graph into two sets A and B, or more generally for any partition into finitely many subsets, at least one of the subgraphs induced by one of the partition sets is isomorphic to the whole Rado graph. gives the following short proof: if none of the parts induces a subgraph isomorphic to the Rado graph, they all fail to have the extension property, and one can find pairs of sets Ui and Vi that cannot be extended within each subgraph. But then, the union of the sets Ui and the union of the sets Vi would form a set that could not be extended in the whole graph, contradicting the Rado graph's extension property. This property of being isomorphic to one of the induced subgraphs of any partition is held by only three countably infinite undirected graphs: the Rado graph, the complete graph, and the empty graph.; . and investigate infinite directed graphs with the same partition property; all are formed by choosing orientations for the edges of the complete graph or the Rado graph. A related result concerns edge partitions instead of vertex partitions: for every partition of the edges of the Rado graph into finitely many sets, there is a subgraph isomorphic to the whole Rado graph that uses at most two of the colors. However, there may not necessarily exist an isomorphic subgraph that uses only one color of edges.. ==Model theory and 0-1 laws== used the Rado graph to prove a zero‚Äìone law for first-order statements in the logic of graphs. When a logical statement of this type is true or false for the Rado graph, it is also true or false (respectively) for almost all finite graphs. ===First order properties=== The first-order language of graphs is the collection of well-formed sentences in mathematical logic formed from variables representing the vertices of graphs, universal and existential quantifiers, logical connectives, and predicates for equality and adjacency of vertices. For instance, the condition that a graph does not have any isolated vertices may be expressed by the sentence :\\\\forall u:\\\\exists v: u\\\\sim v where the \\\\sim symbol indicates the adjacency relation between two vertices., Section 1.2, \\"What Is a First Order Theory?\\", pp. 15‚Äì17. This sentence S is true for some graphs, and false for others; a graph G is said to model S, written G\\\\models S, if S is true of the vertices and adjacency relation of G.See, e.g., , p. 184. The extension property of the Rado graph may be expressed by a collection of first-order sentences E_{i,j}, stating that for every choice of i vertices in a set A and j vertices in a set B, all distinct, there exists a vertex adjacent to everything in A and nonadjacent to everything in B., Section 1.3, \\"Extension Statements and Rooted Graphs\\", pp. 17‚Äì18. For instance, E_{1,1} can be written as :\\\\forall a:\\\\forall b:a e b\\\\rightarrow\\\\exists c:c e a\\\\wedge c e b\\\\wedge c\\\\sim a\\\\wedge\\\\lnot(c\\\\sim b). ===Completeness=== proved that the sentences E_{i,j}, together with additional sentences stating that the adjacency relation is symmetric and antireflexive (that is, that a graph modeling these sentences is undirected and has no self-loops), are the axioms of a complete theory. This means that, for each first-order sentence S, exactly one of S and its negation can be proven from these axioms. Because the Rado graph models the extension axioms, it models all sentences in this theory.; , Theorem 2.4.2, p. 50. In logic, a theory that has only one model (up to isomorphism) with a given infinite cardinality is called -categorical. The fact that the Rado graph is the unique countable graph with the extension property implies that it is also the unique countable model for its theory. This uniqueness property of the Rado graph can be expressed by saying that the theory of the Rado graph is œâ-categorical. ≈Åo≈õ and Vaught proved in 1954 that when a theory is ‚Äìcategorical (for some infinite cardinal ) and, in addition, has no finite models, then the theory must be complete.; ; , p. 147. Therefore, Gaifman's theorem that the theory of the Rado graph is complete follows from the uniqueness of the Rado graph by the ≈Åo≈õ‚ÄìVaught test., Theorem 2.2.6, p. 42. ===Finite graphs and computational complexity=== As proved, the first-order sentences provable from the extension axioms and modeled by the Rado graph are exactly the sentences true for almost all random finite graphs. This means that if one chooses an -vertex graph uniformly at random among all graphs on labeled vertices, then the probability that such a sentence will be true for the chosen graph approaches one in the limit as approaches infinity. Symmetrically, the sentences that are not modeled by the Rado graph are false for almost all random finite graphs. It follows that every first-order sentence is either almost always true or almost always false for random finite graphs, and these two possibilities can be distinguished by determining whether the Rado graph models the sentence. Fagin's proof uses the compactness theorem,; , Theorem 2.4.4, pp. 51‚Äì52. Based on this equivalence, the theory of sentences modeled by the Rado graph has been called \\"the theory of the random graph\\" or \\"the almost sure theory of graphs\\". Because of this 0-1 law, it is possible to test whether any particular first-order sentence is modeled by the Rado graph in a finite amount of time, by choosing a large enough value of and counting the number of -vertex graphs that model the sentence. However, here, \\"large enough\\" is at least exponential in the size of the sentence. For instance the extension axiom implies the existence of a -vertex clique, but a clique of that size exists with high probability only in random graphs of size exponential in . It is unlikely that determining whether the Rado graph models a given sentence can be done more quickly than exponential time, as the problem is PSPACE-complete. ===Saturated model=== From the model theoretic point of view, the Rado graph is an example of a saturated model. This is just a logical formulation of the property that the Rado graph contains all finite graphs as induced subgraphs. In this context, a type is a set of variables together with a collection of constraints on the values of some or all of the predicates determined by those variables; a complete type is a type that constrains all of the predicates determined by its variables. In the theory of graphs, the variables represent vertices and the predicates are the adjacencies between vertices, so a complete type specifies whether an edge is present or absent between every pair of vertices represented by the given variables. That is, a complete type specifies the subgraph that a particular set of vertex variables induces. A saturated model is a model that realizes all of the types that have a number of variables at most equal to the cardinality of the model. The Rado graph has induced subgraphs of all finite or countably infinite types, so it is saturated. ==Related concepts== Although the Rado graph is universal for induced subgraphs, it is not universal for isometric embeddings of graphs, where an isometric embedding is a graph isomorphism which preserves distance. The Rado graph has diameter two, and so any graph with larger diameter does not embed isometrically into it. has described a family of universal graphs for isometric embedding, one for each possible finite graph diameter; the graph in his family with diameter two is the Rado graph. The Henson graphs are countable graphs (one for each positive integer ) that do not contain an -vertex clique, and are universal for -clique-free graphs. They can be constructed as induced subgraphs of the Rado graph. The Rado graph, the Henson graphs and their complements, disjoint unions of countably infinite cliques and their complements, and infinite disjoint unions of isomorphic finite cliques and their complements are the only possible countably infinite homogeneous graphs. The universality property of the Rado graph can be extended to edge-colored graphs; that is, graphs in which the edges have been assigned to different color classes, but without the usual edge coloring requirement that each color class form a matching. For any finite or countably infinite number of colors œá, there exists a unique countably-infinite œá-edge-colored graph Gœá such that every partial isomorphism of a œá-edge-colored finite graph can be extended to a full isomorphism. With this notation, the Rado graph is just G1. investigates the automorphism groups of this more general family of graphs. It follows from the classical model theory considerations of constructing a saturated model that under the continuum hypothesis CH, there is a universal graph with continuum many vertices. Of course, under CH, the continuum is equal to \\\\aleph_1, the first uncountable cardinal. uses forcing to investigate universal graphs with \\\\aleph_1 many vertices and shows that even in the absence of CH, there may exist a universal graph of size \\\\aleph_1. He also investigates analogous questions for higher cardinalities. ==Notes== ==References== * *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

It is their first studio release since 2001's Guilty Pleasures, and is their final studio album to feature lead singer Kevin DuBrow before his death in November 2007. Since DuBrow's death, there are no original members remaining in Quiet Riot. The album has received mixed reviews from fans. ==Background== In September 2003, Quiet Riot broke up for the third time after the 'classic' lineup of vocalist Kevin DuBrow, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali had been reunited since 1997. Interviews with individual members revealed there had been tensions within the band, particularly between DuBrow and Sarzo. When the band set out to reform in 2004, Neither Sarzo nor Cavazo was invited to re-join, and their roles in the band were instead filled by Chuck Wright, who had played with Quiet Riot various times in previous years, and Alex Grossi, respectively. In December 2005, Frankie Banali issued an update on his official website stating: > As we wind down 2005 and begin to musically think about Quiet Riot in 2006, > I want to thank all the friends and fans for the continued support that you > have given to Quiet Riot. We have two shows left for this year, one in Salt > Lake City, UT on November 29 and the final one on New Year's Eve in Ft > Mohave, AZ. We will spend the month of December putting the finishing > touches on the new material for the next Quiet Riot studio CD which we hope > to commence recording in January for a 2006 release.\\" However, the band was once again faced by several line-up changes. Wright left the band in 2005, followed shortly afterwards by Grossi. In December 2005, guitarist Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns briefly joined the band, leaving less than a month later after one rehearsal due to musical differences. Over the following months, the band would also work with guitarist Billy Morris, former bassist Sean McNabb and bassist Wayne Carver. When asked about the status of the upcoming album and the reason it was taking time to be completed, Banali said: > \\"The new album is a work in progress. Kevin and I made a conscious decision > last year to record new Quiet Riot music that would represent the style of > music we both like. Since we are financing the project ourselves, we are in > no hurry to churn it out because it is not time sensitive. Do we want it > released? Of course, but when we are ready to do so and on our own terms. > Let's face it, the Quiet Riot fans will likely go out and buy it when it is > released. All those who aren't interested in Quiet Riot will ignore it. Then > of course, the legions of malcontents who don't like Quiet Riot (or anything > else, for that matter) will slam it as usual, without ever hearing it. So > the album will be available when we decide to release it.\\" Finally, in late August, 2006, it was announced that the new album, Rehab, would be released in October of that year. ==Musical style== The album is an intentional departure from the \\"party-rock\\" sound of their past material and offers a more mature sound. Shortly after its release, drummer Frankie Banali called Rehab \\"the best Quiet Riot material that [they] have released in nearly two decades\\". He was also very positive about guitarist Neil Citron and bassist Tony Franklin's performances on the album, stating \\"No other combination of musicians that Kevin and I have worked with in the past could have achieved what we achieved on \\"Rehab\\" due to the variety of the material and styles.\\" Kevin DuBrow commented on the difference in sound compared to the material that the band is most known for, and compared the album to 1970s rock music, particularly the bands that the members of Quiet Riot grew up listening to, saying: > \\"If you are expecting Metal Health Part II, you won't get it and you won't > like it. There are hardly any background vocals, I mean, it's very similar > to a '70s record in that way... it's very retro. It's not super dry, but > it's not super wet in the echo either. It's like the records I grew up > listening to, Humble Pie, Led Zeppelin, Spooky Tooth, Free, bands from the > '70s, retro bands. Our original roots were more towards glam, [David] Bowie, > Sweet, Slade, things like that.\\" ==Recording and guest performers== Glenn Hughes made a guest appearance on the Crow cover \\"Evil Woman\\" contributing both vocals and bass, and also assisted in the album's songwriting. For the recording of the album, Neil Citron played guitar (with the exception of \\"Free\\" and \\"Strange Daze\\"), while Tony Franklin performed bass. However, for the tour in support of this album, former members Alex Grossi (guitar) and Chuck Wright (bass) returned to the band. The album also features a guest bass and vocal appearance by Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath fame, performing on the Crow cover \\"Evil Woman\\". Hughes also heavily contributed to the album's songwriting. Kevin said of Hughes' contribution \\"[his biggest contribution] was actually more the songwriting and the background vocals to the other songs. Because he was a big participant on the songs that Frankie Banali had written with Neil, that I couldn't complete, because they were so far out of my normal vocabulary. Glenn came over to my house, just on the computer and just boom, finished all the songs I was having trouble with.\\" ==Critical reception== The album has received positive reviews from critics. Prato of Allmusic gave Rehab three and a half stars out of five, and cited the first song \\"Free\\" as proving that \\"DuBrow's voice still sounds identical to the group's Metal Health days\\" and described \\"South Of Heaven\\" as having \\"an unmistakable [Led] Zeppelin-esque flair\\". He ended his review by concluding that \\"From front to back, all the trademark Quiet Riot elements remain in place on Rehab.\\" Greg Schmitt of Rock Eyez Webzine also reviewed the album positively with three and a half stars out of five, particularly praising the band's change in direction, saying \\"The problem was, with each [studio album] release getting further and further away from 1983; the material seemed to become more and more dated... It's almost ironic that for the band to seem fresh again, they needed to go truly retro. And that's just what they've done on Rehab.\\" He concluded his review by saying, \\"by delving back into their roots, the band has found new vitality and spirit we haven't seen in years. Rehab still has plenty of '80s a metal sensibility, but marriages it well with the soulful grooves of the '70s. For Quiet Riot to be relevant in 2006, Rehab might just well be what the doctor ordered.\\" ==Track listing== * Japanese edition ==Credits== ===Quiet Riot=== *Kevin DuBrow ‚Äì lead vocals *Neil Citron ‚Äì guitars *Tony Franklin ‚Äì bass *Frankie Banali ‚Äì drums ===Additional musicians=== *Glenn Hughes ‚Äì bass & vocals on \\"Evil Woman\\" *Alex Grossi ‚Äì guitar on \\"Free\\", \\"Strange Daze\\" ===Production=== *Kevin DuBrow ‚Äì producer *Frankie Banali ‚Äì producer ===Engineers=== *Neil Citron ‚Äì recording, mixing & mastering engineer *Greg Wurth ‚Äì assistant engineer ==References== Category:Quiet Riot albums Category:2006 albums ","title":"Rehab (Quiet Riot album)"},{"id":"7785890","text":"Spanky Wilson (born c. 1947) \\"Unknown Singer Turns Boos To Cheers\\", Jet, 26 November 1970, p.57 is an American soul, funk and jazz vocalist, who has performed internationally and recorded several albums since the late 1960s. ==Biography== She was born in Philadelphia as Louella Wilson The legendary Spanky Wilson returns to Los Angeles: Her personal story.

Birch was signed by QPR manager James Cowan from his former club Aston Villa. Birch had scored 49 goals for Villa's reserves in two seasons but was only a fringe player at the Midlands club, and this form prompted Rangers to sign him in 1912. Birch was small in stature ‚Äì only 5 feet 7 inches ‚Äì but he was a stocky and bustling inside-forward. He made his debut in the September against Plymouth Argyle and scored both goals in a 2‚Äì1 win. Had the First World War not intervened it is very possible that he would have played in excess of 500 games for QPR and ended up as the club's all-time leading scorer. Although never really prolific he was an extremely consistent goalscorer who could usually be relied on to score 15+ a season. There is another James Robert Birch currently residing in Vermont. He went on to play 334 league games (363 in all competitions) for Rangers, scoring 125 league goals (144 in all). He stands third in the all-time list of leading scorers at QPR.

Two works by Aulin, String Quartet E Minor, Op. 17 and String Quartet F Minor are the most important Swedish music compositions in that genre from the 1880s. ==Life== Both of Aulin's parents, Lars Axel Alfred and Edla Aulin n√©e Holmberg, were musical. Her mother, Edla Aulin had hoped for a career as a singer, but bad health had stopped her career. Aulin's father was a classics scholar, holding a doctorate in Greek, on the poet Callimachus. He also held a position at a Stockholm secondary school, where he taught classical languages. While he was a student at Uppsala University, Aulin's father developed an understanding and appreciation of chamber music, eventually becoming a keen amateur violinist, eventually leading to a position in the Mazer String Quartet Society, playing Viola and Violin. Aulin's musical career began when she started taking piano lessons from her grandmother and by age 12 was taking lessons from Hilda Thegerstr√∂m. Aulin eventually came to the notice of Albert Rubenson, the then current director of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. An enrolment at the academy followed when Aulin was 17, to study composition with Rubenson. Aulin was also tutored at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm by Herman Behrens and Ludvig Norman. Norman was an important supporter of Aulin for most of her life and when Norman died in 1885, she composed the Pie Jesu Domine for choir and orchestra. In 1880, Aulin held her first public performance at S√∂derk√∂ping, and went on tour with her brother Tor Aulin to Norrland. Aulin studied piano and composition for 5 years before winning a Jenny Lind Mendelssohn Travelling Fellowship to attend piano tutorials abroad. In 1886, Aulin travelled to Copenhagen to receive study from Niels Wilhelm Gade for a year and in 1887, travelled to Paris for three years to receive composition study from female pianist E. Bourgain as well as Jules Massenet, Ernest Guiraud and Benjamin Godard. In Paris, Aulin created two works, Tableaux Parisiens for orchestra and Procul este for solo voice, choir and string orchestra. Upon returning to Sweden, Aulin began a career as a teacher, pianist and composer. As a teacher, she supplemented her income by teaching piano, counterpoint, composition and harmony. At the same time Aulin was composing and between 1887 and 1901 she gave recitals of her compositions. As a pianist she often played with her brother, Tor Aulin, and others to form the Aulin Quartet, playing favourites like Camille Saint-Sa√´ns Piano Quartet and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart G Minor quartet. Besides many lieder and pieces for solo piano, her compositions included two string quartets (in F major and in E minor) and organ music. At the age of 43, Aulin decided to move from the capital, that place where grew up in, to √ñrebro, a city some 125miles to the west. There Aulin began working as a teacher, organist, pianist and arranging concerts although she ceased composing. The reasons for her departure has never been determined, although the move has been viewed with much speculation. The American Scholar posits that the reasons she possibly became fed up with the constant challenges faced by her regarding the musical culture in Stockholm, particularly since Aulin was female and also that she had certain difficulties with her mother. The Swedish Musical Heritage posits the same reasons. Other reasons suggested by The Swedish Art Music Society include the fact that the Aulin Quartet gradually ceased to perform and that the early death of the composer Ludvig Norman along with other members of her support structure. This combined with a lack of friends may have been one another reason. Either way, Aulin's work was performed less and less, and would be forgotten. It was only in 1991 that Quartet No. 2 was given its next performance. ==Compositions== Aulin's work consists of two types of work, piano compositions and compositions for voice and piano, that both provide works for less experienced musicians and professional musicians. This is evidenced by dedications to singers such as the Swedish opera singer Dina Edling and music teacher Hilda Thegerstr√∂m. With the exception of Grande sonate s√©rieuse pour le piano [F minor], Sonata for piano opus 14, the piano compositions have a single movement. These compositions are mood pieces in which the title already defines the pieces character. The prominence of single movement works is puzzling as Aulin was an accomplished pianist and was more than capable of playing longer compositions. Swedish Musical Heritage has posited that the possible reason was that Aulin wanted more of here work published as smaller works selling better than larger works. Aulin's compositions for solo voice and piano tend to be artistic songs rather than romances. Most of the text that is attached to the compositions were poems written by Karl Alred Melin. It is unknown whether Melin was a poet as he is entirely unknown. The other pieces of text were principally written by the composer Ludvig Norman. Other people of interest was the Swedish poet Carl David af Wirs√©n and the Finnish-Swedish lyricist and poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg. The work with the last effects are the two string quartets. Aulin wrote the last quartet when she was 29 years old and it has often puzzles musical historian and biographers of Aulin's life why she didn't return to writing quartets in later life. ===Orchestral works in several movements=== * Tableaux Parisiens, orchestral suite op. 15, 1886 ===Mixed choir a cappella=== * Three songs for mixed choir a cappella opus 5 * Two choirs a cappella for mixed voices opus 24 ===Mixed choir and instruments=== * Christmas song for mixed choir and organ accompaniment opus 23 ===Mixed choir and orchestra=== * Pie Jesu Domine, Missa sollemnis opus 13 * Veni sanctu spiritus [sic], hymn (Veni sancte spiritus) opus 32 ===Mixed choir with solo voice(s) and orchestra=== * Herr Olof ('P√• √§ngen under det m√∂rka fj√§llet', Carl David af Wirs√©n), ballad for tenor solo, choir and orchestra op. 3, 1880 * Procul este ('G√• stum, ja stum', Carl David af Wirs√©n), lyrical poem for soprano solo, choir, orchestra and harp op. 28, 1886 ===Female choir and instruments=== * Three choirs for female voices with piano accompaniment ===Voice and piano=== * Carina, 1891 * Der Todtengr√§ber [for bass voice and piano] * Det finns en gosse och han √§r min, 1884 * Four songs from Heine's 'Buch der Lieder' opus 9 * F√∂r l√§nge se'n * Kom!, 1881 * Roddaren, 1881 * Saknaden, 1886 * Sk√§rg√•rdsvisa * S√§g ej s√•, * Two songs for one voice and piano opus 19, * Vid R√•n√∂ str√∂m opus 18, 1890 * Ynglingen, 1881 ====Uncategorised works==== * Borta.

Thirteen Moons is a historical novel published in October 2006 by American author Charles Frazier, his second book after the award-winning Cold Mountain. Set in the mid-nineteenth century, the novel is loosely based on the life of William Holland Thomas, a Confederate Army officer during the American Civil War and Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians‚Äîthe only white man to ever hold that position. Thirteen Moons depicts the social and political climate preceding and following the Cherokee Removal from the ancestral homeland of the Cherokee Nation in what is today Western North Carolina. ==Plot summary== Near the end of his life, frontiersman Will Cooper reflects on his formative experiences from the unfamiliar comfort of his twentieth-century house. A call, which could be from Claire, the love of his past with whom he has lost contact, plunges him into memory, the recollection of which comprises, save for this prologue and a brief epilogue, the novel's entirety. Will, as a twelve-year- old boy, is sold into indentured servitude, and in this capacity he travels alone to the edges of a growing United States of America and of the Cherokee Nation in order to manage a trading post. On the way to the trading post he suffers many misadventures and ends up losing his horse which is his only means of transportation. In tracking down his beloved horse \\"Waverley\\" he happens upon the formidable Featherstone (a renowned horse thief), whom Will beats at a game of chance which amounts to a large sum of money. Featherstone demands that Will give him a final chance to recoup all the money in a final hand against a girl that Featherstone claims to have many of. Will wins the girl and when he meets Claire, then aged 11, he instantly falls in love with her; however Featherstone is a bad loser and sends him running for his life into the wilderness. After some days of wandering Will stumbles upon the trading post. There, Will demonstrates, along with optimistic fatalism, an aptitude for entrepreneurship. He quickly learns to speak Cherokee, the language of many of his customers and he manages to communicate and trade with them. When he is sixteen the owner of the trading post dies and his son sells the business to Will. His financial success allows him to build a small library there. He has been befriended by the local Cherokee chief named Bear who adopts him as a son and he is adopted into the tribe as well. Will meets Claire for the second time at a party Bear hosts when she is 16. He comes across Cranshaw, where Claire is part of Featherstone's household, presumably his daughter. We learn that Featherstone brazened out his sentence of forfeiture which should have taken place after he murdered a member of another tribal group. He returns frequently to visit Claire and borrow books from Featherstone, who still has extra aces up his sleeves, but grudgingly accepts and eventually also adopts him. As the years go by, Will grows more and more attached to Claire and they consummate their affection after a long process of courtship, spending two romantic summers together. However, Will finds out that Claire is Featherstone's wife, not daughter, as she had been thrown into the deal when he married her older sister. Coupled with the fact that a white man can not legally marry a mixed blood in the state and Claire's insistence on 'all or nothing' they never become fully wed. He has also had a duel with Featherstone, who never seems able to leave Will's horse alone. Will and his 'father' Bear have been conspiring to legally buy the land occupied by the Cherokee Nation. Will takes up their cause and lobbies at the nation's capitol, arguing for the tribe's legal land rights and for a while is partly successful at keeping a large portion of the land for his tribes exclusive use. He had somewhat become drugged by his legal reading into over-complexity in the transactions and the portion gets drastically reduced. Eventually, however, the army comes in, displaces almost the whole of the Cherokee nation and forces them to the plains beyond their traditional home in the coves cut from the mountains; Claire is forced to move away. He visits her sometime later, but she is unenthused at his visit and has since had a child with Featherstone. Featherstone tells Will that he died and came back to life, and is determined to make his second death one of much more phenomenal proportions. Devastated by the loss of his love on top of the miseries his friends have suffered along the Trail of Tears, some self-conscious attempts to find another partner and finally the traumas he himself witnessed while fighting in the American Civil War, Will departs his only home and wanders the nation aimlessly. Will's final encounter with Claire takes place at the Warm Springs Hotel, when both are in their fifties. Will hears talk of a Woman in Black who keeps herself aloof from the other hotel residents and remains in the mourning black from the death of her husband long past any necessary period. He comes across her one afternoon after being knife-cut by the collectors of someone to whom he owes money. She informs him that Featherstone's final death was hardly more dramatic than the first, and that her child has died as well. The pair spends another summer together, during which time Claire rejects a marriage proposal from Will and decides to leave him again. After more years, Will retires to a lonely home following a deal with the railroad built on a tract of land which he had owned. The novel ends in elegy for lost opportunities, the frontier spirit, and the memory of a native people. ==Cherokee Literature Initiative== Thirteen Moons was selected by the Cherokee Literature Initiative of the Museum of the Cherokee Indians as the first literary work to be translated into the Cherokee language and syllabary.Museum of the Cherokee Indians The Initiative, which was established with a grant from Charles Frazier, aims at preserving the Cherokee language. Myrtle Driver Johnson served as the translator. ==Contract== Charles Frazier was given an advance payment of over $8 million for a proposal that became Thirteen Moons.

In December 1924 The O'Collegian began daily publication, increased its circulation to 2,983, and joined the Associated Press, becoming the fifth college newspaper in the United States to do so. The only other college newspapers holding AP membership at the time were at the University of Illinois, Indiana University, the University of Iowa and Dartmouth College. In 1927, the paper's name was amended a final time, becoming The Daily O'Collegian. The O'Colly's online edition was launched in 1995.

His last duty assignment was with Co B 1st Bn(ABN) 327th Infantry, 101st ABN Div. ==Rhodesian SAS service== Squadron Commander Capt. Robert C. MacKenzie receives the Silver Cross of Rhodesia in 1979, \\"for conspicuous gallantry and leadership in action.\\" In 1970, MacKenzie traveled to Rhodesia in Africa, and passing the rigorous selection course, enlisted as a foreign volunteer in the Rhodesian Special Air Service, where from then on until 1980, he rose through the ranks from Trooper to Captain and SAS Squadron Commander. Decorations received during this time served with the Rhodesian SAS include the Bronze Cross of Rhodesia for \\"gallantry and determination in action\\" and the Silver Cross of Rhodesia for \\"conspicuous gallantry and leadership in action.\\" When the Rhodesian Bush War ended with the Lancaster House Agreement, MacKenzie resigned from the new Zimbabwe National Army and joined the South African Defence Force as a Special Forces Major. The following year, he joined the Transkei Defence Force as second-in-command, Transkei Special Forces Regiment. In 1985, after 15 years serving abroad, he returned to the United States. ==Soldier of Fortune== SOF's Robert K. Brown gave MacKenzie a job as a contributing editor for unconventional operations, and MacKenzie continued his unconventional career. In Mozambique, he worked with RENAMO, securing the release of seven Western hostages. He also trained and fought in Central America, Croatia and Bosnia. In February, 1995, at the behest of Sierra Leone's leader, Valentine Strasser, MacKenzie took command of a training troop, the Sierra Leone Commando Unit (SLCU) in cooperation with Strasser's right-hand man, Major Abu Tarawali and sixty Gurkhas of the Gurkha Security Guards. Their opposition in that African country was the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), an insurgent army then plaguing rural Sierra Leone. ==Final tour of duty== MacKenzie arrived in Sierra Leone in the end of January, 1995. The country's leader, Valentine Strasser had begun to organize a force to counterattacks by the RUF rebels and his right-hand man, Major Tarawali had contracted sixty Gurkhas of the GSG (Gurkha Security Guards Limited) to train approximately 160 green troopers that would form the nucleus of the SLCU. MacKenzie's first order of business was to locate an appropriate camp on which to base the troops. On a scouting patrol to assess possible locations for the training camp, MacKenzie, Tarawali and an escort of would-be SLCU came upon a village that had been burned by the rebels. McKenzie and the co-director of GSG, Borlace, wanted to pursue the rebels; however, the inexperienced troops were reluctant to do so. MacKenzie, Borlace and Tarawali went ahead on their own, and their soldiers later followed. Surprised by such determined action, the RUF forces broke and ran. This incident infused the SLCU with new confidence. Robert C. MacKenzie (standing, wings on hat) with some of the Sierra Leone Commando Unit he was training with the Gurkha Security Guards. Andy Myers is second from left, kneeling. On 17 February, MacKenzie led a convoy of vehicles from their base camp 91 miles from Freetown, the capital, to Mile 47, a town which had a government garrison. This stretch of road had to be secured if they had to hold onto their training camp (Camp Charlie) deep within bandit country. On this particular mission, they were ambushed by an RUF contingent. Marshaling the Gurkhas and the SLCU troops, MacKenzie drove through the kill zone and began flanking maneuvers, surprising the enemy at the aggressiveness of their response. The rebels turned and broke contact. Thick undergrowth prevented effective tracking, but three blood spoors were found, indicating that the RUF forces had taken some casualties. These successes in the field, however, deluded the government hierarchy into believing that the RUF would crumble in the face of any organized resistance. They ordered MacKenzie to attack the RUF base camp in the Malal Hills. MacKenzie countered that the SLCU had not been trained yet and that it would not be ready for such a major engagement. Back came the word that MacKenzie should take the Gurkhas on the mission, and leave the green SLCU troopers to be trained later. MacKenzie again countered that legally this would not be possible, since the GSG were contracted for training alone and not for combat. Finally, the army chief of staff personally wrote MacKenzie, ordering the attack for the 22 or 23 February. Determined to do his duty, MacKenzie agreed to investigate the possibility of attacking the Malal Hills. ==Death== MacKenzie gathered what little intelligence he could in the face of the government's impatience. In preparation for the assault on the hills, jets borrowed from the Nigerians were to drop cluster bombs on the rebel positions in order to soften them up. However, the Russian pilot flying a Mi-24 helicopter tasked with bringing in the Nigerian commander who would communicate with the jets, without any explanation simply hovered over the camp on the 23rd and left. Calls to HQ fell on deaf ears, and when the Nigerian jets arrived the next day, they bombed the wrong hill. Alerted by ordnance falling on unoccupied terrain, the rebels were ready for MacKenzie's group when they approached their objective. MacKenzie, leading from up front with Tarawali and Lieutenant Andy Myers, came under fire from a bandit ambush. Tarawali was killed in the first volley, and an attempt to carry his body back was made. Fire was heavy, coming from the enemy hidden deep in the undergrowth. The SLCU dropped Tarawali's body and ran, actually trampling the Gurkha medics who were a little behind the command group. MacKenzie ordered that everyone should retreat and the senior Gurkha medic saw MacKenzie take two rounds through his legs and one through his back. MacKenzie dropped his rifle as Lieutenant Myers bent over him to give him assistance. This was the last anyone saw of either. Intercepts of bandit radio revealed that they had taken Tarawali's and MacKenzie's bodies, but there was no word on Myers. He would be later presumed dead at 9:00 on the 24th of February. ==Family== Robert C. MacKenzie is survived by his wife, Sybil MacKenzie and a son, Ian MacKenzie. He was the son-in-law of Ray Steiner Cline, Deputy Director for Intelligence for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1962. MacKenzie's wife Sybil was previously married to Stefan Halper of Contragate notoriety. ==See also== *Blood diamonds *C (Rhodesia) Squadron 22 SAS *Executive Outcomes *Rhodesian Bush War *Robert K.

His father was Duncan Alexander McRae and his mother was Mary (Mahwhinney) McRae. His cousin and longtime business partner, Andrew Davidson (b. May 18, 1853) came from the same area. The two of them each went on to study at a Business school in Chatham, Ontario. ==Early career== In search of opportunities, at age 18 he went to work for his cousins, the brothers Alexander and Andrew Davidson of Duluth, Minnesota. The Davidsons had started in Little Falls, Minnesota, working for a railway company and moved into banking. Andrew had become mayor and they were involved in the business of buying, marketing and financing railway land to homesteaders. Minnesota made Andrew an honorary colonel. Their banking business spread through the region. In 1892, at 18 Alexander McRae joined them in Duluth and learned under Andrew. McRae's first business venture on his own account started when his father put up $1,500 and McRae became a partner with the Davidsons in a company that insured grain elevators. The Davidson-McRae company sold fire and liability insurance and surety bonds. By the 1890s they had invested in various businesses and McRae became vice president of First National Bank of Hibbing. By age 25 he had $50,000 of his own earnings accumulated. He invested in other businesses including a granite quarry. He married Blaunche Latimer Howe, of Pennsylvania who was the daughter of wealthy a forest industry father. They married in Minneapolis on February 23, 1900. They would eventually have three daughters, Blanche, Lucile, and Margaret (\\"Peggy\\"). As McRae and the Davidsons saw Minnesota land go up in price and farmers moving west for more land, they realized the Canadian prairies were an opportunity. They formed the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company headquartered in Winnipeg. ==Land Speculation in Saskatchewan== Land in Saskatchewan between Regina and Saskatoon had been surveyed in 1882. Railway companies were compensated with land grants for the cost of railway construction. The railway companies rejected much of the land between Regina and Saskatoon as unfit for settlement and court proceedings began. McRae and the Davidsons thought otherwise. In 1902 they bought land surrendered by the Cree and Assiniboine people under Treaty 4, which the government had assigned to the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway. Their first purchases were for $1.53 an acre and a further 250,000 acres of Treaty 4 land from the federal government for $1 per acre. They bought a further from the Saskatchewan Western Railway. They agreed to terms that required them to actively seek settlers for the land. They were also appointed land agents for the Great Northern Railway owned by Donald Mann and William Mackenzie in 1902. By the time they were done these and other purchases, their syndicate and the various companies it consisted of owned about of land which they sold between $2.25 and $12 per acre netting about $9 million. In the summer of 1902, Davidson and McRae organized two promotional train tours from Minneapolis through to Prince Albert. Each of these journeys saw eight Pullman cars plus dining and baggage cars traveling through hundreds of miles of unbroken and uninhabited prairie lands. The passengers were wealthy investors from the United States. The promotion was a success. Large tracts were purchased and word spread in the business communities leading to further investment. The company developed a network of land agents to sell land to settlers which advertised and maintained sales offices in many locations. In 1901 the population of the North West Territories (which then included Alberta, Saskatchewan and most of Manitoba) was 158,940. In five years it had grown to 443,175. Under their colonization scheme 50,000 people settled in Saskatchewan. The purchases of railway reserves required approval of the government. Those approvals and the purchases from the government were negotiated secretly with the Minister of the Interior, Clifford Sifton. A raging controversy arose in the House of Commons but the opposition was unable to make much of it even though McRae and his colleagues made a staggering profit in the transactions because the land had stood empty for years (the railway companies didn't want it), the government had insisted on terms that required the settlement of these vacant lands and overall the effort succeeded in rapidly filling vast areas of vacant land with settlers at a time when there was concern about American expansion into the territory. ==Business career in British Columbia== When McRae arrived to live in Vancouver in 1907, he came intending to involve himself in business ventures as an active investor. Even before arriving to live on the west coast, he had invested in Canadian North Pacific Fisheries. In its first year, it made a half million dollars. In its second year the business failed. He moved on to invest in Wallace Fisheries and became its president. He knew from his business ventures in the prairies that there was a shortage of lumber there for building. Working with his partner, Davidson, Senator Peter Jansen of Nebraska, the Swift Brothers (meat packing), William Mackenzie and Donald Mann, he took over a sawmill and a company town upstream from New Westminster at a place called Millside at Fraser Mills (now part of Coquitlam). Once he persuaded the government to dredge the Fraser River to permit reliable passage of oceangoing freighters to the mill, he reorganized it as Fraser River Mills (after 1910 known as the Canadian Western Lumber Company) with several large investors and a capitalization of $20 million. The plant and its yards covered and took 1,030 men to run. With an investment of $500,000 in new equipment and the acquisition or formation of related companies such as The Canadian Tugboat Company and the Comox Logging and Railway to transport timber from the of timber the company controlled between Comox and Campbell River on Vancouver Island, the company became the largest lumber and wood manufacturing company in the world. The normal capacity of the mill was of lumber a day. In 1912 the mill produced of lumber, enough to fill 42 rail cars a day. The mill ran around the clock. In the years after McRae's involvement, it eventually, in 1954, was acquired by Crown Zellerbach, and, with further acquisitions became Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited in 1987. By 1911 he had purchased canneries on Princess Royal Island, at Rivers Inlet and at Smith's Inlet. He introduced mechanized canning to the fish packing industry. By 1914, when World War I began, McRae was also president of Anacortes Lumber and Box Company, vice- president of Columbia River Lumber Company Ltd of Golden BC which became a subsidiary of Canadian Western, vice-president of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. of Victoria BC and president of Wallace Fisheries. ==Military service== In 1912, as a recruit of Major General Sir Sam Hughes, McRae volunteered with the 6th Regiment \\"The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles\\" as an honorary lieutenant colonel. When World War I broke out, McRae went to Europe where his first responsibility was the purchase of horses for the army. He reorganized the Remount Commission and was responsible for the purchase of 8,000 horses. He took over a department known for corruption and dysfunction and has been credited for turning it into a business like organization. Rumours led nevertheless to charges about the conduct of these acquisitions resulting in a royal commission under Quebec Chief Justice Sir Charles Peers Davidson. The commission cleared McRae of wrongdoing and commended him for his performance. He carried on as director of supplies and services and, when Hughes fell into disfavour in 1916, McRae continued to advance. He was promoted the rank of Major General and in 1917, was made a member of the Order of the Bath. Later in the war effort, he was seconded to the British Government to organize Ministry of Information assisting Britain's Minister of Information, Lord Beaverbrook. For his services, it has been said that the British crown offered McRae knighthood, which he declined, although McRae himself never confirmed or denied that this happened. He left the army in 1918 two months after the end of the war. Afterwards he had little involvement in the military although, in 1934, addressing the Senate, he predicted correctly that another war would erupt in Europe after touring Europe and interviewing various prominent men in France, Germany and Austria. In World War II his involvement was limited to helping raise financial support for the Canadian Legion and the YMCA. In his later careers he was sometimes an advocate for returned veterans and in 1942 he donated his Vancouver mansion to the federal government for use as a hospital for wounded veterans. ==Hycroft== Hycroft Manor After McRae settled in Vancouver in 1907 he proceeded to build a mansion for his family, to become known as Hycroft, in Shaughnessy one of Vancouver's neighborhoods. The home was built on the brow of a hill on of land. The land upon which the 30 room, 3 story mansion was built cost $10,000. The construction, completed in 1911, cost $100,000. The house was designed by Vancouver architect Thomas Hooper. After the death of his wife Blaunche in 1942, McRae donated Hycroft to the government of Canada to be used as a hospital for wounded veterans. Once converted, it housed 130 beds. Since 1962 Hycroft has been the home of the University Woman's Club of Vancouver and is home in that capacity to the club, founded in 1907 to promote education and human rights for women. The Club promotes education and opportunities for women and members enjoy sharing ideas, interests, and fun at its Clubhouse, Hycroft. Hycroft is available for member use, member events, and rentals. The French Olympic Team used the building during the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. It is also heavily used by Vancouver's film and television production industry as a set. ==Political career== ===British Columbia Provincial Party=== In 1923 McRae organized a group of British Columbia Conservative Party dissidents he called the Committee of 100 which became the Provincial Party of British Columbia. The party sought freight rate equalization, cooperation with the federal government in the development of a northern railway, the elimination of Oriental labour, abolition of patronage, hiring of veterans and the elimination of income tax which had been introduced as a temporary measure during the war. The party nominated candidates in only one provincial election: the 1924 election. In that election, McRae claimed the Conservative government of John Oliver and the previous administration of Liberal Premier William John Bowser, then the opposition leader, were corrupt. Many of his allegations were related to the funding of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway plan to reach Prince George in the Northern interior of the province which was not achieved until many years later. He claimed that there were kickbacks, patronage and various wrongdoings. His allegations were never proven. He offered to pay for an independent audit of the books of the railway. His offer was declined. Although the party achieved 24% of the popular vote in the 1924 election and took 3 seats, McRae was not elected. Both Bowser and Oliver lost their seats but Oliver continued to lead his conservative party as Premier of a minority government after the election. McRae reconciled with his former Conservative allies after the election and went on to federal politics. The Provincial Party disappeared. ===Federal politics=== McRae ran federally for the Conservatives winning a seat in Parliament the 1926 election representing the Vancouver North district. He organized the first modern leadership convention of the Conservative party in 1927. At the same time, he organized the bid of R.B. Bennett for the leadership. He went on to run Bennett's campaign in the 1930 election leading to his election as the 11th Prime Minister of Canada however McRae was defeated in his own constituency in that election. After a few months, Bennett appointed McRae to the Senate where he served until his death, at age 71 in 1946. He was active with his duties in the Senate until immediately before his last, brief, illness. He was interred at Ocean View Memorial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. ==Post-war business career== During his Senate years, he became involved in various business ventures. He was involved in Texas-Canada Oil Company and Pioneer Gold Mine in BC. He was involved in mining in Alaska including the Yukon Charlie mine. ==Eaglecrest Lodge== In the early 1930s McRae purchased 260 acres (1.1 km2) of ocean front bluff land in Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island. In 1934 he built a country home, constructed of logs, long and wide. The property and its development were significant relief for the local population in the depressed economy of the 1930s. The home, which Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth and her husband stayed at for a private visit in 1951 during their honeymoon during subsequent ownership, burned to the ground in 1969. McRae also took up farming with the purchase of 2,000 acres (8 km2) of land near Qualicum Beach. He employed about a hundred men in its operation for the 13 or 14 years that he owned it. He bred sheep and cattle. ==Sources== * * ==References== ==External links== * *Vancouver History: Hycroft Manor By Rebecca Bollwitt Category:1874 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Vancouver Category:Canadian senators from British Columbia Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) senators Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) MPs Category:Canadian Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:People from Middlesex County, Ontario Category:Politicians from Vancouver Category:British Columbia Conservative Party politicians Category:Canadian generals Category:Canadian people of World War I ","title":"Alexander Duncan McRae"},{"id":"7786010","text":"Hollingshead (or Holinshed) is a surname that may refer to: * Raphael Holinshed (1529‚Äì1580), 16th century British author of Holinshed's Chronicles * Gordon Hollingshead (1892‚Äì1952), American movie producer * John Hollingshead (1827‚Äì1904) English theatrical impresario * Holly Hollingshead (1853‚Äì1926), American baseball player * Richard Hollingshead (1900‚Äì1975), American inventor * Harry Hollingshead (1915-?), Australian rules footballer * Greg Hollingshead (b. 1947), Canadian novelist * Megan Hollingshead (b. 1968), American theatre and voice actor * Iain Hollingshead (b. 1980), British freelance journalist and novelist * Michael Hollingshead (b. ?), British scientist * Mike Hollingshead (b. ?), American stormchaser * Tam Hollingshead (b. ?), American football coach * Vanessa Hollingshead (b. ?), American comedian ==See also== * Hollings (disambiguation) ","title":"Hollingshead"},{"id":"7786028","text":"Thomas Raymond \\"Ray\\" Brady (3 June 1937 ‚Äì 15 November 2016) was an Irish international footballer who played in England in the late 1950s and early 1960s with Millwall and Queens Park Rangers.

ATM is a membership organisation representing a community of students, nursery, infant, primary, secondary and tertiary teachers, numeracy consultants, overseas teachers, academics and anybody interested in mathematics education. ==Aims== The stated aims of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics are to support the teaching and learning of mathematics by: * encouraging increased understanding and enjoyment of mathematics * encouraging increased understanding of how people learn mathematics * encouraging the sharing and evaluation of teaching and learning strategies and practices * promoting the exploration of new ideas and possibilities * initiating and contributing to discussion of and developments in mathematics education at all levels ==Guiding principles== ATM lists as its guiding principles: * The ability to operate mathematically is an aspect of human functioning which is as universal as language itself. Attention needs constantly to be drawn to this fact. Any possibility of intimidating with mathematical expertise is to be avoided. * The power to learn rests with the learner. Teaching has a subordinate role. The teacher has a duty to seek out ways to engage the power of the learner. * It is important to examine critically approaches to teaching and to explore new possibilities, whether deriving from research, from technological developments or from the imaginative and insightful ideas of others. * Teaching and learning are cooperative activities. Encouraging a questioning approach and giving due attention to the ideas of others are attitudes to be encouraged. Influence is best sought by building networks of contacts in professional circles. ==Structure== There are about 3500 members, mainly teachers in primary and secondary schools. It is a registered charity and all profits from subscriptions and trading are re-invested. Its head office is located in central Derby ===Branches=== Working within the aims and guiding principles of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics, ATM Branches provide the opportunity for professionals to share ideas and experiences in their own areas. Benefits Include: The opportunity to meet teachers from other schools affected by the same issues as you Meeting people from different phases of education - primary/ secondary/ tertiary Discovering new ideas from session leaders who are experts in their respective fields Revisiting old ideas with a fresh new perspective Establishing a connection between the national ATM teachers in a locality == Publications == ATM publishes Mathematics Teaching, a non-refereed journal with articles of interest to those involved in mathematics education. The journal is sent to all registered members. There are some free 'open access' journals available to all on the ATM website.

He played as a defender from 1989 until 2006 notably played in the Premier League for Ipswich Town, before later going on to Watford, Queens Park Rangers and Milton Keynes Dons. ==Early life== Palmer attended Dorothy Stringer High School, Brighton, and Christ's College, Cambridge, and is the only professional footballer of the modern era to be educated at Cambridge University, obtaining a degree in software engineering. Whilst studying he played for Cambridge University A.F.C. In April 1987 he played a single first- class cricket match for a Cambridge University side also containing future England captain Mike Atherton.Cambridge University v Lancashire, CricketArchive Facing Lancashire, Palmer dismissed former England player Graeme Fowler lbw for 49. He went on to score 18 with the bat, before being bowled by Paul Allott. ==Playing career== He turned professional with Ipswich Town in 1989 and spent six years at the club before making a ¬£135,000 move to Watford. Palmer established himself as a first team regular during another near six-year spell at Vicarage Road and his departure on a free transfer in July 2001 caused some consternation amongst the club's supporters.Gone but not Forgotten: Steve Palmer Whilst at the club he broke the record for wearing every numbered shirt from 1 to 14 in the 1997‚Äì98 season.Knowledge ‚Äì do Woking have the best Wembley record ever? guardian.co.uk Placed in goal for the kick- off of the season's final home match versus A.F.C. Bournemouth, he swapped shirts with goalkeeper Alec Chamberlain early in the game. He completed the set by wearing Jason Lee's number 9 shirt in the final match away at Fulham ‚Äì in which Watford won the Division 2 title. Watford secured back-to-back promotion the following season, with Palmer voted Player of the Season. Palmer signed for Queens Park Rangers in July 2001 and made his debut in August of that year in a 1‚Äì0 win against Stoke City. He was captain and ever present in what was QPR's first season in the third tier since 1966‚Äì67. In total Palmer made 95 league appearances for QPR, scoring 5 goals. After leaving QPR in 2004 Palmer signed for Milton Keynes Dons, playing for the club for two seasons, scoring once against Blackpool. ==Coaching career== He retired from football in October 2005 and took up a position as Tottenham Hotspur's Academy Performance Manager a month later.PALMER'S BEEN THERE tottenhamhotspur.com, Accessed 6 November 2006 In December 2011 Palmer returned to Watford as Academy Recruitment Manager,THE PROFESSOR REJOINS WATFORD Watford Observer, Accessed 11 December 2011 leaving again in June 2012 to work with the Premier League setting up a performance tracking system for the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP).Steve Palmer leaving Watford's Academy for Premier League role Watford Observer, Accessed 17 August 2012 ==References== ==External links== * *Palmer at CricketArchive Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Brighton Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Cambridge University A.F.C. players Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Milton Keynes Dons F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English cricketers Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. non- playing staff Category:Watford F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Steve Palmer (footballer)"},{"id":"7786413","text":"Take-all is a plant disease affecting the roots of grass and cereal plants in temperate climates caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. All varieties of wheat and barley are susceptible. It is an important disease in winter wheat in Western Europe particularly, and is favoured by conditions of intensive production and monoculture. == The disease == The pathogen survives in the soil on infected cereal and grass residues. The fungus infects the root tissue of young plants and can spread from plant to plant in the form of hyphae growing through the soil which is why the disease is often seen in patches. The fungus blocks the conductive tissue of the plants and reduces water uptake. Early symptoms of the disease include yellowing and stunting, tillering is reduced and plants mature prematurely and often exhibit bleached seed heads. The affected roots are blackened and the plants are easy to pull from the soil. These symptoms give rise to an alternative name for the disease, \\"whiteheads\\". Yield loss levels of 40 to 50% are often recorded in severe attacks. == Control == Chemical control measures have traditionally had little success, although a modern seed treatment shows promise. Crop nutrition imbalances exacerbate the disease, as does excessive liming. Modern varieties are stiff and short-strawed which allows relatively high spring nitrogen applications without serious lodging. This can limit damage from the disease. The most appropriate control measure is the use of a clean one-year break crop of a non-cereal crop. This reduces the fungus to an acceptably low soil contamination level in about 10 months although stray volunteer grasses may reduce any beneficial effects. There exists a phenomenon known as \\"take-all decline\\". Experiments performed on the famous \\"Broadbalk\\" field at Rothamsted Experimental Station where continuous monoculture winter wheat is grown, show that take-all build-up occurs in successive crops to reach a peak in the 3rd to 5th cropping year, after which the disease declines, ultimately restoring yields to 80 to 90% of 1st and 2nd year levels. The decline cycle is destroyed by the introduction of a crop other than wheat or barley. == Hosts, Symptoms, and Signs == Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. causes disease in the roots, crown, and stem base of wheat, barley, rye, along with several grasses such as Bromegrass, Quackgrass, and Bentgrass. Oats are the only cereal crops that are able to have resistance. The majority of infected plants can withstand mild root infection and appear symptomless. There are also cases where entire fields can be affected, but typically premature death occurs in circular patches in the field. Infected plants are identifiable through stunting, mild chlorosis (yellowing), and a decreased number of tillers, which are additional stems that develop of the main shoot of the plant. When tillers die due to disease they are white, creating a ‚Äúwhite-head‚Äù that can be described as a sterile environment that isn‚Äôt able to germinate. Signs include perithecia that are shown in infected root and stem tissues which are black in color. This blackening of the crown and stem base allow the plant to be easily pulled from the soil with no attached root system. Given its name \\"Take-all\\", it has been known to destroy entire stands of wheat. == Environment == Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. is a soil borne fungus that received its name over 100 years ago in Australia. Although the term originated in this region of the world, it is seen throughout the world under temperate climates as well as regions with tropical climates or high elevations. Given that it is an ascomycete, it favors damp climates, but can proceed to persist in dry climates where irrigation is used. Take-all becomes more severe in sandy, infertile, compact, and poorly drained soils, where air, and therefore soil temperatures are 11¬∞C to 20¬∞C. The second half of the growing season is favorable. The pathogen favors a basic environment and increases in severity of the pathogen when the pH reaches 7. Soils deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and copper also intensify growth of the pathogen. Therefore, liming is not a suitable form of control. There have been tested areas in Larslan and Toston, Montana, where two different fungi found in particular soil have reduced the severity of take-all through mycoparasitism. == Disease cycle == Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici persists through unfavorable climates in infected host plants and host debris. It can be spread from area to area through this debris. There are two inoculum that contribute to the spread of the pathogen, hyphae and ascospores. Hyphae are the predominant inoculum, because roots become infected as they grow through infested soil. Most of the plant-to-plant spread of take-all occurs via runner hyphae moving across ‚Äúroot bridges‚Äù. In addition, ascospores are moved through splashing and in some instances wind. The pathogen then causes whiteheads to accumulate on the top of the plant. When the plant eventually dies, the cycle repeats and the fungi once again overwinters as an ascocarp inside the host plant and plant debris. This pathogen may be considered polycyclic because initial inoculum is by mycelial growth by the resting spores, ascomata. Alloinfection may be relatively less frequent within a season, yet secondary inoculum can also occur during the same season. == See also == * Genetic engineering * Genetic engineering in the United States == References == * Biology and Control of Take-all.

Together with Franz Berwald and Adolf Fredrik Lindblad, he ranks among the most important Swedish symphonists of the 19th century. Norman was born Fredrik Vilhelm Ludvig Norman in Stockholm. Norman began his musical training with Lindblad and later studied at the Leipzig Conservatory from 1848 to 1852, where he also made the acquaintance of Robert Schumann. Starting in 1857, he taught at the Royal Music Academy of Stockholm. In 1860, he became the conductor of the Nya harmoniska s√§llskapet and obtained the post of Kapellmeister at the Royal Swedish Opera the following year. After 1881, he conducted the choral concerts of the Musikvorenigen. He was married to the noted violinist Wilma Neruda in 1864. Their son Ludwig Norman Neruda was a famous alpinist. As conductor, he is remembered for premiering Franz Berwald's fourth symphony on 9 April 1878.Woodstra, Chris; Brennan, Gerald; Schrott, Allen (2005). .

It belongs to the Aten group of asteroids and measures approximately 210 meters in diameter. Discovered by Charles Kowal in 1976, it was later named after Hathor from Egyptian mythology. == Discovery == Hathor was discovered on 22 October 1976, by American astronomer Charles Kowal at Palomar Observatory, California, United States. It was independently discovered by Eleanor Helin and is named for the ancient Egyptian deity Hathor. === Independent discoveries === On 25 October 1976, Hathor was independently discovered by Eleanor Helin during the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS), and by William Lawrence Sebok, who photographed the same field almost simultaneously using Palomars 1.22-meter Schmidt telescope. On the same day, the official discoverer Charles Kowal found that Hathor had already been imaged three days earlier by Palomars 0.46-meter telescope (the same instrument used by PCAS). A forth independent discovery was made several days later by Nikolai Chernykh at CrAO on the Crimean peninsula. The multiple discoveries were probably due to its very close approach distance to Earth. After 2062 Aten, Hathor was the second discovery of an Aten asteroid. In 1978, the third Aten, 2100 Ra-Shalom was discovered. The Aten was already identified at Palomar in 1954, but its discovery date was later assigned to a 2003-observation at Lincoln Laboratory ETS, and is now known as . == Orbit and classification == Being a member of the Aten asteroids, Hathor orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.5‚Äì1.2 AU once every 0 years and 9 months (283 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.45 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Its observation arc begins 3 days after its official discovery at Palomar, with no precoveries taken and no prior identifications made. Its orbital solution includes non- gravitational forces. === Close approaches === Hathor has an Earth Minimum orbit intersection distance , which corresponds to 2.7 lunar distances (LD). When it was discovered in 1976, Hathor had one of its closest approaches to Earth at . On 21 October 2014, when it passed Earth at 0.048 AU, or 18.8 LD, it was observed 22 times by the Goldstone Deep Space Network using radar astronomy over a period of 21 days from 10 to 31 October. It will pass Earth again at on 21 October 2069. == Physical characteristics == In the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy, Hathor has a CSU and Sq spectral type, respectively. === Diameter and albedo === In the 1990s, Dutch‚ÄìAmerican astronomer Tom Gehrels estimated Hathors diameter to measure approximately 300 meters, assuming an albedo of 0.15. During its close approach to Earth in October 2014, a team of astronomer published a revised estimate of meters for its diameter. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts this diameter and derives an albedo of 0.3331 with an absolute magnitude of 20.2. === Rotation period === In November 2014, American astronomer Brian Warner obtained a rotational lightcurve of Hathor from photometric observations taken at the Palmer Divide Station in Colorado (also see ). Light-curve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 3.350 hours with a brightness variation of 0.11 magnitude (). == Naming == In accordance with the custom to name all members of the Aten group after Ancient Egyptian deities, this minor planet is named for Hathor, sky-goddess and daughter of Ra, who personified the principles of joy, feminine love, and motherhood. The Ancient Greeks sometimes identified Hathor with the goddess Aphrodite. Naming was proposed by Eleanor Helin who also participated in the 1981-recovery. The minor planet 161 Athor is also named for Hathor.

In response to a 1926 article in the periodical Berhanena Salam by Gebre Haywat Baykadagna, where Gebre Haywat unfavorably compared independent Ethiopia to the Italian colony of Eritrea, Tekle wrote that many Eritreans lamented their life under Italian rule: \\"in his characteristic allegorical style\\", states historian Bahru Zewde, a colonial subject \\"is like a bird kept in a cage in pomp and luxury in order to have its plumes plucked.\\"Bahru, Pioneers, p. 106 Tekle Wolde Hawaryat's break with Haile Selassie came when the Emperor decided to leave Ethiopia, when Ethiopia had clearly lost to Italy, in order to personally address the League of Nations. Following the Ethiopian defeat at Maychew, Tekle decided to remain in Ethiopia and continue resistance to the Italians. At one point in the conversations on 1 May 1936, when the Emperor pondered taking the unprecedented act of leaving Ethiopia, Tekle marched up to the Emperor with a pistol barrel in his mouth and addressed Haile Selassie, \\"Are you not the son of Theodore?\\"‚Äîreferring to Tewodros' act of committing suicide at the moment of utter defeat, rather than resort to flight or surrender.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 134 After Haile Selassie departed Addis Ababa, Tekle gathered his own partisans and left to continue fighting. Within a few months, he joined the garrison at Jimma, and retreated with them to Ras Imru Haile Selassie's encampment in the wilderness between Jimma and Gore. When Ras Imru rejected Tekle's proposals for a campaign of guerrilla war against the invaders, he departed to go his own way.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 167 Tekle attempted to unite the fractious bands of the arbegnoch, the Ethiopian resistance fighters, but met little success.

Although the meeting ended inconclusively, and the Emperor and his followers were relieved when Tekle Wolde Hawaryat went to Kenya to find supporters to his views, Haile Selassie did consider some of Tekle's points and began to press the British to help him form an Ethiopian army of liberation.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, pp. 231ff After Haile Selassie convinced the British to aid his return to Ethiopian soil, Tekle \\"did all he could to prevent him from regaining his throne. When British arms supported the return, Takkala dedicated the rest of his life to trying to dethrone Hayla-Selassie.\\" At first Tekle was imprisoned (1942‚Äì1945), then released and the Emperor made an attempt to placate his former friend by making him afenegus; caught in another plot against the Emperor, he was imprisoned for a longer period, until 1954.

It based on the generalized linear model with the design matrix written as a Kronecker product. == Overview == The generalized linear array model or GLAM was introduced in 2006. Such models provide a structure and a computational procedure for fitting generalized linear models or GLMs whose model matrix can be written as a Kronecker product and whose data can be written as an array. In a large GLM, the GLAM approach gives very substantial savings in both storage and computational time over the usual GLM algorithm. Suppose that the data \\\\mathbf Y is arranged in a d-dimensional array with size n_1\\\\times n_2\\\\times\\\\ldots\\\\times n_d; thus, the corresponding data vector \\\\mathbf y = \\\\textbf{vec}(\\\\mathbf Y) has size n_1n_2n_3\\\\cdots n_d. Suppose also that the design matrix is of the form :\\\\mathbf X = \\\\mathbf X_d\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf X_{d-1}\\\\otimes\\\\ldots\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf X_1. The standard analysis of a GLM with data vector \\\\mathbf y and design matrix \\\\mathbf X proceeds by repeated evaluation of the scoring algorithm : \\\\mathbf X'\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf W}_\\\\delta\\\\mathbf X\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta} = \\\\mathbf X'\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf W}_\\\\delta\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf z} , where \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta} represents the approximate solution of \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta, and \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta} is the improved value of it; \\\\mathbf W_\\\\delta is the diagonal weight matrix with elements : w_{ii}^{-1} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta_i}{\\\\partial\\\\mu_i}\\\\right)^2\\\\text{var}(y_i), and :\\\\mathbf z = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\eta + \\\\mathbf W_\\\\delta^{-1}(\\\\mathbf y - \\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu) is the working variable. Computationally, GLAM provides array algorithms to calculate the linear predictor, : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\eta = \\\\mathbf X \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta and the weighted inner product : \\\\mathbf X'\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf W}_\\\\delta\\\\mathbf X without evaluation of the model matrix \\\\mathbf X . ===Example=== In 2 dimensions, let \\\\mathbf X = \\\\mathbf X_2\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf X_1, then the linear predictor is written \\\\mathbf X_1 \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Theta \\\\mathbf X_2' where \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Theta is the matrix of coefficients; the weighted inner product is obtained from G(\\\\mathbf X_1)' \\\\mathbf W G(\\\\mathbf X_2) and \\\\mathbf W is the matrix of weights; here G(\\\\mathbf M) is the row tensor function of the r \\\\times c matrix \\\\mathbf M given by :G(\\\\mathbf M) = (\\\\mathbf M \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf 1') \\\\circ (\\\\mathbf 1' \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf M) where \\\\circ means element by element multiplication and \\\\mathbf 1 is a vector of 1's of length c. On the other hand, the row tensor function G(\\\\mathbf M) of the r \\\\times c matrix \\\\mathbf M is the example of Face-splitting product of matrices, which was proposed by Vadym Slyusar in 1996: : \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{M} = (\\\\mathbf {M} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf {1}^\\\\textsf{T}) \\\\circ (\\\\mathbf {1}^\\\\textsf{T} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf {M}), where \\\\bull means Face-splitting product. These low storage high speed formulae extend to d-dimensions. ==Applications== GLAM is designed to be used in d-dimensional smoothing problems where the data are arranged in an array and the smoothing matrix is constructed as a Kronecker product of d one- dimensional smoothing matrices. ==References== Category:Regression models Array model ","title":"Generalized linear array model"},{"id":"7786897","text":"A drifter drill or drifter is a hydraulic or pneumatic rock or ground drill used to make horizontal holes in tunnel construction and mining. It is mounted on a feed, which is like a rail that the drill travels on or drifts. This kind of drilling procedure is also called drifting. The feed is usually attached with a flexible boom (like an arm) to a stationary or mobile unit that contains the powerpack (engine and hydraulic pump or compressor). Drifters are used in mining, construction, exploration, and natural science. It usually consists of a percussive system and a rotative system. The percussive system strikes the drill steel, for example 2000-5000 strikes per minute, whereas the number of rotations can be, for example, 100-400 per minute. The combination of these functions enables drilling holes into rock. The excess material (cuttings) is pushed up from the bottom of the hole by means of pressurized air or water. Drifter drills can be top-hammer drills (usually hydraulic) or down-the-hole drills (usually pneumatic). ==Early rock drills== In 1849, J. J. Couch, an American inventor from Philadelphia, received the first patent for a rock drill. It featured a drill rod which passed through a hollow piston and was thrown against the rock.

Born in Longueuil, Quebec, he joined the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1878, becoming president of that organization in 1924 and holding the position until 1929. == Aird Commission == A number of problems had arisen during 1920s, causing debates on how broadcasting should be managed. These problems included the feeling that religious radio stations had \\"...emerged as a new weapon with which one religious group could bludgeon another...\\", and that U.S. stations unfairly dominated the airwaves despite an agreements to reserve some frequencies exclusively for Canadian stations. These led the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King to establish a Royal Commission on the subject of broadcasting. Aird was appointed head of the three-man commission which also included Augustin Frigon, an electrical engineer, and Charles Bowman, editor of the Ottawa Citizen. In 1929 the Aird Commission delivered its nine-page Report of the Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting to Parliament. Included in the report was the recommendation that broadcasting in Canada should benefit the people of the country. To this end, the report recommended a publicly owned system funded in part by a $3 annual licence fee, in essence the blueprint for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Unfortunately, the stock market crashed a scant six weeks after the report was issued, making government support for public broadcasting problematic. Eventually, however, under the government of R. B. Bennett, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was formed in 1932 under the chairmanship of Hector Charlesworth, a journalist and music critic from Saturday Night magazine.

He began wrestling when he was five years old. He also played high school football in Columbia, Missouri, but did not start at a position on the team. Imes was 5'9\\" and weighed 165 lbs when he graduated before attending the University of Missouri. Within the next two years, Imes stood at 6'7\\", weighed 290 lbs, and walked on to the school's football team as a sophomore before earning a scholarship as an offensive tackle and lettering in his senior season. After college, Imes played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League for two seasons and was a strength coach for TCU. Imes later moved to Sacramento, California, where he worked as the general manager of a landscaping supply store before being laid off, and then began pursuing mixed martial arts. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Imes made his professional debut in 2004 for the WEC and won his first three fights before being invited to compete on The Ultimate Fighter 2. ===The Ultimate Fighter 2=== Imes was the last pick for his division, and was coached by his training partner and then-UFC Middleweight Champion, Rich Franklin. In his first fight in the house, Imes defeated Rob MacDonald via triangle choke submission in the first round. In the semi-finals, Imes faced Seth Petruzelli and won via split decision.

Isola dei Pescatori (meaning Fishermen's Island) is an island in Lake Maggiore in northern Italy. As the most northerly of the three principal Borromean Islands it is also known as Isola Superiore and, with a population of 25 in 2018, it is the only one to be inhabited all year round. Unlike Isola Bella and Isola Madre, the island has never belonged to the Borromeo family. ==Description== The island is about 375 metres long by 100 metres wide. A narrow street running along its spine is joined by cobbled alleys to the promenade that encircles the island. The promenade is frequently flooded and the houses built against it are constructed to allow for this. In 1971, the population of the island was 208, but has steadily declined to 25 in 2018. While the traditional occupation of fishing still exists‚Äîlocal restaurants providing a ready market for the fish‚Äîtourism has become central to the economic life of the island as its picturesque charms have made Isola dei Pescatori a popular destination, particularly for day-trippers, but also for more extended visits. In addition to the hotels, restaurants and gift-shops, there are boutiques selling craft products, holiday homes, and a small fishing museum in the old elementary school .

The report released its findings in 1929 when it concluded that Canada was in need of a publicly funded radio broadcast system and a governing regulator for all broadcasting throughout the country. The Aird Report eventually resulted in the 1932 creation of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, the forerunner of the CBC as well as the CRTC. ==History== From 1922-1932, the radio administration came under the Department of Marine and Fisheries. With only dozens of radio stations broadcasting within Canada, and few Canadian households owning radios, the Radio Broadcasting industry was not a top agenda issue for the Federal Government in the 1920s. However, a series of controversial and ungoverned attacks over the airwaves, directed namely at the Catholic Church and Canadian Government, led it to be a matter of public and political importance. This led to debates on how broadcasting should be managed. These problems included the feeling that religious radio stations had \\"...emerged as a new weapon with which one religious group could bludgeon another...\\", and that U.S. stations unfairly dominated the airwaves despite an agreements to reserve some frequencies exclusively for Canadian stations.\\"Canada Radio Fans Fight Interference.\\" Tampa (FL) Tribune, January 16, 1927, p. 12D. ==The Commissioners== In December 1928, under the direction of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, P.J. Arthur (Minister of Marine and Fisheries) formed the Aird Commission to report on federal broadcasting policy. Sir John Aird and his colleagues Charles A. Bowman, Esq. (Editor of the Ottawa Citizen), Augustin Frigon, D.Sc. (Director of √âcole Polytechnique in Montreal), and Donald Manson, Esq., (Chief Inspector of Radio, Department of Marine and Fisheries) set out to examine how radio broadcasting is done abroad and how it could be improved on home soil. Between April 17 and July 24, the commission heard 164 oral statements, took 124 written submissions, and had the comments of nine provinces and controlled conventions. Travelling across Europe and the United States, the commission made several observations regarding the inner workings of radio stations and their ownership. It was noted that some of the best broadcasting was done in Germany and the United Kingdom, where they both made use of a public broadcaster. What they also observed was a dependence on advertising revenue in many radio markets. This dependence led the commission to come to the conclusion that when it came to matters of public importance, Canadians should have access to uninterrupted public broadcasting, free of solicitation. The latter notion was at times abandoned in hopes to stimulate Canadian businesses during the Great Depression. ‚ÄúWe believe that private enterprise is to be commended for its effort to provide entertainment for the benefit of the public with no direct return of revenue. This lack of revenue has, however, tended more and more to force too much advertising upon the listener. It also would appear to result in the crowding of stations into urban centres and the consequent duplication of services in such places, leaving other large populated areas ineffectively served.‚Äù -John Aird, Report of the Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting, 1929 Without regulation, the commissioners feared that American radio stations would take over Canada. At this time, the United States was facing issues at their southern border with several ‚ÄúBorder Blaster‚Äù signals taking listenership away from domestic stations. The Commission sought to protect Canada from such activity. There were some disagreements amongst Commissioners regarding who should control this new proposed public broadcaster. This debate continued until 1932, when the J.C.P.C. ultimately decided that this was a federal matter. Based on the report, a national company, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, was set up that would have power to operate and own all radio stations in Canada. Further control was given to the provinces to broadcast the content they want but within the provincial boundaries. ==Demise and Legacy== After the Liberal government (who initially put together this Commission) had fallen in the Election of 1930, the Aird Report fell into the hands of the new Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. This eventually led to the passing of the Radio Broadcasting Act (1932). This created the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, predecessor to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as well as the Canadian Radio-Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). This early CRBC was meant to serve as a free public broadcaster, under federal control for purposes of education and entertainment. The CRBC also served as the regulatory governing body for all private radio stations. Bennett‚Äôs Radio Broadcasting Act had proposed an eventual takeover of all private radio stations by the federal government, something which to this day has never materialized. At this time, one-third of Canadians owned a home radio receiver. There was a mandatory annual licensing fee for radio owners. Although it wasn‚Äôt free, it was considered an affordable means of entertainment for country suffering through the Great Depression. The set top taxes were not enough for the CRBC to survive off of alone, so there were allotted advertising slots for Canadian businesses. This was dually useful as the crippled Canadian economy would benefit from the business generated. After some very controversial and partisan programming, the CRBC became a target from the liberal government who had just come back to power with Mackenzie King's most recent re-election in 1935. With 2 formal investigations in the mid-1930s from special Parliamentary Committees, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was disbanded. The broadcasting element of the CRBC was succeeded by what we know today as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936. The regulatory element of the CRBC and later the CBC eventually evolved into the Board of Broadcast Governors (BBG), and then into the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). ==References== * * Gasher, Skinner and Lorimer, Mass Communication in Canada. 7th ed.

Directed by Adrian Shergold, the film was first broadcast by ITV on 26 September 2004. It was written by Jeff Pope and Ian Puleston-Davies, who suffers from OCD himself. In addition to Michael Sheen, the cast features Shirley Henderson, Anastasia Griffith, Adrian Bower and Claudie Blakley. Sheen's performance was recognised with a Best Actor nomination at the 2005 British Academy Television Awards and both he and Henderson were nominees for 2005 Royal Television Society Awards. Dirty Filthy Love won the Best Single Drama category at the RTS Awards. It was released on DVD in the United States in 2005 by Hart Sharp Video in association with The Sundance Channel. == Plot == Mark Furness (Sheen), once a successful architect, finds it increasingly difficult to control his \\"bad habits\\", such as climbing stairs in a strange sequence, swearing involuntarily and washing himself compulsively. His wife, Stevie (Griffith) asks him to leave their home, so he seeks solace with his best friends Nathan (Bower) and Kathy (Blakley), who take him under their wing. His life gets even worse when, at a meeting with his employers, he finds himself swearing uncontrollably and loses his job. Accepting that he is unwell, Mark visits a doctor, already convinced he is suffering from a brain tumour or meningitis. In the doctor's waiting room, another patient, Charlotte (Henderson), recognises Mark's \\"habits\\" as symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome, and invites him to a local self-help group she runs. Mark finds it comforting that others share his disorder and with Charlotte's help, hopes to face his problems and win his wife back. Mark tries to beat his disease and begins to make some progress despite the news that his wife is petitioning him for divorce. While meeting her to discuss terms - after covering himself in chocolate powder to combat his obsessive cleanliness - Mark and Stevie have sex. Mark interprets this as a sign that they will be reunited, but Charlotte warns it is nothing but \\"sympathy sex\\", leading to an argument between the friends. Mark storms off, but realises Charlotte was right when he sees Stevie with another man in their marital house. This plunges Mark into depression. His disorders deteriorate and, cutting contact with his friends completely, he moves into a rundown bedsit. His situation gets worse still when (now with unkempt hair, matted beard and shabby clothes) he begins to stalk Stevie, convinced she has begun a relationship with another man. Almost unrecognisable, he even attacks his friend Nathan on the street thinking that Stevie is having an affair with him. Nathan tells Mark that Stevie wants Mark to stop phoning and stalking her otherwise she'll call the police on him. At his lowest point, Charlotte re-enters his life and helps clean up his new home and his appearance. Charlotte then suggests they go for a drive to the seaside and Mark has her drive to the beach where Stevie's parents live in an attempt to try and find Stevie and the man she's seeing. But Charlotte scolds Mark insisting that Stevie is nothing but an \\"obsession\\" and that he has to move on. Mark Shows Charlotte a piece of architecture he admires and she reveals her talent for playing violin. The two share a kiss but Mark runs back to Stevie's parents home, upsetting Charlotte. Despite being turned out, Mark sneaks into the back garden where a party is going on. Seeing Stevie with her new partner (Gareth) he head-butts Gareth into the pool. Steve yells at Mark causing him to collapse in a state on the floor. Charlotte arrives to try and talk sense to Stevie who just ignores Charlotte's explanations. Charlotte slaps Stevie for her cruelty, in retaliation Stevie pulls Charlotte's long hair which is really a wig worn to disguise her hair loss from trichotillomania, she runs off in tears. Mark, finally seeing sense takes back the wig and Stevie tells him that the day they had sex, she only wanted things to go back to normal and have \\"Her Mark\\" back. Mark declares that he had always had OCD and will ways will and bids Stevie farewell. He finds a tearful Charlotte on the beach and recognizing her true worth, they begin a romantic relationship themselves. == External links == * Category:2004 television films Category:2004 films Category:British television films Category:British films Category:ITV television dramas Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Works about Tourette syndrome Category:Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder in fiction Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:English-language television shows Category:Films directed by Adrian Shergold ","title":"Dirty Filthy Love"},{"id":"7787295","text":"This is an international list of osteopathic schools, universities and colleges that award a recognized osteopathic qualification.

Ma Yau Tong Au () is a specific name for the mountain pass in the area. ==Geography== The land is relatively flat on the saddle between Tai Sheung Tok (Â§ß‰∏äÊâò), Mau Wu Shan (ËåÖÊπñÂ±±) and Black Hill (‰∫îÊ°ÇÂ±±). Ma Yau Tong is suitable for farming with rivers flowing towards the valleys east and west. The landform of the valley west of Ma Yau Tong was greatly changed by the construction of the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel. ==History== As Ma Yau Tong is on the ridge of Kowloon, it has been on the defense line against Japanese invasion during World War II. The defense line was known as Ma Lau Tong Line. ==Transport== In the past, it was reachable on foot. When the British took over New Territories from Qing in 1899, their army built Anderson Road connecting Custom Hill and Devil's Peak along the mountain range, passing through Ma Yau Tong. The section north of Mau Yau Tong became a regular road and a short section south became Ma Yau Tong Road. In 1955, a new road Po Lam Road was built to serve the refugees of Kuomintang in Rennie's Mill. The road began at the settlement and ends in Anderson Road at Ma Yau Tong. When the Tseung Kwan O New Town began to develop in 1980s, the road was improved by Hong Kong Government and extended to Sau Mau Ping. Another road, Tsui Lam Road, was built to connect a new public housing area in Po Lam of the new town.

Her husband was Carlos Diegues, director and writer of Bye Bye Brasil.IMDB Le√£o was born in Vit√≥ria, Esp√≠rito Santo. When she was twelve, her father gave her a guitar since he was worried about her being shy. Popular musician and composer Patricio Teixeira and classical guitarist Solon Ayala were her teachers. As a teenager in the late 1950s, she became friends with a number of singers and composers who took part in Bossa Nova's musical revolution, including Roberto Menescal, Carlos Lyra, Ronaldo B√¥scoli, Jo√£o Gilberto, Vinicius de Moraes and Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. In fact, it was in her apartment in her parents' home in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro that the new music was born in 1958. By 1963, after singing as an amateur for a few years, she became a professional and toured with S√©rgio Mendes. In the mid-1960s, the institution of military dictatorship in Brazil led her to sing increasingly political lyrics. Her show, Opini√£o, reflected her political beliefs, and she had largely switched to political music by this point. In 1964 she even spoke against bossa nova as a movement, calling it \\"alienating.\\"[ All Music] In 1968 she appeared on the album Tropic√°lia: ou Panis et Circenses, performing \\"Lindon√©ia.\\" She later left Brazil for Paris and in the 1970s abandoned music to focus on her family. She returned to music later, and when she discovered in 1979 that she had an inoperable brain tumor, she increased her productivity as much as possible. She died in 1989. She was known as \\"the muse of bossa nova.\\" Nara's sister is Danuza Le√£o, a former model and socialite who's a newspaper columnist and occasional TV commentator. ==Discography== * 1997: I love you Solon V.

Later he became rabbi of Ia»ôi, Moldavia, and afterward, according to Jacob Aboab, he returned to Italy. He died, according to Leopold Zunz (Kalender, 5623, p. 18), at Ungarisch-Brod, Moravia, on 14 July 1663. Jacob Aboab, however, in a letter to Unger (Wolf, Bibl. Hebr. iii., No. 1728), gives Pieve di Sacco, Italy, as the place of Hannover's death, without indicating the date. The place of his birth is equally uncertain. According to Graziadio Nepi-Mordecai Ghirondi, (Toledot Gedole Yisrael, p. 270) he was born at Krak√≥w, but Steinschneider claims that \\"Nathan Hannover\\" and \\"Nathan of Krak√≥w\\" were two different individuals. == Yeven Mezulah == Hannover is chiefly known for his work entitled Yeven Mezulah (Venice, 1653), which describes the course of the Khmelnytsky Uprising in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth from a Jewish perspective. Hannover in this work gives a brief description of the Polish Crown of the time and of the relations between the Poles, Jews and Cossacks, and the causes which led to the uprising. He also gives a very vivid picture of Jewish life in Poland and the yeshivot. This work, owing to its literary value, was translated into Yiddish (1687), into German (1720), and into French by Daniel Levy (published by Benjamin II, Tlem√ßen, 1855). This last translation was revised by the historian J. Lelewel, and served as a basis for Meyer Kayserling's German translation (also published by Benjamin II, Hanover, 1863). Kostomarov, utilizing Salomon Mandelkern's Russian translation, gives many extracts from it in his Bogdan Chmielnicki (iii. 283-306). In the late 20th century some historians disputed the numbers given Yeven Mezulah. They claim it overstates of Jewish casualties during the Bohdan Khmelnytsky rebellion in 1648 and 1649. These authors tend to question it as a reliable historical source in spite of its literary qualities. Yeven Mezulah was criticized in particular by Shaul Stampfer, Edward Fram, Paul Robert Magocsi's \\"Ukraine: A History\\", and Petro Mirchuk.Stampfer, Shaul. \\"What Actually Happened to the Jews of Ukraine in 1648?\\" Jewish History 17, no. 2 (2003): 207‚Äì27.Fram, Edward. \\"Creating a Tale of Martyrdom in Tulczyn, 1648.\\" Jewish History and Jewish Memory, 1998.Mirchuk, Petro. \\"My Meetings and Discussions in Israel: Ukrainian-Jewish Relations throughout the Ages.\\" Accessed March 21, 2014. http://exlibris.org.ua/mirchuk/r08.html. However others autors regard it as a reliable historical account. == Other works == Hannover's other works are: * ·π¨a'ame Sukkah, a homiletic explanation of the Feast of Tabernacles (Amsterdam, 1652) * Safah Berurah, a dictionary of the Hebrew, German, Italian, and Latin languages, and arranged in Hebrew alphabetical order (Prague, 1660) ‚Äì in a second edition, by Jacob Koppel ben Wolf (Amsterdam, 1701), French was included * Sha'are ·∫íiyyon, a collection of mystical prayers, religious customs, and ascetic reflections; it was taken chiefly from cabalistic works, and was very popular among the Eastern Jews.

The Emperor commuted the sentence to one year's imprisonment and banishment. De Bonneval then offered his services to the Turkish government, and was appointed to organize and command the Turkish artillery, eventually contributing to the Austrian defeat in the Austrian- Ottoman war. In the autumn of 1724 Prince Eugene resigned his governorship of the Netherlands, which caused Pri√© to lose his only support. The Emperor intervened and relieved Pri√© of his duties.

He reigned his state from 943 until his death. During Li Jing's earlier reign, he expanded Southern Tang's borders by extinguishing smaller neighboring states: Min in 945 and Chu in 951. However, the warfare also exhausted the wealth of the country, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the Later Zhou invasion in 956. Forced to cede all prefectures north of the Yangtze River, he also had to relinquish his title as an emperor and accept Later Zhou's overlordship in 958, and later Song Dynasty's overlordship after 960 when Song succeeded Later Zhou. == Background == Li Jing, then named Xu Jingtong, was born in 916. His father Xu Zhigao was then Wu's prefect of Sheng Prefecture (ÊòáÂ∑û, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), under his adoptive father (Xu Jingtong's grandfather) Xu Wen, who was then Wu's regent.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. He was Xu Zhigao's oldest son.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 16. His mother was Xu Zhigao's second wife Song Fujin,Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 18. who would later give birth to three more sons, Xu Jingqian, Xu Jingsui, and Xu Jingda.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 19. == During Wu == In 923, by which time Xu Zhigao was the junior regent under Xu Wen, there was an incident where the general Zhong Taizhang (), who had assisted in Xu Wen's coming to power, was under investigation for corruption. Xu Zhigao advocated punishing Zhong, but Xu Wen, pointing out Zhong's contributions, declined, and instead ordered Xu Zhigao to take one of Zhong's daughters as wife for Xu Jingtong, although it is not clear whether the marriage took place that year or later.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. In 925, Xu Jingtong, then age nine, was given the office of Jiabu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu). He later was given the title of an imperial guard general. In 930, by which point Xu Zhigao had succeeded Xu Wen as regent, Xu Zhigao planned to leave the Wu capital Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and take up his headquarters at Jinling (i.e., the former Sheng Prefecture), he started the preparations of leaving Xu Jingtong at Jiangdu as junior regent by having him given the titles of minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu) and acting chancellor (ÂèÉÊîø‰∫ã, Can Zhengshi). In 931, when Xu Zhigao's chief advisor Song Qiqiu suddenly claimed to want to retire, it was Xu Jingtong that Xu Zhigao sent to Song's retirement mansion to urge Song to return to the government. Later in the year, Xu Zhigao left Jiangdu and took up headquarters at Jinling, leaving Xu Jingtong at Jiangdu to oversee the government, assisted by Song and Wang Lingmou. Xu Jingtong received the titles of Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies), chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi), and acting director of military matters (Áü•‰∏≠Â§ñÂ∑¶Âè≥Ë´∏Ëªç‰∫ã, Zhi Zhongwai Zuoyou Zhujunshi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In late 934, Xu Zhigao summoned Xu Jingtong from Jiangdu to Jinling, to serve as his deputy at Jinling, with the titles of deputy military governor of Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and Ningguo (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) Circuits, deputy commander of the armies of all circuits (Ë´∏ÈÅìÂâØÈÉΩÁµ±, Zhudao Fu Dutong), and acting overseer of military matters (Âà§‰∏≠Â§ñË´∏Ëªç‰∫ã, Pan Zhongwai Zhujunshi). His younger brother Xu Jingqian was made junior regent at Jiangdu in his place.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In late 935, as part of the prelude of taking over the Wu throne, Xu Zhigao had Wu's emperor Yang Pu bestow on him the titles of Prince of Qi and Generalissimo (Â§ßÂÖÉÂ∏•, Da Yuanshuai). In early 936, as he began to create a Generalissimo headquarters with six ministries, he made Xu Jingtong the deputy generalissimo and Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 937, he created Xu Jingtong the crown prince of the Principality of Qi, but Xu Jingtong declined.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. == During Li Bian's reign as emperor == In winter 937, Xu Zhigao had Yang Pu yield the throne to him, ending Wu, and starting a new state later known as Southern Tang (although it was likely known as Qi at this point).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 15. Sometimes around the transition, Xu Jingtong was apparently given the titles of commander of all circuits (Ë´∏ÈÅìÈÉΩÁµ±, Zhudao Dutong) and acting generalissimo, and shortly after the transition, he was given the titles of deputy generalissimo, overseer of the imperial guards, Taiwei, Shangshu Ling (), and Prince of Wu. Shortly after, his name was changed from Jingtong to Jing. In 938, his princely title was changed to Prince of Qi. In 939, Xu Zhigao changed his surname from the adoptive Xu to the birth Li and took a new personal name of BianZizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. (and likely changed the name of the state to Tang at that point). Xu Jing, and the rest of the imperial family (other than the lines from Xu Wen's biological sons) changed their names to Li at that time as well. Li Bian decreed that all the matters of state be submitted to Li Jing for decision, except that he himself would still oversee military matters. Later in the year, Li Bian wanted to create him to be the crown prince, but he declined, and so Li Bian gave him a number of additional titles‚ÄîGeneralissimo, acting commander of the imperial guards, acting Taiwei, director of the executive bureau of government (ÈåÑÂ∞öÊõ∏‰∫ã, Lu Shangshu Shi), and grand prefect of Sheng and Yang Prefectures (i.e., Jinling and Jiangdu). In fall 940, Li Bian created him crown prince, while having him continue to retain the titles of Generalissimo and Lu Shangshu Shi, but he again declined, and so Li Bian allowed him to but ordered that the entire realm honor him as if he were crown prince. In late 940, there was an occasion when the fortuneteller Sun Zhiyong () claimed, due to planet alignments, that Li Bian should visit Jiangdu. Li Bian agreed, and left Li Jing in charge of the state as regent at Jinling, while he headed for Jiangdu. He considered taking up residence there for some time, but because supplying Jiangdu at that time was difficult due to freezing conditions, he soon thereafter returned to Jinling. In 942, when Song Qiqiu complained that he was not given sufficient authority, Li Bian put Song in charge of overseeing the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), while having Li Jing's younger brother Li Jingsui oversee the two other bureaus of government‚Äîthe legislative (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and examination (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), with Li Jing in charge of reviewing Song's and Li Jingsui's decisions. (However, this arrangement did not last long, as, later in the year, Song's associate Xia Changtu () was accused of corruption, but Song refused to execute him. Li Bian, in anger, directly ordered Xia's execution, and after this incident, Song requested retirement and was allowed to retire.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. In any case, though, over the years, Song had often praised the abilities of Li Jing's younger brother Li Jingda, whom Li Bian himself considered resolute and magnanimous and therefore considered making his heir. While it did not actually occur, as Li Jing was older, Li Jing was resentful to Song for making the suggestion. Once, however, when Li Bian visited Li Jing's palace, he happened to see Li Jing playing instruments‚Äîwhich Li Bian considered frivolous, and therefore rebuked Li Jing for several straight days. Li Bian's favorite concubine Consort Zhong, who had given birth to Li Bian's youngest son Li Jingti (), took this opportunity to try to persuade Li Bian to divert succession from Li Jing to Li Jingti‚Äîwhich, however, angered Li Bian, who stated, \\"When a son has faults, the father rebukes him. This is normal. How can a woman interfere with important matters of state?\\" He sent her away and gave her in marriage to someone else. Meanwhile, Li Jing's staff members Chen Jue and Feng Yanji were in alliance with Song and finding ways to expel people who were not cooperating with them. Both Chang Mengxi () and Xiao Yan () submitted petitions to Li Bian accusing Chen of abuse of power, and it was said that while Li Bian understood some of the accusations to be true, he did not get a chance to act on them, before he fell deathly ill in spring 943 from poisoning due to pills given him by alchemists. On March 30, he summoned Li Jing to his deathbed, and, after entrusting the state to him, died. Li Jing did not immediately announce his death, but instead issued an edict in his name naming Li Jing regent and announcing a general pardon. Meanwhile, the official Sun Sheng, trying to stop the influence by Chen and the others on the incoming emperor, considered trying to announce that Li Bian's will named Empress Song regent for Li Jing, but when the official Li Yiye () pointed out that Li Bian often spoke against women's influence on governments and stated that he would publicly tear up the will if it were announced, Sun relented. Shortly after, Li Jing announced Li Bian's death, and then took the throne. == Reign == === Early reign === Upon taking the throne, Li Jing honored his mother Empress Song as empress dowager, and created his wife Princess Zhong empress. As he considered Song Qiqiu and Zhou Zong to be the most respected senior officials of the land, he made them his leading chancellors (as Zhongshu Ling () and Shizhong (), respectively), but decided the main decisions himself. He gave greater princely titles to his brothers Li Jingsui (from Prince of Shou to Prince of Yan) and Li Jingda (from Prince of Xuancheng to Prince of E). It was said after he took the throne, he entrusted much responsibility to Chen Jue, and a group of his associates thus emerged from this association‚ÄîChen, Feng Yanji, Feng Yanji's brother Feng Yanlu (), Wei Cen (), and Cha Wenhui ()‚Äîwho became influential at his court, influencing him to benefit themselves, such that they became known as the \\"Five Ghosts.\\" However, soon thereafter, when Chen left governmental service for some time to observe a mourning period for his mother, the alliance fractured, as Wei took the opportunity to defame Chen. With Chen gone, and with Li Jing unhappy with Song Qiqiu's repeated attempt to defame Zhou, Li Jing sent Song outside Jinling to serve as the military governor of Zhenhai, and then, when Song submitted a retirement request in anger, approved it. Later in the year, believing that it was Li Bian's wish that he pass the throne to his brothers eventually, Li Jing made Li Jingsui Generalissimo and Prince of Qi, and had him move into the eastern palace‚Äîi.e., the palace of the Crown Prince‚Äîand created Li Jingda the Prince of Yan. He publicly declared that he intended to pass the throne to the two of them, in order, despite their attempts to decline their greater titles. Li Jingsui thereafter took, as his courtesy name, \\"Tuishen\\" (ÈÄÄË∫´, \\"withdrawing body\\"), to show that he had no intent to occupy the position. Li Jing also created his oldest son Li Hongji the Prince of Nanchang, and youngest brother Li Jingti the Prince of Baoning. It was said that because Empress Dowager Song resented Consort Zhong for attempt to try to displace Li Jing with Li Jingti, she considered killing Li Jingti, but Li Jingti survived with Li Jing's protection. In winter 943, with the agrarian rebel leader Zhang Yuxian‚Äîwho had earlier plagued Southern Tang's southern neighbor Southern Han‚Äînow inside his realm, Li Jing sent the officer Yan En () to attack Zhang, with the official Bian Hao serving as Yan's army monitor. Bian, using one Bai Changyu () as his chief strategist, attacked Zhang and defeated him. Zhang was then arrested and surrendered by his own subordinate Li Tai (), and was taken to Jinling and executed there. In spring 944, Feng Yanji, Wei, and Cha were trying to monopolize access to the emperor, and they took advance of Li Jing's desire to pass the throne to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda to persuade him to issue an edict that stated, \\"Li Jingsui the Prince of Qi should oversee all matters. Among the officials, only the deputy chiefs of staff Wei Cen and Cha Wenhui may come to us to present matters; otherwise, they can only see us by our summons.\\" This greatly shocked the state, and Xiao Yan's petition to reverse this decision was ignored. However, the imperial guard commander Jia Chong () went to the palace door and knelt, requesting an audience, and when Li Jing saw him, pointed out that this was ill-advised and would cut off the rest of the government from him, causing Li Jing to withdraw this policy. Later in the year, with Southern Tang's southeastern neighbor Min embroiled in a civil war between its emperor Wang Xi and Wang Xi's brother Wang Yanzheng, who had declared himself emperor of a new state of Yin, Li Jing sent them letters, rebuking them for a fraternal civil war and urging them to make peace. Neither listened: Wang Xi wrote back and invoked the precedents of the Duke of Zhou executing his rebellious brothers Lord Guan and Lord Cai, and Emperor Taizong of Tang killing his brothers Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, while Wang Yanzheng wrote back and rebuked Li Jing (and his father Li Bian) for usurping the Wu throne. In anger, Li Jing cut off diplomatic relations with Yin. In summer 944, after Wang Xi was assassinated by his general Zhu Wenjin, who then claimed the Min throne, Zhu sent emissaries to Southern Tang, hoping to establish relations. Li Jing arrested Zhu's emissaries and considered attacking him, but as there were hot weather and plagues at the time, Southern Tang did not actually attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In late 944, Cha made a proposal to attack Yin's capital Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), and, despite much opposition, Li sent him to oversee the borders with Yin to see if such a plan were feasible. When Cha reached Xin Prefecture (‰ø°Â∑û, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), near the Yin border, he submitted a report indicating his belief that an attack would be successful. Li thereafter sent Bian to command an army to rendezvous with Cha. However, their initial attacks were unsuccessful. The Yin general Wu Chengyi (), who was then attacking the Min capital Changle (Èï∑Ê®Ç, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), decided to use this opportunity to falsely claim to the people of Changle that Southern Tang was aiding Yin in the military efforts against Zhu, causing much alarm in Changle. The Min official Lin Renhan () used this opportunity to rise against Zhu, first killing Zhu's confederate Lian Chongyu, and then Zhu, and then opened the city to welcome Wu in. Shortly after, Wang Yanzheng claimed the Min throne, but kept his capital at Jian rather than moving it back to Changle. Soon thereafter, the Southern Tang general Zu Quan'en (), whom Li sent to reinforce Cha, crushed the Min army commanded by Wang Yanzheng's chancellor Yang Sigong, and then put Jian under siege. In fall 945, Jian fell, and Wang Yanzheng surrendered to Southern Tang, ending Min's existence as a state. However, the pillages of the Southern Tang army of Jian disappointed the Min people, who had welcomed Southern Tang forces as liberators from the oppressive Min regime, but Li chose not to pursue charges against the officers responsible due to the great accomplishment of destroying Min.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Initially, the Min territory, after Jian's fall, pledged allegiance to Southern Tang. This included Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, i.e., Changle), which had been under the control of Li Renda, who seized control of the prefecture when Jian was under Southern Tang attack, and whom Li Jing had, in response, given him a new hame of Hongyi and adopted him into the Southern Tang imperial clan. After Jian's fall, however, Fu remained out of effective control by Southern Tang. Chen Jue, who was then Li Jing's chief of staff (Shumishi), volunteered to go to meet Li Hongyi, promising that he would be able to persuade Li Hongyi to give up his semi-independence and go to Jinling to pay homage to Li Jing. When Chen reached Fu, however, Li Hongyi took a defiant stance and treated Chen with disrespect. Chen did not dare to speak of having him come to Jinling, but, when he reached Jian Prefecture (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Nanping) on the way back to Jinling, Chen felt humiliated, and issued an order in Li Jing's name, without authorization, claiming for himself the acting authority to oversee Fu, conscripting the militia soldiers in the region to head toward Fu, and ordering Li Hongyi to report to Jinling. When Li Hongyi resisted, battles began. Li Jing was incensed by Chen's issuing of orders without authority, but by that point, Southern Tang officials became supportive of Chen's endeavor, and so Li Jing sent reinforcements. Southern Tang forces put Fu under siege, but even though the general Wang Chongwen () was in command of the entire operations, Chen, Feng Yanlu, and Wei Cen were all interfering with his authority, while the generals Wang Jianfeng () and Liu Congxiao were also resistant, causing the siege to lose focus and unable to succeed, so the siege wore on. In spring 947, Li Jing formally created Li Jingsui his crown prince. He also created Li Jingda the Prince of Qi, and Li Hongji the Prince of Yan, with Li Jingda also serving as Generalissimo and Li Hongji his deputy. As the Khitan Liao dynasty had recently destroyed Southern Tang's northern neighbor Later Jin and taken over central China, Li Jing sent emissaries to congratulate Liao's Emperor Taizong, and also, as Li Bian claimed ancestry from Tang dynasty emperors, requested permission to send soldiers to repair the tombs of the Tang emperors. The Liao emperor refused, but still sent emissaries to Southern Tang in return. At this time, a number of Later Jin officials who did not want to submit to Liao fled to Southern Tang, and the agrarian rebels north of the Huai River (which formed the border between Southern Tang and Later Jin) were also pledging allegiance to Southern Tang. The official Han Xizai suggested that Southern Tang take an aggressive military stance to contest the central Chinese territories, but as the army was occupied with sieging Fu, such a campaign could not be carried out at the time, causing Li Jing much regret.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. By late spring 947, forces from Wuyue, which Li Hongyi (who now carried the name of Li Da) had sought aid from, had arrived at Fu. The Southern Tang forces allowed the Wuyue forces to land, hoping to defeat them and then take the city. However, Wuyue forces, once they landed, attacked and defeated the Southern Tang forces, lifting the siege on Fu. Subsequently, Liu returned to his stronghold Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and forced the Southern Tang forces there to leave‚Äîthus, while he remained formally a Southern Tang subject, the modern southern Fujian region, which he controlled, was in effect semi-independent from that point on. (Thus, the only part of the former Min territory that Southern Tang had effective control of was the northwestern portion, centered around Jian Prefecture.) Li Jing, angry over the defeat, considered executing Chen and Feng Yanlu, but eventually, at the intercession of Song Qiqiu and Feng Yanji, only exiled them. When Li Jing subsequently heard that Liao abandoned the former Later Jin capital Daliang, he considered a campaign north, with the general Li Jinquan in command. However, he soon heard that the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan had entered Daliang and claimed imperial title (as founder of a new state of Later Han, and therefore, not daring to confront Liu, cancelled those plans.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. After Liu Zhiyuan's death in early 948 and succession by his son Liu Chengyou, the Later Han general Li Shouzhen rebelled at Hezhong (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and sought aid from Southern Tang. Li Jing sent Li Jinquan to attack north. Li Jinquan's army entered Later Han territory and reached Yi Prefecture (Ê≤ÇÂ∑û, in modern Linyi, Shandong), but with Hezhong being far away, across Later Han territory and with the Southern Tang soldiers having low morale, Li Jinquan soon thereafter withdrew back to Southern Tang territory. Li Jing subsequently wrote Liu Chengyou, apologizing for the incursion, asking for him to pardon Li Shouzhen, and requesting resumption of trade relations between Southern Tang and Later Han. Liu did not respond. Soon, Li Shouzhen was defeated by the Later Han general Guo Wei and committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. === Middle reign === In 950, Cha Wenhui, then the acting military governor of Yong'an Circuit (Ê∞∏ÂÆâ, headquartered at Jian Prefecture), received false reports that Wuyue had abandoned Fu Prefecture, and decided to head for Fu to take control of it. When he approached, though, he fell into an ambush set by Wuyue's acting military governor of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, headquartered at Fu), and was defeated and captured. Wuyue's king Qian Hongchu subsequently returned Cha, and, in return, Southern Tang returned a number of Wuyue officers that it had previously captured to Wuyue. (Southern Tang would not subsequently make another attempt at capturing the former Min capital.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. Meanwhile, Southern Tang's southwestern neighbor Chu had fallen into a civil war, as its then prince Ma Xiguang's older brother Ma Xi'e, upset that he was bypassed by their older brother Ma Xifan when Ma Xifan was choosing an heir, rebelled against Ma Xiguang in 949 and effectively made Wuping Circuit (Ê≠¶Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan), independent of the main Chu state. In spring 950, Ma Xi'e, after unable to get the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou, to which Chu was a vassal of, to recognize him as an independent vassal, instead pledged fealty to Li Jing. Later in the year, he captured Chu's capital Tan Prefecture (ÊΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Changsha, Hunan), executed Ma Xiguang, and claimed the princely title for himself. He continued to be Southern Tang's vassal, and sent his secretary Liu Guangfu () to pay tribute to Li. Li, in return, sent the officials Sun Sheng and Yao Feng () to Tan to formally bestow the Prince of Chu title on Ma Xi'e. However, Liu secretly informed Li that the Chu realm was not secure, and so Li stationed Bian Hao at Yuan Prefecture (Ë¢ÅÂ∑û, in modern Yichun, Jiangxi), in anticipation of a strike against Chu. Shortly after this, the Wuping officers Wang Kui and Zhou Xingfeng, upset that Ma Xi'e had driven the soldiers under them into hard labor and not properly rewarded them, escaped from Tan back to Wuping's capital Lang Prefecture () and seized it, deposing Ma Xi'e's son Ma Guangzan () as acting military governor, and replacing him, first with Ma Xi'e's nephew Ma Guanghui, but in fact having a group of officers exercise joint leadership. When Ma Xi'e reported this to Li, Li sent emissaries to Wuping with gifts, hoping that these officers would acknowledge him as overlord, but Wang and the others received the gifts and sent the emissaries back to Li without answering him. Wang and the other officers subsequently supported the general Liu Yan to be Wuping's military governor, and Liu sent an emissary requesting that Southern Tang commission him as military governor. When Li did not respond, he submitted to Later Han's successor state Later Zhou, founded and ruled by Guo Wei.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290. After taking Tan over, Ma Xi'e governed the Chu state with violence and incompetence, spending his days and nights feasting. In fall 950, a coup happened at Tan, overthrowing him. Ma Xi'e's younger brother Ma Xichong, who had been one of the conspirators against him, became the ruler of the regime. Ma Xichong exiled Ma Xi'e to Hengshan (Ë°°Â±±, in modern Hengyang, Hunan), hoping that the non-Han chieftain Peng Shigao (), who had supported Ma Xiguang previously and therefore Ma Xi'e punished, and who was in control of the Hengshan region, would kill Ma Xi'e for him, but Peng instead supported Ma Xi'e to be the leader in resisting Ma Xichong. Upon hearing of the coup, Liu Yan took his troops and headed toward Tan, and Ma Xichong was apprehensive. At Liu's demand, Ma Xichong executed a number of officers close to Ma Xi'e, but that did not stop Liu's advance. With threats from Liu and Peng, Ma Xichong's fellow conspirators considered assassinating him. In fear, Ma Xichong sent his general Fan Shoumu () to the Southern Tang court, requesting to submit his state to Southern Tang. Li sent Bian to Tan to accept the surrender, ending Chu as a state under the Ma family's rule. With the Chu realm suffering from famine due to the wars, Bian distributed the food that the Ma family had stored up, initially greatly pleasing the Chu people. Thereafter, when Ma Xi'e requested to be restored to be position of military governor of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered at Tan), the people of Tan, hating Ma Xi'e for his previous misrule, requested that Bian remain as their military governor, and Li agreed. Li subsequently continued to allow Ma Xi'e to carry the title of Prince of Chu, but moved him to Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). He gave lesser offices to Ma Xichong and the other former Chu officials, moving them away from the former Chu lands. In light of Chu's fall, the Southern Tang officials, in a celebrating mode, became arrogant, believing that Southern Tang would soon be destroying other states, while some secretly harbored reservations about how the campaigns were draining the state. In early 952, the Later Zhou general Murong Yanchao (Liu Zhiyuan's half-brother) rebelled against Later Zhou, and sought aid from Southern Tang. However, the Southern Tang relief army that Li Jing sent was repelled, and Murong subsequently was defeated. Guo returned the Southern Tang general Yan Jingquan (), and in return, Li returned Southern Tang's captives from the central Chinese regimes. Meanwhile, it was said that Li Jing favored literary talent, and that at the time, Southern Tang had the most literary talents of the states of China. However, it did not hold imperial examinations. In 952, Li reinstitute the imperial examinations and put the official Jiang Wenwei () in charge of them. When Li asked how the examinations compared to those of Tang dynasty, which Southern Tang claimed to be the successor to, Jiang responded, \\"In the past dynasty, half of those who passed imperial examinations were properly passed based on their public performance, and half passed based on private favors. I, your subject, only base them on public performance.\\" Li was pleased, but when the official Zhang Wei (), who was a Tang examination, heard this, he became resentful of Jiang and began to speak against the imperial examinations. Further, the other high-level officials were also not imperial examinees, and therefore did not like the idea of them. Soon, the imperial examinations were abolished again. Southern Tang's entrance of the Chu capital Tan Prefecture did not mean that Southern Tang possessed all of Chu lands‚Äîas while its forces controlled Wu'an, Wuping remained in Liu Yan's hands, and Chu's third main circuit, Jingjiang (ÈùúÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi), fell into Southern Han's hands. Li contemplated campaigns to capture Wu'an and Jingjiang, but by summer 952 was contemplating giving up the campaign to capture Jingjiang and simply to issue a commission to Liu without taking actual control. When he consulted Sun Sheng and Feng Yanji, whom he had earlier made chancellors, Sun agreed, but Feng dissuaded him, suggesting that that would mean that the seizure of Chu was an empty one. However, an attack on Jingjiang's capital Gui Prefecture () was repelled by Southern Han at heavy losses to Southern Tang. Meanwhile, Bian, while known for kindness, was not governing Wu'an properly, as he was indecisive and allowed many of his subordinate to interfere with his decisions. In winter 952, Liu sent Wang Kui to launch a surprise attack on Tan. Bian, after trying to defend Tan briefly, abandoned it and fled back to Southern Tang proper. The other Southern Tang prefects assigned to former Chu prefectures, hearing of Tan's fall, also abandoned their prefectures, allowing Liu's army to recover nearly all of Chu's territory north of the Nanling Mountains (i.e., except Jingjiang). Southern Tang, in effect, gained nothing from the Chu adventure. Sun and Feng resigned their chancellorships, and Li stated that he would never launch another army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291. Still, in 955, when Later Shu's emperor Meng Chang sent emissaries to him and to Northern Han's emperor Liu Jun, with proposal to have a three-state alliance against Later Zhou, he agreed, although no real joint attack occurred.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292. === Late reign === ==== War with Later Zhou ==== Earlier in Southern Tang's history, it had been standard procedure for the Southern Tang army to carefully guard the southern bank of the Huai River when the water level were low. However, at some point in or before 955, Wu Tingshao (), the army monitor, thought it was unlikely that there would be war with Later Zhou, and proposed that this procedure be cancelled, to save costs. Wu's proposal was approved, despite vehement opposition by Liu Renzhan () the military governor of Qinghuai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊ∑Æ, headquartered in modern Lu'an, Anhui). Thus, when, in late 955, Later Zhou launched a major attack against Southern Tang, commanded by its chancellor Li Gu, assisted by the general Wang Yanchao (), Southern Tang was caught unprepared. Li Jing sent the general Liu Yanzhen () to try to aid Liu Renzhan, whose capital Shou Prefecture () was the apparent initial target of the Later Zhou attack, and summoned Song Qiqiu, who was then the military governor of Zhennan, back to Jinling, to help him make military decisions. Li Gu did, in fact, put Shou under siege, but could not capture it. When Liu Yanzhen's army arrived in Shou's vicinity, he decided to withdraw rather than confront Liu Yanzhen immediately. Liu Yanzhen's subordinate Xian Shilang () advocated chasing after Li Gu and attacking his army, and Liu Yanzhen decided to do so, despite Liu Renzhan's advice against it. When Liu Yanzhen reached Zhengyang (Ê≠£ÈôΩ, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Li Gu counterattacked, defeating and killing him in battle while capturing Xian and many other of his officers. Over 10,000 Southern Tang soldiers were killed. Subsequently, the Later Zhou emperor Guo Rong (Guo Wei's adoptive son) arrived at Shou and again put it under siege, while replacing Li Gu as commander of the army with his cousin Li Chongjin. Li Jing subsequently wrote a letter to Guo, stating, \\"The Emperor of Tang respectfully addresses the Emperor of the Great Zhou. We request that you quiet your army and restore peace. We are willing to serve you as if you were an older brother, and willing to contribute goods toward your army costs.\\" Guo did not respond. Worried about what might come next at his state's detriment, Li then sent his officials Zhong Mo () and Li Deming (), both of whom known for their speaking skills, to submit tributes of imperial clothing, tea, traditional medicine, gold, silver, silk, cattle, and wine, at the Zhou army's then camp outside Shou. When Zhong and Li Deming arrived there, however, Guo rebuked them and refused their overture of peace, demanding that Li Jing himself come to beg forgiveness instead. Li Jing's emissary to Liao to ask Liao to attack Later Zhou from the north was intercepted by Later Zhou and never reached Liao. Meanwhile, concerned about the possibility that the Wu imperial Yang clan, whose members were then housed at Tai Prefecture (Ê≥∞Â∑û, in modern Taizhou, Jiangsu), would be taken and used by the Later Zhou army, Li Jing sent the official Yin Yanfan () to Tai to move them south of the Yangtze to Zhenhai's capital Run Prefecture (). However, Yin, believing that the road is difficult and concerned that the Yangs would rebel, slaughtered them. Li Jing, shocked at this result, executed Yin. In spring 956, after continuous Later Zhou victories, including capturing Jiangdu in a surprise attack, Li Jing made another peace overture, sending Sun Sheng and Wang Chongzhi () to again pay tributes of gold, silver, and silk to Guo, and this time submitting a submissive petition (i.e., as a subject, rather than on equal terms):Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 293. Subsequently, through Li Deming and Sun, Li Jing further offered to give up his imperial title; give annual tributes of gold and silk; and cede six prefectures‚ÄîShou, Hao (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), Si (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Shuzhou, Anhui), Chu (Ê•öÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), Guang (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan), and Hai (Êµ∑Â∑û, in modern Lianyungang, Jiangsu)‚Äîto Later Zhou. However, Guo, with his confidence bolstered by the Later Zhou victories, believed that he would be able to conquer all of Southern Tang's territories north of the Yangtze, refused. Li Deming and Sun convinced Guo to allow Li Deming and Wang to return to the Southern Tang court to relay the Later Zhou emperor's demands, and Guo himself issued letters addressed at Li Jing and the high-level Southern Tang officials, offering peace, but only at Later Zhou's stated terms. Li Jing again submitted a petition thanking Guo. When Li Deming arrived at Jinling, pointed out the Later Zhou military strength, and argued for ceding all of the territory north of the Yangtze for peace, however, Li Jing was displeased at his report, and Song argued that ceding land had no benefit to the state. Further, Chen Jue, who was then Li Jing's chief of staff, and Chen's deputy Li Zhenggu both had hated both Li Deming and Sun, and therefore enticed Wang into making different assessments than Li Deming about the Later Zhou strength. They then stated to Li Jing, \\"Li Deming has sold out the empire for his own benefit.\\" In anger, Li Jing executed Li Deming‚Äîthus ending hopes of peace at that point. While facing the Later Zhou invasion, Southern Tang was also facing the threat of Wuyue's invasion from the southeast. Li Jing, concerned that Wuyue would attack Run from Chang Prefecture (Â∏∏Â∑û, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), decided to recall Li Hongji, who was then the commandant at Run, to Jinling, as he saw Li Hongji as too young to oversee the defense. Li Hongji, however, listened to his subordinate Zhao Duo () and decided that if he left Run, it would throw the city and the surrounding region into panic, and declined the recall and instead prepared to defend. He also gave full support to the general Chai Kehong () in Chai's efforts of resisting Wuyue forces. Chai subsequently crushed Wuyue forces under Wu Cheng, ending Wuyue's campaign against Southern Tang. With the faltering of the peace efforts, Li Jing commissioned Li Jingda to head an army to counterattack and to try to lift the siege on Shou, but made Chen the army monitor, in actual control of the army. He also commissioned the official Zhu Yuan (), whom he considered to be militarily talented, to lead an army in trying to recover the prefectures that Later Zhou had captured. Zhu was able to quickly recapture Shu (ËàíÂ∑û, in modern Anqing, Anhui) and He (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui) Prefectures, while Li Ping () recaptured Qi Prefecture (ËòÑÂ∑û, in modern Huanggang, Hubei). With these losses and with Li Jingda's army approaching Shou, Guo decided to withdraw from Jiangdu, concentrating his forces on capturing Shou. Li Jingda's army set up camp near Shou, but did not dare to engage the Later Zhou siege army. In winter 956, Li Jing, hearing of discord between the Later Zhou generals Zhang Yongde (ÂºµÊ∞∏Âæ∑, Guo Rong's brother- in-law) and Li Chongjin, Li Jing wrote a secret letter to Li Chongjin, apparently trying to entice him to turn against Guo, in which he made many disparaging remarks about Guo. Li Chongjin, however, presented the letter to Guo, who had at that point returned to the Later Zhou capital Daliang. Upon seeing the letter, Guo, incensed, summoned Sun (whom he had taken back to Daliang with him, along with Zhong), and confronted him about how, unlike what he had previously stated about Li Jing (that Li Jing wanted to become a vassal), Li Jing was trying to entice Li Chongjin to rebel. He also ordered Sun to tell him Southern Tang state secrets. Sun refused and asked for death. Guo thereafter executed Sun and exiled Zhong, but soon thereafter regretted executing the faithful Sun, and therefore recalled Zhong back to his court. Meanwhile, Li Jing sent another emissary, Chen Chuyao (), over the seas to go to the Liao court to request aid from Emperor Muzong of Liao. Liao did not launch an army to aid Southern Tang, and detained Chen at the Liao court. Because of Zhu's battlefield achievements, he became arrogant and often resisted orders issued by Li Jingda (but actually by Chen). In spring 957, Chen submitted a petition to Li Jing, arguing that Zhu could not be trusted, and Li Jing sent the general Yang Shouzhong () to replace Zhu. Zhu, in anger and fear, initially considered committing suicide, but instead decided to surrender to Later Zhou, with more than 10,000 soldiers. The Later Zhou forces sieging Shou took this opportunity to attack and crush Li Jingda's army. Yang, Xu Wenzhen (), and Bian Hao were captured. Li Jingda and Chen fled back to Jinling. With Liu Renzhan deathly ill, the Shou garrison surrendered. When Liu died shortly after, Li Jing, in remembrance of his faithfulness in defending the city for so long, bestowed posthumous honors on him. After capturing Shou, Guo Rong, now again personally commanding the Later Zhou army, approached Jiangdu. Southern Tang forces burned the city and abandoned it, as Later Zhou forces continue to capture city after city north of the Yangtze. As of spring 958, Guo's army had arrived at the Yangtze and was inflicting losses on the Southern Tang fleet, posturing to cross the Yangtze. At this point, Southern Tang only retained four prefectures north of the Yangtze‚ÄîLu (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui), Shu, Qi, and Huang (ÈªÉÂ∑û, in modern Huanggang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. At this time, Li Jingsui, who had continuously offered to yield the crown prince title, again did so and argued that Li Hongji, due to his contributions during the campaign against Wuyue, should become crown prince. Li Jingda also offered to yield the title of generalissimo of all circuits. Li Jing agreed, creating Li Jingsui the Prince of Jin and making him the commandant at Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) as well as the generalissimo of Jiangnan West Circuit (i.e., Zhennan), and making Li Jingda the commandant at Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). He created Li Hongji crown prince. With the Later Zhou forces at the Yangtze, Li Jing finally decided to capitulate, but felt ashamed of personally becoming a vassal to Guo, and therefore sent Chen as an emissary to Guo, offering to pass the throne to Li Hongji and have Li Hongji submit as a vassal. Chen, upon arriving at Guo's camp, saw the impressiveness of the Later Zhou army, and therefore spoke humbly to Guo, requesting that he be allowed to send his subordinate Liu Chengyu () back to Jinling to obtain a petition from Li Jing, offering to cede Lu, Shu, Qi, and Huang to Later Zhou, so that the Yangtze would form the new border. Guo agreed, and authored a letter in which he addressed Li Jing, \\"The respectful greeting of the Emperor to the Lord of Jiangnan.\\" When Liu arrived at Jinling to report, Li Jing agreed, and, in a petition in which he referred to himself as \\"The Lord of Tang,\\" offered submit the four prefectures and annual tributes. Guo agreed to the terms, and ordered cessation of hostilities. He also had Chen inform Li Jing that it was unnecessary to pass the throne to Li Hongji. Pursuant to his submission to Later Zhou, Li Jing stopped using his own era names and adopted Later Zhou's, to show submission. He stopped referring to himself as \\"emperor\\" but only as \\"lord,\\" and stopped using imperial ceremonies. He also changed his own name from the character Áíü to ÊôØ, to observe naming taboo, as Guo Wei's great-great- grandfather was named Guo Jing with the character of Áíü.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 110. ==== After losses to Later Zhou ==== In summer 958, Li Hongji, fearful that Li Jing would restore Li Jingsui to crown prince status, poisoned Li Jingsui to death. Subsequently, Li Jing again proposed to Guo that he pass the throne to Li Hongji, and Guo again declined to approve. Guo did return Feng Yanlu (who had previously been captured), Zhong Mo, Xu Wenzhen, Bian Hao, and Zhou Tinggou () to Southern Tang. Li Jing, viewing Xu and Bian to be defeated generals, never commissioned them again with army commands. At this point, Li Jing was depressed over the military disasters. Li Zhenggu suggested that he go into seclusion and entrust the state to Song Qiqiu to govern. Zhong, who was friendly with Li Deming and who wanted to avenge Li Deming, used this opportunity to accuse Song, Li Zhenggu, and Chen Jue of collaborating to have Song usurp the throne. Further, at this time, Chen had also forged an order from Guo that the Southern Tang chancellor Yan Xu be put to death. These events convinced Li Jing that the Song faction was up to no good. In winter 958, Li Jing thus acted, exiling Chen, executing Li Zhenggu, and ordering Song back into retirement, albeit with his titles still intact. After Song reached his retirement place at Mount Jiuhua in spring 959, Li Jing had his mansion securely guarded, only allowing food to be passed through a hole in the wall. Song lamented and believed that this was divine retribution for his suggestion to have Yang Pu's family put under secure guard, and thereafter hanged himself. Subsequently, at Guo's encouragement, Li Jing began to rebuild some of his defenses. (Li Jing had previously feared that that would be viewed by Guo as provocation, but Guo, who was ill at that point, pointed out that what might lie in the future was uncertain, and that Li Jing had to watch out for his own state's own good. Guo would, in fact, die in summer 959, and be succeeded by his six-year-old son Guo Chongxun.) Meanwhile, with Jinling just across the Yangtze from Later Zhou territory, Li Jing began to consider moving the capital to Hong Prefecture, and put the deputy chief of staff Tang Hao (), who was the only high-level official in favor of the idea, in charge of building up Hong to serve as the capital. By this point, the Southern Tang economy had been greatly damaged by the wars with Later Zhou and the subsequent crippling annual tributes agreed to, particularly given that the supply of coins remaining from Tang times was dwindling and the inflation of prices of goods that the state was confronted with. At Zhong's suggestion, Li Jing ordered that large coins be minted and be deemed the worth of 50 Tang coins. In fall 959, Li Hongji died. Zhong, who had long been honored by both Li Jing and Guo Rong and therefore had been highly influential at the Southern Tang court, but whose arrogance was beginning to cause Li Jing to be displeased, spoke against having Li Jing's next oldest son Li Congjia the Prince of Zheng succeed Li Hongji as crown prince, instead recommending a younger son, Li Congshan () the Duke of Ji, arguing that Li Congjia was timid and overly devout in Buddhism, while Li Congshan was resolute. This greatly displeased Li Jing, who viewed him as overreaching. Soon, he exiled, and then executed Zhong and his ally Zhang Luan (), and cancelled the large coins that Zhong had advocated. He created Li Congjia the Prince of Wu and had him move into the Eastern Palace. In 960, the major Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin carried out a coup, overthrowing Guo Chongxun and claiming the throne himself as the emperor of a new state of Song (as its Emperor Taizu). When he subsequently sent an edict to Li Jing, Li Jing accepted it (thus accepting Song overlordship), and in fact then sent an emissary to congratulate the Song emperor's ascension. When, in fall 960, Li Chongjin rose against the Song emperor at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, i.e., Jiangdu), where he was serving as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (), he sought an alliance with Southern Tang, but Li Jing rejected his overtures. The Song emperor shortly after defeated him, and he committed suicide. When the Song emperor subsequently reviewed the Song fleet on the Yangtze, Li Jing became very fearful, but was calmed some what when two minor Southern Tang officials, Du Zhuo () and Xue Liang () tried to defect to Song, but the Song emperor, despising their treachery, executed Du and exiled Xue. Still, he became more resolute on moving the capital.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. In spring 961, Li Jing ordered that the capital be moved to Hong, now upgraded to Nanchang Municipality. He created Li Congjia crown prince, to remain at Jinling and oversee the affairs of state during the capital move. When he reached Nanchang, however, he discovered that the city was too small to house his government, such that there was only office space for about 10-20% of his officials, and that it was not easily expandable. The officials longed for Jinling, and Li Jing himself often looked north (toward Jinling) in sadness, such that his imperial scholar Qin Chengyu (), in order to alleviate his sadness, often blocked his view with a screen. He considered executing those who advocated the move, such that Tang Hao died in anxiety. Li Jing himself died in summer 961. He left directions that he be buried in the mountains west of Nanchang.

He was beheaded on the Grand Place in Brussels, because of his resistance to innovations in city government detrimental to the power of the Brussels guilds and for his suspected involvement with uprisings within the Austrian Netherlands. ==Background== The end of the War of the Spanish Succession saw the Spanish Netherlands awarded to Austria. In 1716 the Austrians raised new taxes on the Flemish and Brabantine cities to fund the Dutch occupational forces installed by the Barrier Treaty and questioned their old medieval privileges. In 1717 these issues caused riots in Ghent, Antwerp, Mechelen and Brussels. The Italian Marquess de Pri√©, deputy for the absent governor-general, Prince Eugene of Savoy, suppressed the riots with brute force. In the same year, the newly elected deans of the guilds of Brussels were to swear to uphold the law, including a supplementary rider to the liberties of the city imposed in 1700. They refused to swear to uphold this last, with Anneessens apparently the ring-leader in the refusal.Alphonse Wauters, \\"Anneessens, Fran√ßois\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 1 (Brussels, 1866), 300-317. To restore order de Pri√© ordered the arrest of those he saw to be the ringleaders in both the rioting and the refusal. Frans Anneessens was seen as the most important of these and was lured to a business conference with an Austrian colonel to discuss victuals for his regiment. There Anneessens was arrested. Anneessens and four other leaders were kept in confinement for six months. During this period they were denied contact with their families and denied Catholic services. On 12 September 1719 Anneessens was condemned to death, the four other guild leaders to perpetual banishment. ==Execution== The day set for Anneessens' execution was 19 September 1719. As the government feared trouble they had forced the priests to remove the ropes of the church bells and all major streets and squares were occupied by Austrian soldiery. At 8 o'clock Frans Anneessens was brought from prison, and placed on a cart while bound by his hands and feet. After the reading of the sentence, Anneessens refused to sign it, claiming to be innocent in the eyes of God. He was then brought to the scaffold on the Grand Place where his wig was removed. When Anneesens tried to address the crowd, his words were drowned by drum rolls. The executioner then beheaded him with a sword. After the execution Anneessens body was removed by the Alexian monks and he was buried in the Kapellekerk. ==Legacy== Anneessens is commemorated in Brussels with a statue, a street and a square named after him. Anneessens premetro station takes its name from the square. ==References== * M. Huisman, \\"Pri√©, Hercule-Joseph Turinetti, marquis de\\", Biographie Nationale, vol. 18 (1905), 231‚Äì243. *A.H.

In June 2002 Frezzolini joined Lecce for free, as well as Cirillo to Lecce for ‚Ç¨306,000 and Rullo returned to Lecce for ‚Ç¨151,000. The club failed to agree a price, through a mandatory bidding process, Lecce acquired Cirillo and Rullo. Rullo made his Serie A debut on 31 August 2003 against Lazio, the opening match of 2003‚Äì04 Serie A. He was substituted by Alessandro Budel at half time as the team already lost 0‚Äì3 away at that time. He started 4 more Serie A matches that season, In 2004‚Äì05 Serie A, Rullo ahead Abruzzese at the left back position, under new coach Zdenƒõk Zeman who replaced Delio Rossi. The team now featured only one right winger, Marco Cassetti, instead of 2 or even 3 in the last season, which also saw the departure of Tonetto.

He was Australia's first professor of computer science and the founding president of the Australian Computer Society. His pioneering career included work on early computers such as EDSAC, Ferranti Mark 1* and SILLIAC, and spreading the word about the use of computers through computing courses and computing associations. ==Personal life== John Bennett was born in 1921 at Warwick, Queensland, the son of Albert John Bennett and Elsie Winifred n√©e Bourne.Australian computing pioneer pushed technological frontiers , Sydney Morning Herald, 27 Dec 2010, retrieved 4 Jan 2011 In 1952 he married Rosalind Mary Elkington (who was also working at Ferranti).Elkington Internet Family Tree Retrieved 10 November 2006 They had four children: Chistopher John, Ann Margaret, Susan Elizabeth and Jane Mary. In 1986 Bennett, aged 65, retired with his wife to Sydney's Northern Beaches. Bennett died at home on 9 December 2010 and was survived by his wife, four children and six grandchildren. ==Education and War Service== John Bennett was educated at The Southport School. After which, he went to the University of Queensland to study civil engineering. From 1942 until 1946 (during WWII), he served in the RAAF. He worked on a radar unit on the Wessel Islands and later worked in airfield construction. He then returned to the University of Queensland to study electrical and mechanical engineering and mathematics. ==Professional life== In 1947 he went to Cambridge University to become Maurice Vincent Wilkes' first research assistant as part of the team working to build EDSAC.Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre, 'The First computers, 1951 to 1956' Technology in Australia 1788-1988.

V√µru street in P√µlva P√µlva P√µlva County administration building P√µlva Kultuurikeskus P√µlva is home for the Intsikurmu Song Festival Grounds, which regularly hosts concerts and summer activities, situated in a small forested area on the west side of the town. ==History== The Estonian War of Independence monument in P√µlva. The name \\"P√µlva\\" appears in the historical record in 1452. The name seems to derive from the Estonian word for \\"knee\\" (). Legend has it that a girl was immured in a kneeling position in St. Mary's Church to keep the devil away. This is reputedly how the town was named. P√µlva was an old military crossroad between the north and south of Livonia. Around 1240, shortly after the Christianization of Estonia, the Bernardine monks built a church, which they dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The church was subordinate to the Bishopric of Dorpat. The same parish was the result of the Livonian War under Russian domination in the 16th century. In 1582 it became part of Dorpat Voivodeship under Polish sovereignty, and later it belonged to Sweden. In 1721, in the Treaty of Nystad, Estonia and Livonia were then ceded to Russia. Then P√µlva and its church parish belonged first to Tartu County and from 1783 to newly established V√µru County, part of the Governorate of Livonia. The town was developed around St. Mary's Church, which lay in ruins for a long time until it was rebuilt after the Great Northern War. In 1931, a railway from Tartu to Petseri through P√µlva was completed. The population of P√µlva began to grow rapidly and the town began to develop when P√µlva became the center of the P√µlva raion formed in 1950. The town grew around its artificial lake, whose sandy shores teem with vacationers during the summer. On 10 August 1993 P√µlva gained town rights. ==Education== The importance of education is indicated by the town's coat of arms, which features a rooster with a pointer from an ABC primer. There are eight educational institutions in Polva, including the following: * P√µlva Coeducational Gymnasium, which has 737 students; * P√µlva Secondary School, which has 387 students; * P√µlva Roosi School, which has 28 students. This school is for mentally impaired children. ==Culture and sport== In summertime, interesting music festivals are held in P√µlva. 2011 was the first time for harmonica players to get together and play music. Intsikurmu Song Festival is mostly targeted to young people - good music and visuals on the walls, taking place in tender August nights. The inhabitants of P√µlva have always been positive, youthful and fond of sports. In and outside the town one can practise many activities, from swimming to riding. The new gymnasium provides excellent opportunities for sports and the shooting gallery of P√µlva has been the hothouse of top sportsmen who hit targets at various competitions. Handball, which can be practised in the local sports school, has been undoubtedly popular in P√µlva. The professional players from the Serviti Handball Club have become the masters of Estonia four times and the club is also a serious competitor outside Estonia. The varied landscape offers inexhaustible opportunities for those who like running, orienteering or cycling. This surely facilitates the success of the sportsmen of the Kobras Orienteering Club at competitions and urges them to organise sports events. Football club P√µlva FC Lootos was founded 1994. One of the biggest sport clubs in county more than 30 players for Estonian national team was grown up within club history. Lootospark is a football stadium which is a cooperative project between P√µlva Town, Estonian Football Federation and P√µlva FC Lootos. This stadium is covered with a third-generation synthetic lawn and its lighting and underheating systems are equipped according to international requirements. The stadium was officially opened on November 7, 2004. In addition to sports the inhabitants of P√µlva are engaged in art and music. In the P√µlva Art School one can learn painting, graphic arts and ceramics; the works of various artists are displayed in the Maarja Gallery. The Music School provides musical education and the E STuudio, an ensemble of young people, the brass band, the small symphony orchestra and a number of choirs also practise actively. ==Politics== In October 2013, after the municipal elections, P√µlva merged with the surrounding P√µlva Parish and therefore lost its municipal status. Before that, the town council consisted of 17 members elected on 18 October 2009. The government consisted of five members that were elected by the council on 20 November 2009.

However, later dental examination under more powerful magnification found all sea snakes have grooves in their teeth, some deep and wide channels visible to the naked eye, others only at the base of the tooth and requiring magnification to observe. In light of those new findings, Disteira and Hydrophis were merged until McDowell resurrected Disteira as a separate genus in 1972 to accommodate new species. He redefined Disteira as possessing a broad dorsal portion of the venom gland muscle called the Oxyuranus pattern. Although McDowell rolled the monotypic genus Astrotia - which contains only Astrotia stokesii - into Disteira, that classification is not widely adopted. ==References== Category:Sea snakes ","title":"Disteira"},{"id":"7787681","text":"Marcus Vinicius (c. 5 BC ‚Äì AD 46) was a Roman consul and, as husband of Julia Livilla, grandson-in-law (progener) of the emperor Tiberius.Vogel-Weidemann, Statthalter 313; Syme, Roman Revolution 499 He was the son and grandson of two consuls, Publius Vinicius (consul 2 AD) and Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC). ==Life== Born in Cales in Campania, Vinicius started his senatorial career as quaestor in AD 20.

Along with an eventual career as a solo artist, Rose Melberg performed with Tiger Trap, Gaze, and Go Sailor. Jen Sbragia was known for her work with the band Pretty Face. As part of the Twee Pop movement centrally located in the Pacific Northwest, they were able to meet at performances for their respective bands. The two derived their name from a UK new wave group. After Tiger Trap disbanded in January 1994, the pair formed The Softies and recorded the four- song ‚ÄúLove Seat‚Äù 7-inch single for Slumberland Records. Calvin Johnson later produced their ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll Never Have To Know‚Äù single and the band‚Äôs debut album It‚Äôs Love on the K Records label. They released an eponymous EP under Slumberland Records in 1996 (recorded before It's Love). Within months, they would record their critically acclaimed full-length Winter Pageant in Melberg‚Äôs childhood home in Sacramento, California. In 2000, they released their final collaborative work, Holiday in Rhode Island. It is sometimes speculated that their albums correspond with the seasons of the year as follows: It's Love (Summer), The Softies (Autumn), Winter Pageant (Winter), Holiday in Rhode Island (Spring). The Softies almost exclusively use two electric guitars and harmonizing vocal melodies for their recorded tracks and live performances. Their lack of accompaniment, inexcessive production, and brevity of their songs are recurring characteristics of their work throughout their three full-length albums. The band undertook a few tours, including as an opening act for singer/songwriter Elliott Smith. For the first time since 2000, the Softies toured as part of Chickfactor 2012: For the Love of Pop, with shows in Brooklyn, Portland and San Francisco. ==Discography== ===LPs=== * It's Love (1995 - LP/CD - K Records - KLP43) * Winter Pageant (1997 - LP/CD - K Records - KLP61) * Holiday In Rhode Island (2000 - LP/CD - K Records) ===Singles & EPs=== *Loveseat (1994 - 7\\" 4 track EP - Slumberland Records) *He'll Never Have to Know (1995 - 7\\" - K Records - IPU56) * The Softies (1996 - 10\\" - Slumberland Records) *The Best Days (1996 - 7\\" - K Records - IPU79) ==References== ==External links== *Epitonic Profile (with mp3 samples) *The Softies: A Retrospective *Myspace Profile * rosemelberg.net - Unofficial Rose Melberg fansite Category:American indie pop groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Cuddlecore musicians Category:Slumberland Records artists ","title":"The Softies"},{"id":"7787711","text":"Celso Fonseca (born November 15, 1956) is a Brazilian composer, producer, guitarist and singer.

He founded the Lion Path, a shamanistic movement. He held unusual and controversial views relating to mathematics, physics, philosophy, and many other fields. == Biography == Muses was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in Long Island, New York. His father abandoned the family when Muses was a young boy forcing his mother to support Muses and a large, extended family on a school teacher's salary. Years later he would remark in lectures that if his mother had not had an overarching faith in \\"young Charlie\\" he might never have been able to escape the confines of his impoverished youth. In 1947 Muses received his Master's Degree in philosophy from Columbia University, New York. In 1951 he received his PhD in philosophy from Columbia University. Muses' doctoral thesis focused on the famous seer, Jacob Boehme, and one of his followers Dionysius Freher. It was entitled, Illumination on Jacob Boehme, The Work of Dionysius Andreas Freher, and was published by King‚Äôs Crown Press in 1951. On pages 151-152 Muses states that, ‚ÄúBoth Boehme‚Äôs and Freher‚Äôs outstanding message philosophically is that philosophy is not a dodge, game, or only some kind of artistic exercise, but a solid enterprise of most productive value ‚Äì able to yield concrete results of a most extended nature in terms of deep changes in attitude and understanding, leading to actions toward and realization of the intrinsic nobility possible to and desired by mankind.‚Äù In 1991, In All Her Names: Explorations of the Feminine in Divinity, was published by Harper San Francisco. The book was edited by Joseph Campbell and Charles Muses. Each contributed a chapter to the book along with Riane Eisler and Marija Gimbutas. The title of Muses chapter is, The Ageless Way of Goddess: Divine Pregnancy and Higher Birth in Ancient Egypt and China. On pages 136‚Äì137, he states, ‚ÄúSimilarly, the ancient theurgic doctrine taught that in the dim and mysterious recesses of each human brain are lodged the control centers for transducing a higher metamorphic process in that individual, of which the butterfly, wonderful as it is, is but a crude and imperfect analogue... The acquisition of a higher body by an individual meant also, by that very token, the possibility of communicating with beings already so endowed. The entrance into this higher community and fellowship is one of the principal causes for celebration in the Ancient Egyptian liturgy of the sacred transformative process ‚Äì sacred because it conferred so much beyond ordinary life.‚Äù Charles Muses edited, Esoteric Teachings of the Tibetan Tantra, which was translated into English by Chang Chen Chi. The book was first published in 1961, by The Falcon‚Äôs Wing Press. Muses states on page ix, of the introduction, ‚ÄúIn these considerations also lies the true meaning of the most secret tantric path, in Tibet called the Vajrayana or Thunderbolt Vehicle. It is secret only because most do not have enough of the intelligent love-will to find and pursue it. For those who place such a level of high desire first, however, the precious means (upaya) will mysteriously arise in their lifetimes, and they will be able to tread this path of Love-Will-Wisdom, of Heart, Hand and Head harmoniously joined. But heart or love must rule the other two or wisdom will become unwise and the love-will deteriorate again into self-will.‚Äù Muses had no success in attaining a tenured position as a faculty member at an institution of higher education. Forced to give lectures to earn a living, he wrote books and began traveling the world. He continued these pursuits for the remainder of his life. In 1985, Kluwer-Nijhoff first published Muses book entitled, Destiny and Control in Human Systems. In it he proposes a method called ‚Äòchronotopology,‚Äô which he claims can measure the qualitative multidimensional structure of time. In chapter 5, entitled, ‚ÄúFonts Et Origo: Some Traditions Uniquely Illuminating the Structure and Meaning of Time Systems,‚Äù Muses provides historical sources for his claim, ‚ÄúThat the nature of time is inextricably bound up with the origins of evil. . .‚Äù (p. 128). On page 138, he states, ‚ÄúThus our world of waiting, disease, aging, suffering, and death stems from the nature of time itself and was part and parcel of the set of implied consequences of the Demuiurge‚Äôs Dream ‚Äì that very brief nightmare that had spawned a reality of evil on awakening.‚Äù And Muses states on page 139, that, ‚Äú. . . the God of our universe is a wounded God in heart although Himself recovered. His domain, which before was a universally symbiotic cosmos, had now become the frenetically struggling, predominantly predatory one we all know, with Nature trying still to smile through her travail. There is a mysterious tradition both in Iran and Egypt of the female aspect of this Divinity (Daena in Iran and Isis in Egypt) who did not share the death-dream of her spouse and who in fact helped him revive as the renewed and victorious Horus.‚Äù Musean Hypernumbers, table by Klaus Scharff Muses also envisioned a mathematical number concept, Musean hypernumbers, that includes hypercomplex number algebras such as complex numbers and split-complex numbers as primitive types. He assigned them levels based on certain arithmetical properties they may possess. While many open questions remain, in particular about defining relations of these levels, Muses pictured a wide range of applicability for this concept. Some of these are based on properties of magic squares,Hypernumbers-Magic Square and even related to religious belief. He believed that these hypernumbers were central to issues of consciousness. Some research work about hypernumbers was done by the mathematicians Jens Koeplinger and John Shuster.Elliptic NumbersDoubly nilpotent numbers Muses was arrested in Egypt in March 1957 when he tried to remove a number of very valuable artifacts from the country on the argument that he did not realize that a license was required. He was finally convicted in August 1957, but was later allowed to return to the United States.Egyptian Gazette, Wednesday Aug 14, 1957 (page 2), La Bourse Egyptienne July 30, 1957, (page 1), The Egyptian Gazette, July 31, 1957 (page 1), Al Shaab June 22, June 1957 (Arabic language), Archives of Consul General Larry Roeder, Foreign Service Lounge, US Department of State, Washington, DC 20520 == Selected Writings == ‚Ä¢ Illumination on Jacob Boehme.

The Pakistani players refused to take the field after the tea break in protest of the decision. After waiting two more minutes the umpires removed the bails and declared England winners by forfeiture. This was the first such end to a Test match in more than 1,000 Tests. The International Cricket Council (ICC), England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later affirmed that the decision to award the match to England was in accordance with the Laws of Cricket. After the game, an email was leaked showing that Hair had offered his resignation from the ICC Elite Umpire Panel in return for a non-negotiable one-off payment of US$500,000. Hair said that the ICC had been in negotiations with him prior to the incident. The ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle later acquitted Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq of a ball-tampering charge, but banned him for four one day internationals for bringing the game into disrepute. After the hearing the ICC announced that Hair would not be umpiring at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy because of security concerns. Hair was later banned from officiating in international matches by the ICC: they stated that although Hair had been banned from Tests, there is \\"no issue\\" with the result of the Oval Test match. In the aftermath of the Oval incident, Hair was voted Umpire of the Season in a poll carried out by The Wisden Cricketer, with more than a third of the votes. A leaked ICC report showed that immediately before the Oval incident, Hair was ranked the second-best umpire in the world overall behind Simon Taufel and number one in terms of decision-making statistics. In 2007 Hair announced he was suing the ICC and PCB on grounds of racial discrimination, alleging that he was made a scapegoat when he was barred from officiating Test matches after the Oval Test, as no action was taken against his fellow umpire Billy Doctrove. He later dropped the discrimination case. The ICC restored Hair to the Elite Umpiring Panel in 2008 but he resigned five months later, having officiated in only two further Tests. == Incident == On 20 August 2006, during the fourth day of the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at The Oval, umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove ruled that the Pakistani team had been involved in ball tampering. They awarded five penalty runs to England and offered them a replacement ball. The Pakistani players refused to take the field after the tea break in protest at the decision. The umpires left the field, directed the Pakistani players to resume play and returned once more 15 minutes later. After waiting two more minutes the umpires removed the bails and declared England winners by forfeiture. This was the first such end to a Test match in more than 1,000 Test matches. The Pakistani team did take to the field 25 minutes later ‚Äì 55 minutes after the umpires first took to the field for a resumption of play ‚Äì but Hair and Doctrove pointed out that the game had already ended with a Pakistani forfeiture the moment the bails were removed, even though both teams were willing to continue the match. The Test was abandoned, with the match awarded to England. == Reaction == The International Cricket Council (ICC), England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later affirmed that the decision to award the match to England was in accordance with the laws of cricket. However, it caused much debate in the cricketing world, with former cricketer Michael Atherton criticising Hair for not continuing the game. Nasser Hussain sided with Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, saying that he would have done exactly what Inzamam did, while Steve Waugh backed the umpires' decision, saying \\"No-one is bigger than the game. The laws are there for a reason.\\" Michael Holding described the umpires' initial penalty for ball tampering as \\"insensitive\\" and said that every law has room for flexibility. Imran Khan called Hair an \\"umpiring fundamentalist\\", and commented that \\"Such characters court controversy\\", while Wasim Akram called for Hair to be sacked. It was revealed in an ICC news conference on 25 August that after the game, Hair had offered his resignation from the ICC Elite Umpire Panel. In an e-mail entitled \\"The Way Forward\\" addressed to Doug Cowie, the ICC's umpire manager, and with apparent reference to an earlier conversation between the two which had not been made public by the ICC, Hair stated he would resign from his position in return for a non-negotiable one-off payment of US$500,000 directly into Hair's bank account. This was to be kept confidential by both sides. Hair was in contract with the ICC until March 2008, and the payment was said to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments. He subsequently revoked this offer. Hair had stated that the suggested sum was to be compensation for the four or more years he would have umpired for had the controversy not happened, which he claimed would be \\"the best years he had to offer international umpiring\\". Hair had previously suggested, however, in an April 2006 interview that he might give up umpiring at the end of the World Cup saying \\"I'm not so sure that after another 12 months I'll have the passion to keep enjoying it.\\" In the press conference, the ICC's chairman Malcolm Speed did not offer any assurances about Hair's future. On 27 August, Hair responded to the release of the e-mails by stating that the ICC had been in negotiations with him prior to him sending them. He was quoted as saying: \\"During an extended conversation with Mr. Cowie, I was invited to make a written offer. The figure in the e-mail correspondence was in line with those canvassed with the ICC.\\" The ICC however denied they had invited a claim. In a press conference on 28 September 2006 Hair reiterated that he never considered retirement.Cricinfo ‚Äì Hair never considered retirement == ICC hearing == On 28 September, the ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle chaired the hearing into Inzamam's case and acquitted him of the ball-tampering charge stating, \\"Having regard to the seriousness of the allegation of ball-tampering [it is an allegation of cheating], I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is sufficiently cogent evidence that the fielding team had taken action likely to interfere with the condition of the ball\\" in his official report,Cricinfo ‚Äì Ranjan Mudagalle's decision in full but banned him for four One Day Internationals for bringing the game into disrepute. Each of the ICC- appointed match officials (Hair, Doctrove, Cowie, Trevor Jesty, Mike Procter, and Peter Hartley) were of the opinion that markings on the ball indicated tampering. However Geoffrey Boycott, testifying before the panel, stated \\"That's a good ball, not just a playable ball.\\" Another witness, TV analyst Simon Hughes, testified that Hair was \\"guessing\\", and the ball was in \\"pretty good condition\\", when he examined it. At a press conference after the hearing, PCB's chairman Shahryar Khan revealed that his board had not ruled out calling for charges of bringing the game into disrepute against Hair. Following the hearing, the ICC announced that Hair would not be umpiring at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy because of security concerns. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) stated that they were bothered by the controversy surrounding Hair rather than any security issues,Cricinfo ‚Äì Security not an issue ‚Äì BCCI but Malcolm Speed wrote that these had been raised by independent advisors. == Ban == On 4 November 2006, Hair was banned from officiating in international matches by the ICC following a two-day meeting held by the ICC. The announcement was made by ICC President Percy Sonn in Mumbai, India, in a press conference. :\\"He shall not be allowed to officiate in any future international games until the end of this contract [which ends in March 2008]\\" Percy Sonn, ICC President Both Malcolm Speed, CEO of the ICC, and Sonn, stated that although Hair has been banned from tests, there is \\"no issue\\" with the result of the Oval Test match, which Pakistan forfeited. The decision was met with praise from the Pakistani board, who had previously called for Hair to be sacked. It was widely rumoured on 3 November 2006, that Hair was going to be banned, after a \\"reliable source\\" leaked information to an Indian television network. The unnamed source said that 10 test playing nations voted on whether Hair should be allowed to continue, with the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Bangladesh all voting for Hair to be removed, while England, Australia and New Zealand supported him. The voting at the decision to ban Hair was seen by some to reflect the perception of Hair in different countries.Cricket gets its badly needed Hair-cut Most Asian commentators welcomed the move. Javed Miandad said that such a move by ICC sets an example that meant \\"all other umpires will be under pressure to take the right decisions\\" and Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar also supported the decision. The former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga welcomed the decision to ban Hair, commenting that \\"Hair had a prejudice against Asian teams. I am happy that he is finally out. The decision will do good to future cricket.\\" The majority of criticism against the decision to ban Hair from matches involving test nations has come from his home country of Australia. Ricky Ponting said he was surprised by the ICC's move to ban Hair and Cricket Australia demanded the ICC explain the reasons for Hair being stood down. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said \\"Umpires need to have confidence in the system ‚Äì that they are supported by best-practice administration and processes.\\" The Australian media has also been critical of the decision. News Corp's Robert Craddock said, \\"Having seen how brutally Hair was abandoned after his tough call, only a brave or foolish umpire would be courageous enough to throw himself into the lion's den.\\" At the time, Hair had not ruled out taking legal action after the decision. Billy Doctrove, the other umpire during the Oval Test, is unaffected by the ICC's ban on Hair, though he was overlooked for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.HOW THE DRAMA UNFOLDED  Sporting Life ‚Äì Cricket News  Live Cricket Scores, New Zealand v England, CB Series, Live Coverage & Stats In the aftermath of the Oval incident Hair was voted Umpire of the Season in a poll carried out by The Wisden Cricketer, with more than a third of the votes.

Hair alleged that he was made a scapegoat when he was barred from officiating Test matches after the forfeited Oval Test, as no action was taken against his fellow umpire Billy Doctrove. In a statement issued via his solicitor, Hair said: > \\"I can confirm I have instructed my lawyers, Finers Stephens Innocent, 179 > Portland Street, London, to issue an application to the London Central > Employment Tribunal alleging racial discrimination from the International > Cricket Council and the Pakistan Cricket Board.

[It > was] a black spot on the history of cricket thanks to Mr Hair.\\" However, on 9 October 2007 Hair dropped his discrimination case. The ICC said Hair would undergo a development programme over the next six months seemingly with the goal to place him back into top level matches. During this six-month period he would continue to officiate in second tier ICC associate matches. The ICC restored Hair to the Elite Umpiring Panel on 12 March 2008.Hair restored as ICC elite umpire BBC News retrieved 12 March 2008 However, on 22 August 2008 Hair handed in his resignation to the ICC to take up a coaching role, after he had only officiated in two Tests, in May and June 2008 between England and New Zealand.

They live mainly in coniferous forests but they do also occur in some deciduous woodlands. ==Description== The Scottish wood ant has a reddish-brown head and thorax and a black abdomen. At the back of the head is a short fringe of hairs but this does not extend as far as the eyes. This ant has fewer, shorter hairs than are present in the other wood ant species found in Britain. ==Distribution== The Scottish wood ant has a wide distribution across northern Europe, its range extending from Scandinavia to Siberia. It also occurs in the cooler parts of mountainous regions of central Europe and Asia. In Scotland it occurs in the pinewoods of the Caledonian Forest and throughout the Highlands, including the Isle of Skye off the west coast. It is also known from two locations in County Armagh in Northern Ireland. It is generally found in coniferous forests, including clearings and rides, and in suitable plantations. ==Behaviour== This species forms very large mound nests. During the day, columns of ants stream out of these, ascending trees and linking the nests to others in the vicinity. Foraging ants collect honeydew from plant- sucking insects among the tree foliage and bring it back to the nest. They will also collect living or dead invertebrates to supplement this. Winged reproductives are produced in summer, and new nests are also founded by fission from a parent nest, which may contain a number of queens. ==Conservation status== Formica aquilonia is included on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of threatened species, where they are classified as Lower Risk. Because of concerns about their future here, the species is the subject of Species Action Plans, as part of the UK's strategy for protecting biological diversity. Because of the rarity of this ant in Northern Ireland, it is listed as a Northern Ireland Priority Species. ==See also== *Formica exsectoides ==References== ==External links== * aquilonia Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Hymenoptera of Asia Category:Insects described in 1955 ","title":"Formica aquilonia"},{"id":"7787813","text":"Nymphalini is a tribe of nymphalid brush-footed butterflies. Common names include admirals, anglewings, commas, and tortoiseshells, but none of these is specific to one particular genus. The name anglewing butterflies is an English translation of a Latin term papiliones angulati, [Denis & Schifferm√ºller], ([1775, 1776]). Based on an overall similarity in the angulate wing shape, a collective name: Papiliones angulati was employed for Papilio atalanta, P. antiopa, P. cardui, P. c-album, P. io, P. polychloros, P. urticae, P. xanthomelas, P. vaualbum, P. levana and P. prorsa. The term papiliones angulati is applied as a collective taxon name, which therefore needs no type species as specified in Article 42.3.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Papiliones angulati has thus been re-defined to apply only to a clade: Nymphalis sensu lato, and to specifically exclude Papilio atalanta [‚Üí Vanessa], P. cardui [‚Üí Cynthia], P. levana, and P. prorsa [‚Üí Araschnia]. This monophyletic group of nymphaline butterflies inhabiting the Northern Hemisphere are characterized by a jagged outline of their wings and the ability to survive the winter months as adults in an obligatory hibernal diapause, hiding in various shelters (e.g., crevices, hollows, cavities, even unheated buildings). The signature mark of all butterflies is the cryptic colour and maculation (spots) of the ventral (under) side of their wings, serving to conceal the hibernating butterfly against the substrate on which it rests. ==Genera== Listed alphabetically:Nymphalini, Tree of LifeTribe Nymphalini at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms * Aglais Dalman, 1816 ‚Äì tortoiseshells * Antanartia Rothschild & Jordan, 1903 ‚Äì African red admirals * Araschnia H√ºbner, 1819 * Hypanartia H√ºbner, 1821 ‚Äì mapwings * Inachis ‚Äì European peacock (now in Aglais) * Kaniska Moore, 1899 ‚Äì blue admiral (often in Polygonia) * Mynes Boisduval, 1832 * Nymphalis Kluk, 1781 ‚Äì anglewings, tortoiseshells * Polygonia H√ºbner, 1819 ‚Äì anglewings, commas * Symbrenthia H√ºbner, 1819 ‚Äì jesters * Vanessa Fabricius, 1807 ‚Äì red admirals, Kamehameha butterflies, painted ladies The monotypic genus Tigridia is sometimes placed here as a very basal offshoot close to Colobura, sometimes in the related tribe Coeini.

Goanese is an incorrect usage for Goans. ==Epigraphical evidence== A copperplate dating to the early 4th century found in Shiroda, mentions one Devaraja of the Gominas, which is a reference to the Bhoja king ruling from Chandor, who is hailed as the ruler of the Goans or Gominas. ==Language== Geographic Distribution of Native Konkani Speakers within India Goans are multilingual, but mainly speak the Konkani language, a Prakrit based language belonging to the Southern group of Indo-Aryan Languages. Various dialects of Konkani spoken by the Goans which include Bardezkari, Saxtti, Pednekari and Antruz. The Konkani spoken by the Catholics is notably different from those of the Hindus, since it has a lot of Portuguese influence in its vocabulary. Konkani was suppressed for official documentation use only not for unofficial use under the Portuguese governance, playing a minor part in education of the past generations. All Goans were educated in Portuguese in the past when Goa was an overseas province of Portugal. A small minority of Goans are descendants of the Portuguese, speak Portuguese and are of Luso-Indian ethnicity, however a number of native Christians also used Portuguese as their first language prior to 1961. Goans use Devanagari (official) and Latin script (liturgical and historical) for education as well as communication (personal, formal and religious). However the entire liturgy of the Catholic church is solely in the Latin script. In the past Goykanadi, Modi, Kannada and Persian scripts were also used which later fell into disuse owing to many social, political and religious reasons. Portuguese is still spoken by a number of Goans, though it is mainly restricted to upper class Christian families and the older generation. The Marathi language has played a significant role for Hindus near the northern borders of Goa close to Maharashtra and parts of Novas Conquistas. this is due to the influx of ethnic Marathi people and to the area since the late 20th Century.Gauree Malkarnekar (2019). After Karnataka & Maha, UP gives Goa the most migrants ==Religion== Ethnic Goans are predominantly Christians followed by Hindus and a small Muslim community. As per the 1851 census, Christians constituted 64.5% and Hindus 35.5% of the Goan population. Within Goa, there has been a steady decline of Christianity due to Goan emigration, and a steady rise of Hinduism and Islam, due to non-Goan immigration. Conversion seems to play little role in the demographic change. As per the 2011 census, Hindus constituted 65%, Christians constituted 27% and Muslims constituted 6% within the state of Goa. === Christianity === The Catholics display Portuguese influence in the form of a hierarchy due to being for 451 years of close interaction with the Portuguese as an overseas province. Portuguese names are common among the Christians. The Caste system is still followed, but to a lesser degree as compared to other Indians. There are distinct Bamonn, Chard√≥, Gauddo and Sudir communities in Goa that is mainly endogamous. Many Catholic families also share Indo-Portuguese ancestry and some Catholic Goans count themselves as 'mestizo' or a mixed-race. The over 450 years of interaction with the Portuguese (making it one of the longest colonial occupations in history) has resulted in a race that is unique and culturally different from the people around them. === Hinduism === Goan Hindus refer to themselves as Konkane (Devanagari Konkani: ‡§ï‡•ã‡§Ç‡§ï‡§£‡•á), meaning the residents of an area broadly identified as Konkan. Hindus in Goa are divided into many different castes and sub-castes, known as Jatis. They use their village names to identify their clans, some of them use titles. Some are known by the occupation their ancestors have been practising; Nayak, Borkar, Raikar, Keni, Prabhu, Kamat, Lotlikar, Chodankar, Mandrekar, Naik, Bhat, Tari, Gaude are examples. === Islam === Only a small number of native Muslims remain and are known as Moir, the word is derived from the Portuguese Mouro, which means Moor. Mu√ßulmano was the word later used in Portuguese to identify them. === Others === There are minuscule numbers of the Goan diaspora now converted to Sikhism, Buddhism as well as a few Atheists. ==Geographical distribution== Goans have been migrating all along the Konkan Coast and across the world for the last six centuries because of socio-religious and economic reasons. The Indian diaspora have been assimilated with other Konkani people of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. Many Goans have settled in the Gulf, the U.K. and the Greater Angloshpere as well as the former Portuguese territories, including Portugal itself. Goans across the globe refer to the publication, Goan Voice for news about members from their community. === Migrations prior to 1550 === There are no definitive records of Goan migration prior to the Portuguese conquests in the region of Goa. One reason being that the Goan people were not a distinct ethnic group as yet. === Migrations from 1550-1700s (First Phase) === The first recorded instances of significant emigrations of Goans could be traced back to the arrival of the Portuguese in Goa. Sizable numbers of Goan Hindus in 17th-18th centuries fled to Mangalore and Canara, inorder to flee from the conversion efforts. They were soon followed by the newly converted Goan Catholics, who fled the Goa Inquisition. There were flights from Goa to escape taxation as well as epidemics during the same time period. It was also during the latter part this period, when Goans (mainly Catholics) started traveling overseas. Though miniscule, there were migrations of Goans to other parts of the global Portuguese Empire, such as Lisbon, Ormuz, Muscat, Timor, Brasil, Malaca, Pegu, and Colombo. 48 Goan Catholics permanently migrated to Portugal in 18th Century. There was a self imposed ban on Goan Hindus on overseas travel, imposed by the Dharamasastras, due to the belief that crossing salt water would corrupt oneself. === Migrations from 1800s-1950s (Second Phase) === During the Napoleonic Wars Goa was occupied by the British Raj, and many of their vessels were anchored in the Morumug√£o harbour. These ships were serviced by native Goans, who then left for British India once the ships had moved on. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1878 played an important role in speeding the emigration of Goans in the latter half of the 19th Century, since it gave the British the authority to construct the West of India Portuguese Railway, which connected the Velhas Conquistas to the Bombay Presidency. They primarily moved to the cities of Bombay (now Mumbai), Poona (now Pune), Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Karachi. The Goans who moved to mainland India were of both, Christian as well as Hindu, origin. A small number of Goans moved to Burma, to join the already established community in Pegu (now Bago). Another destination for mainly the Catholic community, was Africa. Most of the emigrants hailed from the province of Bardes, due to their high literacy rate, and the Velhas Conquistas region in general. Immigration into Africa came to end after the Decolonisation of Africa, during the 1950-60s. In 1880, there 29,216 Goans who left Goa. By 1954, this number rose to 180,000. === Migration from 1960s-Present (Current Phase) === After the Invasion of Goa (1961) by the Republic of India, there has been a steep rise in the number of emigrants of Goan origin. Many had applied and were granted Portuguese passports in order to obtain a European residence. The educated class found it difficult to get jobs within Goa due to the high influx of non- Goans into Goa, and this encouraded many of them to move to the Gulf states. Until the early 1970s there were substantial populations of Goans in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. There have also, historically, been Goans in former British colonies of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, and Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola. The end of colonial rule brought a subsequent process of Africanisation and a wave of expulsion of South Asians from Uganda (1972) and Malawi (1974) forced the community to migrate elsewhere. Currently it is estimated that there are around 600,000 Goans living outside India. === Professions === Since the Second Phase of migrations, the Goans have had a variety of professions. In British India they were personal butlers or physicians to the English and Parsi elite in India. On the Ships and Cruise liners they were sailors, stewards, chefs, musicians and dancers. In Africa, they pioneered in medicine. Many have also been working on Oil Rigs. ==See also== *Goan Catholics *Goan Muslims *Caste system in Goa *Goan cuisine *Konkani people *List of people from Goa *Goan houses *Luso-Asians *Eurasian (mixed ancestry) ==References== Category:Goan society * ","title":"Goans"},{"id":"7787845","text":"Living Out Loud is a 1998 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Richard LaGravenese and set in New York City, starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Queen Latifah, Martin Donovan, and Elias Koteas. ==Plot== Judith Moore had what she thought was a perfect marriage, with both she and her husband studying to be doctors.

Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, it was the world's first parkway, having been built between 1870 and 1874. At the time of its construction, Eastern Parkway went to the eastern edge of Brooklyn, hence its name. The road begins at Grand Army Plaza (the main entrance to Prospect Park) and extends east to Ralph Avenue, along the crest of the moraine that separates northern from southern Long Island. This section runs parallel to Atlantic Avenue and is aligned with the Crown Heights street grid. East of Ralph Avenue, it turns to the northeast, still following the moraine, until it terminates at Bushwick Avenue near the Evergreen Cemetery, where the moraine climbs steeply toward a peak at Ridgewood Reservoir. The initial portion of Eastern Parkway, west of Ralph Avenue, contains landscaped medians and is officially called by that name. The part east of Ralph Avenue is narrower and is officially known as Eastern Parkway Extension. Eastern Parkway was built with the expectation that it would be the centerpiece of a neighborhood with \\"first-class\\" housing. Ultimately, the resulting development encompassed a variety of building styles including single-family homes, mansions, and apartment buildings. The parkway extension east of Ralph Avenue was built in the late 1890s. The neighborhoods around the parkway developed into a \\"Doctor's Row\\" in the late 19th century, and further settlement occurred with the opening of the New York City Subway's Eastern Parkway Line in 1920. The section of Eastern Parkway west of Ralph Avenue is a New York City designated landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Route description== leftIn the short westernmost portion, between Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park (where it intersects with Prospect Park West, Flatbush Avenue, and Vanderbilt Avenue) and Washington Avenue, the thoroughfare consists of a broad, bidirectional avenue of six lanes, separated by a median from a narrow parallel service road on the north side. It passes Brooklyn Central Library, Brooklyn Museum, Mount Prospect Park, and Brooklyn Botanic Garden in this area; all of these are located on the south side of Eastern Parkway. The section between Washington and Ralph Avenues has a second service road on the south side, separated by another median. The parkway passes Bedford, Rogers, and Nostrand Avenues in this fashion before passing Chabad-Lubavitch world headquarters and the Jewish Children's Museum in Crown Heights. It continues east, crossing Utica and Ralph Avenues. East of Ralph Avenue, the parkway is reduced to six lanes, heading in a northeasterly direction toward Bushwick Avenue. Here, Eastern Parkway officially becomes the Eastern Parkway Extension (though signage saying this only appears northeast of Broadway) and curves northeast to intersect with Howard Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, Fulton Street, and Broadway. In this area, Eastern Parkway runs diagonally to the rest of the street grid, creating several oblique intersections. At Bushwick Avenue, the Extension becomes Vanderveer Street, a dead-end street. The extension connects to Jackie Robinson Parkway, three blocks southeast, via Bushwick Avenue. Originally, Eastern Parkway east of Ralph Avenue continued down present-day Pitkin Avenue toward where Aqueduct Racetrack is today. The addresses along Pitkin Avenue follow directly from that of Eastern Parkway. Pitkin Avenue was created by the late 1890s when the Eastern Parkway Extension was constructed. Eastern Park, the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers before Ebbets Field, was located at Eastern Parkway and Vesta Avenue (now Pitkin Avenue at Van Sinderen Avenue, respectively). === Design === At Kingston Avenue, Crown Heights Eastern Parkway is credited as the world's first parkway to be built explicitly for personal and recreational traffic while restricting commercial traffic. Frederick Law Olmsted, the parkway's co-designer, described a parkway as \\"a shaded green ribbon\\" which might \\"be absolutely formal or strikingly picturesque, according to circumstances.\\" Eastern and Ocean Parkways were planned together, though Eastern Parkway was intended to be the more grand of the two. The section between Washington and Ralph Avenues is wide between curbs, with two service roads, two medians, and a main road. Both medians have trees, benches, and paths for pedestrians. These medians contain sidewalks with hexagonal asphalt tiles and benches made of concrete or wood. The Eastern Parkway Extension is wide between curbs, with two sidewalks. This section has a narrower median of between separating each direction of traffic. There are three lanes in each direction. Originally, there were 1,100 trees planted in the medians. As such, Olmsted placed elm trees along the main road and a variety of trees consisting mostly of maples on the service roads. These were provided by John Condor's Brooklyn nursery. The southern median has a bike path, part of the Brooklyn- Queens Greenway which runs south from the western end through Prospect Park to Ocean Parkway and east from the eastern end through Forest Park. The southern median's bike path is separated from the pedestrian path by way of a \\"rumble strip\\" between the pedestrian and bike lanes. The northern median is for pedestrians only. Many trees along the parkway bear plaques commemorating soldiers fallen in World War I. Today, the trees come from about 25 different species. === Traffic and safety === Between Grand Army Plaza and Ralph Avenue, most traffic uses the main road of Eastern Parkway, while the service roads tend to be used by local traffic; commercial vehicles are prohibited on all of the roadways. However, trucks are allowed on the Eastern Parkway Extension, where traffic loads are heavy throughout the day. In practice, neither section of Eastern Parkway is designated as a local truck route. All of the intersections of Eastern Parkway's main road, between Grand Army Plaza and Ralph Avenue, contain traffic lights on the main road. However, at certain intersections, only one of the two service roads have traffic lights, while the other service road generally contains a stop sign. More specifically, at intersections with northbound cross-streets, only the main road and eastbound service road contain a traffic light, and at intersections with southbound cross-streets, the main road and westbound service road contain a traffic light. At intersections with two-way streets, both service roads and the main roads generally contain a traffic light. Since the parkway was not designed for modern traffic loads, traffic lights and crosswalks at the service roads were installed in a piecemeal fashion, creating inconsistencies even between adjacent intersections. At many intersections, there are also no crosswalks between the traffic medians; at intersections where the service roads use stop signs, crosswalks at the curbs of the service roads are also missing. Due to its width, as well as the lack of traffic lights on some service roads, Eastern Parkway contains a number of dangerous intersections, especially at those with two-way cross streets or one-way southbound cross streets. This is exacerbated by cars attempting to turn from the main road onto the side streets, who frequently block the crosswalk or make quick turns onto these streets. One of the more dangerous intersections along Eastern Parkway is at Utica Avenue, a two-way street, frequently regarded as the most dangerous intersection in Brooklyn. This was once the second-most-dangerous intersection in the city, with eighty-eight pedestrians being hurt and four being killed between 1995 and 2001. Another intersection with Washington Avenue, a two-way street, formerly lacked a traffic light for the northbound service road. Between 1995 and 2005, the intersection of Eastern Parkway and Washington Avenue saw one fatality and thirty-nine injuries. The segment between Grand Army Plaza and Washington Avenue was later upgraded with a traffic light and bike lane. Because of the high number of traffic incidents on Eastern Parkway, the parkway is designated as a Vision Zero traffic safety \\"priority corridor\\". In an effort to reduce injuries, the city proposed installing traffic signals on all of the service roads during the 2010s. ==History== === Planning and construction === Eastern Parkway is located on the high edge of Harbor Hill Moraine, a terminal moraine. Approximately 17,000 years ago the moraine of the receding Wisconsin Glacier that formed Long Island established a string of hills. Mount Prospect (or Prospect Hill), near the present-day intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway, is one of the tallest hills in Brooklyn, rising 200 feet (61 m) above sea level. During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the area was a site of the Battle of Long Island (aka Battle of Brooklyn). American forces attempted to hold Battle Pass, an opening in the terminal moraine where the old Flatbush Road passed from the villages of Brooklyn to Flatbush. It fell after some of the heaviest fighting in the engagement, and its loss contributed to George Washington's decision to retreat. Even though the Continental Army lost the battle, they were able to hold the British back long enough for Washington's army to escape across the East River to Manhattan. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who were also responsible for Central Park and Prospect Park, suggested the construction of Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway to Brooklyn park commissioners in reports prepared in 1866. The proposed Ocean and Eastern Parkways would connect Prospect Park with Coney Island and East New York, respectively. Their plan for the parkways were inspired by boulevards such as Under den Linden in Berlin and Avenue Foch in Paris. However, Ocean and Eastern Parkways were considered to be improvements over these two thoroughfares, since both would contain service roads separated from the main road by tree-lined medians. Olmsted and Vaux intended the parkways to be the center of a parkway system which would connect several parks in Brooklyn. While this plan did not come to fruition, it spurred plans for other park and parkway systems in the United States. At the time, the road was known as Sackett Street. On May 6, 1868, the New York State Legislature approved the street's widening between Washington and Ralph Avenues, the latter street being the boundary of the City of Brooklyn at the time. The grading of the site began in August 1870, and because the road was to run at the top of the high ridge of a moraine, this work was difficult. The grading resulted in the excavation of topsoil that was then used to landscape the medians. Gangs of workmen started to break up stone for gravel, paving stones, and Belgian blocks. By August 10, 1871, grading between Washington and Ralph Avenues had been completed and paving had begun. It was expected that, considering Prospect Park was nearly complete, the parkway would be finished along with the park. By 1874, Eastern Parkway was considered to be completed, and lots were put for sale on the route of the parkway. The Report of the Brooklyn Park Commissioners for the Years 1874-1879, contained a description of \\"Parkways, Avenues, Streets and Roads, graded, paved and otherwise improved by the Brooklyn Park Commissioners\\" between 1866 and 1879. The report classified Ocean Parkway as a \\"gravel roadway\\" and Eastern Parkway as being of \\"macadam stone, Belgian block and cobble\\". Specifically, the main road was paved with macadam while the service roads were of stone blocks. === Later 19th century === View of Eastern Parkway looking toward the Brooklyn Museum, cellulose nitrate negative photograph by Eugene Wemlinger 1903‚Äì1910 Brooklyn Museum In conjunction with the development of Eastern Parkway, a special zoning ordinance was implemented (see ). The plan was supposed to spur \\"first-class\\" construction on the parkway, and according to Brooklyn borough president James S. T. Stranahan, similar development had occurred in Brooklyn Heights and at the original location of Columbia College. However, development was stymied by disputes over the ownership of the \\"East Side Lands\\" of Prospect Park, at the parkway's western end. The park commission was unable to sell it for profit, and so it lay undeveloped until a guarantee company vouched for the title in 1910. Like some later roads on Long Island, Eastern Parkway was designed to use land that was idle because it was high, rocky, and unsuited to farming. The presence of the road, however, made the area residentially desirable for people whose income derived from elsewhere. Thus it became inhabited in the next few decades, while land on slopes to the south and north continued to be used for farms into the 20th century. Eastern Parkway divided the Crow Hill section of Crown Heights to the south and the African American village of Weeksville to the north. The area became known as \\"Doctor's Row\\" due to the high concentration of professionals that moved to the area by the 20th century. While borough president Stranahan originally envisioned one large park between Prospect Park and Jamaica, Queens (with the parks being connected via Eastern Parkway), the city's rapid development made this impossible. Eastern Parkway was originally routed along the current route of Pitkin Avenue east of Ralph Avenue, but a new Eastern Parkway Extension was built in the late 1890s. The extension traveled northeast to near Cemetery of the Evergreens, Highland Park, and the Ridgewood Reservoir at the southwestern end of Brooklyn and Queens' Cemetery Belt. Work started in 1896 and was performed in three phases. A further extension eastward, in the early 20th century, was originally planned as part of Eastern Parkway, but later became Interboro (now Jackie Robinson) Parkway. === 20th and 21st centuries === The intersection with Nostrand Avenue By the early 1900s, the area around Eastern Parkway had been developed; though a few single-family homes had been built, mostly along President Street, the majority of structures did not follow Olmsted's 1868 zoning regulations. The service roads were widened in 1907. The 1900s also brought proposals for New York City Subway lines to Brooklyn, several of which were planned to travel under major arteries in central Brooklyn. It was expected that such construction would accelerate development along their respective corridors. One such route, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s Eastern Parkway Line, was completed between Bowling Green in Manhattan and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn in 1908, running under the East River via the Joralemon Street Tunnel. A second route to the Eastern Parkway Line, the Clark Street Tunnel, opened in 1919. The subway line was further extended under Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway starting in 1915. The section under Eastern Parkway included a tunnel section between Grand Army Plaza and Utica Avenue. In 1920, the Eastern Parkway Line was opened from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue, with four intermediate stops under Eastern Parkway and two additional stations on the route. This resulted in a large migration of Jews and African-Americans, who moved into high-rise buildings along Eastern Parkway. These developments included Copley Plaza and Turner Towers, as well as the Lubavitch world headquarters. In its heyday, Eastern Parkway was seen as a good example of road design; a 1939 Works Progress Administration guidebook stated that Eastern Parkway \\"recalls the Champs-Elysees\\". In 1976, Borough President Sebastian Leone asked the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to designate Eastern Parkway a city scenic landmark, following a similar designation for Ocean Parkway. Two years later, the parkway was declared a scenic landmark. The parkway was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 26, 1983. In 1987, the city announced plans to renovate Eastern Parkway between Grand Army Plaza and Pitkin Avenue. The project entailed installing water and sewage pipes, as well as rebuilding the roadways, sidewalks, and medians. Granite curbs were installed; benches, street lights, and traffic signs were replaced; and a bike lane with hexagonal asphalt blocks was added. The median was replanted and 1,000 trees were added. A $59 million, three-year contract was awarded to Naclerio Contracting Company in 1987, but the company filed bankruptcy in 1990 without finishing the project. Despite this, the city refused to fire Naclerio, though they did file a lawsuit to force the renovation's completion. The project was nearly completed by 1992. In the early 2010s, the section between Grand Army Plaza and Washington Avenue was again reconstructed, this time with a westbound bike lane in the northern median and a traffic light at the intersection with Washington Avenue. In 2017, as part of the Vision Zero traffic-safety plan, the city also proposed installing traffic signals on all of the service roads. == Structures == alt=The design of the original parkway was supposed to spur the construction of prestigious residential structures between Douglas Street to the north and President Street to the south. For the service roads, Olmsted proposed to have exclusively \\"first class\\" residences with buildings set back from the sidewalk. The service roads themselves would be relegated to driveways filled only with greenhouses, carriage houses, and stables. Olmsted believed he could narrow the paved portion of the main road to and widen the medians to . In accordance with this, Douglas and President Streets were widened; the \\"first class\\" housing restriction was implemented, but repealed in 1903 due to a lack of enforcement. Other restrictions were put in place, including a requirement that all proposed plantings be approved first. Today, Eastern Parkway contains a variety of zoning uses. While the parkway is mostly zoned for mid-to-high-rise residential structures, there are also small areas of commercial zoning, as well as industrial zoning at the extreme eastern end, where there is a high concentration of transit-related infrastructure in the area around Broadway Junction. In addition, high-rise zoning is allowed at the western end, especially closer to Grand Army Plaza. Eastern Parkway is lined with one-and-two-family rowhouses, apartment complexes, semi-detached residences, and freestanding mansions. These coexist with some of the grander structures on the parkway, such as the Beaux-Arts Brooklyn Museum and the neoclassical and Modern Classical Central Library. Commercial uses are more common at Franklin, Nostrand, Kingston, Schenectady, and Utica Avenues, where there are subway entrances. Generally, Eastern Parkway Extension has fewer institutions or commercial structures, while predominating in residential or industrial uses. Present-day attractions and notable buildings along Eastern Parkway include the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Public Library's central branch, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Lubavitch world headquarters at 770 Eastern Parkway, Zion Triangle, and the Jewish Children's Museum. There are also numerous parks along Eastern Parkway's route. In addition to Prospect and Highland Parks, Eastern Parkway passes by Mount Prospect Park at its west end, as well as Callahan and Kelly Playground at its eastern end. There are also numerous schools and educational institutions, such as PS 155, PS 157, PS 167, Prospect High School, Clara Barton High School, and Medgar Evers College. In Crown Heights, Eastern Parkway divides the black community to the north and the Jewish community to the south. The separation was highlighted in 1991, when the Crown Heights riot occurred after two Guyanese children were struck (one fatally) by one of the cars in the motorcade of Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Eastern Parkway even divides the two community boards that serve Crown Heights: Brooklyn Community Board 8 to the north and Brooklyn Community Board 9 to the south. == Events == Eastern Parkway is the route of the West Indian Day Parade, a festive annual celebration taking place during J'ouvert, around Labor Day. The parade, which has been held on Eastern Parkway since the late 1960s, attracts between one and three million participants each year. However, the West Indian Day Parade has also been the site of shootings and stabbings on the route, both during and following the parade. ==Transportation== The New York City Subway's IRT Eastern Parkway Line runs under the parkway, with stations at (served by the ), (served by the ), and (both served by the ), and (served by the ). The Broadway Junction station on the is located at the extreme eastern end of Eastern Parkway Extension. The B14 and westbound B17 buses of MTA Regional Bus Operations travel on the parkway for short stretches. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Streets in Brooklyn Category:National Register of Historic Places in Brooklyn Category:Parkways in New York City Category:Frederick Law Olmsted works Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Brooklyn Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Jews and Judaism in Brooklyn Category:New York City scenic landmarks Category:Parks in Brooklyn ","title":"Eastern Parkway"},{"id":"7787854","text":"The Year of the Quiet Sun is a 1970 science fiction novel by American writer Wilson Tucker, dealing with the use of forward time travel to ascertain future political and social events.

Initially assuming her to be a reporter interested in a controversial book he just published on the Dead Sea scrolls, she informs him that she works for the federal Bureau of Standards and that she is recruiting him for a physical survey of the future via a secretly constructed \\"TDV\\" or time displacement vehicle. When Chaney demurs, she informs him that his contract has been purchased from the think tank where he works, leaving him little choice. The reluctant Chaney travels by armored train to a military installation south of Joliet, Illinois. There he is teamed with two diversely talented military officers, United States Air Force Major William Moresby and United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Arthur Saltus. Chaney soon finds that he shares with Saltus an attraction to Kathryn, who is their civilian liaison, but unlike Saltus, Chaney lacks the assertiveness to pursue her aggressively. Instead he focuses his attention on the project, which is soon ordered by the President of the United States to embark on their first mission, a trip two years into the future to discover whether he wins the 1980 presidential election. The three travel to the Thursday after the election on individual trips, with first Moresby and then Saltus going first according to military seniority. Chaney, as a civilian, is the last to leave, but arrives earlier than the others due to a temporal navigation instrument error. They discover that the president, whom Chaney despises as a weak man (in fact, his name is given as \\"President Meeks\\"), wins the election in a landslide as a result of his successful handling of ongoing race riots in Chicago, and that these riots have resulted in the building of a wall down the middle of Cermak Road dividing the north of the city from the south. They also learn that the nation is under martial law after a failed attempt by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take over the government by coup d'√©tat, one thwarted because of the advance knowledge the time travelers will bring back of it. While preparing for their return, Saltus informs Chaney of an additional discovery: a marriage license between him and Kathryn. With Saltus gloating in the knowledge of his inevitably successful courtship, Chaney concedes the pursuit to him. With the success of the initial mission, the three are authorized to travel further into the future. They plan to travel to dates of their own choosing within the coming two decades, with each trip to be separated by approximately a year in order to provide broader coverage. Moresby goes first and travels to July 4, 1999 (\\"It has significance, after all!\\" he says), only to emerge in the middle of a racial civil war in which Chicago had recently been attacked with a nuclear bomb launched from China on behalf of black guerrillas. Quickly getting involved in a battle between base troops and invading \\"ramjets\\", as the black guerrillas are called, Moresby dies in an attack on a ramjet mortar position. Saltus is the next to go, traveling to the date of his 50th birthday in 2000. Upon his arrival he discovers remnants of the battle, and is nearly killed by survivors hiding out on the base. Wounded, he is assisted back to the displacement vehicle by an unknown figure and returns to the present, taking with him a tape-recorded report that Moresby had made upon his arrival. Forewarned by Saltus's experience, Chaney travels further into the future. Not having chosen a date, and disillusioned by his experiences on the 1980 trip, he arrives at an indeterminate point in \\"2000-plus\\", by which time the power from the base's nuclear reactor has been disrupted, causing the chronometers set up for the travelers to shut down. Venturing outside the building, he finds the base to be long-neglected, apart from a cistern and a grave. While further investigating the grave (which is that of Saltus), he is approached by a young man and a woman who identify themselves as Arthur and Kathryn's children. They take Chaney to Kathryn, now elderly, who reveals to Chaney that civilization collapsed as an indirect result of the time travel project; with the information from the future, the president made a series of disastrous decisions that led to war with China, followed by the civil war and societal destruction. When Chaney asks how much of this information he reports, she informs him that he reported none of it, that with the loss of power the time displacement vehicle could no longer return to the past and that Chaney was forever trapped in the future. Although it is foreshadowed earlier in the book, only at this point is the reader explicitly told a fact that makes Chaney's predicament all the more tragic. He is black, the only such member of the project. \\"Everyone fears you; no one will trust you since the rebellion,\\" Kathryn tells him. \\"I am the only one here who does not fear a black man.\\" ==Reception== In her introduction to the 1979 Gregg Press edition of the novel, writer Sandra Miesel praised the novel as \\"an intimate drama of Armageddon played out within the boundaries of Will County, Illinois by a cast of five principals.\\" She noted the way Wilson linked the America of the novel and the Qumran community of ancient Palestine, which are introduced through Chaney's background as a biblical scholar who had published a book on the Dead Sea scrolls prior to the start of the novel. The parallels were made explicit through Biblical motifs that appear throughout the novel, with characters paralleling types out of the Dead Sea scrolls and such apocalyptic imagery as a radioactive Lake Michigan substituting for the lake of fire in the Book of Revelation.Sandra Miesel, \\"Introduction\\", in Wilson Tucker, The Year of the Quiet Sun (Boston: Gregg Press, 1979), pgs. v, xi-xiv. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1970 American novels Category:1970 science fiction novels Category:Novels about time travel Category:Post-apocalyptic novels Category:Novels by Wilson Tucker Category:American science fiction novels Category:Books with cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon Category:Ace Books books Category:Fiction set in 1978 Category:Fiction set in 1980 Category:Fiction set in 1999 Category:Fiction set in 2000 Category:Novels set during World War III ","title":"The Year of the Quiet Sun"},{"id":"7787856","text":"L√©andre Dumouchel (29 March 1811 - September 24, 1882) was a Quebec doctor and political figure.

Since 2010, he has been on his second stint in the Senate, first serving from 2001 to 2007. He was the representative of Batangas' 4th district from 1992 to 2001. In 2007, Recto lost his reelection bid because, as many analysts believed, he had authored the unpopular EVAT (Expanded Value Added Tax) law. In July 2008 he was appointed to head the National Economic and Development Authority in the Arroyo administration, but resigned from his position in August 2009 in preparation for another run for the Senate in the 2010 elections. He is a grandson of statesman Claro M. Recto. His wife is actress-politician Vilma Santos. ==Early life== Recto comes from a political family. His grandfather, the late nationalist and statesman Claro M. Recto, was a Senator for several terms. His father, Atty. Rafael Recto, was an Assemblyman during the Regular Batasang Pambansa while his older brother, Ricky Recto, was the former vice governor of the province of Batangas.

He garnered 98% of the votes cast in those two elections in the 4th District of Batangas. During his three terms (from 1992 to 2001) as a member of the House of Representatives, most of his legislative measures enacted into law deal with economic reforms and poverty alleviation, among which are the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act; the Philippine Economic Zone Law; Amendment to the Special Economic Zone Law; the Retail Trade Liberalization Law; Regional Headquarters Law; and the Comprehensive Tax Reform Law. ===First term in the Senate: 2001‚Äì2007=== Recto was elected to the Senate in 2001, becoming the youngest Senator of the 12th Congress at the age of 37.

He was also chosen to be Serbia's flag bearer at that year's opening ceremony, thereby becoming the first Serbian to carry his country's flag at the Olympic Games. The men's marathon, which lasted , took place on 14 July amid record heat; half the runners did not finish. Toma≈°eviƒá emerged from the marathon \\"battered and bruised\\", finishing 37th out of sixty-eight runners in two hours and 47 minutes. The cause of his injuries remains unknown, but one modern sports writer speculates that Toma≈°eviƒá may have suffered a fall during the run. Following the outbreak of World War I, Toma≈°eviƒá was conscripted by the Royal Serbian Army. He was killed during a skirmish with soldiers of the Imperial German Army in October 1915. Following his death, he became the subject of several urban legends concerning his athletic prowess. Toma≈°eviƒá's native village contains a museum dedicated to his sporting achievements. A commemorative marathon named after Toma≈°eviƒá is held in his native Petrovac na Mlavi every year and a street in Belgrade carries his name. ==Biography== Dragutin Toma≈°eviƒá was born on 20 April 1890 in the village of Bistrica, near the town of Petrovac na Mlavi, to Milo≈° and Stana Toma≈°eviƒá. His father was a merchant and his mother was a seamstress. At the age of 15, his parents sent him to Serbia's capital, Belgrade, to receive an education. From a young age, Toma≈°eviƒá had exhibited a talent for athletics and gymnastics, and upon arriving in Belgrade, he joined a local Sokol organization named after the medieval Serbian emperor Du≈°an the Mighty. Toma≈°eviƒá also competed for the Belgrade Sports Club (; BSK), specializing in the marathon. He won the Obrenovac‚ÄìKo≈°utnjak marathon on ten separate occasions. His first-place finish at the Obrenovac‚ÄìKo≈°utnjak marathon of May 1911, which involved forty other competitors, qualified him to participate in the men's marathon at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, the first Olympic Games in which Serbia took part. Toma≈°eviƒá was one of the first two citizens of Serbia to participate in the Olympics, the other being the sprinter Du≈°an Milo≈°eviƒá. The first Serb to participate in the Olympics was Momƒçilo Tapavica (), a Habsburg Serb who competed for Hungary at the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in tennis in the men's singles competition. At his official farewell before departing for Sweden, Toma≈°eviƒá was presented with a loaf of traditional Serbian bread and a wicker bag by the country's sports and government officials. He was Serbia's flag bearer at the opening ceremony on 6 July 1912, thereby becoming the first Serbian to carry his country's flag at an Olympic opening ceremony. The start of the men's marathon at the 1912 Summer Olympics The men's marathon, which lasted , took place on 14 July amid record-breaking heat; half the participants did not finish. The Portuguese marathon runner Francisco L√°zaro died of heat exhaustion, the first of only two athletes ever to die in competition during the Olympic Games. Toma≈°eviƒá completed the marathon in two hours and 47 minutes, and finished 37th out of sixty-eight runners, prompting speculation in the Serbian tabloid press that he had been poisoned by \\"a beautiful Swedish blonde\\" or \\"pushed into a ditch\\" and held there so as to be prevented from winning. \\"As he came in battered and bruised,\\" the sports writer Nigel McCrery writes, \\"it seems more likely that he fell or was pushed and injured, explaining his condition.\\" The gold medal was won by South Africa's Ken McArthur, the silver by another South African, Christian Gitsham, and the bronze by the American Gaston Strobino.McCrery 2016, p. 106 Upon returning to Serbia, Toma≈°eviƒá began preparing for the 1916 Summer Olympics, which were never held due to the outbreak of World War I. In July 1914, he was conscripted into the Royal Serbian Army and assigned to the 18th Infantry Regiment. By October 1915, he had reached the rank of sergeant. That month, he was seriously wounded while taking part in a skirmish with the Imperial German Army on Bubanj Hill, near Po≈æarevac. Toma≈°eviƒá's fellow soldiers dragged him to cover and he was evacuated from the front, but soon succumbed to his injuries in the village of Ra≈°anac, near Petrovac na Mlavi. Toma≈°eviƒá's body was subsequently returned to his native village and buried in his family's tomb, alongside the trophies he had won during his lifetime. The epitaph on his gravestone reads: \\"He is buried with his mother and his courage.\\"McCrery 2016, p. 106 ==Legacy== A life-size statue of Toma≈°eviƒá in Petrovac na Mlavi A myth that surfaced following Toma≈°eviƒá's death holds that the pathologist who examined his cadaver discovered that the athlete had been born with two hearts.McCrery 2016, p. 106 Another urban legend holds that, in 1909, Toma≈°eviƒá was challenged to race a train from Po≈æarevac to Petrovac na Mlavi by a Serbian transportation firm. He is said to have been waiting for the train as it arrived at the station, to the astonishment of the train conductor and the company's executives. Toma≈°eviƒá's native village contains a museum dedicated to his sporting achievements. A commemorative marathon that takes in Petrovac na Mlavi every year has been named in his honour and a street in Belgrade bears his name.

Although it was performed every 12 years in Bhaktapur, it is performed every 6 years in pokhara valley to better fulfill its cultural role. It was brought more than 236 years ago by Jitaram from Bhaktapur according to the guru Late Mr. Sarbagyaman Pradhananga . The rag (song) sung in this dance indicates that it was started at the time of last Malla King of Bhaktapur, Ranajit Malla. ==Dancers== There are 12 deities in this dance, namely Dagini (Dakini), Kwancha, Bhuccha, Bhairab, Kali Bhairab (Budi Bhairab), Indrayani, Barah, Kumari, Bishnuvi (Vaishnavi), Bramhayani (Brahmani), Maheswori(Gangaju) and Ganesh (Ganesha). Bhairab leads and conducts the dance. Before the dance all performers bathe and wear ceremonial clothes and mask (Khawpa). After wearing the mask no performer can speak until it is taken out. The dance is started at the Bhairab Temple in the evening and after a couple of rounds and puja it is taken to the hosting place where it is performed for around six hours including puja. At first all 12 gods dance. After the puja is complete then individual dance starts. First is Bhairab with Kwancha and Bhuccha which is like a child and adult play. It is called a Jyoti Naach. After that Bhairab, Kali, Indrayani and Barah come. It lasts almost one hour and called a Char Bhairab. It is an energetic dance and most people love to watch this part of the dance. Then come Kumari, Bishnuvi, Bramhayani and Ganga. Then Ganesh dances solo. Then come Kwancha and Bhuchha, again with their like childlike playing. At the end comes Dagini. In the closing act all 12 Bhairabs participate. Then the ending puja is performed and they return to the Bhairab Temple. ==Other similar dances== Comparable dances include the Mahakali Naach of Bhaktapur; the Devi Naach of Kilaghal Tole; the Lakhe Naach of Majipat Tole and the Layaku Bhaila (Royal Bhairab) of Madhyapur Thimi. == Gallery == File:Shiva Bhairab (Bhairab Naach) 01.jpgBhairab File:Kali (Bhairab Naach masks).jpgKali (Budi) Bhairab File:Indraini (Bhairab Naach mask).jpgIndrayani File:Barah (Bhairab Naach masks).jpgBarah File:Kumari (Bhairab Naach masks).jpgKumari File:Bishnuvi (Bhairab Naach mask).jpgBishnuvi File:Bramhayani (Bhairab Naach mask).jpgBramhayani File:Kwancha (Bhairab Naach mask).jpgKawancha File:Bhuccha (Bhairab Naach mask).jpgBhuccha File:Dagini (Bhairab Naach masks).jpgDagini ==External links== * Bhairab Naach Videos in Youtube * Shaphalya Amatya, Some aspects of cultural policy in Nepal, UNESCO, p. 13 * Pokhareli Festival Bhairab Naach Category:Asian dances Category:Newar Category:Masked dances Category:Kaski District ","title":"Bhairab Naach"},{"id":"7787967","text":"frame The Animals in That Country is a 1968 poetry collection written by Canadian author Margaret Atwood.

The genera Aglais, Inachis, Polygonia and Kaniska, were sometimes included as subgenera of Nymphalis\\"Nymphalis Kluk, 1780\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms but they may instead be treated as distinct genera.http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research- curation/research/projects/lepindex/ Lepindex See also anglewing butterflies. For other butterflies named tortoiseshells, see the genus Aglais. The name Nymphalis, established by Jan Krzysztof Kluk in 1780,Nymphalis Kluk, [1780]. ‚Äì Hist. nat. pocz. gospod. 4: 86. ‚Äì TS: Papilio polychloros Linnaeus, 1758 Systema Naturae (Edn. 10) 1: 477. Subsequently designated by Hemming (1933), The Entomologist 66: 223. is the oldest name among the generic names for a relatively small group of butterflies collectively known as anglewing butterflies. In zoological nomenclature, the oldest name has a priority over other names. The collective name anglewing butterflies is derived from a Latinised term Papiliones angulati. This name was probably used for the first time by Ignaz Schifferm√ºller in 1775‚Äì1776. The anglewing butterflies as a group are characterized by a cryptic silhouette and by the colouration and pattern on the ventral side of both wings. This signature mark is an important taxonomic characteristic as well as a significant evolutionary adaptation. During winter months, in latitudes with snow cover, all members of this group hibernate as adult butterflies.Scott, J. A. (1999). Hibernal diapause of North American Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea. Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera 18(3):171-200. During hibernation, hidden in various shelters, the butterflies are dormant. The camouflage provided by crypsis is advantageous to hibernating butterflies. Potential predators will have difficulties in seeing the dormant butterflies. With their wings closed, exposing only the ventral cryptically coloured underside, they blend in with their surroundings. Today, the anglewing butterflies are found only in the northern hemisphere. Carl Linnaeus described the first members of this group in 1758, and it has since become clear that anglewing butterflies evolved from a common ancestor. The most recent studies include Nylin et al., 2001; Wahlberg & Nylin, 2003; Wahlberg et al. 2011, 2009, 2005.

Impetus to study composition seriously came when the S√£o Paulo Municipal String Quartet commissioned a work from Lacerda in 1952.Audi, 4‚Äì5. At this point, Lacerda began lessons with composer Camargo Guarnieri, with whom he would continue to study until 1962 and who helped popularize Lacerda‚Äôs music through recitals.Audi, 5. Alongside his studies with Guarnieri, Lacerda also attended law school at the University of S√£o Paulo, graduating in 1961; after earning his degree he focused mainly on composition.Audi, 5.

Lacerda returned to Brazil after his American studies and festival participation, and from the late 1970s to early 1980s he also studied orchestration with conductor Roberto Schnorenberg.Audi, 6. === Later Life and Career === From the mid-1960s onward, Lacerda‚Äôs career consisted of composing, teaching, writing music textbooks, and promoting the Brazilian national style in art music. He taught at the Escola Municipal de M√∫sica de S√£o Paulo from 1969 to 1992 (a government-funded school providing free instrumental and theory teaching), at Santa Marcelina College, and at several music conferences and festivals. He also assisted Guarnieri by giving new students preparatory lessons in counterpoint and harmony.Audi, 7. He became a member of the Academia Brasileira de M√∫sica in 1972.Di Cavalcanti, 9. Lacerda married pianist Eud√≥xia de Barros (b. 1937) in 1981, and throughout her lifetime she has remained a strong supporter of the composer and his music.Clayton Juliano Rodrigues Miranda, ‚ÄúThe Inception of Trumpet Performance in Brazil and Four Selected Solos for Trumpet and Piano, Including Modern Performance Editions,‚Äù PhD diss., (North Dakota State University, 2016), 55. In 1984 Lacerda founded his third artistic society, the Centro de M√∫sica Brasileira; this organization is still active today.Di Cavalcanti, 9. Date is from \\"Centro de M√∫sica Brasileira,‚Äù Centro de M√∫sica Brasileira, 2018, accessed 18 November 2018, http://centrodemusicabrasileira.blogspot.com. Lacerda also wrote four textbooks that are frequently used in Brazil and Portugal: Comp√™ndio de Teoria Elementar da M√∫sica, Exerc√≠cios de Teoria Elementar da M√∫sica, Curso Preparat√≥rio de Solfejo e Ditado Musical, and Regras de Grafia Musical.Miranda, 7. Lacerda continued to receive honors and awards throughout his mature years. The Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Criticos de Arte awarded him ‚ÄúBest Chamber Work‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Symphonic Work‚Äù for several pieces: Trio for Violin, Cello, and Piano (1970); Quatro pegas modais (1975); Apassionato, cantilena e tocata for viola and piano (1972); Concerto for Flute and String Orchestra (1981); Sonata for Oboe and Piano (1986); and Cromos for Piano and Orchestra (1994).Rubia C. Souza Santos, ‚ÄúSelected Piano Trios By Brazilian Composers in the Succession of M. Camargo Guarnieri,‚Äù PhD diss., (Arizona State University, 2004), 54. He was featured in festivals both in Brazil and the United States, including Sonidos de las Am√©ricas in New York City (1996), the 31st Bar Harbor Music Festival in Maine (1997), and the Latin American Music Festival at Bard College (1999).Souza Santos, 54. == Compositional Style == The Brazilian nationalist musical style that Guarnieri imparted to Lacerda had roots in the writings of aesthetician Mario de Andrade and continued in the vein of composers such as Heitor Villa-Lobos and Francisco Mignone. Composers in this style brought together features of European art music and musical elements from Brazilian folk and popular music, which itself blends European, African, and indigenous musical heritages.David P. Appleby, The Music of Brazil, (Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1983), 145‚Äì153. Guarneri taught that composers should absorb these folk sources so that they could naturally use and transform them in their own compositions.Di Cavalcanti, 9. This nationalist style can generally be described as neoclassical because it draws from the approaches to form, harmony, and melody of the classical Western tradition, combining these with Brazilian and contemporary European sources of inspiration.Di Cavalcanti, 7. In the 1950s, Guarnieri and other composers advocated for the continuation of this national style despite attempts of the M√∫sica Viva movement, led by the German- Brazilian composer Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, to promote dodecaphonic composition in Brazil.Suzel Ana Reily, ‚ÄúBrazil: Central and Southern Areas,‚Äù in The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 2, South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, edited by Dale A. Olsen and Daniel E. Sheehy (New York: Garland, 1998), 306. One characteristic of Lacerda‚Äôs music that reflects his focus on Brazilian traditions is his use of folk dance titles and musical features in many of his instrumental works. Examples of such pieces include his twelve Brasilianas (four-movement piano suites, composed 1965‚Äì1993)Di Cavalcanti, 11. and three pieces for oboe and piano, ‚ÄúAboio,‚Äù ‚ÄúSegunda Valsa,‚Äù and ‚ÄúToada.‚ÄùKeri McCarthy, ‚ÄúOboe Music Reviews: Osvaldo Lacerda,‚Äù The Double Reed 36, no. 1 (January, 2013), 165‚Äì166. He also set Brazilian children‚Äôs music in some works; according to scholar of Brazilian music David Appleby, music for children or about childhood has historically been an important part of the Brazilian tradition.Appleby, 97. Lacerda‚Äôs oboe and piano work ‚ÄúVaria√ß√µes sobre dois cantos infantis‚Äù consists of variations on the children‚Äôs songs ‚ÄúCarneirinho, carneir√£o‚Äù and ‚ÄúSapo Curur√∫.‚ÄùMcCarthy, 165‚Äì166. In his vocal works, Lacerda set texts in Portuguese as well as some African languages spoken in Brazil. One piece written in a mixture of African languages is his choral work Oful√∫ Lor√™r√™: this work is based on a Candombl√© song that Guarnieri recorded in the state of Bahia, and influences from that Afro-Brazilian ritual tradition can be heard in Lacerda‚Äôs treatment of polyphony and rhythm.Gustavo de S√°, ‚ÄúTwo Centuries of Brazilian Choral Music,‚Äù liner notes for Saudade: Choral Music from Brazil, Kammerchor Apollini et Musis, Vinzenz Weissenburger, Rondeau Production ROP6049, 2011, compact disc, 12‚Äì16. In his dissertation, Carlos Audi provides a thorough list of ‚Äúnational elements‚Äù in Lacerda‚Äôs style that come from Brazilian folk and popular genres, including (but not limited to) use of modes, pentatonic scales, melodies with a narrow range, syncopations, ostinatos, and parallel thirds.Audi, 30. Apart from his interest in Brazilian folk and popular sources, Lacerda also took after his teacher Guarnieri in the latter‚Äôs neoclassical use of traditional European forms, such as sonata form or theme and variations.Kristen Lia Smith, ‚ÄúThe Influence of Folk and Popular Music on Twentieth-Century Flute Music of Brazil,‚Äù PhD diss., (University of Cincinnati, 2000), 154. Like Guarnieri, Lacerda also drew from broader currents in twentieth-century Western art music, including contemporary techniques in areas of harmony, rhythm, and atonality.Di Cavalcanti, 10. Lacerda believed that it was important for nationalist composers to be open to new techniques so that their music could be a source of pride for their country.Marilia Gabriela do Nascimento Gimenes, ‚ÄúOsvaldo Lacerda‚Äôs Sonata for Flute and Piano (1959): a Performance Guide With Historical Background of Brazilian Genres Embolada, Seresta, and Bai√£o,‚Äù PhD diss., (University of North Texas, 2012), 12. == Works Lists == A list of Lacerda‚Äôs works can be found in Gerard B√©hague‚Äôs entry on the composer in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart.Gerard B√©hague, ‚ÄúLacerda, Osvaldo (Costa de),‚Äù in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, vol. 10, Personenteil Kem-Ler, edited by Friedrich Blume (Kassel: B√§renreiter-Verlag, 2003), 964‚Äì965.

Built in 1707 by James Pope the chapel was the place of worship for nonconformists. In 1717 there were a thousand ‚Äòhearers‚Äô in the congregation. In 1773, a split in the congregation of Rook Lane led to the establishment of another Congregational Church, Zion, in Whittox Lane. As other chapels opened, however, there was a gradual decline in attendees and in 1933 the pastor‚Äôs salary was reduced by ¬£20 to ¬£205 (). In 1965 the chapel merged with the Zion Chapel and Rook Lane eventually closed in 1968. It was sold to developers but they were unable to secure planning permission for proposed future uses. Lead and tiles were stolen from the roof, vandals broke in, smashed all the memorials and brought down the gallery. The building was square with two pillars supporting the roof and a gallery around three sides. There are two tiers of seven windows, and a central pediment spanning five windows. Side lobbies were added in a matching style in 1862 for stairs to the gallery. Over the main door is an inscription from Ecclesiastes 5:1: \\"Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House of God\\". There is a domed roof structure which is still intact. It is said that this chapel was locally known as \\"The Cupola\\". It was bought by the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust which, with help from a grant from English Heritage, restored the Grade I listed building. The building is now owned by NVB, a firm of architects, who have converted it into a community facility for exhibitions, receptions, meetings and concerts, including chamber music, on the ground floor now run by the architects practice with this function known as Rook Lane. www.rooklane.org.uk The galleried upper floor is used as office space by the architects. The building is also licensed for weddings. == References == Frome Rook Frome Category:Tourist attractions in Somerset Category:Churches completed in 1707 Category:Frome Category:Former churches in Somerset Category:1707 establishments in Great Britain ","title":"Rook Lane Chapel"},{"id":"7788111","text":"David Luther Roberts (born July 23, 1951) is a retired American pole vaulter.

In universal algebra, a signature lists the operations that characterize an algebraic structure. In model theory, signatures are used for both purposes. Signatures play the same role in mathematics as type signatures in computer programming. They are rarely made explicit in more philosophical treatments of logic. == Definition == Formally, a (single-sorted) signature can be defined as a triple œÉ = (Sfunc, Srel, ar), where Sfunc and Srel are disjoint sets not containing any other basic logical symbols, called respectively * function symbols (examples: +, √ó, 0, 1) and * relation symbols or predicates (examples: ‚â§, ‚àà), and a function ar: Sfunc \\\\cup Srel ‚Üí \\\\mathbb N which assigns a natural number called arity to every function or relation symbol. A function or relation symbol is called n-ary if its arity is n. A nullary (0-ary) function symbol is called a constant symbol. A signature with no function symbols is called a relational signature, and a signature with no relation symbols is called an algebraic signature. A finite signature is a signature such that Sfunc and Srel are finite. More generally, the cardinality of a signature œÉ = (Sfunc, Srel, ar) is defined as œÉ = Sfunc + Srel. The language of a signature is the set of all well formed sentences built from the symbols in that signature together with the symbols in the logical system. == Other conventions == In universal algebra the word type or similarity type is often used as a synonym for \\"signature\\". In model theory, a signature œÉ is often called a vocabulary, or identified with the (first-order) language L to which it provides the non- logical symbols. However, the cardinality of the language L will always be infinite; if œÉ is finite then L will be ‚Ñµ0. As the formal definition is inconvenient for everyday use, the definition of a specific signature is often abbreviated in an informal way, as in: :\\"The standard signature for abelian groups is œÉ = (+,‚àí,0), where ‚àí is a unary operator.\\" Sometimes an algebraic signature is regarded as just a list of arities, as in: :\\"The similarity type for abelian groups is œÉ = (2,1,0).\\" Formally this would define the function symbols of the signature as something like f0 (nullary), f1 (unary) and f2 (binary), but in reality the usual names are used even in connection with this convention. In mathematical logic, very often symbols are not allowed to be nullary, so that constant symbols must be treated separately rather than as nullary function symbols. They form a set Sconst disjoint from Sfunc, on which the arity function ar is not defined. However, this only serves to complicate matters, especially in proofs by induction over the structure of a formula, where an additional case must be considered. Any nullary relation symbol, which is also not allowed under such a definition, can be emulated by a unary relation symbol together with a sentence expressing that its value is the same for all elements. This translation fails only for empty structures (which are often excluded by convention). If nullary symbols are allowed, then every formula of propositional logic is also a formula of first-order logic. An example for an infinite signature uses Sfunc = {+} ‚à™ {fa: a ‚àà F} and Srel = {=} to formalize expressions and equations about a vector space over an infinite scalar field F, where each fa denotes the unary operation of scalar multiplication by a. This way, the signature and the logic can be kept single- sorted, with vectors being the only sort. Here: p.173. == Use of signatures in logic and algebra == In the context of first-order logic, the symbols in a signature are also known as the non-logical symbols, because together with the logical symbols they form the underlying alphabet over which two formal languages are inductively defined: The set of terms over the signature and the set of (well-formed) formulas over the signature. In a structure, an interpretation ties the function and relation symbols to mathematical objects that justify their names: The interpretation of an n-ary function symbol f in a structure A with domain A is a function fA: An ‚Üí A, and the interpretation of an n-ary relation symbol is a relation RA ‚äÜ An. Here An = A √ó A √ó ... √ó A denotes the n-fold cartesian product of the domain A with itself, and so f is in fact an n-ary function, and R an n-ary relation. == Many-sorted signatures == For many-sorted logic and for many-sorted structures signatures must encode information about the sorts. The most straightforward way of doing this is via symbol types that play the role of generalized arities.Many-Sorted Logic, the first chapter in Lecture notes on Decision Procedures, written by Calogero G. Zarba. === Symbol types === Let S be a set (of sorts) not containing the symbols √ó or ‚Üí. The symbol types over S are certain words over the alphabet S \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\times, \\\\to\\\\\\\\}: the relational symbol types s1 √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó sn, and the functional symbol types s1 √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó sn‚Üís‚Ä≤, for non-negative integers n and s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_n, s' \\\\in S. (For n = 0, the expression s1 √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó sn denotes the empty word.) === Signature === A (many-sorted) signature is a triple (S, P, type) consisting of * a set S of sorts, * a set P of symbols, and * a map type which associates to every symbol in P a symbol type over S. == Notes == == References == * Free online edition. * == External links == * Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \\"Model theory\\"‚Äîby Wilfred Hodges. * PlanetMath: Entry \\"Signature\\" describes the concept for the case when no sorts are introduced. * Baillie, Jean, \\"An Introduction to the Algebraic Specification of Abstract Data Types.\\" Category:Model theory Category:Universal algebra ","title":"Signature (logic)"},{"id":"7788163","text":"Poritia is a genus of lycaenid butterflies.

She was the forerunner to a generation of African women writers, and was also acknowledged as the first African woman novelist to be published in the English language in Britain. She achieved international recognition,Margaret Busby, \\"Flora Nwapa\\", Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent (1992), Vintage: 1993, p. 399. with her first novel Efuru, published in 1966 at the age of 30 years by Heinemann Educational Books. While never considering herself a feminist, she was best known for recreating life and traditions from an Igbo woman's viewpoint.Susan Leisure, \\"Nwapa, Flora\\", Postcolonial Studies @ Emory, Emory University, Fall 1996. Nwapa is also known for her governmental work in reconstruction after the Biafran War, in particular, she worked with orphans and refugees who were displaced during the war. Furthermore, she published African literature and promoted women in African society.Literary Encyclopedia She was one of the first African women publishers when she founded Tana Press in Nigeria in 1970. ==Biography== ===Early years and education=== Nwapa was born in Oguta,Hamilton, Janice, Nigeria in Pictures, p. 71. in south-eastern Nigeria, the eldest of the six children of Christopher Ijeoma (an agent with the United Africa Company) and Martha Nwapa, a teacher of drama.\\"Interesting Things About Flora Nwapa, Nigeria‚Äôs First Female Novelist\\", Information Nigeria, 1 March 2013. Flora Nwapa attended school in Oguta, Secondary School at Elelenwa in Port Harcourt and Lagos. At the age of 22 years she entered the university in 1953 and earned a B.A degree at the age of 26 years from University College, Ibadan, in 1957. She then went to Scotland, where she earned a Diploma in Education from Edinburgh University in 1958.Hannan, Martin, \\"Untold stories of Edinburgh University alumni told in new project\\", The National, 3 December 2018. ===Family life=== Flora Nwapa had three children Ejine Nzeribe (from her previous relationship), Uzoma Gogo Nwakuche and Amede Nzeribe. She was married to Chief Gogo Nwakuche. Her uncle, AC Nwapa was Nigeria's first Minister of Commerce and Industries, according to The House of Nwapa, the documentary by Onyeka Nwelue. ===Teaching and public service=== After returning to Nigeria, Nwapa joined the Ministry of Education in Calabar as an Education Officer until 1959. She then took employment as a teacher at Queen's School in Enugu, where she taught English and geography from 1959 to 1962. She continued to work in both education and the civil service in several positions, including as Assistant Registrar, University of Lagos (1962‚Äì67). After the Nigerian civil war of 1967‚Äì70, she accepted cabinet office as Minister of Health and Social Welfare in East Central State (1970‚Äì71), and subsequently as Minister of Lands, Survey and Urban Development (1971‚Äì74). She was a visiting lecturer at Alvan Ikoku College of Education in Owerri, Nigeria. In 1989, she was appointed a visiting professor of creative writing at University of Maiduguri. ===Writing and publishing=== Nwapa's first book, Efuru, was published in 1966 at the age of 30 years and is considered a pioneering work as an English- language novel by an African woman writer. She sent the transcript to the famous Nigerian author Chinua Achebe in 1962, who replied with a very positive letter and even included money for the postage to mail the manuscript to the English publisher, Heinemann.Ainehi Edoro, Flora Nwapa and the Letter That Changed Nigerian Literature Forever, thejournalist.org.za, retrieved March 2017Ezenwa-Ohaeto, Chinua Achebe: A Biography, p. 93, (), via google-books It was followed by the other novels such as Idu (1970), Never Again (1975), One is Enough (1981), and Women are Different (1986). She published two collections of storiesThis is Lagos (1971) and Wives at War (1980)and the volume of poems, Cassava Song and Rice Song (1986). She is also the author of several books for children. In the year 1974, she founded Tana Press, and in 1977 the Flora Nwapa Company, publishing her own adult and children's literature as well as works by other writers.Hans M. Zell, \\"Publishing and Book Development in Africa: A Bibliography\\" (Studies on Books and Reading, UNESCO), p.4. She gave as one of her objectives: \\"to inform and educate women all over the world, especially Feminists (both with capital F and small f) about the role of women in Nigeria, their economic independence, their relationship with their husbands and children, their traditional beliefs and their status in the community as a whole\\".\\"Frankfurt Book Fair 1980\\", Flora Nwapa interviewed in The African Book Publishing Record, Vol. VII, No. 1, 1981, p. 6. Tana has been described as \\"the first press run by a woman and targeted at a large female audience. A project far beyond its time at a period when no one saw African women as constituting a community of readers or a book-buying demographic.\\"\\"Flora Nwapa and the Letter That Changed Nigerian Literature Forever\\" , Brittle Paper, 3 February 2016. At the beginning of Nwapa's literary career, as a result of the way feminism was viewed and the way it was portrayed, she had no interest in feminism because she felt it was prejudiced against men but she eventually came to terms with it. However, her struggle with feminism is representative of the present conversations about the movement in Africa and the world at large. Her work was anthologised in publications ranging from Pr√©sence Africaine and Black Orpheus in the 1960s and '70s to Daughters of Africa in 1992.Berrian, Brenda F., \\"Flora Nwapa (1931‚Äì1993): A Bibliography\\", Research in African Literatures, Vol. 26, No. 2, Flora Nwapa (Summer 1995), pp. 124‚Äì129. ===Later years=== Nwapa's career as an educator continued throughout her life and encompassed teaching at colleges and universities internationally, including at New York University, Trinity College, the University of Minnesota, the University of Michigan and the University of Ilorin. She said in an interview with Contemporary Authors, \\"I have been writing for nearly thirty years.

The region was held by the Counts of Tyrol from the 12th century onwards and acquired by the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1363. In 1559 a paper mill was established at Wattens, the first in the Austrian lands. The local economy was further promoted, when in 1895 Daniel Swarovski (1862‚Äì1956), a glass cutter from Ji≈ôet√≠n pod Bukovou in Bohemia, settled here to start the production of crystal jewelry. Wattens received market rights in 1895. ==Population== ==Economy== Giant waterspout at the entrance of 'Swarovski Kristallwelten'' The Swarovski company is Wattens' main employer. In 1995, it celebrated its one-hundred-years jubilee by the establishment of the Swarovski Kristallwelten museum. Andr√© Heller designed several cabinets of curiosities modelled on the historic chambers of Ambras Castle. The museum features the history of crystal manufacturing, the life of Daniel Swarovski and a large collection of crystals including works by notable artists like Brian Eno and Niki de Saint Phalle. It is today one of the major tourist destinations in Austria, attracting visitors from all over the world. Other museums are the typewriter museum and the Museum Wattens, dedicated to the history of Swarovski, the paper mill and excavations (Prehistory, Classical antiquity) in Wattens, as well as in neighbouring Volders and Fritzens. The historic paper mill is the predecessor of the Wattenspapier factory, one of the leading manufacturers of rolling paper, since 1980 owned by the Finnish Delfort Group. 97% of the tobacco paper is exported to over 90 countries. ==Notable people== Portrait of Jakob Gapp at the St Mary's parish church Wattens is the birthplace of the Marianist priest Jakob Gapp (1897‚Äì1943). Openly rejecting the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, Gapp fled to France and upon the French defeat in 1940 to Valencia in Spain, where he preached against the persecution of Catholic resistance fighters by the Nazi authorities. In November 1942 he was captured by Gestapo agents in German-occupied France and deported to Berlin. At trial of the People's Court led by President Roland Freisler, he was sentenced to death and was executed at Pl√∂tzensee Prison. A Christian martyr of the Catholic Church, Gapp was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1996. ==Climate== Climate type is dominated by the winter season, a long, bitterly cold period with short, clear days, relatively little precipitation mostly in the form of snow, and low humidity.

Wilkins qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but did not compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. Wilkins won a silver medal in the discus throw at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. He placed 5th in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. ==World records== Wilkins broke the world record four times in his career. During his discus throw series on May 1, 1976 in San Jose, California, he set the world record three times with consecutive throws of 69.80 m, 70.24 m, and 70.86 m.

It was his first novel, written when he was 26 years old, and received a great deal of critical acclaim. After graduating from Duke University in 1947, Styron took an editing position with McGraw-Hill in New York City. After provoking his employers into firing him, he set about writing his first novel in earnest. Three years later, he published the novel, Lie Down in Darkness. Styron had first written the book under the working title Inheritance of Night; he made two revisions of the draft before publishing it under its eventual title. Among the honors bestowed on Lie Down in Darkness was the prestigious Rome Prize, awarded by the American Academy in Rome and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Styron was unable to immediately accept the award because he was recalled into the military during the Korean War. ==Plot== The novel is about the dysfunctional Virginian Loftis family. It centers on the funeral of Peyton Loftis, one of the daughters, with previous events told in flashbacks by the other characters. The young, psychologically vulnerable Peyton is attached to her father, but finds her mother, Helen, emotionally remote and oppressive. Helen loathes the spoiled and beautiful Peyton, whom she characterizes as a whore. She has given all her love to her crippled daughter, Maudie, leaving no affection for Peyton or her own husband, Milton, who finds solace in a shallow mistress. Milton, who adores Peyton, turns to alcohol as he is spurned by Helen and as Peyton slips away from the family circle. Peyton's marriage is a disaster, also, and she eventually commits suicide. The penultimate section of the story is related in a stream of consciousness style by Peyton herself. In the last part, a recreation of a revivalist meeting, it is suggested that only the Loftis family's black servants may experience genuine mourning for Peyton. Styron incorporated many actual portions of his home town, the Hilton Village section of Newport News, Virginia. The character of Helen contains some elements of Styron's own stepmother. Part of the story occurs at the James River Country Club, which is still in operation today. ==Film adaptation== In August 2012, Scott Cooper was announced as the director of the film adaptation. Word got out that Kristen Stewart was cast in the lead role of Peyton. However regarding casting, the film's production company released the following statement: \\"While it's exciting to see all the interest the project is generating, the film is still in the pre-production process and no offers to cast have been made as of yet.\\" ==References== Category:1951 American novels Category:Novels by William Styron Category:Novels set in Virginia Category:Newport News, Virginia Category:Novels about suicide Category:1951 debut novels ","title":"Lie Down in Darkness (novel)"},{"id":"7788274","text":"Gary James Oakes (born 21 September 1958 in Kentish Town, Camden, London) is a male British retired athlete who mainly competed in the men's 400 metre hurdles. ==Athletics career== Oakes competed for Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow, Soviet Union, where he won the bronze medal in the 400 metre hurdles.

It is part of a trilogy centering on the character of David Meredith. The other books in the trilogy are Clean Straw for Nothing and A Cartload of Clay. Its text is commonly studied for many English literature subjects in Australia. ==Overview== This semi-autobiographical novel follows the narrator, David Meredith, through his childhood and adolescence in interwar Melbourne through to adulthood and his journalism career during World War II. The novel constantly contrasts him with his older and more \\"typically Australian\\", brother, Jack. The book chronicles the life of an average Australian bloke in interwar Australian society. Jack Meredith is a liked and tough man, uneducated but hardworking and decent, who grew up suffering during the Great Depression. His younger brother has a successful and prominent career as a journalist, although the narrator's personal life is empty, unlike that of his more physical, less intellectual, more \\"Aussie\\" brother Jack. Jack is a post- colonial archetype of Australian men: a type that has largely disappeared from reality with the modernisation of Australia however the image lingers and continues to influence the national psyche. The novel describes the \\"Aussie bloke\\" ‚Äì physical, unintellectual ‚Äì and his place in interwar Australian history with affection and a certain respect. The book was made into an Australian TV series (2001). ==Awards and nominations== My Brother Jack won the Miles Franklin Award in 1964. ==1965 TV series== The book was serialised for ABC in 1965 by Charmian Clift, who was also Johnston's wife. It featured actors Ed Devereaux, Nick Tate and Richard Meikle. ==2001 TV series== It was adapted again in 2001 by John Alsop and Sue Smith.

It is similar in form to a European seabass, with a pearly-silver coloration and a yellow-coloured mouth. Length can range from 40‚Äì50 cm to 2 m long, with weights up to 55 kg. ==Description== Argyrosomus regius has a relatively large head with quite small eyes, the large mouth is at the terminal position and it has an elongated body. The lateral line is easily seen and extends all the way to the caudal fin. The rear dorsal fin is much longer than first one which has nine rays. The first ray of the anal fin is short and spiny while the second is very thin. The swim bladder contains several branched appendages which are vibrated to make a grunting sound which can be heard from up to 30m away and this grunting is produced by the males during the spawning season. Body colour pearly-silver, with bronze traits dorsally. The fin bases are reddish brown and mouth cavity yellow-gold or salmon pink. The scales are large and every fourth scale is set at a different angle from the rest. It can grow to 2m in length and 50 kg in weight. left ==Distribution== Argyrosomus regius is found in the eastern Atlantic from Norway to West Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It has colonised the Red Sea by migrating through the Suez Canal. In Europe it is rare off the British Isles (three records) and Scandinavia. ==Behaviour and life history== Argyrosomus regius is a demersal, oceanodromous fish which is found in inshore waters and on the continental shelf, it can occur close to the bottom as well as in surface and mid-waters. The adults prey on grey mullet and clupeids such as sardines which are actively pursued in open water. The adults gather in inshore waters to spawn during spring and summer. The juveniles and subadults prefer estuaries and coastal lagoons, and the health of recruitment into the adult population is possibly determined by the availability of these habitats. These fish are migratory, at all ages, migrating along shore or between offshore and inshore waters in response to temperature changes. A. regius feeds on fishes and swimming crustaceans and mostly occurs over sand, close to rocks, at 1‚Äì200 m max, but commonly found at 15‚Äì100 m. The three main spawning sites in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea are the Nile delta, L√©vrier Bay, and the Gironde estuary and with large numbers of adults congregate at these sites between May and July. Large schools of A. regius occur around wrecked ships that were deliberately sunk to create new habitat for a number of commercially caught species of fish. Most of their growth happens during the summer months and feeding activity is significantly reduced when the water temperature drops below 13-15 ¬∞C. The newly hatched juveniles leave the estuaries where they spend the first few months at the end of summer and move into coastal waters with depths between 20 and 40 m where they spend the winter months. In the following Spring they return to their estuarine feeding areas from the middle of May. Water temperature is the most important factor that determines the trophic migration and reproduction of meagre. An adult female A. regius measuring 1.2m in length produces about 800,000 eggs and spawning occurs when the water temperature is 17-22 ¬∞C. The juveniles eat small demersal fish and crustaceans switching to pelagic fish and cephalopods once they grow to 30‚Äì40 cm in length. ==Fisheries== Argyrosomus regius is fished for commercially using trawls, long lines, and hand lines. It is also a sport fishing quarry species. Specimens of 1.8 m in length and over 50 kg in weight which were landed in Portugal in 2002 fetched over ‚Ç¨200. The main meagre fisheries are currently in Mauritania, Morocco, and Egypt and these account for over 80% of the annual world catch of around 10,000 tonnes. The European fisheries are comparatively small and are on the Atlantic coasts of Spain, Portugal and France with annual catches of 800 t in France, 400 t in Portugal and 150 t in Spain. ==Aquaculture== The farming of Argyrosomus regius is still rather experimental and involves intensive production, in land-based tanks and sea cages. There are few facilities established mainly in southern France where they are in the Camargue, Cannes, and Corsica, in Huelva, Spain, and at La Spezia and Ortobello in Italy. ==References== ==External links== *List of names in the various countries *Taxonomy of genus Argyrosomus Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fish of the North Sea Category:Fish of the Black Sea Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Fish of the Baltic Sea Category:Fish of Europe Category:Fish of Western Asia Category:Sciaenidae Category:Fish described in 1801 Category:Taxa named by Ignacio Jord√°n Claudio de Asso y del R√≠o ","title":"Argyrosomus regius"},{"id":"7788370","text":"Euploea is a genus of milkweed butterflies.

He is the eldest son of the late millionaire businessman Robert Holmes √† Court and Janet Holmes √† Court. He was well known as a joint owner of the National Rugby League team South Sydney Rabbitohs together with Russell Crowe from 2006 until 2014. ==Education== After completing his schooling at Geelong Grammar School in Corio, he read law at Oxford University and received his BA in economics and theatre from Middlebury College, Vermont. ==Back Row Productions== In 1993 Holmes √† Court founded Back Row Productions, operating in New York City, London and Sydney. Back Row produced at least twenty live shows in thirty countries and 300 cities worldwide. Back Row Productions, produced and promoted tours of ‚ÄúTap Dogs‚Äù and standup turns by comics Eddie Izzard and Jerry Seinfeld. It staged shows in 30 countries and turned out ancillary videos, CDs and DVDs. Back Row expanded rapidly due to a succession of successful productions including Tap Dogs and Jerry Seinfeld. Based in New York, it had several productions (seven of which were Tap Dogs) running in three markets - USA, Australia and America. In three years, it had achieved a pounds 4m turnover and Holmes a Court had clear ambitions to take over the theatre-producing world. The deal would involve a merger between his New York- based partnership, Back Row Productions, and Livent. It would also bring about an alliance with London's leading theatre owner, Stoll Moss, which is owned by the Holmes √† Court family. In a move every bit as dramatic as the share raids of his late father, Mr. Peter Holmes √† Court was poised to emerge as a leading player in the American theatrical entertainment business. In 1994 Holmes √† Court put together an off-Broadway rock musical, Fallen Angel. The show was open for three weeks and lost most of Holmes √† Court's available capital as well as the capital put in by investors. Peter's mother, Janet Holmes √† Court's official biography states: \\"Newly married, Peter Holmes √† Court was impatient for success and not interested in working in a hands-on way to learn the theatre business, as someone like Cameron Mackintosh had done. Peter had some tough lessons early. Billy Boesky's rock and roll musical, Fallen Angel, was Peter's first off-Broadway show, which he put together in 1994. It stayed open three weeks and lost most of Peter's available capital and that of some investor's close to home who weren't happy with the result\\".Edgar, Patricia (1999). Janet Holmes √† Court. Australia. Harper Collins. . p.349 The official biography Tap Dogs was the instant hit of the Sydney Theatre Festival where it had its world premi√®re in January 1995 and where Back Row‚Äôs founders Peter Holmes √† Court and Liz Koops first witnessed the magic of Dein Perry‚Äôs revolutionary show. Its success was infectious. Peter toured 10 UK cities with Tap Dogs, a show in which six hunky guys sweat it out tap-dancing on metal, before putting the pounds 500,000 product into a Stoll Moss theatre. ==Return to Australia== In 1996 Holmes √† Court became involved in a dispute over a contracted tour of Lift-Off Live, a spin-off of an Australian Broadcasting Corporation educational television show, Lift Off, which was booked and scheduled. Holmes √† Court wanted to close the show down, despite contractual obligations. To make things more complicated his mother Janet's company, Heytesbury, was an investor in Lift Off and was entitled to income from ancillary rights. Janet Holmes √† Court's biographer, Patricia Edgar, details the incident in another book, Bloodbath: a memoir of Australian television, stating that Back Row Productions was also in financial trouble. Edgar describes how Janet initially reacted to the situation by attempting to force Peter to meet his obligations, but later wanted to assume the Back Row Productions' debt and pay out of her own pocket to save her son from ignominy. \\"Janet suggested that she assume Back Row's debt with the Foundation and pay out of her own pocket. She knew Peter was in financial difficulties and this was a way to avert further damage...\\"Edgar, Patricia (2006). Bloodbath: a memoir of Australian television. Australia. Melbourne University Publishing. . pp.368‚Äì370 In 2000 Holmes √† Court settled out of court with his family to gain his inheritance from the family company, Heytesbury. Holmes √† Court's father, Robert Holmes √† Court, died intestate leaving his wife Janet one third of the family fortune with the four children getting the other two-thirds. The amount Peter Holmes √† Court received was reported as A$35 million. At the same time he took up the position as chief executive officer of the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) and was responsible for re-listing AACo on the Australian Stock Exchange. With his younger brother Paul Holmes √† Court in charge of Heytesbury, Peter had effectively set himself up in competition with his family's primary business. In 2004 Holmes √† Court stood down from the post of CEO of the AACo. ==South Sydney Rabbitohs== In March 2006 Holmes √† Court and Russell Crowe gained 75% ownership of the South Sydney Rabbitohs through a vote of the Membership of the club. Holmes √† Court became Executive Chairman of the club. In early 2008 he became CEO of the Rabbitohs after Shane Richardson resigned and took up a position as Director of Sports Operations in Holmes √† Court's company The Passionate Group in October 2007. In May 2008 Holmes √† Court resigned as Executive Chairman and CEO of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Some reports suggested that Holmes √† Court had been forced to stand down after his relationship with Crowe had deteriorated. At the same time as Holmes √† Court stood aside, the previous CEO, Shane Richardson, was subsequently re-appointed to the role of CEO of the Rabbitohs. Nick Pappas was also re-appointed as chairman. In April 2009, Holmes √† Court was recalled to the witness box in the NSW Supreme Court in a defamation case brought against him by Tony Papaconstuntinos, known as Tony Papa, a Member of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Holmes √† Court said that Russell Crowe had hired San Francisco- based husband-and-wife team Palladino & Sutherland ( Jack Palladino ), to do surveillance work on people opposed to their planned takeover of the South Sydney Football Club. Holmes a Court admitted that Crowe had engaged the investigators but that he had also given instructions to Sandra Sutherland and the firm had used its \\"Australian associates\\" to conduct surveillance of the \\"no\\" campaign. In August 2009 it was revealed by The Sydney Morning Herald that Holmes √† Court had ignored NSW Supreme Court orders for payment of costs to several people who had been subpoenaed by Holmes √† Court in the Tony Papa defamation case. The newspaper revealed, on 22 August 2009, that writs for levy of property had been taken out by two long-time members of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. This action designated Holmes √† Court a \\"judgement debtor\\" and enabled the NSW Sheriff's office to seize property on behalf of the two Rabbitohs Members. On 4 September 2009, Holmes √† Court was found, by Justice Lucy McCallum in the NSW Supreme Court, to have defamed Tony Papaconstuntinos. Justice McCallum ordered Holmes √† Court to pay A$25,000 and all costs. Holmes √† Court claimed a \\"moral victory\\". In March 2010 Holmes √† Court resigned as a director of the Rabbitohs, but remained a 37.5% shareholder in partnership with Russell Crowe until 2014. In October 2014, less than a month after the club's 2014 premiership, Holmes √† Court sold his stake in the club to casino entrepreneur and Sydney Roosters fan James Packer. ==Current activities== Holmes √† Court is the Chairman of White Bull Holdings, a private investment company. He is also a director of ISFM, The Passionate Group, and Viocorp. In March 2010 Holmes √† Court resigned as a director of Queensland Rail, having served on the board since 2006. Holmes √† Court is a member of the Lord Mayor's City of Sydney Business Forum. In April 2010 he was appointed as head of the 'Greater Sydney Partnership', a NSW Government initiative to promote Sydney globally. In November 2010 the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that Holmes √† Court was departing from the Greater Sydney Partnership. He said his departure just eight months after he took on the role of chairman was \\"premature\\". Holmes √† Court also said he was \\"not thrilled at the prospect of sitting at home alone\\", as his wife and children were leaving for Europe and \\"plans to set himself up in a farmhouse to write a book\\". == Riding with Giants == In January 2020 Viking published that book as Riding With Giants: My struggles with modern capitalism, the lessons from children and the joys of cycling fast. Riding with Giants is a book about struggles with modern capitalism, Peter‚Äôs lessons from children and the joys of cycling fast. Peter narrates how he left a privileged life and moved to France where he led a rather lonely life while his seven year old girls asked ‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù Alison Walsh writes in The Courier Mail that the book ‚Äú reveals how the move to France changed his life in every way, although his growing connection with his girls, who were having difficulties fitting in at the local school, is the constant thread.‚Äù In 2011, Peter took a sabbatical to show his children Europe. While at it, he planned to ride L'Etape du Tour, the challenging amateur leg of the Tour de France. To do this, he needed a bike. In an effort to find some new friends in the community - and a bike for the race - he discovered a 50-year old bicycle factory that custom fits cycles. In June 2011 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Holmes √† Court had stepped down from the Barangaroo Delivery Authority Board after missing three consecutive board meetings while on sabbatical in France. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Australian chief executives Category:Holmes √† Court family Category:Rugby league people in Australia Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:People educated at Geelong Grammar School Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:Rugby league chairmen and investors ","title":"Peter Holmes √† Court"},{"id":"7788381","text":"Funny Games may refer to: * Funny Games (1997 film), an Austrian horror film * Funny Games (2007 film), a shot-for-shot remake of the 1997 film by the same director ==See also== * Fun and Games (disambiguation) ","title":"Funny Games"},{"id":"7788386","text":"Media Puzzle (May 7, 1997 ‚Äì June 22, 2006), foaled in the United States was an IrishDamien Oliver recalls miracle Herald Sun, retrieved 2006-09-07 horse best known for his win in the 2002 Melbourne Cup. ==Background== Media Puzzle was bred by Walter Haefner's Moyglare Stud Farm and owned by Dr. M.

Tillie the Toiler is a newspaper comic strip created by cartoonist Russ Westover who initially worked on his concept of a flapper character in a strip he titled Rose of the Office. With a title change, it sold to King Features Syndicate which carried the strip from January 3, 1921 to March 15, 1959. The daily strip began on Monday, January 3, 1921, followed by the Sunday page on October 10, 1922. Westover retired in 1951 with his assistant Bob Gustafson then doing most of the writing and drawing. After Westover departed completely three years later, Gustafson's signature appeared on the strip beginning October 4, 1954. The daily strip ended March 7, 1959, with the last Sunday eight days later on March 15.Toonopedia\\" Tillie the Toiler ==Characters and story== Stylish working girl Tillie was employed as a stenographer, secretary and part-time model. An attractive brunette, she had no problem finding men to escort her around town. Comics historian Don Markstein described the story situations: :Tillie (last name Jones) toiled for a fashionable women's wear company run by clothing mogul J. Simpkins. Or usually did, anyway‚Äîshe'd occasionally quit or be fired, as the plotline, which ran at breakneck pace and didn't always make perfect sense, required. During World War II, in fact, she even joined the U.S. Army. But she always came back to Simpkins. Mostly, she worked in his office, but she also did a little modeling. Whatever she did and wherever she went, however, she was impeccably dressed in the very latest styles. (Except when she was in the army, of course.) This helped her in the pursuit of charming and often wealthy young men, who came and went at an alarming rate, providing grist for the story mill. She did, however, have one steady male associate, Clarence \\"Mac\\" MacDougall, a short, bulb-nosed co-worker who loved her persistently even though she returned little of the feeling. ==Toppers== For the Sunday page, Westover produced a series of topper strips, starting with Kitty Change-Her- Mind (Jan 10‚ÄìMarch 14, 1926) and The Counter Kids (March 21‚ÄìMay 2, 1926). On May 9, 1926, Westover began a topper series that would run for two decades ‚Äì first called The Van Zippers (May 9‚ÄìAug 15, 1926), then The Van Swaggers (Aug 22, 1926 ‚Äì June 26, 1938) and finally The Van Swaggers Starring Aunt Min (July 3, 1938 ‚Äì 1943?) There was also a paper-doll panel that appeared next to the topper, Tillie the Toiler's Fashion Parade, which ran from April 24, 1932 until 1951. ==Reprints== Cupples & Leon collected the strips into book form in 1925, followed by seven other books in that series. Dell Comics reprinted the strip in 14 issues between 1941 and 1949. Tillie the Toiler and the Masquerading Duchess was a novel published by Whitman in 1943. ==Films== The comic strip inspired two films of the same name: Tillie the Toiler (1927), a silent film with Marion Davies in the title role, and Tillie the Toiler (1941), starring Kay Harris. ==References== ==External links== *Christopher Wheeler: Tillie the Toiler books *\\"See You in the Funnies\\" by Barbara Erdman Category:American comic strips Category:1921 comics debuts Category:Fictional American people Category:1959 comics endings Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:American comics characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1921 Category:Comics about women Category:Female characters in comics Category:American comics adapted into films ","title":"Tillie the Toiler"},{"id":"7788389","text":"Thomas Theodore Jefferson (born June 8, 1962) is an American former sprinter.

The exoskeleton of males is hard and circular and has eyes and antennae extending from their fronts, and the chelipeds are more robust in males than in females, which have more elongated chelipeds. The bodies of the female pea crabs are often translucent and show the inner organs and gonads as yellow and red, with the males being a \\"more yellowish-grey with patches of brown\\". ==Ecology== A pea crab (yellow in color) has fallen out of the clam that this sea otter is eating, and has landed on the sea otter's neck (in Moss Landing, California) The relationship between the pea crab and its host is one of parasitism, rather than commensalism, since the host may be harmed by the crab's feeding activities. The pea crab relies solely on its host for food, safety, and oxygen. Pea crabs have a variety of hosts, the most important of which are mollusks. The pea crab lives in the mantle cavity of these hosts. Other hosts, in addition to oysters, include sea urchins and sand dollars. Pinnotheres can be found inside sand dollars, in the rectum of sea cucumbers, in the tubes of parchment worms, in the burrows of mud shrimp, or in the gills of sea squirts. Little is known about the pea crab's feeding habits, but in the related oyster crab (Zaops ostreus), larval stages feed on plankton brought in by the oyster, while adults feed by taking the food that is a part of the oyster's diet, as well as what is not. The feeding process can be harmful to the crab's host when it feeds on the mucous strings that help carry the food to the host's mouth. == Mating == A male pea crab will rub the edge of a shellfish containing a female pea crab for hours until the shellfish opens and allows the male pea crab to enter.Nationalgeographic.com 2015-05-08 Crab Tickles Shellfish for Hours to Find Love Male pea crab entering a green- lipped mussel hosting a female crab, infrared video A study by New Zealand researchers Oliver Trottier and Andrew Jeffs from University of Auckland shows this behaviour on a similar parasitic pea crab, Nepinnotheres novaezelandiae. == Etymology == Pinnotheres is Greek for \\"guard of Pinna\\" and pisum is Latin for a pea, in reference to the shape of the crab. == References == Category:Pinnotheroidea Category:Crabs of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Parasitic crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1767 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Pea crab"},{"id":"7788449","text":"The cover of the Kamus Dewan dictionary Kamus Dewan (Malay for The Institute Dictionary) is a Malay language dictionary compiled by Teuku Iskandar and published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka.

However, these workhouses were intended to help only the elderly, sick and orphaned, not the able-bodied poor. The sick, elderly and infirm were cared for in poorhouses whereas the able-bodied poor were provided with poor relief in their own homes. Gilbert's Act aimed to be more humane than the previous modification to the Poor Law, the Workhouse Test Act. During the 1780s, there was an increase in unemployment and underemployment due to high food prices, low wages and the effects of enclosing land. This caused poor rates to increase rapidly, which wealthy landowners found unacceptable. The Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1871. ==Attempts to pass legislation== Thomas Gilbert attempted to pass an act \\"for the better relief and employment of the poor\\" in 1765.Bicheno J E An inquiry into the poor laws 2nd edn (R Hunter, London 1824), free in Google Books Gilbert was a supporter of the 5th Duke of Bedford, which led to his act being blocked by Charles Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham.

Cross may have been the victim of a botched abortion. A fictionalized account of her death appears in the novella \\"Murdered by Human Wolves\\", by Steven E. Wedel. ==Life and legend== Cross was born March 13, 1899, to J.T. and M.K. Cross. She died at the age of 18 on October 10, 1917. The cause of her death was not commonly known, leading her grave to become a popular \\"ghost story\\" setting and source of legend. Many modern legends pertaining to the unusual epitaph, \\"Murdered by human wolves\\", claim that her body was found shredded to pieces, that she was killed by werewolves, or that she was killed by the Ku Klux Klan. According to the October 25, 1917 Seminole County News, however, Cross died while under the care of Dr. A.H. Yates and Fredrick O'Neal, a schoolteacher from Konawa who was acting as his assistant. Her death certificate lists the cause of death as a \\"criminal operation\\" and many feel because to the time period and the location that this refers to a botched abortion. This, according to the news article, was the \\"Second Charge\\" against Yates and O'Neal. They were held in county jail for the death of 18-year-old Elise Stone. Stone was admitted to Dr. Yates' office on August 15, 1917, and remained there for four days, after which she was taken home and died there. According to Dr. Yates, her death was the result of a \\"congestive chill\\". Although most of Konawa was satisfied with Dr. Yates' explanation, the few who were suspicious contacted County Attorney A.G. Nichols. Nichols and the county physician, with an order from M.L. Rascoe, Justice of the Peace, exhumed her body to perform an autopsy and the findings also listed the cause of her death as a \\"criminal operation\\". ==In fiction== A fictionalized account of Cross's death appears in a 2004 novella by Steven Wedel, \\"Murdered by Human Wolves\\".
