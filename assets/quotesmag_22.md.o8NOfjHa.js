The road starts from Neil Road which is one way, but becomes two ways, when the road forks out into two parts, with one becoming Teo Hong Road, with both roads ending at New Bridge Road. The road is mainly lined with conserved shophouses and houses a high-end boutique hotel known as the New Majestic Hotel. ==Etymology and history== The place got its name from the Ali Baba jars, the tong or pasoh used to store rice or water in homes. There were many kilns in the 19th century that made these pots, bricks and tiles in Telok Blangah, Silat Estate and Bukit Merah. A part of Bukit Merah was known as Brickworks in the past, due to the number of brick factories in that area. This road is located on the hill that in the 1830s marked the western boundary of the colonial town. Pasoh is the Malay word for \\"flower pot\\", and this was where earthenware pots used to be made. The hill has been renamed several times. It was first called Ryan's Hill from 1835 to 1836 after an early planter, Charles Ryan, who was the first owner of the hill as well as the first civilian Post Master of Singapore. It was sold to Hugh Syme in 1827 when Ryan returned to England; Syme renamed it Duxton Hill. It was bought by Dr Montgomerie in 1836 and developed into a nutmeg plantation together with nearby Craig Hill. Both were auctioned off in 1856 when Montgomerie died and fragmented it into building lots. The hill was later renamed Dickenson's Hill after Rev J.T. Dickenson, followed by Bukit Padre and finally Bukit Pasoh. Bukit Pasoh was owned by an opium farmer, Tan Keng Hoon, at the time of his death in 1877. The road and its vicinity is a conservation area known as Bukit Pasoh Conservation Area, which is bounded by New Bridge Road, Keong Saik Road, Kreta Ayer Road, Neil Road and Cantonment Road. This area was given the conservation area status on 7 July 1989. The shophouses mainly consist of two and three storey shophouses in transitional, late and art deco styles. ==References== *Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern University Press, ==External links== *Uniquely Singapore website Category:Roads in Singapore Category:Protected areas of Singapore Category:Outram, Singapore Category:Tanjong Pagar ","title":"Bukit Pasoh Road"},{"id":"7452591","text":"Gottfried Ungerboeck (born 15 March 1940, Vienna) is an Austrian communications engineer.

Georg Weerth (17 February 1822 - 30 July 1856) was a German writer and poet. Weerth's poems celebrated the solidarity of the working class in its fight for liberation from exploitation and oppression. He was a friend and companion of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who described Georg Weerth as the first and most significant poet of the German proletariat. ==Biography== Weerth was born in the Westphalian town of Detmold, the son of the clergyman Ferdinand Weerth. He died in Havana, Cuba. Georg Weerth wrote and edited the sketch page in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, a German newspaper of which Karl Marx was editor-in-chief. His provocative writing and pungent satire led to his imprisonment, after which he fled to England. From 1843 to 1846 Weerth made his home in Bradford, England. Six months of this time he spent in close contact with Engels, whose business was in Manchester. Like Engels, he devoted what time was left from his functions as a representative of a textile firm to studying the effects of the Industrial Revolution on the relationship between property owner and working class. Weerth attended Chartist meetings and made friends with the leaders of the movement, such as George Julian Harney and Ernest Jones. He reported on the conditions in England for German papers. In 1846 Weerth left England and went to live in Brussels, where Karl Marx had his home. Weerth succumbed to tropical fever on a business trip to Cuba.

Baitursynov reformed the Kazakh alphabet. In 1912, he excluded all the purely Arabic letters not used in the Kazakh language and added letters specific to the Kazakh language. The new alphabet, named Tote jazu (meaning straight writing), is still used by Kazakhs living in China, Afghanistan, and in Iran. Baitursynov also developed the basics of Kazakh and the scientific terminology for the definition of Kazakh grammar. In 1937, he was executed by a firing squad during the Great Purge. ==Early life, education== Baitursynov was born in what is today Kostanay Region, and was educated at the Orenburg Teachers' School.

Many famous Polish actors appeared in the series. The filming location used in Alternatywy 4 was a residential complex, still in existence at 3 Marii Grzegorzewskiej Street in Warsaw, Poland. The series was a satire of life under the communist rule in Poland. The dialogues had to be written in a way that they would be approved by the communist authorities censorship office. Due to the censorship, partial or entire scenes had to be cut. 30 years after the series was filmed it underwent a digital reconstruction and the initially deleted scenes were added, after they had been found in the archives of TVP. The series title is a result of a dispute among the real estate developers on what to name a new street in their development (in episode 1). Annoyed by the lack of consensus, one of them quips: \\"There must be some alternative\\". In 2005, one of the streets in Ursyn√≥w district, where the series plot had taken place, was officially named Alternatywy to commemorate the series.UCHWA≈ÅA Nr XLV/1114/2005 RADY MIASTA STO≈ÅECZNEGO WARSZAWY z dnia 27 stycznia 2005 r. w sprawie nadania nazwy ulicom w Dzielnicy Ursyn√≥w m.st.

A tall centre-forward who could also play in the centre of defence, he began his career as an apprentice with Rotherham United. He turned professional in November 1978, but was released without making his league debut. In November 1980 he joined Sheffield United from Gainsborough Trinity, but left to join Wimbledon in March 1982 before appearing in the Blades first team. He had more success with the Dons, instantly slotting into Dave Bassett's side, partnering Alan Cork up front. He helped Wimbledon to promotions from the Fourth to the First Division, scoring 50 times in 175 games in the process, but in August 1986, just before Wimbledon were about to embark on their first ever season in the top flight, Evans was sold to newly relegated West Bromwich Albion for ¬£60,000. He stayed less than a season at the Hawthorns, joining Plymouth Argyle for ¬£50,000 and, after recovering from injury played his part in Argyle's surprising challenge for promotion. In November 1988, after 10 goals in 45 games for the Pilgrims, he moved to Rotherham United for ¬£40,000. He joined Torquay United on loan in March 1991, hitting 5 goals in 15 games and playing in the successful play-off final at Wembley against Blackpool. In September that year he left Rotherham, after 14 goals in 65 league games, joining Crewe Alexandra. He played 83 times for Crewe, scoring 12 times, but left after helping them to promotion in the 1993‚Äì94 season. Evans then moved back into non-league football with Denaby United, where he won the Northern Counties East Football League title in the 1996‚Äì97 season, Maltby Main and Parkgate.

It was the third iteration of the first generation of the Holden Commodore. This new Commodore was an evolution of the previous Holden VC series model, and was released on 5 October 1981. The frontal appearance was mildly facelifted with a new horizontal-slat grille and new lighting components designed to give a lower, wider look, and for interest of aerodynamics. It continued to be available as sedan and station wagon, with new taillight clusters utilized on sedan models. ==History== The engines were carried over but revisions were made to the 1.9- and 2.85-litre engines to improve fuel economy. Gains of 12.5 and 14 percent respectively were made to the city cycle fuel economy figures. Mechanical specifications were as before, except for an additional five-speed manual transmission which was an option only (due to the limits of the transmission- box) on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre straight six versions. A 4142 cc V8 engine was also available from the beginning. This was later complemented by the more powerful 5.0-litre. At the same time a reshuffle was made to the range‚ÄîSL was now the base model and SL/X was introduced as the mid-range car, with SL/E remaining the top-of-the-line sedan. The SL/E also came available with optional cruise control and a trip computer. The trip computer measured average speed and fuel consumption. Wagons were available in SL and SL/X variants. September 1982 saw the release of the Commodore SS,Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, January 2002, page 311 a model that was a Commodore mainstay until 2017. The abbreviation stands for \\"Sports Sedan\\". Offered with Holden's 4.2 L V8 as standard, the factory SS was supplemented by three up-spec versions produced by Peter Brock's HDT Special Vehicles company. The HDT models were named \\"SS Group One\\", \\"SS Group Two\\" and \\"SS Group Three\\", with the lattermost also featuring the Holden 5.0-litre V8 in a higher state of tune). The SS sedans were initially exclusively Maranello Red in color, but were later also made available in Alabaster White. The Group Three-tuned V8 produces at 4750 rpm.

In 1983 an 'Executive' pack of the base Commodore was introduced, primarily directed to fleet buyers. These cars featured automatic transmission and air-conditioning as part of a Commodore SL package, but had no distinguishable external identification badges. Special editions of Commodore released around Christmas 1981, 1982 and 1983 were badged 'Vacationer'. With the effects of the 1979 energy crisis ending, buyers gravitated towards the larger Ford Falcon rival, rather than the mid-size Commodore. Thus for the first time, the Holden Commodore lost its position as Australia's best-selling car. Production of this model ceased in February 1984, to be replaced by the much further facelifted Holden Commodore (VK). ===Export markets=== In Indonesia the only engine available was the 1.9-liter four, in SL/X trim and with a five-speed manual. Because of the absence of emissions controls in that market, power was higher than for Australian cars, at . ==Motorsport== The VH Commodore was first used in Australian Touring car racing in the 1982 Australian Touring Car Championship. Unfortunately controversy reigned as the Holden Dealer Team attempted to run Peter Brock's car with yet-to-be homologated parts. Brock actually scored enough points to win the 1982 ATCC (using both the VC and VH), but was disqualified from all but two races of the series. Better was to come in the late season endurance races. With the HDT VH Commodore SS now properly homologated, Allan Grice drove his Commodore to pole position in the 1982 James Hardie 1000 at Mount Panorama with a time of 2:17.501 after earlier having been the first driver to lap the 6.172 km (3.835 mi) circuit in a touring car at better than with a lap of 2:17.8 in official qualifying. The Holden VH Commodore SS went on to fill the top 4 places in the race with the HDT Commodore of Peter Brock and Larry Perkins winning the race. The Commodore was still a major force in the 1983 Australian Touring Car Championship with both Grice and Brock each winning two of the eight round series. However, they were forced to give best to Allan Moffat and his smaller, lighter (and thus much better suited to the tight Australian tracks) Mazda RX-7. Moffat won four of the eight rounds, and with the emergence of the smaller capacity Nissan Bluebird turbo of George Fury, Brock and Grice finished only 3rd and 4th at the end of the championship. Further homologations grants from the Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) in August 1983 saw the VH Commodore SS once again the car to beat. Peter Brock set pole position at the 1983 James Hardie 1000 (VH Commodores filled seven of the top 10 spots on the grid), and although his own car suffered a rare engine failure on lap 8 of the race, he and Perkins then moved into the team's second car with its lead driver John Harvey to go on and win the race. The second HDT car was in fact the 1982 winning car giving the Commodore the distinction of being the only car to twice win the Bathurst 1000. The VH Commodore would fill six of the top 10 finishing positions in the race. The VH continued to be a major force into 1984, with Brock winning the opening two rounds of the 1984 ATCC before finishing second to Moffat's Mazda in Round 3. Unfortunately however Brock was to miss two rounds of the series while racing a Porsche 956 at the 1000 km of Silverstone and Le Mans 24 Hours. Brock would eventually finish second in the championship behind the Ford XE Falcon of Dick Johnson. The VH Commodore SS has the distinction of winning the final ATCC race held under the locally developed Group C regulations when Allan Grice won the 7th and final round of the championship at the Adelaide International Raceway on 1 July. The VH Commodore SS was succeeded by the Holden VK Commodore in the last half of 1984, though it was only the HDT, Roadways and Warren Cullen's team who would race the new model. The VH remained the Commodore of choice for the privateers. The model's touring car racing life ended at the completion of the 1984 season as CAMS had decided that new rules based on the FIA's international Group A regulations would apply to Australian Touring Cars from the beginning of 1985. The VH Commodore also proved to be popular in Sports Sedan racing as well as in speedway. ==References== Category:Cars of Australia VH Category:Mid-size cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Cars introduced in 1981 Category:1980s cars ","title":"Holden Commodore (VH)"},{"id":"7452802","text":"E400 may refer to: *Alginic acid *Eclipse 400, a light jet aircraft *Acer beTouch E400, a smartphone *Mercedes-Benz E400 Hybrid, an automobile *One of the locomotives of Taiwan Railways Administration *GV-E400 series, a DEMU train type on order by JR East in Japan ","title":"E400"},{"id":"7452808","text":"Linguistic Inquiry is a peer-reviewed academic journal in generative linguistics published by the MIT Press since 1970.

The ground occupies a part of Barton Park, next to Muddy Creek, a tributary of the Cooks River in Banksia. Over time the stadium has been used less and less, commensurate with its dilapidation. The stadium has never been renovated over its lifespan. In 2005 the St George Saints were controversially axed from the new look New South Wales Premier League and took legal action against the decision along with the Bonnyrigg White Eagles, but were unsuccessful. They now play in the New South Wales Premier League 2, which is one level below the state's highest, the NSW Premier League. In 2006, the St George-Budapest club, now the St George Saints, played their last match at the stadium for several years, deeming it unsafe and unstable, with the grandstand on the verge of collapse. The St George Saints then played at various locations including the Belmore Sports Ground (an arena outside the St George district) and Kogarah Jubilee Oval. Between 2007 and 2008 the ground was not fit to be used as a playing arena. It was widely vandalised with graffiti, with litter on the pitch and throughout the stand. In the grandstand the floor and seating was pulled out. The stand had structural cracks running through the side of it, leaving the grandstand covered in security fences, due to fears of it being unstable.

The Leader - Saints Make A Return To Stadium They used this stadium between 2009-2013 with occasional higher-level games played at Jubilee Oval. In 2014 the stadium was used for community level games (games conducted between St George clubs) only, with the St George Saints using Jubilee Oval.

It introduced a requirement for drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness and safety of their drugs before approval,Peltzman, Sam. An Evaluation of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments. The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 81, No. 5. (Sep. - Oct., 1973), pp. 1051. required drug advertising to disclose accurate information about side effects, and stopped cheap generic drugs being marketed as expensive drugs under new trade names as new \\"breakthrough\\" medications. ==Background== The amendment was a response to the thalidomide tragedy, in which thousands of children were born with birth defects as a result of their mothers taking thalidomide for morning sickness during pregnancy.O'Reilly, James, Jurisdiction to Decide an Agency's Own Jurisdiction: The Forgotten Tale of the Hynson Quartet, Administrative Law Review, Vol. 58, No. 4 (Fall 2006), pp. 829-843 (15 pages). The bill by U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver, of Tennessee, and U.S. Representative Oren Harris, of Arkansas, required drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness and safety of their drugs before approval. Thalidomide had not been approved for use in the United States and that the tragic birth defects that occurred were in other countries. Frances Oldham Kelsey was the FDA reviewer who refused to approve Thalidomide for use. It introduced a \\"proof-of-efficacy\\" requirement for the first time. In addition, the Amendment required drug advertising to disclose accurate information about side effects and efficacy of treatments. Finally, cheap generic drugs could no longer be marketed as expensive drugs under new trade names as new \\"breakthrough\\" medications. The law was signed by President John F. Kennedy on October 10, 1962. ==Effect== The Kefauver Harris Amendment strengthened the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's control of experimentation on humans and changed the way new drugs are approved and regulated. Before the Thalidomide scandal in Europe, and Canada, U.S. drug companies only had to show their new products were safe. After the passage of the Amendment, an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) would have to show that a new drug was both safe and effective (previously the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was the main law that regulated drug safety). Informed consent was required of patients participating in clinical trials, and adverse drug reactions were required to be reported to the FDA. The Drug Efficacy Study Implementation was begun to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as either effective, ineffective, or needing further study. Estes Kefauver considered the Amendment his \\"finest achievement\\" in consumer protection. Louis Lasagna, then a prominent clinical pharmacologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, advised Congress about the proper conduct of clinical research during the 1962 hearings leading up to passage of the Amendment. The law also exempted from the \\"Delaney clause\\" (a 1958 amendment to the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938) certain animal drugs and animal feed additives shown to induce cancer, but which left no detectable levels of residue in the human food supply. ==See alsoReferences== Sources * Abood, R.R., & Brushwood, D.B.

It is named Sajjangarh after Maharana Sajjan Singh (1874‚Äì1884) of the Mewar Dynasty, who it was built for in 1884. The palace offers a panoramic view of the city's lakes, palaces and surrounding countryside. It was built chiefly to watch the monsoon clouds; hence, appropriately, it is popularly known as Monsoon Palace. It is said that the Maharana built it at the top of the hill to get a view of his ancestral home, Chittorgarh. Previously owned by the Mewar royal family, it is now under the control of the Forest Department of the Government of Rajasthan and has recently been opened to the public. The palace provides a beautiful view of the sunset. Its builder, Maharana Sajjan Singh, originally planned to make it a five-storey astronomical centre. The plan was cancelled with Maharana Sajjan Singh's premature death. It was then turned into a monsoon palace and hunting lodge. High in the Aravalli Hills, just outside Udaipur, the Palace is illuminated in the evenings, giving a golden orange glow (see image in the infobox). The palace was used in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy as the residence of Kamal Khan, an exiled Afghan prince. ==History== The history of the palace reflects the history of the Mewar kingdom. Sajjan Singh, Maharana (b. 18 July 1859 d. 23 December 1884), the initial builder of the Monsoon Palace was the seventy‚Äìsecond ruler of the Mewar Dynasty (1874‚Äì1884) and ruled from Udaipur for a short period of 10 years until his untimely death. The Mewar dynasty traces its history to Guhil who founded the Mewar State in 568 AD. Sajjan Singh came to the throne when he was 15 years old. However, his uncle Sohan Singh challenged his right to the crown and even plotted through astrologers, who said the timing for the coronation was not appropriate. Fortunately for him the then British agent, who was in favour of Sajjan Singh, intervened and persuaded the astrologers to give a favourable date for the crowning. The eventual Coronation of Sajjan Singh took place two years after this. As the trouble-maker uncle was still persisting with his obstructions towards the newly crowned Maharana, his property was confiscated and he was eventually imprisoned. After he was invested in 1876 the Maharana, considered an enlightened ruler and a \\"man of vision\\", launched a massive programme of developmental activities in his kingdom, in particular, enlarging infrastructure facilities such as roads, water supply and other civil works. He also introduced civil administration and courts. He also improved the general environment of Udaipur by afforestation and lake improvements. He had Lake Pichola desilted and the masonry dam re-built to improve storage capacity, as well as preserving the historical heritage in line with his personal interest in the arts and culture. The most ambitious project he undertook was building the Sajjan Garh Palace, or the Monsoon Palace, as a western backdrop to Udaipur city. It was during Sajjan Singh's rule that Udaipur gained recognition as the second Municipality in India, after Bombay. In recognition of his outstanding achievements in preserving and developing the Mewar kingdom, and to remind him that his was a princely state under the British Raj, he was conferred the title of \\"Grand Commander of the Star of India\\" in November 1881 by Lord Ripon, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's crowning as the Empress of India. ==Structure== alt=Monsoon palace at evening with interior lights on The palace, built with white marble, is located on Bansdara peak of the Aravalli hill range at an elevation of 944 m (3100 ft) above mean sea level, overlooking Lake Pichola from the west about below the palace. The intention of the original planner, Maharana Sajjan Singh, was to build a nine storey complex, basically as an astronomical centre and to keep track of the movement of monsoon clouds in the area surrounding the palace, and also to provide employment to people. It was also meant to serve as a resort for the royal family. Unfortunately, the Maharana died prematurely at the age of 26 (after only 10 years of rule between 1874 and 1884), which resulted in the shelving of his plans for some time. Before his death, he had built it partially, and it was subsequently completed by his successor king Maharana Fateh Singh who used it to watch the monsoon clouds. The Royal family also used this building as a hunting lodge. The white marble palace has high turrets and guards regulating each of the towers. The palace has a grand central court with a staircase and many rooms and quarters. The palace is built on marble pillars, which are carved with exquisite motifs of leaves and flowers. The walls are plastered with lime mortar. At night, the illuminated palace with the Rajasthani architecture comprising domes, fountains and jharokas gives it a fairy tale beauty. alt=Monsoon palace panoramic view A unique water harvesting structure to collect rainwater in an underground cistern, with a storage capacity of 195,500 litres, exists in the precincts of the palace. In spite of this, the water supply was found to be inadequate and the palace was therefore abandoned. ==Other attractions== Udaipur city from the Monsoon Palacealt=View of Udaipur city from the Monsoon Palace Sajjangarh Wildlife Sanctuary, which encircles the palace, was established in 1987. It covers an area of . It is now a well-protected sanctuary, with the Kishan Pol concrete wall surrounding it. The hillside is thickly wooded and the former rulers maintained this area as a royal shooting preserve. When Udaipur was attacked by the Scindias in 1764, the hill was used as an ordnance dump; some cannons still remain. The palace overlooks the sanctuary, which is a reserve for reptiles, tigers, nilgai, sambhar deer, wild boars, hyenas, panthers, and jackals. It is also popular for bird watching. The reserve can also be approached by a trek (as an adventure) starting from the Gorilla Point to the Jiyan Sagar or the Bari Lake, to enjoy the scenic beauty of the Aravalli hills and the wildlife of the reserve forest. ==In popular culture== alt=Monsoon palace entrance against backdrop of cloudy skies The Monsoon Palace was used as a location for the filming of the 1983 James Bond film, Octopussy. It appears as the residence of the principal villain, an exiled Afghan prince named Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan),. Sequences shot at the palace include a 'tiger' hunt on elephants where James Bond (Roger Moore) escapes from the Palace and is pursued into the jungle and the finale, complete with a battle in the courtyard and an escape by Union Jack hot-air balloon. Other footage in the film was shot at Shiv Niwas Palace and the Lake Palace Hotel. However, scenes showing Bond eating dinner inside the palace, running between rooms, sliding down the grand staircase and finally a basement rendezvous for the villains in the film, were not shot inside the Monsoon Palace, nor were the sets for those sequences based on the layout or features of the Monsoon Palace. In 2008 The Cheetah Girls filmed the song \\"Dance Me If You Can\\", for their Indian movie, at the palace. ==Visitor information== The Monsoon Palace is west of Udaipur and overlooks Lake Pichola. The palace can be accessed by a winding road through the surrounding Sajjan Singh Sanctuary by taxi or 'auto rickshaw'. The palace and the Sajjan Singh Sanctuary are major attractions and are open to visitors until sunset. A boat ride across Lake Pichola in Udaipur provides excellent views of the palace and allows visitors to enjoy the scenic beauty of the palace. Udaipur is well connected by road and air links to all parts of the country. thumb ==Gallery== File:Sajjangarh1.jpgRemote view of Sajjangarh Palace File:Udaipur from Sajjangarh fort.jpgUdaipur view from Sajjangarh fort File:Window at Sajjangarh fort, udaipur.jpgWindow at Sajjangarh fort, udaipur File:Udaipur view from Sajjangarh fort.jpgUdaipur view from Sajjangarh fort File:Sajjangarh fort sidewall.jpgSajjangarh fort sidewall File:Monsoon Palace2.jpginterior facade, Monsoon Palace File:Sajjangarh fort, Udaipur.jpgSajjangarh fort, Udaipur ==ReferencesExternal links== *www.rajasthantourism.com *Sajjangarh *Flickr images Category:Palaces in Rajasthan Category:Royal residences in India Category:Buildings and structures in Udaipur Category:Tourist attractions in Udaipur Category:Houses completed in 1884 Category:Palaces in Udaipur ","title":"Monsoon Palace"},{"id":"7452887","text":"Pierre Bureau (October 9, 1771 - June 6, 1836) was a businessman and political figure in Lower Canada.

It was formerly called Odd Stadion, and was built in 1923 as the home ground of Eliteserien club Odd. The stadium is often referred to as Falkum, being situated in that area of Skien. The stadium has been undergoing an extensive redevelopment process, begun in November 2006, which produced a modern all- seater venue by April 2008. Part of the finance Odd needed for the project was obtained through the lease of the stadium's naming rights to the club's main sponsor since 1995, the Norwegian power company Skagerak Energi. The stadium will therefore be known as Skagerak Arena until at least 2017. The pitch has been rotated 90 degrees in order to free up space. As is increasingly common in Norway, the new surface is artificial. The old main stand is now an end stand, incorporated into the new structure as the only surviving feature of the old stadium. Three new two-tiered stands was completed between 2007 and 2008. The east and west stands has a capacity of 4,300 while the south end seats around 3,000. Construction of the west stand had progressed far enough by April 2007 to allow spectators on the lower tier for the first home match of the season, on 15 April. Total capacity was at first 6,000 And increased gradually throughout 2007. The old stadium had a capacity of about 8,600, of which 5,600 were seated. The venue has hosted Norway national under-21 football team matches three times, playing 0‚Äì0 against Portugal on 9 May 1979, 2‚Äì1 against Romania on 18 August 1998 and 3‚Äì1 against Scotland on 19 August 2003.

Diameters of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi- walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are typically 0.8 to 2 nm and 5 to 20 nm, respectively, although MWNT diameters can exceed 100 nm. CNT lengths range from less than 100 nm to 0.5 m. Individual CNT walls can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the orientation of the lattice with respect to the tube axis, which is called chirality. MWNT's cross-sectional area offers an elastic modulus approaching 1 TPa and a tensile strength of 100 GPa, over 10-fold higher than any industrial fiber. MWNTs are typically metallic and can carry currents of up to 109 A cm‚àí2. SWNTs can display thermal conductivity of 3500 W m‚àí1 K‚àí1, exceeding that of diamond. , carbon nanotube production exceeded several thousand tons per year, used for applications in energy storage, device modelling, automotive parts, boat hulls, sporting goods, water filters, thin-film electronics, coatings, actuators and electromagnetic shields. CNT-related publications more than tripled in the prior decade, while rates of patent issuance also increased. Most output was of unorganized architecture. Organized CNT architectures such as \\"forests\\", yarns and regular sheets were produced in much smaller volumes. CNTs have even been proposed as the tether for a purported space elevator. 3D carbon nanotube scaffolds Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three- dimensional macroscopic (>1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricated macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks. These scaffolds possess macro-, micro-, and nano- structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications. These 3D all-carbon scaffolds/architectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage, supercapacitors, field emission transistors, high- performance catalysis, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices and implants. == Biological and biomedical research == Researchers from Rice University and State University of New York ‚Äì Stony Brook have shown that the addition of low weight % of carbon nanotubes can lead to significant improvements in the mechanical properties of biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for applications in tissue engineering including bone, cartilage, muscle and nerve tissue. Dispersion of low weight % of graphene (~0.02 wt.%) results in significant increases in compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites. Researchers at Rice University, Stony Brook University, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and University of California, Riverside have shown that carbon nanotubes and their polymer nanocomposites are suitable scaffold materials for bone tissue engineering and bone formation.Dalton, Aaron (15 August 2005). Nanotubes May Heal Broken Bones. Wired. CNTs exhibit dimensional and chemical compatibility with biomolecules, such as DNA and proteins. CNTs enable fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging, as well as localized heating using near-infrared radiation. SWNT biosensors exhibit large changes in electrical impedance and optical properties, which is typically modulated by adsorption of a target on the CNT surface. Low detection limits and high selectivity require engineering the CNT surface and field effects, capacitance, Raman spectral shifts and photoluminescence for sensor design. Products under development include printed test strips for estrogen and progesterone detection, microarrays for DNA and protein detection and sensors for and cardiac troponin. Similar CNT sensors support food industry, military and environmental applications. CNTs can be internalized by cells, first by binding their tips to cell membrane receptors. This enables transfection of molecular cargo attached to the CNT walls or encapsulated by CNTs. For example, the cancer drug doxorubicin was loaded at up to 60 wt % on CNTs compared with a maximum of 8 to 10 wt % on liposomes. Cargo release can be triggered by near-infrared radiation. However, limiting the retention of CNTs within the body is critical to prevent undesirable accumulation. CNT toxicity remains a concern, although CNT biocompatibility may be engineerable. The degree of lung inflammation caused by injection of well-dispersed SWNTs was insignificant compared with asbestos and with particulate matter in air. Medical acceptance of CNTs requires understanding of immune response and appropriate exposure standards for inhalation, injection, ingestion and skin contact. CNT forests immobilized in a polymer did not show elevated inflammatory response in rats relative to controls. CNTs are under consideration as low-impedance neural interface electrodes and for coating of catheters to reduce thrombosis. CNT enabled x-ray sources for medical imaging are also in development. Relying on the unique properties of the CNTs, researchers have developed field emission cathodes that allow precise x-ray control and close placement of multiple sources. CNT enabled x-ray sources have been demonstrated for pre-clinical, small animal imaging applications, and are currently in clinical trials. In November 2012 researchers at the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proved that single-wall carbon nanotubes may help protect DNA molecules from damage by oxidation. A highly effective method of delivering carbon nanotubes into cells is Cell squeezing, a high-throughput vector-free microfluidic platform for intracellular delivery developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the labs of Robert S. Langer. Carbon nanotubes have furthermore been grown inside microfluidic channels for chemical analysis, based on electrochromatography. Here, the high surface- area-to-volume ratio and high hydrophobicity of CNTs are used in order to greatly decrease the analysis time of small neutral molecules that typically require large bulky equipment for analysis. == Composite materials == Because of the carbon nanotube's superior mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat jackets and space elevators. However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes must be greatly improved. For perspective, outstanding breakthroughs have already been made. Pioneering work led by Ray H. Baughman at the NanoTech Institute has shown that single and multi-walled nanotubes can produce materials with toughness unmatched in the man-made and natural worlds. Carbon nanotubes being spun to form a yarn, CSIRO Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1 TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures (such as yarns, fibres or films) has led to mechanical properties that were significantly lower than these potential limits. The hierarchical integration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and metal/metal oxides within a single nanostructure can leverage the potentiality of carbon nanotubes composite for water splitting and electrocatalysis. Windle et al. have used an in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) spinning method to produce continuous CNT yarns from CVD-grown CNT aerogels. CNT yarns can also be manufactured by drawing out CNT bundles from a CNT forest and subsequently twisting to form the fibre (draw-twist method, see picture on right). The Windle group have fabricated CNT yarns with strengths as high as ~9 GPa at small gage lengths of ~1 mm, however, strengths of only about ~1 GPa were reported at the longer gage length of 20 mm. The reason why fibre strengths have been low compared to the strength of individual CNTs is due to a failure to effectively transfer load to the constituent (discontinuous) CNTs within the fibre. One potential route for alleviating this problem is via irradiation (or deposition) induced covalent inter-bundle and inter-CNT cross-linking to effectively 'join up' the CNTs, with higher dosage levels leading to the possibility of amorphous carbon/carbon nanotube composite fibres. Espinosa et al. developed high performance DWNT-polymer composite yarns by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds. These DWNT-polymer yarns exhibited an unusually high energy to failure of ~100 J¬∑g‚àí1 (comparable to one of the toughest natural materials ‚Äì spider silk), and strength as high as ~1.4 GPa. Effort is ongoing to produce CNT composites that incorporate tougher matrix materials, such as Kevlar, to further improve on the mechanical properties toward those of individual CNTs. Because of the high mechanical strength of carbon nanotubes, research is being made into weaving them into clothes to create stab-proof and bulletproof clothing. The nanotubes would effectively stop the bullet from penetrating the body, although the bullet's kinetic energy would likely cause broken bones and internal bleeding. Carbon nanotubes can also enable shorter processing times and higher energy efficiencies during composite curing with the use of carbon nanotube structured heaters. Autoclaving is the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for composite curing however, it comes at a high price and introduces part size limitations. Researchers estimate that curing a small section of the Boeing 787 carbon fiber/epoxy fuselage requires 350 GJ of energy and produces 80 tons of carbon dioxide. This is about the same amount of energy that nine households would consume in one year. In addition, eliminating part size limitations eliminates the need to join small composite components to create large scale structures. This saves manufacturing time and results in higher strength structures. Carbon nanotube structured heaters show promise in replacing autoclaves and conventional ovens for composite curing because of their ability to reach high temperatures at fast ramping rates with high electrical efficiency and mechanical flexibility. These nanostructured heaters can take the form of a film and be applied directly to the composite. This results in conductive heat transfer as opposed to convective heat transfer used by autoclaves and conventional ovens. Lee et. al. reported that only 50% of the thermal energy introduced in an autoclave is transferred to the composite being cured regardless of part size, while about 90% of the thermal energy is transferred in a nanostructured film heater depending on the process. Lee et al. were able to successfully cure aerospace- grade composites using a CNT heater made by ‚Äúdomino-pushing‚Äù a CNT forest onto a Teflon film. This film was then laid on top of an 8-ply OOA prepreg layup. Thermal insulation was incorporated around the assembly. The entire setup was subsequently vacuum bagged and heated using a 30V DC power supply. Degree-of- cure and mechanical tests were conducted to compare conventionally cured composites against their OOA set-up. Results showed that there was no difference in the quality of the composite created. However, the amount of energy required to cure the composite OOA was reduced by two orders of magnitude from 13.7 MJ to 118.8 kJ. Before carbon nanotubes can be used to cure Boeing 787 fuselage‚Äôs however, further development needs to occur. The largest challenge associated with creating reliable carbon nanotube structured heaters is being able to create a uniform carbon nanotube dispersion in a polymer matrix to ensure heat is applied evenly. CNTs high surface area results in strong Van Der Waals forces between individual CNTs, causing them to agglomerate together and yielding non-uniform heating properties. In addition, the polymer matrix chosen needs to be carefully chosen such that it can withstand the high temperatures generated and the repetitive thermal cycling required to cure multiple composite components. === Mixtures === MWNTs were first used as electrically conductive fillers in metals, at concentrations as high as 83.78 percent by weight (wt%). MWNT-polymer composites reach conductivities as high as 10,000 S m‚àí1 at 10 wt % loading. In the automotive industry, CNT plastics are used in electrostatic-assisted painting of mirror housings, as well as fuel lines and filters that dissipate electrostatic charge. Other products include electromagnetic interference (EMI)‚Äìshielding packages and silicon wafer carriers. For load-bearing applications, CNT powders are mixed with polymers or precursor resins to increase stiffness, strength and toughness. These enhancements depend on CNT diameter, aspect ratio, alignment, dispersion and interfacial interaction. Premixed resins and master batches employ CNT loadings from 0.1 to 20 wt%. Nanoscale stick-slip among CNTs and CNT-polymer contacts can increase material damping, enhancing sporting goods, including tennis racquets, baseball bats and bicycle frames. CNT resins enhance fiber composites, including wind turbine blades and hulls for maritime security boats that are made by enhancing carbon fiber composites with CNT-enhanced resin. CNTs are deployed as additives in the organic precursors of stronger 1-Œºm diameter carbon fibers. CNTs influence the arrangement of carbon in pyrolyzed fiber. Toward the challenge of organizing CNTs at larger scales, hierarchical fiber composites are created by growing aligned forests onto glass, silicon carbide (SiC), alumina and carbon fibers, creating so-called \\"fuzzy\\" fibers. Fuzzy epoxy CNT-SiC and CNT-alumina fabric showed 69% improved crack-opening (mode I) and/or in-plane shear interlaminar (mode II) toughness. Applications under investigation include lightning-strike protection, deicing, and structural health monitoring for aircraft. MWNTs can be used as a flame-retardant additive to plastics due to changes in rheology by nanotube loading. Such additives can replace halogenated flame retardants, which face environmental restrictions. CNT/Concrete blends offer increased tensile strength and reduced crack propagation. Buckypaper (nanotube aggregate) can significantly improve fire resistance due to efficient heat reflection. === Textiles === The previous studies on the use of CNTs for textile functionalization were focused on fiber spinning for improving physical and mechanical properties. Recently a great deal of attention has been focused on coating CNTs on textile fabrics. Various methods have been employed for modifying fabrics using CNTs. produced intelligent e-textiles for Human Biomonitoring using a polyelectrolyte-based coating with CNTs. Additionally, Panhuis et al. dyed textile material by immersion in either a poly (2-methoxy aniline-5-sulfonic acid) PMAS polymer solution or PMAS-SWNT dispersion with enhanced conductivity and capacitance with a durable behavior. In another study, Hu and coworkers coated single- walled carbon nanotubes with a simple ‚Äúdipping and drying‚Äù process for wearable electronics and energy storage applications. In the recent study, Li and coworkers using elastomeric separator and almost achieved a fully stretchable supercapacitor based on buckled single-walled carbon nanotube macrofilms. The electrospun polyurethane was used and provided sound mechanical stretchability and the whole cell achieve excellent charge- discharge cycling stability. CNTs have an aligned nanotube structure and a negative surface charge. Therefore, they have similar structures to direct dyes, so the exhaustion method is applied for coating and absorbing CNTs on the fiber surface for preparing multifunctional fabric including antibacterial, electric conductive, flame retardant and electromagnetic absorbance properties.F. Alimohammadi, M. Parvinzadeh, A. Shamei (2011) \\"Carbon Nanotube Embedded Textiles\\", . Later, CNT yarns and laminated sheets made by direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or forest spinning or drawing methods may compete with carbon fiber for high-end uses, especially in weight- sensitive applications requiring combined electrical and mechanical functionality. Research yarns made from few-walled CNTs have reached a stiffness of 357 GPa and a strength of 8.8 GPa for a gauge length comparable to the millimeter-long CNTs within the yarn. Centimeter-scale gauge lengths offer only 2-GPa gravimetric strengths, matching that of Kevlar. Because the probability of a critical flaw increases with volume, yarns may never achieve the strength of individual CNTs. However, CNT's high surface area may provide interfacial coupling that mitigates these deficiencies. CNT yarns can be knotted without loss of strength. Coating forest-drawn CNT sheets with functional powder before inserting twist yields weavable, braidable and sewable yarns containing up to 95 wt % powder. Uses include superconducting wires, battery and fuel cell electrodes and self-cleaning textiles. As yet impractical fibers of aligned SWNTs can be made by coagulation-based spinning of CNT suspensions. Cheaper SWNTs or spun MWNTs are necessary for commercialization. Carbon nanotubes can be dissolved in superacids such as fluorosulfuric acid and drawn into fibers in dry jet-wet spinning.Proceedings of the 7th Aachen-Dresden International Textile Conference, November 28‚Äì29, 2013, Aachen, Germany. DWNT-polymer composite yarns have been made by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds. Body armor‚Äîcombat jackets Cambridge University developed the fibres and licensed a company to make them. In comparison, the bullet-resistant fiber Kevlar fails at 27‚Äì33 J/g. Synthetic muscles offer high contraction/extension ratio given an electric current. SWNT are in use as an experimental material for removable, structural bridge panels. In 2015 researchers incorporated CNTs and graphene into spider silk, increasing its strength and toughness to a new record. They sprayed 15 Pholcidae spiders with water containing the nanotubes or flakes. The resulting silk had a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young‚Äôs modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers. === Carbon nanotube springs === \\"Forests\\" of stretched, aligned MWNT springs can achieve an energy density 10 times greater than that of steel springs, offering cycling durability, temperature insensitivity, no spontaneous discharge and arbitrary discharge rate. SWNT forests are expected to be able to store far more than MWNTs. === Alloys === Adding small amounts of CNTs to metals increases tensile strength and modulus with potential in aerospace and automotive structures. Commercial aluminum-MWNT composites have strengths comparable to stainless steel (0.7 to 1 GPa) at one-third the density (2.6 g cm‚àí3), comparable to more expensive aluminium-lithium alloys. === Coatings and films === CNTs can serve as a multifunctional coating material. For example, paint/MWNT mixtures can reduce biofouling of ship hulls by discouraging attachment of algae and barnacles. They are a possible alternative to environmentally hazardous biocide-containing paints. Mixing CNTs into anticorrosion coatings for metals can enhance coating stiffness and strength and provide a path for cathodic protection. CNTs provide a less expensive alternative to ITO for a range of consumer devices. Besides cost, CNT's flexible, transparent conductors offer an advantage over brittle ITO coatings for flexible displays. CNT conductors can be deposited from solution and patterned by methods such as screen printing. SWNT films offer 90% transparency and a sheet resistivity of 100 ohm per square. Such films are under development for thin-film heaters, such as for defrosting windows or sidewalks. Carbon nanotubes forests and foams can also be coated with a variety of different materials to change their functionality and performance. Examples include silicon coated CNTs to create flexible energy-dense batteries, graphene coatings to create highly elastic aerogels and silicon carbide coatings to create a strong structural material for robust high- aspect-ratio 3D-micro architectures. There is a wide range of methods how CNTs can be formed into coatings and films.  Optical power detectors  A spray-on mixture of carbon nanotubes and ceramic demonstrates unprecedented ability to resist damage while absorbing laser light. Such coatings that absorb as the energy of high-powered lasers without breaking down are essential for optical power detectors that measure the output of such lasers. These are used, for example, in military equipment for defusing unexploded mines. The composite consists of multiwall carbon nanotubes and a ceramic made of silicon, carbon and nitrogen. Including boron boosts the breakdown temperature. The nanotubes and graphene-like carbon transmit heat well, while the oxidation-resistant ceramic boosts damage resistance. Creating the coating involves dispersing the nanotubes in toluene, to which a clear liquid polymer containing boron was added. The mixture was heated to . The result is crushed into a fine powder, dispersed again in toluene and sprayed in a thin coat on a copper surface. The coating absorbed 97.5 percent of the light from a far- infrared laser and tolerated 15 kilowatts per square centimeter for 10 seconds. Damage tolerance is about 50 percent higher than for similar coatings, e.g., nanotubes alone and carbon paint.  Radar absorption  Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by MWNTs. Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller radar cross-section. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the University of Michigan regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as stealth technology on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current stealth aircraft black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.Bourzac, Katherine. \\"Nano Paint Could Make Airplanes Invisible to Radar.\\" Technology Review. MIT, 5 December 2011. In 2010, Lockheed Martin Corporation applied for a patent for just such a CNT based radar absorbent material, which was reassigned and granted to Applied NanoStructure Solutions, LLC in 2012.http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PG01&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=%2220100271253%22.PGNR.&OS;=DN/20100271253&RS;=DN/20100271253; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=8325079.PN.&OS;=PN/8325079&RS;=PN/8325079 Some believe that this material is incorporated in the F-35 Lightning II.http://aviationweek.com/site- files/aviationweek.com/files/uploads/2017/12/12/State%20of%20Stealth%20FINAL%20121317.pdf, 14-15 == Microelectronics == Nanotube-based transistors, also known as carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs), have been made that operate at room temperature and that are capable of digital switching using a single electron. However, one major obstacle to realization of nanotubes has been the lack of technology for mass production. In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting ones behind for use as transistors. Their process is called \\"constructive destruction,\\" which includes the automatic destruction of defective nanotubes on the wafer. This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale. SWNTs are attractive for transistors because of their low electron scattering and their bandgap. SWNTs are compatible with field-effect transistor (FET) architectures and high-k dielectrics. Despite progress following the CNT transistor's appearance in 1998, including a tunneling FET with a subthreshold swing of <60 mV per decade (2004), a radio (2007) and an FET with sub-10-nm channel length and a normalized current density of 2.41 mA Œºm‚àí1 at 0.5 V, greater than those obtained for silicon devices. However, control of diameter, chirality, density and placement remains insufficient for commercial production. Less demanding devices of tens to thousands of SWNTs are more immediately practical. The use of CNT arrays/transistor increases output current and compensates for defects and chirality differences, improving device uniformity and reproducibility. For example, transistors using horizontally aligned CNT arrays achieved mobilities of 80 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1, subthreshold slopes of 140 mV per decade and on/off ratios as high as 105. CNT film deposition methods enable conventional semiconductor fabrication of more than 10,000 CNT devices per chip. Printed CNT thin-film transistors (TFTs) are attractive for driving organic light-emitting diode displays, showing higher mobility than amorphous silicon (~1 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1) and can be deposited by low- temperature, nonvacuum methods. Flexible CNT TFTs with a mobility of 35 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 and an on/off ratio of 6 were demonstrated. A vertical CNT FET showed sufficient current output to drive OLEDs at low voltage, enabling red-green- blue emission through a transparent CNT network. CNTs are under consideration for radio-frequency identification tags. Selective retention of semiconducting SWNTs during spin-coating and reduced sensitivity to adsorbates were demonstrated. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors suggests that CNTs could replace Cu interconnects in integrated circuits, owing to their low scattering, high current-carrying capacity, and resistance to electromigration. For this, vias comprising tightly packed (>1013 cm‚àí2) metallic CNTs with low defect density and low contact resistance are needed. Recently, complementarymetaloxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible 150-nm- diameter interconnects with a single CNT‚Äìcontact hole resistance of 2.8 kOhm were demonstrated on full 200-mm-diameter wafers. Also, as a replacement for solder bumps, CNTs can function both as electrical leads and heat dissipaters for use in high-power amplifiers. Last, a concept for a nonvolatile memory based on individual CNT crossbar electromechanical switches has been adapted for commercialization by patterning tangled CNT thin films as the functional elements. This required development of ultrapure CNT suspensions that can be spin-coated and processed in industrial clean room environments and are therefore compatible with CMOS processing standards. === Transistors === Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) can operate at room temperature and are capable of digital switching using a single electron. In 2013, a CNT logic circuit was demonstrated that could perform useful work. Major obstacles to nanotube-based microelectronics include the absence of technology for mass production, circuit density, positioning of individual electrical contacts, sample purity, control over length, chirality and desired alignment, thermal budget and contact resistance. One of the main challenges was regulating conductivity. Depending on subtle surface features, a nanotube may act as a conductor or as a semiconductor. Another way to make carbon nanotube transistors has been to use random networks of them. By doing so one averages all of their electrical differences and one can produce devices in large scale at the wafer level. This approach was first patented by Nanomix Inc.Nan≈çmix ‚Äì Breakthrough Detection Solutions with the Nanoelectronic Sensation Technology. Nano.com. (date of original application June 2002). It was first published in the academic literature by the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 2003 through independent research work. This approach also enabled Nanomix to make the first transistor on a flexible and transparent substrate. Since the electron mean free path in SWCNTs can exceed 1 micrometer, long channel CNTFETs exhibit near-ballistic transport characteristics, resulting in high speeds. CNT devices are projected to operate in the frequency range of hundreds of gigahertz. Nanotubes can be grown on nanoparticles of magnetic metal (Fe, Co) that facilitates production of electronic (spintronic) devices. In particular control of current through a field-effect transistor by magnetic field has been demonstrated in such a single-tube nanostructure.  History  In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting nanotubes for use as components. Using \\"constructive destruction\\", they destroyed defective nanotubes on the wafer. This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale. In 2003 room- temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and high-k gate dielectric were reported, showing 20‚Äì30x more current than state-of-the-art siliconMOSFETs. Palladium is a high-work function metal that was shown to exhibit Schottky barrier-free contacts to semiconducting nanotubes with diameters >1.7 nm. The potential of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated in 2003 when room- temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and high-k gate dielectric were reported, showing 20‚Äì30x higher ON current than state-of-the- art Si MOSFETs. This presented an important advance in the field as CNT was shown to potentially outperform Si. At the time, a major challenge was ohmic metal contact formation. In this regard, palladium, which is a high-work function metal was shown to exhibit Schottky barrier-free contacts to semiconducting nanotubes with diameters >1.7 nm. The first nanotube integrated memory circuit was made in 2004. One of the main challenges has been regulating the conductivity of nanotubes. Depending on subtle surface features a nanotube may act as a plain conductor or as a semiconductor. A fully automated method has however been developed to remove non-semiconductor tubes. In 2013, researchers demonstrated a Turing-complete prototype micrometer-scale computer.Lee, Robert. (3 October 2002) Scientists Build First Nanotube Computer. The Wall Street Journal.Hsu, Jeremy. (24 September 2013) Carbon Nanotube Computer Hints at Future Beyond Silicon Semiconductors. Scientific American.BBC News ‚Äì First computer made of carbon nanotubes is unveiled. BBC. Carbon nanotube transistors as logic-gate circuits with densities comparable to modern CMOS technology has not yet been demonstrated. In 2014 networks of purified semiconducting carbon nanotubes were used as the active material in p-type thin film transistors. They were created using 3-D printers using inkjet or gravure methods on flexible substrates, including polyimide and polyethylene (PET) and transparent substrates such as glass. These transistors reliably exhibit high-mobilities (> 10 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1) and ON/OFF ratios (> 1000) as well as threshold voltages below 5 V. They offer current density and low power consumption as well as environmental stability and mechanical flexibility. Hysterisis in the current-voltage curses as well as variability in the threshold voltage remain to be solved. In 2015 researchers announced a new way to connect wires to SWNTs that make it possible to continue shrinking the width of the wires without increasing electrical resistance. The advance was expected to shrink the contact point between the two materials to just 40 atoms in width and later less. They tubes align in regularly spaced rows on silicon wafers. Simulations indicated that designs could be optimized either for high performance or for low power consumption. Commercial devices were not expected until the 2020s. === Thermal management === Large structures of carbon nanotubes can be used for thermal management of electronic circuits. An approximately 1 mm‚Äìthick carbon nanotube layer was used as a special material to fabricate coolers, this material has very low density, ~20 times lower weight than a similar copper structure, while the cooling properties are similar for the two materials. Buckypaper has characteristics appropriate for use as a heat sink for chipboards, a backlight for LCD screens or as a faraday cage. == Solar cells == One of the promising applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is their use in solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon buckyballs (known as fullerenes) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow.S.A. Chivilikhin, V.V. Gusarov, I.Yu. Popov \\"Flows in nanostructures: hybrid classical-quantum models\\" Nanosystems: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, p 7 Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will then be able to make the electrons or current flow. Additional research has been conducted on creating SWNT hybrid solar panels to increase the efficiency further. These hybrids are created by combining SWNT's with photo-excitable electron donors to increase the number of electrons generated. It has been found that the interaction between the photo-excited porphyrin and SWNT generates electro-hole pairs at the SWNT surfaces. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, and contributes practically to an increase in efficiency up to 8.5%. Nanotubes can potentially replace indium tin oxide in solar cells as a transparent conductive film in solar cells to allow light to pass to the active layers and generate photocurrent. CNTs in organic solar cells help reduce energy loss (carrier recombination) and enhance resistance to photooxidation. Photovoltaic technologies may someday incorporate CNT-Silicon heterojunctions to leverage efficient multiple-exciton generation at p-n junctions formed within individual CNTs. In the nearer term, commercial photovoltaics may incorporate transparent SWNT electrodes. == Hydrogen storage == In addition to being able to store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen to be used as a fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H2), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the on-board storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H2 gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25‚Äì45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage efficiency. This method allows for a volume to energy ratio slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range. An area of controversy and frequent experimentation regarding the storage of hydrogen by adsorption in carbon nanotubes is the efficiency by which this process occurs. The effectiveness of hydrogen storage is integral to its use as a primary fuel source since hydrogen only contains about one fourth the energy per unit volume as gasoline. Studies however show that what is the most important is the surface area of the materials used. Hence activated carbon with surface area of 2600 m2/g can store up to 5,8% w/w. In all these carbonaceous materials, hydrogen is stored by physisorption at 70-90K. === Experimental capacity === One experiment sought to determine the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs by utilizing elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). CNTs (primarily SWNTs) were synthesized via chemical vapor disposition (CVD) and subjected to a two-stage purification process including air oxidation and acid treatment, then formed into flat, uniform discs and exposed to pure, pressurized hydrogen at various temperatures. When the data was analyzed, it was found that the ability of CNTs to store hydrogen decreased as temperature increased. Moreover, the highest hydrogen concentration measured was ~0.18%; significantly lower than commercially viable hydrogen storage needs to be. A separate experimental work performed by using a gravimetric method also revealed the maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of CNTs to be as low as 0.2%. In another experiment, CNTs were synthesized via CVD and their structure was characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Utilizing microwave digestion, the samples were exposed to different acid concentrations and different temperatures for various amounts of time in an attempt to find the optimum purification method for SWNTs of the diameter determined earlier. The purified samples were then exposed to hydrogen gas at various high pressures, and their adsorption by weight percent was plotted. The data showed that hydrogen adsorption levels of up to 3.7% are possible with a very pure sample and under the proper conditions. It is thought that microwave digestion helps improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs by opening up the ends, allowing access to the inner cavities of the nanotubes. === Limitations on efficient hydrogen adsorption === The biggest obstacle to efficient hydrogen storage using CNTs is the purity of the nanotubes. To achieve maximum hydrogen adsorption, there must be minimum graphene, amorphous carbon, and metallic deposits in the nanotube sample. Current methods of CNT synthesis require a purification step. However, even with pure nanotubes, the adsorption capacity is only maximized under high pressures, which are undesirable in commercial fuel tanks. == Electronic components == Various companies are developing transparent, electrically conductive CNT films and nanobuds to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in LCDs, touch screens and photovoltaic devices. Nanotube films show promise for use in displays for computers, cell phones, Personal digital assistants, and automated teller machines. CNT diodes display a photovoltaic effect. Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT coated with magnetite) can generate strong magnetic fields. Recent advances show that MWNT decorated with maghemite nanoparticles can be oriented in a magnetic field and enhance the electrical properties of the composite material in the direction of the field for use in electric motor brushes. A layer of 29% iron enriched single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) placed on top of a layer of explosive material such as PETN can be ignited with a regular camera flash. CNTs can be used as electron guns in miniature cathode ray tubes (CRT) in high-brightness, low-energy, low-weight displays. A display would consist of a group of tiny CRTs, each providing the electrons to illuminate the phosphor of one pixel, instead of having one CRT whose electrons are aimed using electric and magnetic fields. These displays are known as field emission displays (FEDs). CNTs can act as antennas for radios and other electromagnetic devices. Conductive CNTs are used in brushes for commercial electric motors. They replace traditional carbon black. The nanotubes improve electrical and thermal conductivity because they stretch through the plastic matrix of the brush. This permits the carbon filler to be reduced from 30% down to 3.6%, so that more matrix is present in the brush. Nanotube composite motor brushes are better-lubricated (from the matrix), cooler-running (both from better lubrication and superior thermal conductivity), less brittle (more matrix, and fiber reinforcement), stronger and more accurately moldable (more matrix). Since brushes are a critical failure point in electric motors, and also don't need much material, they became economical before almost any other application. Wires for carrying electric current may be fabricated from nanotubes and nanotube-polymer composites. Small wires have been fabricated with specific conductivity exceeding copper and aluminum; the highest conductivity non-metallic cables. CNT are under investigation as an alternative to tungsten filaments in incandescent light bulbs. === Interconnects === Metallic carbon nanotubes have aroused research interest for their applicability as very-large-scale integration (VLSI) interconnects because of their high thermal stability, high thermal conductivity and large current carrying capacity. An isolated CNT can carry current densities in excess of 1000 MA/cm2 without damage even at an elevated temperature of , eliminating electromigration reliability concerns that plague Cu interconnects. Recent modeling work comparing the two has shown that CNT bundle interconnects can potentially offer advantages over copper. Recent experiments demonstrated resistances as low as 20 Ohms using different architectures, detailed conductance measurements over a wide temperature range were shown to agree with theory for a strongly disordered quasi-one- dimensional conductor. Hybrid interconnects that employ CNT vias in tandem with copper interconnects may offer advantages from a reliability/thermal- management perspective. In 2016, the European Union has funded a four million euro project over three years to evaluate manufacturability and performance of composite interconnects employing both CNT and copper interconnects. The project named CONNECT (CarbON Nanotube compositE InterconneCTs) involves the joint efforts of seven European research and industry partners on fabrication techniques and processes to enable reliable Carbon NanoTubes for on-chip interconnects in ULSI microchip production. === Electrical cables and wires === Wires for carrying electric current may be fabricated from pure nanotubes and nanotube-polymer composites. It has already been demonstrated that carbon nanotube wires can successfully be used for power or data transmission. Recently small wires have been fabricated with specific conductivity exceeding copper and aluminum; these cables are the highest conductivity carbon nanotube and also highest conductivity non-metal cables. Recently, composite of carbon nanotube and copper have been shown to exhibit nearly one hundred times higher current-carrying-capacity than pure copper or gold. Significantly, the electrical conductivity of such a composite is similar to pure Cu. Thus, this Carbon nanotube-copper (CNT-Cu) composite possesses the highest observed current-carrying capacity among electrical conductors. Thus for a given cross- section of electrical conductor, the CNT-Cu composite can withstand and transport one hundred times higher current compared to metals such as copper and gold. == Energy storage == The use of CNTs as a catalyst support in fuel cells can potentially reduce platinum usage by 60% compared with carbon black. Doped CNTs may enable the complete elimination of Pt. === Supercapacitor === MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics uses nanotubes to improve supercapacitors. The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size‚Äîfew too large or too small‚Äîand consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.Halber, Deborah. MIT LEES on Batteries . Lees.mit.edu. A 40-F supercapacitor with a maximum voltage of 3.5 V that employed forest-grown SWNTs that are binder- and additive-free achieved an energy density of 15.6 Wh kg‚àí1 and a power density of 37 kW kg‚àí1. CNTs can be bound to the charge plates of capacitors to dramatically increase the surface area and therefore energy density. === Batteries === Carbon nanotubes' (CNTs) exciting electronic properties have shown promise in the field of batteries, where typically they are being experimented as a new electrode material, particularly the anode for lithium ion batteries. This is due to the fact that the anode requires a relatively high reversible capacity at a potential close to metallic lithium, and a moderate irreversible capacity, observed thus far only by graphite-based composites, such as CNTs. They have shown to greatly improve capacity and cyclability of lithium-ion batteries, as well as the capability to be very effective buffering components, alleviating the degradation of the batteries that is typically due to repeated charging and discharging. Further, electronic transport in the anode can be greatly improved using highly metallic CNTs. More specifically, CNTs have shown reversible capacities from 300 to 600 mAhg‚àí1, with some treatments to them showing these numbers rise to up to 1000 mAhg‚àí1. Meanwhile, graphite, which is most widely used as an anode material for these lithium batteries, has shown capacities of only 320 mAhg‚àí1. By creating composites out of the CNTs, scientists see much potential in taking advantage of these exceptional capacities, as well as their excellent mechanical strength, conductivities, and low densities. MWNTs are used in lithium ion batteries cathodes. In these batteries, small amounts of MWNT powder are blended with active materials and a polymer binder, such as 1 wt % CNT loading in cathodes and graphite anodes. CNTs provide increased electrical connectivity and mechanical integrity, which enhances rate capability and cycle life.  Paper batteries  A paper battery is a battery engineered to use a paper-thin sheet of cellulose (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned carbon nanotubes. The potential for these devices is great, as they may be manufactured via a roll- to-roll process, which would make it very low-cost, and they would be lightweight, flexible, and thin. In order to productively use paper electronics (or any thin electronic devices), the power source must be equally thin, thus indicating the need for paper batteries. Recently, it has been shown that surfaces coated with CNTs can be used to replace heavy metals in batteries. More recently, functional paper batteries have been demonstrated, where a lithium-ion battery is integrated on a single sheet of paper through a lamination process as a composite with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) or LiCoO2 (LCO). The paper substrate would function well as the separator for the battery, where the CNT films function as the current collectors for both the anode and the cathode. These rechargeable energy devices show potential in RFID tags, functional packaging, or new disposable electronic applications. Improvements have also been shown in lead-acid batteries, based on research performed by Bar-Ilan University using high quality SWCNT manufactured by OCSiAl. The study demonstrated an increase in the lifetime of lead acid batteries by 4.5 times and a capacity increase of 30% on average and up to 200% at high discharge rates. == Chemical == CNT can be used for desalination. Water molecules can be separated from salt by forcing them through electrochemically robust nanotube networks with controlled nanoscale porosity. This process requires far lower pressures than conventional reverse osmosis methods. Compared to a plain membrane, it operates at a 20 ¬∞C lower temperature, and at a 6x greater flow rate. Membranes using aligned, encapsulated CNTs with open ends permit flow through the CNTs' interiors. Very-small-diameter SWNTs are needed to reject salt at seawater concentrations. Portable filters containing CNT meshes can purify contaminated drinking water. Such networks can electrochemically oxidize organic contaminants, bacteria and viruses. CNT membranes can filter carbon dioxide from power plant emissions. CNT can be filled with biological molecules, aiding biotechnology. CNT have the potential to store between 4.2 and 65% hydrogen by weight. If they can be mass-produced economically, of CNT could contain the same amount of energy as a gasoline tank. CNTs can be used to produce nanowires of other elements/molecules, such as gold or zinc oxide. Nanowires in turn can be used to cast nanotubes of other materials, such as gallium nitride. These can have very different properties from CNTs‚Äîfor example, gallium nitride nanotubes are hydrophilic, while CNTs are hydrophobic, giving them possible uses in organic chemistry. == Mechanical == Oscillators based on CNT have achieved speeds of > 50 GHz. CNT electrical and mechanical properties suggest them as alternatives to traditional electrical actuators. === Actuators === The exceptional electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have made them alternatives to the traditional electrical actuators for both microscopic and macroscopic applications. Carbon nanotubes are very good conductors of both electricity and heat, and they are also very strong and elastic molecules in certain directions. === Loudspeaker === Carbon nanotubes have also been applied in the acoustics (such as loudspeaker and earphone). In 2008 it was shown that a sheet of nanotubes can operate as a loudspeaker if an alternating current is applied. The sound is not produced through vibration but thermoacoustically.Hot nanotube sheets produce music on demand, New Scientists News, 31 October 2008 In 2013, a carbon nanotube (CNT) thin yarn thermoacoustic earphone together with CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip was demonstrated by a research group of Tsinghua- Foxconn Nanotechnology Research Center in Tsinghua University, using a Si- based semi-conducting technology compatible fabrication process. Near-term commercial uses include replacing piezoelectric speakers in greeting cards. == Optical == :See additional applications in: Optical properties of carbon nanotubes *Carbon nanotube photoluminescence (fluorescence) can be used to observe semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube species. Photoluminescence maps, made by acquiring the emission and scanning the excitation energy, can facilitate sample characterization. *Nanotube fluorescence is under investigation for biomedical imaging and sensors. *The reflectivity of buckypaper produced with \\"super-growth\\" chemical vapor deposition is 0.03 or less, potentially enabling performance gains for pyroelectric infrared detectors. AIST nanotech 2009 . aist.go.jp == Environmental  Environmental remediation === A CNT nano-structured sponge (nanosponge) containing sulfur and iron is more effective at soaking up water contaminants such as oil, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Their magnetic properties make them easier to retrieve once the clean-up job is done. The sulfur and iron increases sponge size to around . It also increases porosity due to beneficial defects, creating buoyancy and reusability. Iron, in the form of ferrocene makes the structure easier to control and enables recovery using magnets. Such nanosponges increase the absorption of the toxic organic solvent dichlorobenzene from water by 3.5 times. The sponges can absorb vegetable oil up to 150 times their initial weight and can absorb engine oil as well. Earlier, a magnetic boron-doped MWNT nanosponge that could absorb oil from water. The sponge was grown as a forest on a substrate via chemical vapor disposition. Boron puts kinks and elbows into the tubes as they grow and promotes the formation of covalent bonds. The nanosponges retain their elastic property after 10,000 compressions in the lab. The sponges are both superhydrophobic, forcing them to remain at the water's surface and oleophilic, drawing oil to them.Quick, Darren (17 April 2012) Reusable oil-absorbing nanosponges could soak up oil spills. Gizmag === Water treatment === It has been shown that carbon nanotubes exhibit strong adsorption affinities to a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic contaminants in water, due to their large and hydrophobic surface areas. They also showed similar adsorption capacities as activated carbons in the presence of natural organic matter. As a result, they have been suggested as promising adsorbents for removal of contaminant in water and wastewater treatment systems. Moreover, membranes made out of carbon nanotube arrays have been suggested as switchable molecular sieves, with sieving and permeation features that can be dynamically activated/deactivated by either pore size distribution (passive control) or external electrostatic fields (active control). == Other applications == Carbon nanotubes have been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems, including mechanical memory elements (NRAM being developed by Nantero Inc.) and nanoscale electric motors (see Nanomotor or Nanotube nanomotor). Carboxyl-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (so called zig-zag, armchair type) can act as sensors of atoms and ions of alkali metals Na, Li, K. In May 2005, Nanomix Inc. placed on the market a hydrogen sensor that integrated carbon nanotubes on a silicon platform. Eikos Inc of Franklin, Massachusetts and Unidym Inc. of Silicon Valley, California are developing transparent, electrically conductive films of carbon nanotubes to replace indium tin oxide (ITO). Carbon nanotube films are substantially more mechanically robust than ITO films, making them ideal for high-reliability touchscreens and flexible displays. Printable water-based inks of carbon nanotubes are desired to enable the production of these films to replace ITO. Nanotube films show promise for use in displays for computers, cell phones, PDAs, and ATMs. A nanoradio, a radio receiver consisting of a single nanotube, was demonstrated in 2007. The use in tensile stress or toxic gas sensors was proposed by Tsagarakis. A flywheel made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a density approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of storing electricity, making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress. Carbon nanotube springs have the potential to indefinitely store elastic potential energy at ten times the density of lithium-ion batteries with flexible charge and discharge rates and extremely high cycling durability. Ultra-short SWNTs (US- tubes) have been used as nanoscaled capsules for delivering MRI contrast agents in vivo. Carbon nanotubes provide a certain potential for metal-free catalysis of inorganic and organic reactions. For instance, oxygen groups attached to the surface of carbon nanotubes have the potential to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenations or selective oxidations. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes may replace platinum catalysts used to reduce oxygen in fuel cells. A forest of vertically aligned nanotubes can reduce oxygen in alkaline solution more effectively than platinum, which has been used in such applications since the 1960s. Here, the nanotubes have the added benefit of not being subject to carbon monoxide poisoning. Wake Forest University engineers are using multiwalled carbon nanotubes to enhance the brightness of field-induced polymer electroluminescent technology, potentially offering a step forward in the search for safe, pleasing, high-efficiency lighting. In this technology, moldable polymer matrix emits light when exposed to an electric current. It could eventually yield high-efficiency lights without the mercury vapor of compact fluorescent lamps or the bluish tint of some fluorescents and LEDs, which has been linked with circadian rhythm disruption. Candida albicans has been used in combination with carbon nanotubes (CNT) to produce stable electrically conductive bio-nano-composite tissue materials that have been used as temperature sensing elements. The SWNT production company OCSiAl developed a series of masterbatches for industrial use of single-wall CNTs in multiple types of rubber blends and tires, with initial trials showing increases in hardness, viscosity, tensile strain resistance and resistance to abrasion while reducing elongation and compression In tires the three primary characteristics of durability, fuel efficiency and traction were improved using SWNTs. The development of rubber masterbatches built on earlier work by the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology showing rubber to be a viable candidate for improvement with SWNTs. Introducing MWNTs to polymers can improve flame retardancy and retard thermal degradation of polymer. The results confirmed that combination of MWNTs and ammonium polyphosphates show a synergistic effect for improving flame retardancy. == References  External links == * * Applications of Carbon Nanotubes Category:Carbon nanotubes Category:Electronic design automation Category:Open problems ","title":"Potential applications of carbon nanotubes"},{"id":"7452935","text":"Logo of Niva Niva () is a weekly newspaper in Belarusian language published by the Belarusian minority in Poland.

The station, which appears to have commenced transmissions in the 1970s, is believed to have been controlled by the British Secret Intelligence Service. It is thought to have originally broadcast from a base on Guam (a US territory), but moved to Australia in 2009. Broadcasts from Cherry Ripe consisted of an electronically-synthesised, English-accented female voice, reading groups of five numbers, e.g. \\"3-5-7-6-1\\". The final number in each group was spoken at a higher pitch. It is likely that the station was used to communicate messages to undercover agents operating in other countries, to be decoded using a one-time pad. A better known and more active counterpart, known as the Lincolnshire Poacher, also after an English folk song used as its interval signal, was broadcast from the eastern Mediterranean from the early 1970s until 2008. Many aspects of both stations' broadcasts were identical. The Lincolnshire Poacher used the same synthesised female voice and was also suspected as being operated by the UK government. From unofficial triangulation, its location was determined to be RAF Akrotiri, on Cyprus. Cherry Ripe appeared to assume at least part of the role of the Lincolnshire Poacher, after the latter ceased transmission. In September 2009, the transmitter for Cherry Ripe was moved to Humpty Doo, in Australia.

Shantaram, who also starred. It is considered to be one of the classics of Hindi cinema and is based on humanistic psychology. It won a Golden Bear at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival and a Golden Globe Award in the new category Samuel Goldwyn International Film Award for best film produced outside of the United States. The film is also remembered for the song \\"Aye Maalik Tere Bande Hum\\", sung by Lata Mangeshkar and written by Bharat Vyas. The film was inspired by the story of an \\"open prison\\" experiment: Swatantrapur in the princely state of Aundh near Satara. Now, Swatantrapur is part of Atpadi tehsil in Sangli district of Maharashtra. It was recounted by screenwriter G. D. Madgulkar to V. Shantaram. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.25 Must See Bollywood Films indiatimes.com. During filming, V. Shantaram fought with a bull and injured an eye, but his eyesight survived.Classics Revisited ‚Äì Do Aankhen Barah Haath Rediff.com.

He takes these notorious, often surly murderers and makes them work hard with him on a dilapidated country farm, rehabilitating them through hard work and kind guidance as they eventually produce a great harvest. The film ends with the death of the warden at the hands of the oxes of a corrupt enemy who wants no competition in the profitable market he controls. The film takes the viewers through several scenes that set a strong moral lesson that through hard work, dedication and concentration a person can accomplish anything. It also explains that if people focus their energy on a worthy cause, success is guaranteed. In the final scene, all six thieves became hardworking persons and decided to live at that hut where they learn all things because they think the two eyes of adinath are observing them whether they are doing good things or bad and they raise their hands to salute the positive energy of Adinath and film ends with the song sung by Champa and one of the favourite songs of Adinath, \\"Aye Maalik Tere Bande Hum\\". ==Promotion== Noted painter G.

Launched on the premise of producing ‚Äúclothes without prejudices‚Äù Cross Colours helped establish a fashion market based around black youth. The clothing was used to broadcast political and social messages. ==History== Cross Colours was the brainchild of Carl Jones the entrepreneur who studied fashion at Otis Parson's School of Design and Trade Technical College in Los Angeles, then worked in various fashion enterprises before starting his own T-shirt company. He eventually started a company called Surf Fetish, which rode the wave of beachwear trends. He also hired Thomas Walker, a graphic designer who would eventually become vice president of Cross Colours. For Jones, Cross Colours was a way to broadcast political and social messages-such as denouncing gangs or calling for racial unity-to the African American community, and eventually other communities as the clothes' popularity spread. The label, whose baseball caps, baggy jeans, and message-bearing T-shirts were to prove influential, also introduced such future designers as Karl Kani. In 2014 Cross Colours made a fresh start as a multistyle street fashion label. Cross Colours does not specifically target the African-American youth but targets a broader multicultural group.

Southampton was a strategic bombing target for the Luftwaffe as it contained both busy docks with associated business premises and factories and the Supermarine factory building Spitfires in Woolston. Being a large port city on the south coast it was within easy reach of German airfields in France, as was the neighbouring city of Portsmouth. During the war, 57 attacks on the city were made, but over 1,500 air raid warnings were issued. According to the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Department approximately 2,300 bombs were dropped amounting to over 470 tonnes of high explosives. Over 30,000 incendiary devices were dropped on the city with nearly 45,000 buildings damaged or destroyed, with most of the city's High Street being hit. ==Spitfire factory== The Supermarine factory building making Spitfires in Woolston was a key target in the city. On the 24 and 26 September, 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked the riverside factory during two day-time raids. Much of the factory was destroyed and 110 people were killed. Northam gasworks was also targeted on 26 September and 11 workers were killed in the raid. ==Civic Centre== A daylight raid on 6 November 1940 targeted the city's Civic Centre. Hermann Goering, head of the Luftwaffe, had remarked that the Civic Centre appeared like a \\"piece of cake\\" from the air, and that he was going to \\"cut himself a slice\\". During the raid twelve bombs were dropped, including a direct hit on the Civic Centre with a 500lb high explosive. The bomb penetrated to the lower floors of the art gallery killing 35 people, including 15 children, who were having an art lesson in the basement. ==Blitz== Of the 57 air raids, by far the worst were on 23 and 30 November and 1 December 1940 and these attacks are generally referred to as \\"Southampton's Blitz\\". Starting at 1815 and running until midnight on the evening of 23 November, 77 people were killed and over 300 injured with the Civic Centre taking much of the brunt of the attack. The scale of the raid ruined the city's water supply and many of the fires had the be left to burn themselves out. There were reports that the glow of the firestorm of Southampton burning could be seen from as far away as Cherbourg on the coast of France. Nazi publicity declared in propaganda that the city had been left a smoking ruin. A week later, 120 German bombers returned for a further six-hour attack on the evening of November 30. 800 bombs dropped on the city left 137 dead, 96 killed in their air raid shelters. Major buildings including Pirelli Cable Works, the Daily Echo newspaper building and the General Motors factory were severely damaged or destroyed. All Saints', Holyrood and St. Mary's churches, were destroyed and although St. Michael's escaped with only minor damage, allegedly because the spire was used by the German bombers as a landmark and their pilots were ordered not to hit it. Altogether, Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes. The last casualties of air raids in the city were in a small raid on the suburbs of the city in May 1941 and on 8 July 1941 in the area of Victory Crescent, Millbrook, killing three people. The last major raid of over 50 bombers was in June 1942. There were occasional tip and run raids and in 1944 two V1 flying bombs in mid-July were the last enemy ordnance to fall in the city. ==Victims== Among the victims of the bombing was Edgar L. Perry, who had worked as a coal trimmer on board the RMS Titanic in 1912. Perry, who had survived the sinking, perished along with his wife on 23 November 1940 as they sought shelter from the bombing. ==References External links == *BBC People's War - One child's memories of the Southampton Blitz *BBC People's War - getting bombed when home on leave *Soton Blitz on Plimsoll.org *Mapping the Southampton Blitz 70 years on - Ordnance Survey Category:History of Southampton Southampton Category:The Blitz Category:20th century in Hampshire Category:20th century in Southampton ","title":"Southampton Blitz"},{"id":"7453123","text":"Nirah in the form of a snake on upper edge of a kudurru boundary stone.

The administrative center was the village of Sira where Bakke Church is located. ==History== The church parish of Bakke (population: 2,378 in 1835) was split into three civil municipalities on 1 January 1838: Vestre Bakke, √òstre Bakke, and Gyland. This occurred because the main church parish of Bakke contained land in both the counties of Rogaland and Vest-Agder and they had to be divided according to the formannskapsdistrikt law. Due to the very low populations of the three municipalities, this arrangement did not last long. In August 1838, the county border was moved westwards to its current position, and √òstre Bakke and Vestre Bakke were merged to form the municipality of Bakke. Then about a year later, in November 1839, Gyland was merged into the municipality of Bakke. In 1849, the northern district of Sirdal (population: 1,804) was separated from Bakke to become a municipality of its own, leaving 2,597 inhabitants in Bakke. On 31 December 1893, Gyland (population: 1,085) was also separated from Bakke to form a municipality of its own. This split left Bakke with a population of 1,368. On 1 January 1960, the √òksendal area (population: 226) in northern Bakke was merged with Tonstad and √òvre Sirdal municipalities to form a new municipality of Sirdal. On 1 January 1965, another major municipal merger took place due in part to the work of the Schei Committee. Bakke (population: 925) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Gyland, Nes, and Hidra and with the town of Flekkefjord to create the new municipality of Flekkefjord. ==Name== The parish and the municipality was named after the old Bakke farm (Old Norse: Bakkar), located on the south side of the village of Sira, where the first Bakke Church was located. The name is the plural form of bakki which means \\"hillside\\" or \\"riverside\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== *Weather information for Bakke Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:Sirdal ","title":"Bakke, Norway"},{"id":"7453140","text":"Tekovsk√© Nemce is a village and municipality in Zlat√© Moravce District of the Nitra Region, in western-central Slovakia. ==History== In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1275. ==Geography== The municipality lies at an altitude of and covers an area of .

A year later, he starred in the movie serial Tarzan the Tiger, which, though shot as a silent feature, was partially dubbed into sound. Merrill was thus the first actor to voice Tarzan's \\"victory cry\\" on film. ==Later life== With the coming of sound films, it was decided that Merrill's voice was unsuitable for the \\"talkies,\\" and he was not asked back in the role. This suited Merrill fine, as he had so enjoyed meeting youngsters via his tenure as Tarzan that he devoted the rest of his life to working with children in the Los Angeles city administration, the Los Angeles Parks Commission, as a recreation director and as a volunteer gymnastics instructor with the YMCA. ==Death== Merrill died on February 12, 1966, in Hollywood, California.

The Polisario Front rejected this illegal move and declared in Bir Lehlou, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as the state representing an independent Western Sahara. In 1979, Mauritania signed a peace treaty with the Polisario front, and Morocco annexed the part formerly controlled by Mauritania. A U.N.-brokered ceasefire was signed in 1991 between the two parties, but the sovereignty of the territory remains unresolved pending ongoing peace-talks. ===Coat of arms of Spanish Sahara=== The Coat of arms of Spanish Sahara was used for the Spanish colony of Spanish Sahara.

A real paceman, he made his first-class debut against a team of West Indians for Worcestershire in 1995, after breaking through with a quick wicket.

His second season was to prove harder than his debut, and he was released in 1997. Determined to stay in the game, he relegated himself to Second XI cricket with Derbyshire, and though he was only to make one first-class appearance for the Peakites, this was perhaps the appearance which epitomized his career, as he exemplified phenomenal pace and great comfort within the team. He moved to Glamorgan very soon after, playing for them merely days after playing for Derbyshire, and later to Herefordshire, where Thomas's shining moment was to help Herefordshire progress in the C&G; Trophy competition of 2001.

The municipality existed from 1837 until 1968 when it was merged into √Ölesund Municipality. Borgund originally encompassed the large area north of the Storfjorden and south of the Grytafjorden, from the mainland areas of today's Skodje Municipality in the east to the islands of today's Giske Municipality and the ocean in the west. The city of √Ölesund was located in the central part of Borgund, however, was not part of Borgund, and it was governed separately. At its dissolution in 1968, the municipality included the islands of Sula, Humla, T√∏rla, and Ellings√∏ya, as well as parts of Oksen√∏ya, Hessa, and N√∏rv√∏ya, plus many minor islands throughout the area. The main church for the municipality was Borgund Church, located at Borgund (on the western tip of Oksen√∏ya). The administrative centre of the municipality was at Borgund, near the church, along the N√∏rvasundet strait. ==History== The municipality of Borgund was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). According to the 1835 census, the municipality had a population of 3,754. In 1849, the eastern district of Borgund including the mainland part of Borgund and the eastern part of Oksen√∏ya island was separated from Borgund to become Skodje Municipality. This left Borgund with 4,461 inhabitants. On 1 January 1908, the islands of Giske, God√∏ya, and Valder√∏ya in western Borgund were separated from the municipality to become the new Giske Municipality. Borgund then had a population of 6,734. On 1 January 1916, a small part of Skodje Municipality (population: 14) was transferred to Borgund Municipality. Also on 1 July 1958, a small part of Hareid Municipality on the island of Sula, with 68 inhabitants, was transferred to Borgund Municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the northern part of Borgund Municipality (including the Gamlem, S√∏vik, and Grytastranda areas on the mainland and the islands of Bj√∏rn√∏ya, Ter√∏ya and many small islands around them) with 1,191 inhabitants, was administratively transferred into the neighboring Haram Municipality to the north. On 1 January 1968, Borgund municipality ceased to exist when it was merged with the town of √Ölesund, creating the new √Ölesund Municipality. Prior to the merger, Borgund had a population of 20,132. It was the most populous municipality in M√∏re og Romsdal at the time. On 1 January 1977, the island of Sula, previously a part of Borgund, was separated from √Ölesund to constitute the new Sula Municipality. ===Incorporation into √Ölesund=== There was considerable debate on the 1968 incorporation into √Ölesund and on what to name the new, larger municipality. The municipal council of Borgund opposed its own incorporation into √Ölesund as worked out by the Schei Committee. However, when the Norwegian Parliament agreed to the incorporation, Borgund's municipal council passed a resolution that the new municipality be named Borgund instead of √Ölesund. The case went to the Government of Norway, who drafted a resolution that the name √Ölesund should be kept. In the Council of State of 10 March 1967, the cabinet Borten agreed to this, except for Per Borten, Kjell Bondevik, Bjarne Lyngstad, and Dagfinn V√•rvik who formally dissented--to no avail. The name √Ölesund was recommended, and the Norwegian Parliament passed it. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Borgund, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Borgund was made up of 41 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The tail is typically in length, and the ears are long. ==Taxonomy== The Korean hare was first described by Thomas in 1892. Five other species of hare in the genus Lepus occur in eastern Asia: the Chinese hare (L. sinensis), the mountain hare (L. timidus), the Manchurian hare (L. mandschuricus), the Japanese hare (L. brachyurus) and the brown hare (L. capensis). In 1974, the Korean hare was considered to be a subspecies of L. brachyurus and in 1978, a subspecies of L. sinensis, however, a study of mtDNA published in 2010 showed that the Korean hare is a valid species (L. coreanus). ==Distribution and habitat== The Korean hare is native to the Korean Peninsula and the Jilin Province in northeastern China. It is found on plains, in scrublands and in mountainous regions. Densities ranged from no individuals on coastal cultivated land to four individuals per square kilometre (0.4 square mile) in the hills and five per square kilometres in the mountains. A study in the Jirisan National Park in South Korea found that its abundance increased in proportion to the density of scrub cover in its habitat. ==Conservation== The IUCN, in its Red List of Threatened Species, lists the Korean hare as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because, although the population trend is unknown, this hare seems to be a common species without any specific identified threats. It has been reported as damaging barley crops in the foothills of South Gyeongsang Province, and ringing the bark and killing peach trees in South Jeolla Province, both in South Korea.

A temporal part would be something like \\"the first year of a person's life\\", or \\"all of a table from between 10:00 a.m. on June 21, 1994 to 11:00 p.m. on July 23, 1996\\". The term is used in the debate over the persistence of material objects. Objects typically have parts that exist in space‚Äîa human body, for example, has spatial parts like hands, feet, and legs. Some metaphysicists believe objects have temporal parts as well. Originally it was argued that those who believe in temporal parts believe in perdurantism, that persisting objects are wholes composed entirely of temporal parts. This view was contrasted with endurantism, the claim that objects are wholly present at any one time (thus not having different temporal parts at different times). This claim is still commonplace, but philosophers like Ted Sider believe that even endurantists should accept temporal parts. ==Definition== Not everyone was happy with the definition by analogy: some philosophers, such as Peter van Inwagen, argued that‚Äîeven given the definition by analogy‚Äîthey still had no real idea what a temporal part was meant to be (1981: 133), whilst others have felt that whether temporal parts existed or not is merely a verbal dispute (Eli Hirsch holds this view). Gallois surveys some of the attempts to create a more specific definition (Gallois 1998: 256). The early attempts included identifying temporal parts with ordered pairs of times and objects, but it seems relatively unproblematic that temporal parts exist given the definition and ordered pairs seem unsuitable to play the role that perdurantists demand, such as being parts of persisting wholes‚Äîhow can a set be a part of a material object? Later perdurantists identified persisting objects with events, and as events having temporal parts was not problematic (for example, the first and second halves of a football match), it was imagined that persisting objects could have temporal parts. There was a reluctance from many to identify objects with events, and this definition has long since fallen out of fashion. Of the definitions closest to those commonly used in the literature, the earliest was Thomson: > x is a cross-sectional temporal part of y =df (‚àÉT)[y and x exist through T & > no part of x exists outside T & (‚àÄt)(t is in T ‚äÉ (‚àÄP)(y exactly occupies P > at t ‚äÉ x exactly occupies P at t))] (Thomson 1983: 207). Later, Sider tried to combat the fears of endurantists who could not understand what a temporal part is by defining it in terms of \\"part at a time\\" or \\"parthood at a time\\", a relation that the endurantist should accept, unlike parthood simpliciter‚Äîwhich an endurantist may say makes no sense, given that all parts are had at a time. (However, McDaniel argues that even endurantists should accept that notion [McDaniel (2004) 146-7]). Sider gave the following definition, which is widely used: > x is an instantaneous temporal part of y at instant t =df (i) x is a part of > y; (ii) x exists at, but only, at t; and (iii) x overlaps every part of y > that exists at t. (Sider 2001: 60). Sider also gave an alternative definition that is compatible with presentism, using the tensed operators \\"WILL\\" and \\"WAS\\": > x is an instantaneous temporal part of y =df (i) x is a part of y; (ii) x > overlaps every part of y; (iii) it is not the case that WILL (x exists); > (iv) it is not the case that WAS (x exists). (Sider 2001: 71). While Sider's definition is most commonly used, Zimmerman‚Äîtroubled by the demand for instants (which may not exist in a gunky space-time that is such that every region has a sub-region)‚Äîgives the following: > x is a temporal part of y throughout T =df (i) x exists during and only > during T; (ii) for every subinterval T* of T, there is a z such that (a) z > is a part of x, and (b) for all u, u has a part in common with z during T* > if and only if u has a part in common with y during T*; and (iii) y exists > at times outside of T. (Zimmerman 1996: 122) ==The argument from temporary intrinsics== Temporal parts are sometimes used to account for change. The problem of change is just that if an object x and an object y have different properties, then by Leibniz's Law, one ought to conclude that they are different. For example, if a person changes from having long hair to short hair, then the temporal-parts theorist can say that change is the difference between the temporal parts of a temporally extended object (the person). So, the person changes by having a temporal part with long hair, and a temporal part with short hair; the temporal parts are different, which is consistent with Leibniz's Law. However, those who reject the notion that ordinary objects, like people, have temporal parts usually adopt a more common-sense view. They say that an object has properties at times. In this view, the person changes by having long hair at t, to short hair at t'. To them, there is no contradiction in thinking an object is capable of having different properties at different times. An argument widely held to favor the concept of temporal parts arises from these points (Sider, 2001): David Lewis' argument from temporary intrinsics, which he first advanced in On the Plurality of Worlds. The outline of the argument is as follows: :P1: There are intrinsic properties, i.e., properties had by an object independently of anything in the world. :P2: If every property had by an object is had to times, then there are no intrinsic properties. :C1: Therefore, not every property had by an object is had two times. Objects have some of their properties intrinsically, i.e., simpliciter. :P3: But only temporal parts can have their properties simpliciter. :C2: Therefore, there are temporal parts. (For this to follow, it is required that there be objects). Premise P1 is an intuitive premise; generally we distinguish between properties and relations. An intrinsic property is just a property that something has independently of anything else; an extrinsic property is had only in relation to something. An example of an extrinsic property is \\"fatherhood\\": something is a father only if that something is a male and has a child. An example of an alleged intrinsic property is \\"shape\\". According to Lewis (Sider, 2001), if we know what \\"shapes\\" are, we know them to be properties, not relations. However, if properties are had to times, as endurantists say, then no property is intrinsic. Even if a ball is round throughout its existence, the endurantist must say \\"for all times in which the ball exists, the ball is round, i.e., it is round at those times; it has the property 'being round at a time'.\\" So, if all properties are had to times, then there are no intrinsic properties, (premise P2). However, if we think that Lewis is right and some properties are intrinsic, then some properties are not had to times‚Äîthey are had simpliciter (premise C1). It might be said that premise P3 is more controversial. For instance, suppose a timeless world is possible. If that were so, then in that world, even if there were intrinsic properties, they would not be had by temporal parts‚Äîsince by definition a timeless world has no temporal dimension, and therefore in such a world there cannot be temporal parts. However, our world is not timeless, and the possibility of timeless worlds is questionable, so it seems reasonable to think that in worlds with a temporal dimension, only temporal parts can have properties simpliciter. This is so because temporal parts exist only at an instant, and therefore it makes no sense to speak of them as having properties at a time. Temporal parts have properties, and have a temporal location. So if person A changes from having long hair to having short hair, then that can be paraphrased by saying that there is a temporal part of A that has long hair simpliciter and another that has short hair simpliciter, and the latter is after the former in the temporal sequence; that supports premise P3. Premise C2 follows, so long as one is not considering empty worlds‚Äîif such worlds are even possible. An empty world doesn't have objects that change by having a temporal part with a certain property and another temporal part with a certain other property. Premise P1, the key premise of the argument, can be coherently denied even if the resulting view‚Äîthe abandonment of intrinsic properties‚Äîis counterintuitive. There are, however, ways to support the argument if one accepts relationalism about space-time. ==See also== * Four-dimensionalism * Mereological nihilism * Mereology ==ReferencesSources== * Gallois, A. 1998.

It runs from Whitehall Street near the southern tip of Manhattan to Jackson Street near the Williamsburg Bridge. The Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive, in an elevated portion known as the South Street Viaduct, runs along the entire length of the street. The street is noted for the South Street Seaport, south of the Brooklyn Bridge, and is the former site of the Fulton Fish Market, which was located just to the north of the seaport. Knickerbocker Village, a municipal housing project, fronts on South Street between the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge in the \\"Two Bridges\\" neighborhood. West of the seaport, South Street is the location of a number of office buildings, including 55 Water Street, and the New York City Police Museum. ==History== The East River waterfront of lower Manhattan, which includes South Street (so named because it is on the south side of the island), played an important part in the early history of New York City and became, over a period of two hundred years, one of the most prosperous commercial districts in the city. This development of the South Street Seaport area from a small cluster of wharves in the 18th century to an important part of the leading port of the nation in the mld-19th century reflects the rise of New York City as an international center of commerce. As early as 1625 when the Dutch West India Company established a trading post at the foot of Manhattan Island, the area south of today's seaport served as a landing site for incoming boats. The Dutch constructed a small floating dock which extended into the East River from what is now Broad Street. As lower Manhattan, then New Amsterdam, became more populous, a few streets were cut through the surrounding countryside. One of the first was Queen Street (now Pearl Street), laid out in 1633, which rapidly became the core of the mercantile community of 17th century Manhattan. Queen Street ran along the waterfront until the latter half of the 18th century when landfill extended the eastern boundary of Manhattan out to Water and later to Front Street. South Street was built on landfill in the latter part of the 17th century;, p.96 the city began to grade and pave it in 1798, creating a 75-foot border between houses and merchants' shops, and the wharves, slips and piers that had sprung up along the street; the width was necessary because the ships docked right against the shoreline, with their bowsprits sticking out into the street, giving it its nickname, the \\"streety o' ships\\"., p.80-81 In the early 19th century, South Street was created on additional landfill. South Street became the center of the city's shipping industry and water-based commerce for two hundred years; although by 1810 it was getting competition from West Street on the other side of the island.Burrows et al., p.338-39 In 1835, the Great Fire of New York destroyed 76 of the buildings on the street, but that hardly kept back the expansion of commerce along the shoreline. On one day in 1836, there were 921 vessels on the East River waiting to load or unload onto South Street, while an additional 320 waited on the Hudson. At that time, New York City had 62% of the import business in the entire country.Burrows et al., p.435 The amount of trade kept increasing, and by 1857 Gleason's Pictorial Magazine described both South and West Streets as blocks and blocks of \\"sail- lofts, shipping offices, warehouses of every description, cheap eating-houses, markets, and those indescribable stores, where old cables, junk, anchors, and all sorts of cast-off worldly things, that none but a seaman has a name for, find a refuge.\\"Burrows et al., p.653 By the 1930s, the South Street area was depressed and the hurly-burly of its heyday was gone: > On mild sunny days the drifters sit along the docks with their \\"junk bags\\", > share cigarette butts, and stare endlessly into the water. In winter they > cluster in little groups about small bonfires; many sleep at night in > doorways with newspapers for covering. Other join the homeless men who sleep > in the Municipal Lodging House, Annex No. 2, in the old ferry shed at the > foot of Whitehall Street, which can accommodate about 1,200 nightly. Sometime in the early 1980s, South Street was refurbished from its abandoned status into a tourist attraction to create an atmosphere similar to places like Baltimore's Inner Harbor and Boston's Quincy Market. ==In popular culture== The street has often been used as a location for Hollywood movies, including A Hatful of Rain, which was filmed in 1957 at Knickerbocker Village. South Street was the setting for the 1953 Sam Fuller film Pickup on South Street. ==Nearby points of interest== * Alfred E.

He was born Louis-Marie Bourdages in Jeune- Lorette, Quebec in 1764, the son of Raymond Bourdages, an Acadian doctor and merchant. Bourdages studied at the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, where he met Pierre-Stanislas B√©dard. After he left school, he became a sailor and travelled to Europe and the West Indies. He returned to Quebec City in 1787, where he was unsuccessful in establishing himself as a merchant, and moved to Saint-Denis on the Richelieu River in 1790 where he became a farmer. He later articled as a notary and qualified to practice in 1805. Bourdages also became an important land-owner in the region. In 1804, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Richelieu; he represented this region until 1814. In 1806, he helped found Le Canadien. Bourdages was generally opposed to measures intended to put an end to seigneurial tenure. During the War of 1812, he served in the local militia, reaching the rank of lieutenant- colonel. He was elected in Buckinghamshire in an 1815 by-election and then represented it from 1820 to 1830, when Buckinghamshire was reorganized. He then represented Nicolet in the assembly from 1830 until his death at Saint- Denis in 1835. Bourdages helped prepare the Ninety-Two Resolutions submitted to the British government in 1834. In January 1835, he suffered an attack of apoplexy and died several days later. His son R√©mi-S√©raphin, who represented Rouville in the legislative assembly, died before his father in 1832. ==External links== * * Category:1764 births Category:1835 deaths Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada ","title":"Louis Bourdages"},{"id":"7453309","text":"E234 may refer to: * Nisin European E number * European route E234 ","title":"E234"},{"id":"7453310","text":"The dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi) is a little-known species of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae and is the smallest shark in the world, reaching a maximum known length of . It is known to be present only on the upper continental slopes off Colombia and Venezuela, at a depth of . This species can be identified by its small size at maturity, long flattened head, and pattern of black ventral markings and a mid-dorsal line. Like other members of its genus, it is capable of producing light from a distinctive array of photophores. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females gestating two or three young at a time. The dwarf lanternshark is not significant to commercial fisheries, but could be threatened by mortality from bycatch; the degree of impact from human activities on its population is unknown. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== American ichthyologists Stewart Springer and George H. Burgess described the dwarf lanternshark from specimens collected via trawling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research ship Oregon in 1964. They dubbed the new species in honor of noted shark biologist Perry W. Gilbert, and published their findings in a 1985 Copeia paper. The type specimen is a long female caught in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Colombia. This species is grouped with the velvet belly lantern shark (E. spinax), Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), and combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus) in having irregularly arranged, needle-shaped dermal denticles. ==Distribution and habitat== At present, the dwarf lanternshark has only been reported from a small area of the Caribbean Sea off the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela, occurring between Barranquilla and Santa Marta, near the Guajira Peninsula, and between the Los Testigos Islands and Grenada. This shark apparently inhabits the upper continental slope at a depth of . ==Description== The dwarf lanternshark appears to reach a maximum length of about (female). It has a long, wide, flattened head comprising a fourth to a fifth of its total length. The eyes are large, twice as long as high, with the anterior and posterior corners acute. The nares are large and preceded by poorly developed flaps of skin. There are 25-32 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 30-34 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth of adult males have a single cusp flanked by two pairs of smaller cusplets, while the upper teeth of females are more robust and have only one pair of lateral cusplets flanking the central cusp. The lower teeth each have a single, strongly oblique cusp, and their bases are interlocked to form a continuous cutting surface. Scattered, sparse papillae are inside the mouth and on the edges of the gill arches. The five pairs of gill slits are small. The trunk is short, with two relatively closely spaced, large dorsal fins bearing grooved spines in front. The first dorsal fin originates over the trailing margins of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin has twice the area of the first and is larger than the pectoral or pelvic fins, and originates over the end of the pelvic fin bases. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin is low, with a moderate lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is densely covered by thin, needle- like dermal denticles in a random pattern, except for the lips and the tips of the fins. This shark is dark brown with a striking and distinctive pattern of black markings on its ventral surface, a continuous or broken, fine black line along the middle of its back (but without a white band like in the similar Caribbean lanternshark), a black band on the end of its caudal fin, and a dark blotch on its lower caudal fin lobe. Curiously, some of the ventral black markings are composed of light-producing photophores, while others (including the patch behind the pelvic fins) are composed of pigment-containing chromatophores. The largest known individual is long. ==Biology and ecology== Perhaps the smallest living shark species, male dwarf lanternsharks mature at a length of and females from a length of with long pregnant individuals known. The spined pygmy shark (Squaliolus laticaudus) and the pygmy ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis radcliffei) are known to attain maturity at comparably small sizes; difficulties in assessing the reproductive maturity of sharks precludes stating one of these species as definitively smaller than the others. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing fetuses being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females bear litters of two or three young, each measuring long. ==Human interactions== Because of its very small size, the dwarf lanternshark is of no economic value. Its low fecundity and limited known range may merit concern if commercial fisheries in the region are taking it as bycatch, though there is insufficient information for the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess it beyond Data Deficient. ==References== Category:Etmopterus Category:Fish described in 1985 ","title":"Dwarf lanternshark"},{"id":"7453320","text":"The Manchurian hare (Lepus mandshuricus) is a species of hare found in northeastern China and Russia, the Amur River basin, and the higher mountains of northern North Korea.

Participants can normally access their KiwiSaver funds only after the age of 65, but can also use them as a deposit for a first home. A policy initiative of the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand (in office 1999‚Äì2008), KiwiSaver is governed by various Acts of Parliament, including the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (passed in September 2006). Some people have criticised KiwiSaver for high fees going to Australian banks and for government subsidies going to wealthiest income-earners in New Zealand. Some people have critiqued KiwiSaver as an alleged part of a strategy to reduce New Zealand Universal Superannuation provision and to expand New Zealanders' reliance on private financial institutions to fund retirement income. KiwiSaver assets on the Morningstar database grew to more than NZ$60.9 billion at 30 September 2019. == Basic operation == Anyone aged 64 and under, who is entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely and who normally lives in New Zealand, is entitled to join KiwiSaver. Those under 18 require parental consent to join. Employee participants can choose to contribute 3%,KiwiSaver changes in the 2014 tax year 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross pay, and can switch rates three months after setting a rate (unless employers agree to a shorter time frame). These contributions are deducted from an employee's pay, and sent by the employer to Inland Revenue alongside their PAYE tax returns. The self-employed and unemployed can choose how much they want to contribute; while most KiwiSaver schemes have minimum contribution amounts for people in this category, several schemes allow any level of contributions.Self-employed ‚Äì your guide to KiwiSaver KS12. Inland Revenue Department. Retrieved 31 May 2012.http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/already/contributions/you/ All eligible participants aged 18 to 64 starting a new job, with some exceptions, are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. New employees can choose to opt out from day 14 to day 56 of their employment. KiwiSaver ‚Äì Change or stop contributions Participants choose to put their savings in one of several \\"approved savings schemes\\". They can only belong to one scheme at a time, but can change schemes at any time. If they do not choose a scheme, and the participant is aged 18 or over, they will be assigned either to the employer's default scheme or to a government-selected default scheme. Each scheme offers several managed funds to invest the participants' savings in, with varying degrees of expected risk and return. Employers are required to contribute at least 3% of an employee's gross pay to the employee's KiwiSaver account. The employer contribution is taxed at the employee's marginal tax rate, so the actual amount the employee receives in their account is between 2.01% and 2.685%. From the start of the scheme until May 2015, those who joined KiwiSaver received a $1,000 tax-free \\"kick start\\" to their KiwiSaver account from the government. The Fifth National Government removed it effective 21 May 2015 as part of its 2015 budget. Those aged 18 and over also receive from the government a \\"member tax credit\\" (MTC) of 50 cents per dollar contributed (or part thereof) for the first $1,042.86 contributed per year (1 July to 30 June). The MTC is not a true tax credit; it is a monetary contribution paid by the government via Inland Revenue, mainly to offset the tax paid on interest earned. Those withdrawing KiwiSaver funds to help buy a first home may also get a deposit subsidy of up to $5,000 (existing homes) or $10,000 (new builds) from Housing New Zealand, provided they meet the required income, deposit and house price requirements. A participant can access all their KiwiSaver contributions once they reach the age of entitlement for New Zealand Superannuation (currently 65), as long as they have been a KiwiSaver member for five years. Otherwise, KiwiSaver contributions can only be accessed (with restrictions) in the following circumstances: * a one-off withdrawal after three years to help buy a first home. * serious illness or death * significant financial hardship * permanent emigration from New Zealand to a country other than Australia. == Mortgage diversion == Some provider funds offer a mortgage diversion scheme where some of the employee contributions can be used to make mortgage repayments instead of going towards Kiwisaver, after a person has been signed up for 12 months. This is only allowed for repayments on the main home, and not for other properties such as investment or holiday homes. Employer contributions will not be able to be used for the mortgage. This option was abolished by the National Government that came into power in 2008, though employees who used this option prior to June 2009 can continue to use it as long as their provider offers it. == Savings Suspension == Persons on the scheme can take savings suspension (use to be called contribution holidays) after 12 months for any period from 3 months to 5 years without any limits on future savings suspension. == Children == People aged under 18 may join KiwiSaver if the provider allows their enrolment. If not employed, the child has to agree to a level of contributions with the provider. As soon as the child is employed they must contribute and can never opt out. Children are not entitled to the tax credits.The Dominion Post: local, national & world news from Wellington's daily newspaper . Dominion.co.nz (18 September 2007). Retrieved 19 August 2011. As of 30 June 2013, there were 352,600 KiwiSaver members aged under eighteen. == Funds == Each scheme offers several managed funds to invest the participants' KiwiSaver savings in, and members may invest parts of their savings in different funds. Each managed fund has different risks, returns, investment composition and fees. ===Categories=== Inland Revenue and the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income both divide funds into five broad categories, based on their investment composition: * Cash funds or defensive funds invest less than 10% of savings in growth assets, such as shares and property, and more than 90% of savings in income assets, such as bank deposits and bonds. These funds are low risk but offer low returns. * Conservative funds invest between 10% and 35% of savings in growth assets and between 65% and 90% in income assets. These funds are medium-low risk but offer medium-low returns. If a member doesn't choose a fund, or they are in a default scheme, their savings are automatically put into a conservative fund. * Balanced funds invest between 35% and 63% of savings in growth assets and between 37% and 65% in income assets. These funds offer medium returns with medium risk. * Growth funds invest between 63% and 90% of savings in growth assets and between 10% and 37% in income assets. These funds offer medium-high returns but with medium-high risk. * Aggressive funds invest more than 90% of savings in growth assets and less than 10% in income assets. These funds offer high returns but with high risk. Some providers offer a \\"lifetime\\" fund option, which sees the member's savings move to more defensive funds as the member ages. An example may have members aged under 35 in an aggressive fund, those aged 35 to 49 in a growth fund, those aged 50 to 59 in a balanced fund, those aged 60 to 64 in a conservative fund, and those aged 65 and over in a defensive fund. ===Ethical concerns=== There have been concerns raised that members are not easily able to choose ethical investing due to a lack of information about the makeup of funds. In particular, investments which include profits the production of cluster munitions, landmines, and nuclear weapons have been highlighted as being illegal in New Zealand. There are however now at least five funds aimed specifically at these concerns, describing themselves as variously as \\"socially responsible\\", \\"The ethical KiwiSaver scheme for Christians\\", or expressly excluding \\"companies involved in cluster bombs, landmines, tobacco, gambling and pornography\\". == Withdrawing savings == As the main purpose of the KiwiSaver fund is for retirement savings, money can be withdrawn from the fund at the age at which the person is eligible for government superannuation, currently 65, as long as they have been a KiwiSaver member for five years. However, money can be withdrawn before retirement in a number of circumstances which are outlined in Schedule 1 (KiwiSaver scheme rules), of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. * After three years contributions can be withdrawn to buy the first home. This excludes the government kickstart of $1000, and until 1 April 2015, the tax credits. * In the event of significant financial hardship. This excludes the government $1000 kickstart and tax credits. * In the event of serious illness. * If a person permanently emigrates from New Zealand to a country other than Australia. This excludes the government tax credit. * Divorce or the end of a de facto relationship longer than 3 years (less if there are children). KiwiSaver savings earned during the marriage, civil union or de facto relationship are considered relationship property under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 and can be claimed against by an ex-partner as with any other relationship property. KiwiSaver savings earned prior to the relationship are considered separate property and cannot be claimed against by an ex-partner. * Death. KiwiSaver savings are paid into the deceased person's estate. If a New Zealander permanently emigrates to Australia, they may choose to keep their KiwiSaver savings in New Zealand or transfer them to a complying Australian superannuation fund. Likewise, if an Australian permanently emigrates to New Zealand, they may choose to keep the Australian superannuation savings in Australia or transfer them to a complying KiwiSaver fund. Regardless of where the money is held, Australian superannuation savings can be withdrawn once the person turns 60 and retires from working, or turns 65 regardless of employment status. Australian savings cannot be withdrawn to help buy a first home. == Grant for first home == KiwiSaver contributors meeting certain criteria can apply for a cash grant to purchase their first home or a piece of land. This grant is for individuals earning less than $85,000 per year or two or more individuals earning $130,000 per year in total. This grant is in addition to the withdrawing savings option. == Political issues == The KiwiSaver scheme was one of the promises on Prime Minister Helen Clark's controversial 2005 pledge card as part of the Labour Party's promises for that election. In 2008 John Key, then Leader of the Opposition, stated that a National led government would mean \\"there won't be radical changes...there will be some modest changes to KiwiSaver\\". KiwiSaver therefore has broad political support, being supported by both the National and Labour parties. Additionally, fee subsidy for those people who become members after 1 April 2009, has been removed and for those people who joined before 1 April 2009 only 1 or 2 years fee subsidy will be paid (depending upon the date the member joined). On 16 July 2009, the governments of New Zealand and Australia announced plans to allow funds in KiwiSaver and Australian superannuation to be transferred between the two schemes. This would allow New Zealanders who have worked in Australia to repatriate their superannuation money to New Zealand, and likewise for Australians who have worked in New Zealand to repatriate their KiwiSaver money to Australia. Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings came into force on 1 July 2013; from that date New Zealanders could no longer withdraw their KiwiSaver funds in cash on the basis of permanent emigration to Australia. In 2013 Labour said it would like to make the KiwiSaver scheme universal, in the face of the rising cost of superannuation,Labour backs universal savings scheme. 3 News NZ. 10 October 2013. while financial organisations called for raising the minimum contributions to 7 percent.FSC wants KiwiSaver contributions at 7pc. 3 News NZ. 14 October 2013. As part of the 2015 New Zealand budget, the National led Government repealed the $1,000 \\"kick-start\\" payment. Following the presentation of the budget, Finance Minister Bill English indicated the government was considering \\"mass auto-enrolment\\" of all workers under the age of 65. == Criticisms == KiwiSaver has been critiqued as being a part of a strategy to reduce New Zealand Universal Superannuation provision and expand New Zealanders' reliance on private financial institutions to fund retirement income, and can be seen as part of the wider global strategy of pension privatisation originally promoted by the World Bank and others. Winston Peters has critiqued KiwiSaver as a 'billion dollar rort' by the finance industry and proposed alternatively that private KiwiSaver funds should be invested in a government run \\"KiwiFund\\" which would invest mainly in New Zealand assets and infrastructure. Russel Norman of the Green Party has earlier proposed directing KiwiSaver funds into the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (also known as the \\"Cullen Fund\\") to reduce high fees paid to financial industry. == Enrollment == It was announced on 30 August 2007 that nearly 130,000 New Zealanders had signed up for the scheme. In October 2007, after 3 months of operation, 200,000 people had signed up, leading Revenue Minister Peter Dunne to say that > If take-up continues at this rate it might be easier to make the scheme > compulsory, thereby removing the employer compliance costs associated with > people opting out. However he said that these were his personal views and not those of the government. On 6 December 2007, 5 months after the start of KiwiSaver, it was announced that 316,000 people had signed up. Over half were under 45, nearly 20% were under 25, and 33,000 were under 20. By 31 May 2008 uptake had more than doubled to 673,000, with more than $900 million having been paid into KiwiSaver schemes.\\"KiwiSaver numbers closing in on 700,000 \\".

Gordon (born May 29, 1967) is an American jazz trombonist, arranger, composer, band leader, and music educator at the collegiate-conservatory level. Gordon also sings and plays didgeridoo, trumpet, tuba, and piano.The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, Second edition, Vol. 2, edited by Barry Dean Kernfeld, London: Macmillan Publishers (2002) His nickname is \\"Pinecone\\". == Early life and education == Gordon was born in Waynesboro, Georgia into a religious and musical background that influenced the early direction of his music. His father, Lucius Gordon (1936‚Äì1997), was a church organist at several churches in Burke County, Georgia and a classical pianist and teacher. Gordon took an interest in jazz in 1980 when he was thirteen, while listening to jazz records inherited from his great-aunt. The collection included a five-LP anthology produced by Sony-Columbia. In particular, he was drawn to musicians like Louis Armstrong and the Hot Fives and Hot Sevens At age 13, he was attending Sego Junior High School in Augusta, Georgia, where his band director was trombonist Don Milford. Gordon graduated in 1984 from Butler High School in Augusta. He performed in New York City as part of the McDonald's High School All-American Band. He then studied music at Florida A&M;, where he played in the marching band. ==Career== His early works as a professional were with Wynton Marsalis, but in 2010 he has expanded beyond swing and has experimented with new instruments. The strongest example of this might be The Search where he plays didgeridoo and covers Thelonious Monk songs.All About Jazz He has also played Gospel music. In 1995, Gordon arranged and orchestrated the theme song for NPR's All Things Considered.Theme Music, 30th Anniversary Celebration of All Things Considered, NPR Gordon's arrangement and orchestration is the third version of the melody composed in 1971 by Donald Joseph Voegeli (1920‚Äì2009). He has recently gained more worldwide popularity, being featured in South Australia's Generations In Jazz 2016 and 2017, playing alongside artists such as James Morrison, Jazzmeia Horn, Gordon Goodwin and Ross Irwin among others. For over a decade, he has also worked with visual artist and educator Ligel Lambert on numerous collaborative projects. Ligel Lambert with Wycliffe Gordon (2008 - Present), Ligel & Wycliffe ==Blues Back Records== Blues Back Records was an American independent jazz label founded by Gordon in 2006, coinciding with the release of his album Rhythm on My Mind, a collaboration with bassist Jay Leonhart. His desire for artistic control was the impetus for creating Blues Back. During a meeting with Leonhart, with Gordon's \\"I Want My Blues Back\\" playing in the background, the two laughed and decided on the name for the company. Blues Back produced other artists who met Gordon's criteria for originality. The company became inactive in 2011.Berlanga-Ryan, Esther.

The university is a national 211 Project university, one of the country's 100 key universities in the 21st century that enjoy priority in obtaining national funds. It is also a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, a major government initiative to comprehensively develop a group of elite universities into \\"world-class universities\\" by 2050. It is particularly reputable for its concentration on teachers education and training, foreign language studies, Chinese literature and history. == History  National Normal College === Hunan Normal University was built on the first independent teachers' college in China, named \\"National Normal College,\\" established in 1938. Its historic origin can be traced back to Yuelu Academy in Northern Song Dynasty, one of the four most prestigious academies over the last 1000 years in China. It was integrated into Hunan University in 1949. == Structure and departments == Consisting of five campuses, Hunan Normal University covers a total area of 1.78 km¬≤, with one million square meters of floor space. Most of the campuses are located near the Yuelu Mountain. The university is divided into 23 colleges, 3 teaching departments, 51 research institutions. The university offers 74 undergraduate programs, 147 master programs, and 55 Ph.D. programs. There are 10 postdoctoral scientific research stations, 13 State Training and Research Bases or Centers and 7 key laboratories, jointly constructed by the Ministry of Education and Hunan Province, on the campus. Since its founding, the university has educated nearly 300,000 students, including about 4,000 international students and students from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Currently, over 24,000 undergraduates, 8,000 graduates and 300 international students are studying on campus. There are 1091 professors and associate professors at the university; among them are one academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and one academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The university has invited about 600 scholars and experts to give lectures or conduct scientific research on campus from more than 20 countries since 2,000, and has established relations with over 80 foreign institutions of higher learning for academic exchanges. ==Library== The library of the university has a collection of 3.4 million volumes, including 200,000 volumes of traditional thread binding books, and subscribes 4,700 kinds of Chinese and foreign periodicals. There are 12 academic periodicals published and distributed by the university. The university has its own publishing house called Hunan Normal University Press. ==Partner Institution== Hunan Normal University has partnered with 125 higher education institutions across around 33 countries or regions, including the United States, France, Italy, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia.

Unlike The Meadows, which formerly contained a loch drained by the end of the 18th century, Bruntsfield Links has always been dry ground. It is the last vestige of the Burgh Muir, former woodland which stretched southwards to the Jordan Burn at the foot of the slope now covered by the built-up areas of the Grange and Morningside. The woodland was cleared in accordance with a decree of James IV in 1508, much of the wood being used to build timber-fronted houses and forestairs in the Lawnmarket and West Bow area of the Old Town.J Grant, Old And New Edinburgh, Cassell, 1880, vol.III, p.28 ==Golf on the Links== The Golf Tavern \\"Links\\" is a Scots word for land associated with the game of golf. Originally meaning open sandy ground \\"usually covered with turf, bent grass or gorse, normally near the sea-shore\\",M Robinson (ed.), The Concise Scots Dictionary, Aberdeen University Press, 1985 as at Leith Links or Lundin Links, the word came to mean any ground on which golf was played and is now often used for modern golf courses. A City of Edinburgh Council plaque states that Bruntsfield Links are one of the earliest known locations where the game was played in Scotland, but it is unclear precisely when. The Golf Tavern which stands on the west side of the Links claims to have been established in 1456, although there is no evidence for this other than an unsupported statement made in A history of the Edinburgh Burgess Golfing Society, now known as The Royal Burgess Golfing Society. Golf is still played on the Links in the form of a 36-hole Short Hole Golf Course After James IV's Charter of 1508 allowed the Town Council to feu portions of the Burgh Muir quarriers began extracting sandstone from the Links. By an Act of Council dated 25 December 1695 lessees were granted the liberty of choosing \\"an aiker\\" on any part of the Links for a quarry, \\"the said aiker always being at ane distance from the place where the neighbours play at Goulf\\".W Moir Bryce, The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, p.240 Robert Chambers mentions golf being played on the Links at the time of a well-known local incident which he implies took place in the reign of Charles II, although the internal evidence points more to the later \\"Killing Time\\" of the 1680s. This would make it contemporaneous with the famous game of golf played by the Duke of York and John Patersone on Leith Links in 1682 (see Timeline of golf).R Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, 1824, reprinted Chambers 1980, \\"Another hangman of this period was a reduced gentleman, the last of a respectable family who had possessed an estate in the neighbourhood of Melrose. He had been a profligate in early life; squandered the whole of his patrimony, and at length, for the sake of subsistence, was compelled to accept this wretched office, which, in those days must have been unusually obnoxious to popular odium, on account of the frequent executions of innocent and religious men [i.e. Covenanters]. Notwithstanding his extreme degradation, this unhappy reprobate could not altogether forget his original station and his former tastes and habits. He would occasionally resume the garb of a gentleman, and mingle in the parties of citizens who played at golf in the evenings on Bruntsfield Links. Being at length recognised, he was chased from the ground with shouts of execration and loathing, which affected him so much that he retired to the solitude of the King's Park, and was next day found dead at the bottom of a precipice, over which he was supposed to have thrown himself in despair. The rock was afterwards called the Hangman's Craig.\\" By the middle of the 18th century the area to the west of Bruntsfield House was regarded as the \\"city quarry\\", from which, for example, stones were taken in 1740 to build the city's Charity Workhouse at Bristo. A history of the area relates how, \\"The vacant intervals [between the quarry holes] then became utilised by the citizens in pursuit of the popular game of golf, the quarries with their mounds of debris acting in place of the usual bunkers.\\"W Moir Bryce, The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, p.240 When the Warrender family of Bruntsfield applied to acquire ground between the nearby quarry and their property the Council approved, deciding that \\"the giving of the feu of the same could in no degree be hurtful to the Exercise and Diversion of the Golff\\". In 1752, however, an anonymous pamphlet warned against further encroachments, arguing that \\"the greatest Part of the Sheep Pasture will be cut off, and the Inhabitants deprived of Ew Whey [a by-product of cheese-making from ewe's milk], which is often prescribed and contributes much to their Health, and is easily got, because of the Nearness of the Town; and Tender People will be deprived of these Walks and retired Places which the playing at Golf hath rendered absolutely necessary, and the only places to retire to when the Golfing Green is full of Golfers.\\"W Moir Bryce, The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.30‚Äì31Young golfers at the 19th hole with the Barclay Church adjoining Wright's Houses behind The pursuit of golf was a major factor in preserving the Links as an open space. In 1791, it was proposed to drive a straight road across them (to link present-day Home Street to the crest of the hill at present-day Church Hill), thus bypassing the little village of Wrightshouses (roughly on the site of present-day Leven Street). The proposers argued that the existing road constituted \\"the worst and most inconvenient of all the entries into Edinburgh...which must always be the case while it is carried through so narrow and a dirty a village inhabited by so many low people\\". The proposal was, however, successfully blocked by the Burgess Golfing Society which used the Links and the road re-routed to circumvent them. This resulted in the demolition of houses on the west side of the village, but spared those on the east side where a terrace retains the name (in the grammatically incorrect form) \\"Wright's Houses\\". A request made to the Council by Walter Scott in 1798 (before his fame as a novelist), that the volunteer cavalry regiment of which he was quartermaster should be allowed to train on the Links, based on the traditional right to muster troops there, was rejected. The Council cited the position taken by the golfing societies as the reason.W Moir Bryce, The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.249‚Äì50 The city currently boasts more than twenty-one golf courses, one of which is home to the Royal Burgess Golfing Society founded in 1735 and the Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society founded in 1761. These Societies moved from the Links to Musselburgh in 1874 and 1876 respectively, and then to a newly laid out course at Barnton on the north-western outskirts of the city in 1895 and 1898. ==Recreation== Path by Bruntsfield Links The area is a favourite spot for dog-walkers and becomes an overspill area when crowds gather in the Meadows during warm Summer weather. The west section of the Links next to Whitehouse Loan, where a former school building (the original Boroughmuir School, later James Gillespie's School for Girls) has been converted to a University Hall of Residence, also attracts crowds in good weather. It is frequently used by historical re-enactment societies as a practice ground. A children's playpark and the lawn of the Edinburgh Croquet Club are situated close to the Barclay Viewforth Church. The raised ground in front of Warrender Park Terrace is a good vantage point for viewing Festival and New Year fireworks from the Castle, and during winter snowfalls the north- facing slope here becomes a popular sledging ground for children. A footpath and cycle lane connecting Bruntsfield to Middle Meadow Walk provide all those living in the area with a shortcut and quick route to the University buildings around George Square. There are also many local businesses, including the Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative, which attract visitors. The Golf Tavern pub sits to the west of the links. ==Botanical== An early attempt to remove some of the trees from the Links was blocked in one of the first campaigns of the city's conservation body, the Cockburn Association. Over the years, however, Dutch elm disease has taken a gradual toll of trees in the area, with the most recent outbreak occurring in 2011. Among notable surviving elms (2019) are four old Exeter Elms in the southernmost corner (Bruntsfield Crescent), well- grown Huntingdon Elms at the start of Whitehouse Loan, and a rare Ulmus minor 'Umbraculifera Gracilis' in front of the Links Hotel in Alvanley Terrace.

The village was first recorded in 1156 by its Hungarian name as villa Kesceu. In the 16th century, it became the estate of the B√°thory-family, which is reflected by its name. Until the end of World War I, the village was part of Hungary and fell within the P√°rk√°ny district of Esztergom. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the village became officially part of Czechoslovakia. In November 1938, the First Vienna Award granted the area to Hungary and it was held by Hungary until 1945. After Soviet occupation in 1945, Czechoslovak administration returned and the village became officially part of Czechoslovakia in 1947. == Demography == In 1910, the village had 3144, for the most part, Hungarian inhabitants. At the 2001 Census the recorded population of the village was 3514 while an end-2008 estimate by the Statistical Office had the village's population also as 3475. As of 2001, 83,38 per cent of its population was Hungarian while 15,59 per cent was Slovak. Roman Catholicism is the majority religion of the village, its adherents numbering 66.68% of the total population. ==Facilities== The village has a public library, a gym and a football pitch.

However, in \\"Mon l√©gionnaire\\" the Legion is seen from the outside - through the eyes of a woman who briefly meets one legionnaire and afterwards longs for him, and who has only a vague idea of the Legion's function and the places to which it is posted (\\"In some sunny country...\\"). In the present song, the Legion as such takes center stage. The song tells the story of a small Legion outpost (\\"fortin\\" - \\"little fortress\\"), isolated in the Sahara (\\"The immense Bled\\"). Its garrison of thirty \\"gars\\" (\\"guys\\" or boys) comes under attack by a horde of \\"Salopards\\" (\\"Dirty Ones\\" or \\"Bastards\\") - evidently a derogatory term for Saharan tribespeople which Asso may have picked up while on actual service with the Legion. No background is given for the attack and the reasons of the \\"Salopards\\" in launching it. The isolated Legionnaires defend their outpost most heroically, suffering staggering losses and terrible privations of hunger and thirst. By the time a column of reinforcements is finally profiled on the horizon, only three of them have survived the fierce battle: \\"Hungry, thirsty, half-naked, but covered with Glory.\\" Throughout, \\"Le beau fanion de la l√©gion\\" (\\"The beautiful flag of the Legion\\") continues to fly from the mast (no mention of the French Tricolour). The theme is familiar from other fictional depictions of colonial wars (such as the film Zulu, based on the actual Battle of Rorke's Drift), as well as from Westerns. Though the song is set in the Sahara, Asso was likely influenced by the Battle of Camar√≥n (1867), during the failed French attempt to prop up the regime of the Emperor Maximilian in Mexico - a major founding myth familiar to anyone who served in the Legion. At Camerone, as in Asso's song, there were only three survivors (though there, their lives were spared through their opponents' generosity). Sung to the accompaniment of martial music of drums and trumpets, \\"The Flag of the Legion\\" can be said to glorify war in general and colonial war in particular. Though duly considered a part of the Piaf Canon and continually included in newly printed collections of her songs, it never achieved the popularity of \\"Mon l√©gionnaire\\". Ironically, the Foreign Legion itself did not conspicuously take up the song (as Asso may have hoped). Rather, the Legionnaires adopted as their own a different Edith Piaf song - \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" (I regret nothing) - whose words in themselves have nothing to do with the Legion but came to express their defiance when accused of atrocities and involvement in a failed coup d'etat during the Algerian War (see May 1958 crisis and Algiers putsch). ==See also== * French Foreign Legion in popular culture * Colonial war * Jacques Brel's song Zangra (also inspired by Dino Buzzati's The Tartar Steppe) Category:French-language songs Category:1936 songs Category:French Foreign Legion Category:French colonial empire Category:√âdith Piaf songs Category:Songs with music by Marguerite Monnot Category:French Foreign Legion in popular culture Category:Songs about Africa ","title":"Le Fanion de la L√©gion"},{"id":"7453375","text":"Mandakini () is a tributary of the Alaknanda River. Mandakini originates from the Chorabari Glacier near Kedarnath in Uttarakhand, India. Mandakini is fed by Vasukiganga River at Sonprayag. Mandakini joins Alaknanda at Rudraprayag. Alaknanda then proceeds towards Devaprayag where it joins Bhagirathi River to form the Ganges River. Mandakini river flows along NH-107 in Rudraprayag district and turns violent during monsoon, often destroying parts of the highway and adjoining villages. Meaning of 'Mandakini' The prefix \\"mand\\" (Sanskrit) means \\"calm\\" and \\"unhurried\\", and Mandakini thus signifies \\"she who flows calmly\\". ==White Water== The Mandakini is a runnable low volume river from October to April and can be unpredictable during the Monsoon months (June‚ÄìSeptember) when all rivers in the area become swollen torrents. The Mandakini is a kayakable river with a lot of class 3 rapids and some class 4 and class 5 rapids.

According to the 1835 census the municipality had a population of 7,234. On 22 April 1852 the city of H√∏nefoss was separated from Norderhov to constitute a separate administrative unit. In 1857 the rural district √Ödal was separated from Norderhov, leaving Norderhov with a population of 6,846. In 1938 a part of Norderhov with 268 inhabitants was moved to H√∏nefoss, and on 1 January 1964 the rest was merged with H√∏nefoss, √Ödal, Tyristrand and Hole to form the new municipality Ringerike. Norderhov was by far the largest municipality prior to the merger, with a population of 15,143. ==Parish== The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old farm Norderhov (Old Norse: Njardarhof), since the first church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of the name Njord, the last element is hof, Old Norse for 'temple'. Until 1865 the name was written Norderhoug. The parish of Norderhov (Norderhov prestegjeld) included churches located at Norderhov, Haug, Lunder, Tyristrand, √Ödal, Veme and H√∏nefoss. ==Ringerikes Museum== Ringerikes Museum Ringerikes museum was founded in 1923. It is the regional museum for the municipalities of Hole and Ringerike in Buskerud county. Ringerikes Museum is located at the site of the former rectory of Norderhov Church which it moved into around 1960. Stiftelsen Ringerikes Museum owns and Stiftelsen Hringariki operates the museum. Ringerikes Museum (Distriktsmuseum for Ringeriksregionen) The museum is noted for its collection of icons and runestones, as well as for its memorabilia relating to authors Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe. The Icon Collection at the museum was donated by the artist Hans √òdegaard. The collection contains icons from the Baltics, Greece and Russia, the oldest dating back to the 1400s. Hjemmestyrkemuseet, located on the first floor of Ringerike museum, shows weapons and equipment from the German occupation of Norway. ==Norderhov Church== Norderhov Church Norderhov church (Norderhov kirke) is a medieval church which has been rebuilt and expanded into a cruciform church. It is located in Norderhov just south of H√∏nefoss. The church was originally built as a church of stone approx. 1170. The construction may be related to the establishment of the Diocese of Hamar in 1153. Norderhov Church has a recorded history dating to an announcement for Ringerike issued in 1298 by Duke Hakon Magnusson, who later became King Haakon V. The church is most known for it close connection with Anna Colbj√∏rnsdatter and with the Skirmish at Norderhov. The church was renovated in 1771, 1796 and 1809‚Äì1810. The sacristy was extended to the east and with new, larger windows and a new lower ceiling and a new choir loft in 1881‚Äì1882. Meanwhile, the tower spire was covered with copper plates and the church was refurbished. A new chapel was erected on the north side of the church in 1910‚Äì1912. The church was restored again in 1926 and 1953‚Äì1956. ==Skirmish at Norderhov== Norderhov church was the site of the Skirmish at Norderhov (Slaget p√• Norderhov). Late on the evening of 28 March 1716, an army of King Charles XII of Sweden was confronted by Norwegian forces. The Swedish troops had taken shelter in and by the old Norderhov rectory. Anna Colbj√∏rnsdatter, the spouse of pastor Jonas Danilss√∏nn Ramus, sent an alert to Norwegians forces about the presence of the Swedes. The event itself was published by Peter Andreas Munch in his book Norges, Sveriges og Danmarks Historie til Skolebrug (1838).

Elder & Company at Glasgow for the Merchant Shipping Company of London. She was chartered by the New Zealand Shipping Company in the 1870s and made three voyages to Lyttelton, New Zealand with approximately three hundred emigrants each time. The first voyage in 1874 took 87 days, and the second took 80 days, arriving in Lyttelton on 19 January 1878. In 1881, she was stranded on Ingleby Reef near Port Phillip Heads, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and towed off on 12 March 1881 by a tug. In 1882, the Hereford was purchased by the Nourse Line. In 1883, she made a voyage to Townsville, Australia from Plymouth, England, in 101 days, with 451 passengers, including 1 Fare paying, 113 Assisted and 337 Free. She left Townsville for Calcutta from where she picked up Indian indentured labourers for Guyana and brought sugar back to England. The Hereford made three voyages to Trinidad carrying Indian indentured labourers. On the first voyage, she arrived in on 31 October 1888 carrying 601 passengers. There were 13 deaths during the voyage. She then arrived on 5 February 1890 with 598 passengers (6 deaths) and later on 27 December 1894 with 565 passengers (37 deaths). The Hereford was used for the transportation of Indian indentured labourers to Suriname as well, making four voyages on 17 May 1891, 19 April 1893, 11 November 1895, and 17 December 1896. She was also involved in the repatriation of labourers from St Lucia back to India in 1890. She made three voyages to Fiji, the first on 24 April 1888 carrying 539 Indian indentured labourers, the second on 15 June 1892 carrying 479 labourers, and the third on 28 June 1894 carrying 511 labourers. The Hereford was sold to Norwegian owners in 1898 and on 1 April 1907 was wrecked at Hatteras Island, North Carolina, en route from Pensacola, Florida, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the loss of three of her crew. Survivors were rescued by the steamship Olivebank. == See also == * Indian Indenture Ships to Fiji * Indians in Fiji * Indian indenture system ==References External links == * STRANDING OF THE HEREFORD - TOWING THE SHIP OFF THE INGLESBY REEF. picture Category:History of Guyana Category:Indian indenture ships to Fiji Category:Victorian-era passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1869 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1881 Category:Maritime incidents in 1907 Category:Shipwrecks of the Carolina coast ","title":"Hereford (ship)"},{"id":"7453417","text":"E264 can refer to: * European route E264, a European route * Ammonium acetate, a chemical compound ","title":"E264"},{"id":"7453419","text":"Club Deportivo Laferrere is a football club from the homonymous district of La Matanza Partido, Greater Buenos Aires.

Mam Sodhail, sometimes known by its anglicised name of \\"Mam Soul\\", is a Scottish Munro situated in the secluded country on the northern side of Glen Affric, some 30 kilometres east of Kyle of Lochalsh. == Overview == At 1181 metres (3875 feet), it is the second highest mountain north of the Great Glen (after neighbouring C√†rn Eige) and the fourteenth highest in the United Kingdom. C√†rn Eige stands just one kilometre to the north of Mam Sodhail and the two are regarded as twin mountains, being roughly identical in height and appearance. They stand together above Gleann nam Fiadh (Glen of the Deer) and are linked by a high col of around 1045 metres, making the traverse of the two mountains a natural day's walk. Mam Sodhail's name translates from the Gaelic as ‚ÄúHill of the Barns‚Äù although other sources give it as ‚ÄúBreast (-shaped hill) of the Barns‚Äù. == Geography and Summit == Mam Sodhail is mostly grassy without too much rock, however its sheer size, long ridges and fine corries together with its four \\"tops\\" named in the Munro Tables make it a first-rate mountain. The hill casts three ridges down towards Glen Affric, the most impressive of these being the east southeast ridge, which has two \\"tops\\" on it; Mullach Cadha Rainich (996 metres) stands at the midpoint of the ridge which runs for four kilometres to conclude at the other ‚Äútop‚Äù of Sgurr na Lapaich (1036 metres), which is the most prominent part of the mountain when viewed from Glen Affric. It has the characteristics of a separate mountain and was regarded as a Munro in the original 1891 list, with Irvine Butterfield saying, \\"The peak certainly does not lack character and many were disappointed to find that its original status was not restored in the seventh edition of Munros Tables\\".\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland\\" Pages 199 (Gives this quote). The other two ridges, which form a horseshoe around the Allt Coulavie valley to the south of the summit, carry the ‚Äútops‚Äù of An Tudair (1074 metres) and Creag Coire nan Each (1055 metres).Database of British and Irish Hills retrieved 18 Dec 2011.The Munros and Tops 1891-1997 Variorum of Munros Tables giving changes at each revision. The mountain's western flanks fall away towards Gleann a‚Äô Choilich, which drains northwards into Loch Mullardoch. Mam Sodhail was an important part of the Ordnance Survey‚Äôs initial mapping of the northern Highlands in the 1840s, and the summit carries a massive cairn which was used by the surveyors in their work. The cairn is hollow and its walls have to be climbed to get inside.\\"The Munros and Tops\\" Page 158 (Gives info on hollow summit cairn). Unusually, there is a visitors' book inside the cairn.The Angry Corrie. Mentions the summit visitors book. A few feet below the summit is the remains of a small bothy, complete with walls, fireplace and a chimney, which was formerly used by deerstalkers and watchers to keep sheep and walkers off the mountain. The bothy was mentioned by Sir Hugh Munro in volume one of the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal along with tips to circumvent it and its inhabitants.\\"Hamish's Mountain Walk\\" Pages 257 (Gives info on summit bothy). There is evidence of some quarrying south-west of the main summit on the ridge to Creag Coire nan Each. There are a number of pits about three metres deep and several metres across, and it is probable that this was the source of the stone for the summit cairn and the bothy.\\"The Munros and Tops\\" Page 158 (Gives info on small quarry). == Ascents == The ascent of Mam Sodhail starts at the car park at the road end in Glen Affric at grid reference . The walker can either ascend by a stalker's path up Coire Leachavie, or by climbing Sgurr na Lapaich first and then following the long ESE ridge to the top of the mountain. The view from the top takes in the impressive sights of Sgurr nan Ceathreamhnan and C√†rn Eige close by and the distant view is crowded by the mountains of the north-west Highlands. Most walkers will take in the nearby Carn Eige as part of the walk and strong walkers may take the opportunity to climb the remote Munro of Beinn Fhionnlaidh, which lies three kilometres to the north and is difficult to access from any other place. ==See also== *Breast-shaped hill == References and Footnotes == * The Munros (SMC Guide), Donald Bennett et al., * 100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains, Ralph Storer, * Hamish‚Äôs Mountain Walk, Hamish Brown, * The Munros and Tops, Chris Townsend, * The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland, Irvine Butterfield, Footnotes Category:Munros Category:Mountains and hills of the Northwest Highlands Category:One-thousanders of the British Isles ","title":"Mam Sodhail"},{"id":"7453439","text":"Jana Yuddha () was an organ of the Bengal Committee of the Communist Party of India.

A list of masters of the Grammar School at Dalkeith (located on the High Street) commences at 1582. No other reference is made to the age of the school. An extract from the National Gazetteer, 1868 says: \\"The parish school, otherwise known as the grammar school, has long borne a high character among Scottish seminaries; beside the usual branches of a classical education, French, German, Italian, and mathematics are taught.\\" Alexander Bower suggests in his History of the University of EdinburghVolume 3, p298, The History of the University of Edinburgh: Chiefly Compiled from Original Papers and Records, Never Before Published, Volume 3, 1830 that \\"for upwards of a century, [it] maintained a distinguished reputation, as being one of the best seminaries in Scotland for acquiring a knowledge of classical learning\\". Archibald Pitcairne (1652‚Äì1713), the physician, studied at Dalkeith Grammar School Alexander Campbell, A Journey from Edinburgh Through Parts of North Britain: Containing Remarks on Scotish Landscape; and Observations on Rural Economy, Natural History, Manufactures, Trade, and Commerce, 1802, p 5. as did Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn (1733‚Äì1805) who went on to become Lord Chancellor, and Rev. William Robertson (1721‚Äì93), historian and later Principal of the University of Edinburgh. The naval tactician John Clerk of Eldin (1728‚Äì1812) was also a pupil. In 1914 the Grammar School moved from the High Street to a location at King's Park School. The Newmills Road site (designed by William Scott (1870‚Äì1951)) was first used in 1940 and in 1960 the large extension to the rear was opened to a design by Reid & Forbes. The school buildings were closed in September 2003. The buildings were category B listed. Attempts to utilise them for other purposes were unsuccessful, in part because the newer building was severely contaminated with asbestos. In July 2009, Midlothian Council proposed demolition. Developing the location close to the centre of Dalkeith was felt could \\"assist greatly in promoting much needed economic development\\".Midlothian Council Planning Committee, Tuesday 12 January 2010, Item No 7. In November 2003, Dalkeith High was integrated into the Dalkeith Schools Community Campus along with St. David's Roman Catholic High School and Saltersgate School, a special education facility, making it the first such joint secondary school campus in Scotland. After the move, teachers kept students separated from each other in the dining hall and on the playground, citing concern that younger pupils might become disoriented by the sudden transformation of their small school into a large, integrated organisation with 2,200 youths. They initially predicted that the regime of segregation could be relaxed within a few weeks, and that religious factors played no role in their decision; by January 2004, teachers at Dalkeith and St. David's still told their pupils not to talk to pupils from the other school, and students were kept segregated due to threats of violence directed at one another and teachers of different religious backgrounds in addition to assaults. The school's old building was demolished in January 2012. Midlothian Council spent ¬£3,000 on lighting and ¬£10,000 on security between 2004 and 2007, leading to criticism from local Conservative and Green Party politicians. Prior to the decision to demolish, the council had believed it was near an agreement to sell the property (2007) to Taylor Wimpey to convert the building to 63 flats, together with 110 new flats on the site. Taylor Wimpey withdrew their planning application in February 2008 and their intention to purchase in March 2008 citing asbestos contamination as the determining factor. Dalkeith High has produced a number of significant figures, including the meteorologist James Stagg (1900-1975), the distinguished Marxist geographer and critic, Neil Smith (1954‚Äì2012), the missionary Andrew Ross (1931‚Äì2008) and the musician Fish. ==ReferencesExternal links== *District site *Dalkeith High School's page on Scottish Schools Online Category:Secondary schools in Midlothian Category:School buildings completed in 2003 Category:Dalkeith Category:1580s establishments in Scotland Category:Educational institutions established in the 1580s ","title":"Dalkeith High School"},{"id":"7453456","text":"Lasswade High School is a non-denominational secondary state school in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, Scotland. ==History== In 1956, Lasswade Senior Secondary School (the earliest predecessor for which was established in the village of Lasswade in the 1610s)Lasswade Centre (Lasswade High School), Gazetteer for Scotland. transferred to a new building on the present site, with improvements and extensions opened in 1978 to provide new accommodation for Business Studies, Home Economics, Music, Art & Design, Science, Craft, Design & Technology, Library, Computer Room, Kitchen, Dining Room and Sports Centre. Lasswade was further developed as a community school since 1979.

This included state of the art fully equipped Mathematics classrooms, Guidance classrooms, offices and meeting rooms and a Learning Support base with tutorial rooms. In 2009 it was announced that a new Lasswade High School Community Campus was to be built, with construction beginning in October 2011. The school re-opened in 2013 as the Lasswade Centre, with ceremonial duties performed by the then First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond. The new building cost ¬£38 million to complete, and contains 90 classrooms to accommodate around 1,500 pupils. The facility also has a purpose-built Sports Centre, which comprises a games hall, squash courts, fitness training rooms, activity movement studio, cafeteria, creche and spacious playing fields. ==Schools Curriculum Award 2000== Lasswade High School received the prestigious award at a ceremony in London in recognition of the school's involvement with the local community. The award was open to all schools - nursery, primary and secondary - in the United Kingdom. Assessment of the school was made in two stages - an initial written submission followed by a visit by two external assessors - to ensure that the school met the challenging criteria set by the Trustees. The award is sponsored by the government departments and private industry. ==Fittest School in Britain 2009== The school took the top prize in the Fitter Schools Challenge,https://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/10/15115621 in which 3,000 UK schools put their sporting prowess to the test. The school was presented with a trophy and ¬£10,000 worth of sports equipment by Olympian Roger Black. The challenge was open to first and second year pupils at every school in the UK. Each school had to complete in three challenges which tested their skills and stamina. Pupils were asked to complete a shuttle run, which tested their ability to accelerate and change direction. They were also challenged to see how many star jumps they could do in a minute. ==Links with China and South Africa== In recent years, the school has developed educational links with Tianlin No 3 Middle School in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. The collaboration is part of a wider initiative to develop a closer relationship between Scotland and China, and will include teacher and pupil exchanges as well as using e-mail and the internet to develop joint projects. ==Eco-Schools== Following a visit by an Eco-Schools inspection team in 2008, Lasswade High was awarded the Green Flag environmental award.http://www.midlothianadvertiser.co.uk/news/Lasswade-High-School-flies- flag.4974501.jp ==Queen's Baton Relay 2014== For the run-up to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, the Queen's baton passed through the school building circling the school floors before eventually moving on. ==Notable former pupils== *James Edward Tierney Aitchison (1835‚Äì1898), surgeon and botanist *A.J.

It has been publishing articles dedicated to the theatre and the play writing and it has been working in the field of anthropology of theatre. The magazine was founded in 1956 by Adam Tarn, a translator, playwright and journalist. The following editors of the magazine were, among others, Konstanty Puzyna and Jerzy Koenig. For over ten years, the magazine has been headed by Jacek Sieradzki. Dialog's task is to publish the newest Polish plays. Each issue of the magazine contains one or two domestic contemporary plays, which were previously neither published nor staged. From here they reach the stages of Polish theatres. The magazine is therefore an important forum for playwright debuts; several generations of Polish playwrights begun their careers from a publication in Dialog. At the same time, the most important mission of the magazine is to provide quick and competent information to the Polish reader, concerning the current theatrical life outside Poland, and for many years Dialog was the only opening to the Western world for Polish directors, translators, literary directors, the community interested in theatre and theatrical literature. Other than Polish plays, each issue contained translations of the most important international plays and theoretical texts dedicated to the creation of the most outstanding western authors.

Athens National Theatre ==History== The Central Theatre on Agiou Konstantinou Street. The theatre was decided to be founded in 1880, with a grant from King George I and Efstratios Rallis to give theatre a permanent home in Athens. The foundations for this new project were laid on Agiou Konstantinou Street and the building itself was designed by the famous Saxonian architect noted for many other public buildings in Athens at the time, Ernst Ziller. Despite problems getting the building done in time, it was eventually completed in the late 1890s and in 1900 it was opened as Royal Theatre. Angelos Vlachos was appointed as the Director. The National Theater began to expand its operations and in 1901 a drama school was opened. The same year, the Royal Theatre opened its doors to the public with a monologue from Dimitris Verardakis' play Maria Dozapatri and two Greek one-act comedies: Dimitris Koromilas' The Death of Pericles and Charalambos Anninos' Servant Required. Following the first performance the theatre began to expand in popularity among Greece's upper and upper middle classes and staged more productions. One of the most famous of the period was Aeschylus' Oresteia, staged in a prose translation by Yorgos Sotiriadis. The production sparked a long linguistic conflict, between the adherents of katharevousa and the modern Demotic Greek. Students from the University of Athens' School of Philosophy, incited by their classicist professor, Yorgos Mistriotis, marched down Agiou Konstantinou in an attempt to halt the performance. The episodes that followed, known as the Oresteiaka, resulted in one death and ten injuries on November 8, 1903. In 1913, upon the assassination of King George, the Royal Theater was bequeathed to his son, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, who was a painter and playwright. The theatre entered into a period of decline, occasionally playing host to foreign theatre companies, until 1932. It remained closed until was re-founded, as National Theatre, under an act of parliament signed by the education minister, Georgios Papandreou, on May 30, 1932. The first plays staged were the Aeschylus' Agamemnon and Gregorios Xenopoulos' comedy O theios Oneiros. The first actor team includes Katina Paxinou, Aimilios Veakis, Eleni Papadaki and Alexis Minotis. First theatrical director was placed Fotos Politis and from 1934 Dimitris Rontiris. In 1939, the Greek National Opera () was founded as part of the National Theatre. In 1955, the NT contributed in the foundation of the Epidaurus Festival (as part of the Athens Festival), devoted to the ancient drama. Notable (general) directors of the NT, through its history, include Ioannis Gryparis, Kostis Bastias, Angelos Terzakis, Y√≥rgos Theotok√°s, Dimitris Rontiris, Elias Venezis, Alexis Minotis and Nikos Kourkoulos. ==Scenes== The National Theatre includes the Central Scene (performs classical repertoire), the New Scene and the Peiramatiki Scene (Experimental). From 1991 there is also the Kotopouli Scene and from 1995 the Paxinou Scene. ==BuildingsThe Central Theatre=== Detail of decoration on Agiou Konstantinou Street, building. The first home of the National Theatre was commissioned by King George I and designed by the architect Ernst Ziller. It was built between 1895 and 1901. The \\"Royal Theatre\\" occupied the historic neo-classical building on Agiou Konstantinou Street from 1901 to 1908, but went bankrupt and was forced to close. The building was renovated in 1930 and 1931 under the supervision of the set designer Kleovoulos Klonis. Since 1932 the building has been the home of the National's Central Theatre. In 2009, the complete renovation of the building was completed. ===Children's Theatre=== The theatre is situated in the basement of the Sikiarideio Hall. It was designed to operate as a music hall, but soon became a cinema. Its ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Culture in 1987, and since 1993 the National Theatre has staged children's productions there. ==Drama School== The National Theatre of Greece Drama School (GNT Drama School) was founded in 1930, since when it has operated in tandem with the National Theatre of Greece. ==External links== * *Vasilis Fotopoulos, 100 years National Theatre, Latsis Group 2001 (e-book) Category:1900 establishments in Greece Category:1903 riots Category:1903 in Greece Category:Tourist attractions in Greece Category:Theatres in Athens Category:Greek culture Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Greece ","title":"National Theatre of Greece"},{"id":"7453509","text":"The National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China (NEAC) is a cabinet-level department under the State Council of the People's Republic of China and responsible for relations between the Central Government and ethnic minorities in China.

The militia originally consisted of farmers and the middle-class people creating their own defense against revolutionary socialists. Squadrismo became an important asset for the rise of the National Fascist Party led by Benito Mussolini, using violence to systematically eliminate any political parties which were opposed to Italian Fascism. This violence was not solely an instrument in politics, but was also a vital component of squadrismo identity, which made it difficult for the movement to be tamed. This was shown in the various attempts by Mussolini to control squadrismo violence, with the Pact of Pacification, and finally with the Consolidated Public Safety Act. Squadrismo, which ultimately became the Blackshirts, served as a source of inspiration for Adolf Hitler‚Äôs S.A. ==Origins== After World War I, there was a general feeling of disillusionment. Diffused poverty, economic fractures, and a social and moral political upheaval generated by the mobilisation of the war, contributed to the unstable climate proceeding the armistice.

Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 100 Mussolini had planned to assimilate the mostly self-organizing Squadrismo into his movement, but the violence against socialists was compromising his strategy of not wanting to ‚Äúlose his position on the left‚Äù that included the establishment of a ‚ÄúFascist Labor Party‚Äù or ‚ÄúNational Labor Party. Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 99 A number of squadristi leaders voiced opposition to Mussolini‚Äôs leadership and plastered posters in the city of Bologna, denouncing ‚ÄúMussolini as a traitor to Fascism,‚ÄùDahlia S.

Elazar, The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-Revolution, Italy 1919‚Äì1922, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001, p. 142 There were secret anti-Mussolini meetings that fixated on ‚ÄúMussolini‚Äôs lingering leftist loyalties,‚Äù Stanley G.

Kedward, Fascism in Western Europe 1900‚Äì45, p 40 New York University Press New York, 1971, p. 40 Mussolini went on the offensive and disparaged the squadrismo, declaring that provincial Fascism was ‚Äúno longer liberation, but tyranny; no longer protector of the nation, but defense of private interests and of the dullest, deafest, most miserable caste that exists in Italy.‚Äù Dahlia S.

First published in 1959 == Conceding to the squadrismo== Mussolini was unable to gain significant control over the squadrismo in order to preserve his old alliance of national syndicalists, revolutionaries and Futurists. At the Third Fascist Congress in Rome on Nov. 7‚Äì10, 1921, Mussolini was pressured to concede to the majority delegation of squadristi leaders and members, abandoning his plans for a ‚ÄúFascist Labor Party‚Äù and forced to accept the party as an ‚Äúassociation of the fasci and their storm squads.‚ÄùCharles F. Delzell, edit., Mediterranean Fascism 1919‚Äì1945, New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26 In return for his concessions, Mussolini was recognized as the undisputed leader of the newly renamed National Fascist Party. The action squads were to become identified by their black shirts, a motif which ultimately coined the name Blackshirts and became the inspiration for Adolf Hitler's S.A. in the Third Reich. Mussolini and his followers selected the iconic black shirts of the laborers in the Italian cities of Romagna and Emilia, who had originally ‚Äúadopted their uniforms from the anarchists.‚Äù Christopher Hibbert, Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce, New York: NY, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2008, p. 29.

SECDET was based on an Australian Army combined arms combat team consisting of an infantry company group and a troop of cavalry which operated the Australian Light Armoured (ASLAV) vehicles. The force's duties included static security guarding at the Australian Embassy in Baghdad and the protection of Australian diplomats by the 1st Military Police Bn- Close Personal Protection Team and vehicle convoys. SECDET was withdrawn in August 2011, with the firm Unity Resources Group becoming responsible for providing security for Australia's diplomatic presence in Iraq. ==Incidents== SECDET III engaged and destroyed an insurgent mortar team that had been firing on the Coalition Headquarters in the Green Zone. This was the first time an Australian ASLAV had used its 25mm Main Gun in combat. SECDET IV had a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) detonate across the street from their HQ during their tour. SECDET IV was also involved in a serious accident when an ASLAV rolled at high speed. SECDET V was involved in a VBIED attack on 25 October 2004, just short of an International Zone checkpoint, with the patrol suffering four wounded in action and serious damage to an ASLAV-25. As a direct result of the incident, Trooper Matthew Millhouse died of his injuries in 2015. He is listed on the Australian War Memorial Honour Roll as a casualty of the Iraq War. SECDET V was also involved in two incidents in the northern city of Tall Afar on 8 and 10 December 2004, when 3 Troop, A Squadron of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was ambushed by insurgents using small arms and rocket propelled grenades. The first incident involved the troop providing an armoured convoy escort to a US engineer unit travelling to Al Kasik. The convoy was ambushed in Tal Afar with the majority of the Australian callsigns returning fire from 25mm and .50cal. The second incident occurred a couple of days later in roughly the same location. The patrol was ambushed with insurgents using IED‚Äôs, small arms and rocket propelled grenades. The troop again returned fire en masse. During these firefights, the insurgents suffered unknown injuries and casualties, however no damage was inflicted on the Australian patrol.

An adult northern pika has a body length of , and a tail of . The pika sheds its fur twice annually, bearing a reddish-brown coat in the summer and grayish-brown coat in winter. It feeds on various plant material and makes \\"hay piles\\" for winter use. ==Taxonomy== There are several subspecies of this pika: *Ochotona hyperborea cinereoflava *Ochotona hyperborea coreana *Ochotona hyperborea ferruginea *Ochotona hyperborea mantchurica *Ochotona hyperborea normalis *Ochotona hyperborea uralesis *Ochotona hyperborea yesoensis *Ochotona hyperborea yoshikurai ==Description== The northern pika is a small species and grows to a length of between with a tail of . It has small rounded ears and short legs with five toes on each foot and furry soles. The fine long hair is reddish-brown in summer but much greyer in winter. The underparts are white tinged with reddish-brown and the sexes look alike. It is variable in size and colouring across its extensive range. ==Distribution and habitat== The northern pika lives in mountainous regions of eastern Asia. Its range extends from the Urals and the Putorana Plateau, through eastern and southern Siberia, including Sakhalin Island, to northern Mongolia, Manchuria, North Korea and Hokkaido. It is found on scree and on rocky slopes in mountainous areas, in boulder fields, in damp areas among coniferous trees and in dry Alpine meadows. In large areas of rock it is mostly found near the edge and makes shallow burrows in the turf nearby. It occurs at altitudes between . In general it is restricted to higher altitudes than the Alpine pika. ==Behaviour== Northern pikas are most active and mostly feed soon after dawn and as dusk approaches. They have a network of burrows and also use crevices in the rocks and subterranean runways. Each underground network of passages has numerous entrances and pathways join these with feeding areas on the surface. During their time above ground, their time is spent moving about, feeding, grooming or sitting in a stationary position, usually on some eminence. They mostly move around using short jumps but can also walk and run, and can combine these means of locomotion while agilely climbing over rocks or scaling cliffs. They can stand briefly on their hind legs while sparring or gathering food and can climb in an ungainly fashion in seedling conifers such as the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The northern pika is herbivorous and eats a variety of plant material such as grasses, twigs, needles, stems and leaves. The food is gathered and then mostly carried back, using the mouth alone, to one of a number of eating points near an entrances to the burrow. When feeding on stems and twigs, a sitting posture is adopted and gnawing starts low down and works upwards. If alarmed while feeding, the pika may dash to its hole, sometimes carrying the food item in its mouth, or remain stationary and alert till the danger passes. It also collects green parts of plants, allows them to dry, and stores them in caches. It has been found that the plants chosen are not those that are the most abundant but are selected species with high nutritive value. Evergreen tuft-forming plants are avoided. These \\"hay piles\\" are located in dry locations for consumption during the winter. Northern pikas do not hibernate and can tunnel under the snow to reach their caches and visit areas where there are twigs and other plant material still available. Some time is spent grooming the fur of the head and face with the forepaws and scratching the head and front part of the body with the hind feet. Apart from settling the fur and removing external parasites, these activities may serve to spread the secretions of the apocrine glands onto the paws for territory marking. Much time is spent loitering in specially selected spots, usually on a prominent rock or tree stump within a few metres (yards) of a hole, for up to ten minutes at a time. On some of these occasions, the pika seems to be sunbathing in a relaxed stance, the animal often turning its head towards the sun, but at other times the animal seems alert and on the look out. The approach of a predator or an observer too closely for comfort causes the animal to scurry away into its hole with a sharp warning cry \\"Kitz\\". At certain times, an animal may call from an eminence to other pikas in the area and other individuals may respond. Other shrill calls may be made when sitting or moving around but their significance is unclear. ==Breeding== Both male and female northern pikas defend territories. They mark the boundaries by either rubbing a gland on their cheek on a projecting rock or by scent marking with urine. A territory is usually occupied by a pair of pikas but males sometimes stray into other territories. The population is usually stable with one litter of up to nine (usually three or four) offspring being produced each year, though two smaller litters may be produced in the more southerly part of the range. The gestation period is about 28 days and juveniles share their parents' territory for a while before dispersing.

The name has been retained today in the partly anglicised form Boroughmuir for a much smaller district within Bruntsfield, vaguely defined by the presence of Boroughmuir High School, and, until 2010, Boroughmuirhead post office in its north-west corner. In terms of today's street names, the historic muir (Scots for 'moor') extended from Leven Street, Bruntsfield Place and Morningside Road in the west to Dalkeith Road in the east, and as far south as the Jordan Burn and east to Peffermill, thus covering an area of approximately five square miles. The names of the historic roads that bounded it were the \\"Easter Hiegait\\", corresponding to Dalkeith Road, and the \\"Wester Hiegait\\" corresponding to Bruntsfield Place and Morningside Road.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol. X, Edinburgh 1918, contains a court statement made by the Edinburgh magistrates in 1593 which defines its limits in detail: \\"Begynnand at the west neuke [corner] of the dyke [wall] upoun the south syde of Sanct leonards loneing [lane] qr [where] the grund of the croce stands, and thairfra passand south and south eist as the said dyke gangis be the heids of the airabill landis of Sanctleonards and Preistisfield respectively until it cum to the end of the dyke foresaid, and to the gait that passes to the Priestisfield, Peppermylne, and Nidrie, and fra the south wast syde of the said gait, as ane oyr dyke passes south and south wast, be the sydes of the airable lands of Camroun qll it cum to the south wast neuk of the said dyke, and thairfra doun as the said dyke passes south south eist to the end of the Grene end of the said Commoun Mure by and contigue to the passage and hie street [Dalkeith Road] fra the said burgh of Edr. to the brig end betuix the lone dyke of the said lands of Camroun, and thairfra ascendand the waster lone dyke be the edge of the said commoun mure, and as the said wester lone dyke gannis to the end thairof, quhair it meets at the croce dyke by and upoun the eist syde of the aikers of the said commoun mure pertening to [blank text] and sa linalie be the said dyke qll it cum to the Powburne, and sua up the said Pow burne qll it cum to the loneing that passes to the lands of Newlands pertening to the laird of Braid [bordering the south of the Grange], and thairfra wastwart as the dyke gangis to the south neuk of the dyke situat upone the eister pt of the lands of Tipperlinn, and sua northwart as the said dyke gangis by the yet [gate] of Tipperlinn, and thairfra northwart to the dykes of the corne land heids thairof, passand north as the said dyke gangis to the hie gait that passes by Merchamstoun to the Craighous, and eist be the said gait till it cum to the west dyke of the croft callit the Dow croft [present Albert Terrace], and thairfra sout. to the sout. end of the said dyke and sua nort. eist be the said dyke to the nort. eist neuk thairof, and thairfra nort. wert as the dyke gangis to the nort. west nuk of the same upoun the south syde of the passage that leids fra Edr. by the yett of Merchamstoun, and than begynnand upoun the nort. syde of the said hie passage directlie foiranent [in front of] the nuk of the said dyke be the new yaird dyk laitlie biggit [built] be the laird of Merchamstoun upoun ane pece of the said commoun mure laitlie disponit [transferred in ownership] be the provost baillies and counsall of the said burt.

No record of David I's gift of the burgh muir has survived, many of the burgh records having been lost during the Wars of Independence and when the Earl of Hertford sacked the city in 1544. It is possible that it was given at the same time as the founding of Holyrood Abbey in the 12th century, the abbey charter (c.1143) containing the first mention of Edinburgh as a royal burgh.D Daiches, Edinburgh, London 1978, p.15W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, \\"de meo Burgo de Edwinesburg\\" Three areas of the muir were exempted from the city's jurisdiction, due to having been previously granted under separate Royal Charters: the Grange (church-held farmland) of St. Giles (\\"Sanct Gilysis Grange\\"), and the Provostry lands of Whitehouse and Sergeantry lands of Bruntsfield, both held from the Crown by royal officials. The Grange lands were forfeited in the reign of David II and awarded to Sir Walter de Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow, passing to his kin, the Wardlaws, until 1506, and then to the merchant, John Cant, whose family owned them until 1632. Cant donated 18 acres of his land to help establish the Dominican nunnery of St. Catherine of Siena in 1517, intended to provide for widows of some of the nobility slain at Flodden in 1513. This was the last convent established in pre-Reformation Scotland, from which the surrounding area of Sciennes took its name. A small Chapel of St. John the Baptist built c.1512-13 by Sir John Craufurd, a prebendary of the Grange of St. Giles, as a hermitage for vagabonds, was given to the Sisters by him for use as their conventual chapel. It is believed to have stood on the site later occupied by Sciennes Hill House.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.96-102 In 1632, the lands held by the Cants passed to another merchant family, the Dicks (later Dick Lauder), who inhabited Grange House until the 19th century. Increasingly empty and neglected after 1848, the house was demolished in 1936.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918 Bruntsfield House in 2010 The Bruntsfield lands, held originally by the King's Sergeant, Richard Broune (hence Brounisfield, later Bruntsfield), were granted by Robert II to Alan de Lawdre in 1381. The Lauder family sold them to the merchant John Fairlie in 1603, whose family sold them in turn to Sir George Warrender, a Bailie and later Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in 1695. His descendants signed the estate over to Edinburgh Corporation (Council) in the 1930s. The second Bruntsfield House on the site, dating from the time of the Lauders in the 16th century, still stands. The Whitehouse lands have had a more complex history. Records show that prior to 1449 they were held by a family of the surname Hog before coming into the hands of Lord Chancellor William Crichton in the reign of James II (c.1449). They passed through numerous hands down the centuries, including Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell (1581) and Walter Scott of Buccleuch (1594), until they were increasingly subfeued in the 19th century, the feudal superiors being, from 1890 onwards, two brothers named Reid. One feuar was the Order of Ursulines which established St. Margaret's Convent (now the Gillis Centre) in 1834, the first Catholic institution established in Scotland since the Reformation. When the Earl of Hertford attacked Edinburgh in 1544 as part of what was later called the 'Rough Wooing' the original Bruntsfield House was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that a similar fate befell the Grange and Whitehouse, as one of Hertford's men wrote, \\"And the nexte mornyge, very erly we began where we lefte, and continued burnyge all that daye and the two dayes nexte ensuing contynually so that neyther within the wawles nor in the suburbes was lefte any one house unbrent...\\"British Library Cotton Ms. Augustus I ii 56 It is unclear whether the convent at Sciennes suffered. ==James IV's charter of 1508== James IV (r.1488‚Äì1513) The land outwith the exempted portions began to be feued in the early 16th century. The Burgh Records record that in 1490 \\"...all the haill counsale, deikynis [leaders of craft trades], and community consentit to the assedatioun [feuing] of the space of the burrowmuir\\", but it was not until 1508 that a Royal Charter issued by James IV gave the Council licence to feu, stipulating that \\"the foresaid lands shall be leased in feu-farm as aforesaid, and their heirs and all dwellers on the same lands be subject to the jurisdiction of our foresaid Burgh, the Provost, Baillies and Officers thereof, present and to come, and that they repair every week with their victuals and other goods to the market of our said Burgh...\\"W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, p.67 A Council enactment of 30 April 1510 obliged the feuars \\"to build upon the said acres dwelling-houses, malt-barns, and cowbills, and to have servants for the making of malt betwixt [that date?] and Michaelmas 1512; and failing their doing so, to pay ¬£40 to the common works of the town, and also to pay ¬£5 for every acre of three acres of the Common Muir set to them\\".W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, p.67 This extract from the printed Burgh Records, vol.i, p.129 is rendered in modern English, but the original document cannot have used the ¬£-sign for sterling; and is therefore more likely to refer to pounds Scots. The Scottish lawyer and antiquarian William Moir Bryce (whose exhaustive researches inform much of this article), writing in an age influenced by the Temperance Movement, thought this a \\"strange obligation\\", but it made sense at a time before piped urban water supplies, when beer was the common drink in preference to water drawn from lochs and wells which often proved injurious to health. ==Clearing the land== One of the houses clad with timber boards, which existed at the time of Brereton's visit. The feuing of the Muir led to the rapid clearing of the remaining woodland on the muir, to dispose of which more easily the Council granted anyone fronting their tenement with wood the liberty of extending the front by seven feet into the street. The resulting timber frontages were followed by wooden fore-stairs which reduced the width of the street even more (until banned by the Council in 1674. A later parliamentary act of 1727 forbade stone-built stairs). According to the 18th-century historian William Maitland, \\"...the buildings which before had stonern fronts were now converted into wood, and the Burgh into a wooden city\\".W. Maitland, History of Edinburgh, Hamilton, Balfour & Neil, Edinburgh 1753, p.11 An English visitor William Brereton, commented in 1635 on what he perceived as the hideous effect of these wooden frontages, > Here they usually walk in the middle of the street, which is a fair, > spacious, and capacious walk. This street is the glory and beauty of this > city: it is the broadest street (except in the Low Countries, where there is > a navigable channel in middle of the street) and the longest street I have > seen, which begins at the palace, the gate whereof enters straight into the > suburbs, and is placed at the lower end of the same. The suburbs make an > handsome street; and indeed the street, if the houses, which are very high, > and substantially built of stone (some five, some six stories high), were > not lined to the outside and faced with boards, it were the most stately and > graceful street that ever I saw in my life; but this face of boards, which > is towards the street, doth much blemish it, and derogate from glory and > beauty; as also the want of fair glass windows, whereof few or none are to > be discerned towards the street, which is the more complete, because it is > as straight as may be. This lining with boards (wherein are round holes > shaped to the proportion of men's heads), and this encroachment into the > street about two yards, is a mighty disgrace unto it, for the walls (which > were the outside) are stone; so, as if this outside facing of boards were > removed, and the houses built uniform all of the same height, it were the > most complete street in Christendom.P Hume Brown (ed.), Early Travellers in > Scotland William Maitland (historian), James Thin 1973 One of the last timber-fronted houses at the corner of the West Bow and the Lawnmarket was demolished as late as 1878 as part of city improvement measures. ==Feuing the land== History re-enactors on the old Burgh Muir in 2011, from where a contingent of the Scottish army marched south to the Battle of Flodden A record survives from 1511 listing the first 16 feuars who were each given three acres of land on the north side of the burgh loch, divided into a half-acre lot for building and two and a half acres of farmland. This was followed by a further 27 lots granted in 1530, mainly for the South Muir, but including one to the widow of Walter Chapman situated just north of the convent at \\"Seynis\\" (Sciennes). Over time most of the South Muir plots came into the possession of the Dick family as owners of the Grange estate. The list of feuars in 1530 also survives, albeit with some gaps.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.71 & 74, where the 1530 list is reprinted from the Extracts from the Town Council Minutes held in the Advocates Library In 1586, the Council, led by Provost William Little, decided on a further round of feuing by auctioning lots on the Wester Muir and Easter Muir which extended down the southern slope of the muir as far as the Pow Burn (the Dicks of Grange became owners of the Braid estate beyond the burn in 1631). The Wester Muir comprised the lands which developed by a process of sub-leasing, known in Scots Law as subinfeudation, into the districts of Greenhill, Burghmuirhead and Morningside. The Easter Muir comprised the lands which developed likewise into the districts of the Grange, Blackford, Mayfield and Newington. The feuing of the Grange Estate was sanctioned by a private Act of Parliament in 1825 which allowed its owner, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, to feu land for the building of residential villas; the first being constructed in 1845.M Cant, Sciennes and the Grange, John Donald 1990, p.2 The Marchmont district, lying directly south of the Meadows, developed on land first feued by the Warrenders of Bruntsfield in 1869.M Cant, Marchmont In Edinburgh, John Donald 1984, p.1 ==Military use== The burgh muir was the traditional Edinburgh location for military training and wappenshaws (district inspections of arms) held periodically in accordance with a 1548 Act of Parliament in the reign of James V, which \\"...decretyt and ordaynit that wapinschawingis be haldin be the lordis and baronys spirituale and temporale four tymis in the yere.\\"Dickinson, Donaldson and Milne (eds.), A Source Book Of Scottish History, vol.ii, Nelson 1953, p.72 It was also where troops were mustered, for example in 1384, and before the Lauder Bridge incident in 1482.P Hume Brown, History of Scotland, vol.i, Cambridge 1902, p.277, when Archibald 'Bell-the-Cat' summarily executed the King's favourites by hanging them from the bridge A contingent also assembled here to fight the English army before the battle of Flodden in 1513, and again in 1523 and 1542. In total, the Scottish Army rendezvoused on the muir on at least six occasions prior to invading England.W Moir Bryce, Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, p.190 Sir Alexander Lauder of Bruntsfield (along with his two brothers) and his descendant, also Sir Alexander Lauder of Bruntsfield, both died in battle serving the Crown at Flodden and Pinkie respectively; their lands passing to their heirs.W Moir Bryce, Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.21 & 23 The 'Bore Stone', Morningside Road A stone built into the western boundary wall of the former Morningside Parish Church, known as the \\"Bore Stone\\" or \\"Hare Stane\\" (from Old Scots heir, meaning 'army') is popularly believed to be the stone which held the Royal Standard at the muster for Flodden on the muir in 1513. An accompanying plaque states that it was placed there by the owner of Greenhill House, Sir John Stuart Forbes of Pitsligo, in 1852. The story attached to its origin was established by Sir Walter Scott in his epic poem 'Marmion' (1808) which contains the lines, \\"The royal banner, floating wide:/The Staff, a pine tree strong and straight:/Pitched deeply in a massive stone/Which still in memory is shown.\\" However, the identification of the stone in Morningside Road with this poetic statement was discredited in an essay published by Henry Paton in 1942. Firstly, the stone has no hole-socket for holding a pole. Secondly, the Royal Treasurer's Accounts for 1513 make it clear that the King left Edinburgh before his standard and other banners had been made ready, and that they were sent after him.H M Paton, The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, vol.xxiv, Edinburgh 1942, pp.79-80, \\"ane man to byde on the standartis to bring thaim with him in haist that nycht that the kingis grace departit furth of Edinburgh\\" The standard must therefore have been first raised at Ellem, near Duns in Berwickshire where the Scottish host assembled before marching into England.R L Mackie, King James IV of Scotland, Oliver & Boyd 1958, p.247 According to the historian William Maitland, writing in 1753, the stone was originally situated on the eastern side of the road \\"almost opposite to the south-eastern corner of the Park-wall of Tipperlin Lone\\", suggesting it was a boundary marker belonging to the since vanished village of Tipperlin which bordered that side of the road.W Maitland, History of Edinburgh, Hamilton Balfour & Neill 1753, p.507 ==Use during the plague== In times of plague, of which there were several outbreaks in the 16th and 17th centuries, infected victims of \\"the pest\\" were sent to the muir as a primitive quarantine measure.D Daiches, Edinburgh, Hamish Hamilton 1978, p.64 Some records suggest that hopeless cases were sent to the chapel at Sciennes (see above), while suspected cases were lodged on the southern slope of the muir in temporary huts clustered round the Chapel of St. Roque, the patron saint of the plague- stricken, built on the Grange c.1503.C J Smith, Historic South Edinburgh, vol.1, Edinburgh & London 1978, p.229 > Horse or hand-drawn wooden carts conveyed the hapless victims out to the > Burgh Muir between the hours of 9.p.m. and 5 a.m. These primitive ambulances > were preceded by \\"Bailies of the Mure\\", voluntarily recruited men wearing > black or grey tunics and St Andrew's Crosses. They carried long staffs used > to touch infected materials and rang hand-bells to warn citizens of their > dangerous charges. The carts halted at the Burgh or South Loch, now the > Meadows. On its south bank were prepared large cauldrons of boiling water in > which other Bailies of the Mure, known as \\"clengeris\\" [cleansers], carrying > long staffs with metal hooks at the tips, attempted to disinfect the > victims' clothes.C J Smith, Historic South Edinburgh, vol.1, Edinburgh & > London 1978, pp.228-9 Smith does not identify the precise time in history he > is describing in this scene. Gravestone of John Livingstone, an Edinburgh apothecary who fell victim to the plague in 1645. His mausoleum stands in what were the grounds of his house built on the western edge of the muir. The Town Council laid down strict regulations to contain the plague. People suspected of infection, because they lived in proximity to others who had died, were taken with their household goods to be \\"clengit\\" (cleansed) on the muir. In October 1568, a shoemaker, John Forrest, was appointed as cleanser on the west part of the \\"Borrow Mure.\\" Another shoemaker and a weaver were made Baillies of the Muir, among whose responsibilities was giving permission to those cleansed to return home. No- one was allowed to visit those suspected of infection on the muir except in the company of these officers. They were issued with similar gowns bearing a white St Andrew's cross on the back and front, and carried a stick with a white cloth on the end \\"quhairby thai may be knawin quhaireuer thay pas\\".Marwick, J.D., ed., Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1557-1571, (1875), pp.250-259, link to pages on British History Online. In 1585, during another plague outbreak, a \\"Greitt Fowle Luge\\" was built on the muir at a location named Purves's Acres. The quarantined \\"cleansed\\" were lodged to the west of this building, and newly suspected \\"foul\\" persons to the east. There were so many people on the muir that the council ordered that their beer should be brewed thinner. Cleansed persons allowed home were confined to their houses for 15 days. Stealing infected goods was a hanging offence,Marwick, J.D., ed., Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1573-1589, (1882), pp.430-7; see p.422, 1 June 1585; pp.430-1, 8 July 1585; p.432-3, 23 July 1585 \\"that na maner of persoun that salhappin pas be the caldrone abstract ony of thair guddis, vnder the pane of deid\\" and a \\"foul\\" hangman was employed for the purpose of executing offenders on the muir. It is recorded that Smythie, the \\"fowle hangman\\", was chained to his own gibbet on 23 July 1585 for disobedience.Marwick, J.D., ed., Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1573-1589, (1882), pp.430-7; see p.422, 1 June 1585; pp.430-1, 8 July 1585; p.432-3, 23 July 1585 When land in the west muir area was feued in 1597, the council reserved a path at the east end leading to the Braid Burn for use during times of pestilence.Wood, Marguerite, ed., Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589-1603, (1927), p.209, The name here may not in fact refer to the present Braid Burn, as this was also another name for the Pow Burn (see Jordan Burn) which was the boundary of both the city and the muir. The path is described as belonging to the lands of Herbert Maxwell. A narrow lane runs north-south through the Grange area today, and, while no direct evidence exists, may follow the line of an older path such as the one mentioned here. It appears on a map of 1766 as Kirk Road, leading to the West Kirk (St. Cuthbert's) and is currently named Lovers Loan. Stuart Harris observes in his 'Place Names of Edinburgh' (1996) that the pairing Kirk/Lovers Loan occurs frequently in Scotland \\"since dawn-to-dusk working hours six days a week made the long Sunday walks to and from the kirk an important courting occasion\\". Many of the afflicted must have died en route and been buried by the wayside, as evidenced by human remains later unearthed in private gardens. The dead were buried in unmarked burial pits, some of which have left traces in the grounds of the present-day Astley Ainslie Hospital.C J Smith, Historic South Edinburgh, vol.1, Edinburgh & London 1978, p.228-9 ==As a place of execution== Edinburgh had several execution sites in the past. An area of ground known as \\"the Gallowgreen\\" (when its feuing was recorded in 1668)S Harris, The Place Names Of Edinburgh, London 1996 describes this as \\"a wedge- shaped outshot of the Burgh Muir\\" which extended from its base about 150 yards along the north side of today's East Preston Street \\"tapering to a point about 400 yards further north\\" at today's Spittalfield Crescent. was the site of a gibbet of uncertain date, erected on the eastern edge of the burgh muir. It was deliberately placed to face down the road to Dalkeith, presumably to deter highway robbers. It is known that a horse-thief, also accused of being a \\"commone gyde to Inglis Thevis\\" (\\"a common guide to English thieves\\"), was hanged \\"at the galloss of the burrow mure\\" in 1563; and it is also recorded that two men were hanged for stealing infected clothing during an outbreak of the plague in 1585. In the following year the Town Council ordered the gibbet, described as \\"foullet and decayand, bayth in the timmer [timber] wark and the wallis\\", to be replaced close to the same spot (at the present-day junction of East Preston Street and Dalkeith Road) and enclosed by walls of sufficient height \\"sua tht doggis sal not be abill to cary the cariounis [dead flesh] furth of the samyn\\"; a statement that implies the practice of hanging the bodies or body parts of malefactors in chains. The new gibbet is described in the Town Council Minutes of 1568 as consisting of two or more stone pillars connected at the top by one or more wooden cross-beams, with the whole structure surrounded by a wall to keep out stray dogs.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.85-6 Other executions here included the hanging of members of the outlawed McGregor clan, of whom a total of 38 were judicially killed on the spot between 1603 and 1624, as were four 'Gypsies' in 1611, for failing to observe a parliamentary act of 1609 which had banished all \\"Egyptianis\\" from the kingdom. They were followed by 11 more Gypsies in 1624, whose womenfolk were initially sentenced to drowning, but eventually ordered to leave Scotland.W Moir Bryce, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol x, Edinburgh 1918, pp.87ff. The ground at this part of the Muir was also used for the unmarked burials of malefactors. For example, the torso of James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, without his heart (removed from his coffin at the instigation of his niece), was unceremoniously buried in unconsecrated ground after his execution on 21 May 1650. Following the Restoration his remains were disinterred in 1661 and eventually placed in an elaborate tomb in St. Giles.

Commissioned by Glyndebourne Opera, Glyndebourne Touring Opera premiered the work at Glyndebourne Opera House in a production by Richard Jones on 24 September 1998. It received its Glyndebourne Festival premiere with the original cast at Glyndebourne Festival Opera on 14 August 1999, and was revived at Glyndebourne in August 2005. De Angelis took part of the inspiration for the plot from the true-life story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who lived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, for 18 years, unable to exit the airport terminal. Some of the same real events surrounding Nasseri were later used in the story for the 2004 Steven Spielberg film The Terminal, independently conceived after the opera. Dove has also arranged music from Flight into an orchestral suite, titled Airport Scenes, for concert performances. This suite was first performed in Warwick on 7 March 2006. ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 24 September 1998 (Conductor: David Parry (conductor)) - Refugee countertenor Christopher Robson - Controller soprano Claron McFadden - Bill tenor Richard Coxon - Tina soprano Mary Plazas - Stewardess mezzo-soprano Ann Taylor - Older Woman contralto Nuala Willis - Steward baritone Garry Magee - Minskman baritone Steven Page - Minskwoman mezzo-soprano Anne Mason - Immigration Officer bass-baritone Richard Van Allan } ==Plot== The setting is the departure lounge of an unspecified airport. The opera takes place over the course of one full day and the following morning. ===Act 1=== In the airport, all of the characters are en route somewhere, except for the Controller, the Refugee, and the Immigration Officer. The Refugee cannot leave the airport because he does not have a passport or other documents to allow him to enter the country legally. The Immigration Officer looks for the Refugee in order to arrest him. Married couple Bill and Tina are going on holiday to try to get their relationship out of its routine with the help of a sex manual. The Older Woman, appearing in disguise, has come to the terminal to wait for her \\"fianc√©\\"‚Äîa younger man that has promised to meet her. Minskman is a diplomat relocating for an assignment, and his wife, Minskwoman, is pregnant and on the brink of childbirth. The Stewardess and Steward, when not serving the customers, enjoy a vibrant physical relationship. At the last minute, Minskwoman is afraid to fly, and Minskman goes to his destination without his wife. The Flight Controller warns of approaching storms. The Older Woman's fianc√© has not arrived, and Bill and Tina prepare to depart. As Act I closes, all of the characters are suddenly delayed and stranded at the airport because of the inclement weather. ===Act 2=== The time is during the night, just after the storm has \\"gotten worse\\" and grounded all the planes. After all the characters have gone to sleep, Bill, in an attempt to break out of his \\"predictable\\" nature, makes a pass at the Stewardess, but is shocked to find the Steward instead. The two of them agree to venture up to the heights of the control tower. The Flight Controller grapples with the lack of planes and verbally assaults the storm outside her tower. The Refugee tries to insinuate himself with the various women and gives them (at various points throughout the act) each a \\"magic stone\\" that he says will cure their individual travails. The women toast their good fortune and drink with the Refugee. Eventually, as the storm builds, the drunk women realize that the Refugee has given them all the same \\"magic stone\\" and turn on him in a fit of rage, knocking him unconscious and concealing his body within a trunk. Up above in the tower, Bill and the Steward engage in an explorative sexual affair. ===Act 3=== It is dawn; the storm has cleared, and every character reels from the events of the previous night. The controller announces the sudden arrival of a plane. Minskman has returned suddenly on the first available flight back, unable to continue without his wife at his side. When Tina learns of Bill's sexual encounter, she is enraged and angrily strikes him with the sex manual, knocking him unconscious as well. The Minskwoman suddenly goes into labor and delivers her baby in the terminal, just as the Refugee awakes from the trunk. The characters, with the insight of newborn life, reflect on the problems in their lives and offer forgiveness to each other for their wrongs. The Immigration Officer finally catches up with the Refugee. The passengers divide into two camps, one demanding the arrest of the Refugee, with the other trying to persuade the Immigration Officer to \\"review the situation\\". The Immigration Officer is implacable, citing the need to observe the rules. The Refugee then tells his story, which explains why he has no documentation. His story touches the passengers, and also the Immigration Officer. The officer says that the Refugee cannot leave the terminal, but also that he will \\"turn a blind eye\\" and not arrest him. With the storm cleared, Minskman and Minskwoman, with their new baby, fly to his new mission. Tina, taking the opportunity to start fresh with her husband Bill, go to their respective vacation destination. The Older Woman decides to venture out on a flight herself. The Steward and Stewardess make amends, each working on their respective flights. The opera ends with an enigmatic inquiry from the Controller to the Refugee. ==Recording== The opera has been recorded commercially for Chandos, taken from the live Channel 4 television broadcast from Glyndebourne. ==Selected list of stagings== {  - !

According to the 1835 census the municipality had a population of 4,381. Gjerpen was located east of the city of Skien. It encompassed districts such as Borgestad, B√∏le, Gulset and Luksefjell. On 1 July 1916 an area with roughly 1,332 inhabitants was moved to Skien, and on 1 July 1920 an area with 437 inhabitants was moved to Porsgrunn. On 1 January 1964 the rest of Gjerpen was incorporated into Skien, along with Solum and the district Valeb√∏. Prior to the merger Gjerpen had a population of 15,300. The current district of Gjerpen constitute only a small part of the former Gjerpen municipality. ==Etymology== The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the farm Gjerpen (Old Norse Gerpin, from *Garpvin), since the first church was built there.

Murray has now moved to the welterweight but all of his fights as a professional were fought in the welterweight division.Boxrec Fighter Page ==Background== Murray was born into a large family from Palmerstown, west County Dublin in 1976. Robbie Murray is a cousin of Irish hip-hop artist Ste V Roc and Irish Middleweight champion Jim Rock. Murray is promoted by Brian Peters and although a native Dubliner, Murray, like his cousin Rock, is trained by Jim Breen and fights out of the Breen Gym in Belfast along with Eamonn Magee and Neil Sinclair. Murray is also an author who has penned novel. ==Amateur career== Murray boxed as an amateur at local, national and represented the Irish national boxing team at an international competition. He also enjoyed victory professional James Moore. After seeing the success of his cousin and after coming through a good experience sparring with \\"Shamrock\\" Shea Neary this convinced Murray that he had the skills to become a professional. ==Professional careerDebut=== Murray then turned professional in November 2001, winning his first fight at the National Boxing Arena in Dublin, in which Murray beat fellow debutant Paul McIlwaine on a card that included Steve Collins and Eamonn Magee. Both novices showed that they lacked but also showed their grit and determination in this scrappy and untidy bout. In the fourth round Murray cut McIlwaine badly over his left eye and the referee stopped the fight in the following round by the referee giving Murray a stoppage win in his first outing as a professional. ===Carlin fight=== In February 2003, Murray faced Welsh boxer Dafydd Carlin on the undercard of the Neil Sinclair and Jim Rock v Takaloo bout. The fight took place over four fiercely contested rounds at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. Murray got off to a great start when he knocked Carlin to the canvas with a sweeping right hook in the first round and also dominated the second. Carlin came back strongly in the third round to trouble Murray. However, Murray knowing that with the knockdown in the first round Carlin would require a knockdown or knockout of his own to gain a draw or victory covered up in the final round to take the win by 38‚Äì36 on the scorecards. ===The Flurry beats Senior=== Murray then travelled train and spar at Frank Maloney's \\"Fight Factory Gym\\" in London. Murray returned from his time in London enthused and his trainer, Jim Breen, was sure Murray was ready to step up a level. Murray was to return to the ring on 30 October 2007 to face unbeaten Scottish fighter Ronnie Nailen at the Ulster Hall in Belfast. However, Murray was forced to pull out of the fight due to injury and was replaced by Glenn McClarnon.Boxrec Fighter Page Murray's trademark, which earned him the nickname \\"the flurry\\", was his hand speed and solid punch. He displayed this speed in his first fight after a gap of over a year in his impressive win over Nottingham's Nigel Senior at the Burlington Hotel in Dublin on 30 May 2004. Murray began by attacking the head and body. Although Senior appeared to hold and cover Murray showed his speed and wasted few punches connecting flurries to the body. Senior was on the canvas in the second round though the referee, Emile Tiedt, adjudged it a slip. Senior was again on the canvas in the third but this time it was called as a low blow but Murray finally floored Senior legally in round four but Senior picked himself up once more to continue to the final bell and survive this one sided contest to finish which Murray won by 58 points to 56 points to extend his unbeaten run. After the fight Senior acknowledged that Murray was \\"a good kid, awkward to fight and he's got fast hands\\". ===Ceri Hall fight at the National Stadium=== Murray's toughest contest of his career came on 19 February 2005, at the National Boxing Stadium in Dublin against Ceri Hall. In what had become a familiar pattern Murray commanded the opening of the fight on workrate alone, throwing bunches of punches while Halls individual shots were heavier they were too infrequent. Murray maintained his busy pace using height and reach advantages in the second round when Hall suddenly caught Murray sending Murray to the floor, for the first time in his career, in a flash knockdown. Despite rising quickly, Murray appeared dazed but by the end of the round Murray had returned to his busy style. In the third round Murray, with blood streaming from his nose, appeared more respectful of Hall's power and Hall seemed to be dictating the pace and tempo of the fight. At the end of the third round, Murray's trainer, John Breen instructed to increase the workrate, which he duly did, taking the fourth and fifth on sheer punch volume. In the sixth it was Murray's turn to floor Hall with a right, left combination, which even the tally in terms on knockdowns. In the final two rounds both fights tired and in the eighth and final round referee David Ervine docked Hall a point for holding. At the end of the fight the Belfast ref scored the bout 77‚Äì75 in favour of Murray which again extended his unbeaten record. ===Irish title victory=== On 14 May 2005, Murray was due to fight Hartlepool's Alan Temple for the vacant Irish Light Welterweight championship National Boxing Stadium in Dublin on the undercard of a Bernard Dunne fight. Murray had wanted to face London based Galway Olympian, Francie Barrett but he stated \\"\\"I know Francie will want this title but unfortunately negotiations broke down this time....but I know he will not want anyone else to have it\\" In any event Murray faced another London based Galwegian the former British Southern Area Lightweight title holder Peter McDonagh for the belt. Murray was a comparative novice in the professional ranks in comparison to McDonagh who was an experienced campaigner having already faced the likes of Peter Buckley, Chilli John and David Burke, whereas Murray had never been past eight rounds. In the opening rounds Murray dominated McDonagh with a higher workrate and McDonagh appeared content to counter punch. Through the middle round McDonagh began to stand firm against Murray's onslaught of flurries. Murray's high workrate left his defence open at times which McDonagh began to take advantage of. Towards the latter rounds McDonagh appeared to fade and become ragged, however, Murray's fitness told as he was able to continue his marauding style, pushing forward and making his superior workrate count. The tenth and final round highlight the desire that both men had to win an Irish title. A fresher looking Murray still seemed to gain the upper hand in the exchanges to finish the fight strongly. Belfast referee Sean Russell scored the fight 98‚Äì94 to give Murray the Irish national title. Murray was then presented with the belt by former professional, Sligonian, Vinny Feeney and then stated \\"I knew my persistent and aggressive style would catch up with him eventually. He was tough though, he worked hard throughout and it was an eye opener for me and just what I needed at this stage in my career\\". ==Move to welterweight== Murray has only fought intermittently since debut and a highly anticipated Irish title fight against US based Irishman Oisin Fagan has been cancelled as Murray has now vacated the Irish title and stated that he is moving up to the welterweight division. Murray is currently ranked 7th in Irish.boxing.com's rankings of welterweights after up a division, however, as a light welterweight he was ranked number in the Boxing Union of Ireland lists in 2005. ==See also== * Jim Rock ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from County Dublin Category:Irish male boxers Category:Welterweight boxers ","title":"Robbie Murray"},{"id":"7453596","text":"E121 may refer to: * European route E121 * Citrus Red 2, a food dye, sometimes used in the United States to color the skin of oranges * Unbiunium, a hypothetical element ","title":"E121"},{"id":"7453602","text":"Bodzianske L√∫ky () is a village and municipality in the Kom√°rno District in the Nitra Region of south-west Slovakia. ==Geography== The village lies at an altitude of 109 metres and covers an area of 5.166 km¬≤.

At age 20 he entered Shogen-ji, a well-known Rinzai monastery; it is reported that he experienced kensho after two and half years there. In 1901 he graduated from Komazawa University (then S≈çt≈ç-shu Daigakurin), the S≈çt≈ç university. He eventually studied under various S≈çt≈ç and Rinzai masters such as Harada Sodo Kakusho,Dharma Heirs and Teachers of the Harada-Yasutani school (Edited by Dr T. Matthew Ciolek) Oka Sotan, Akino Kodo, Adachi Tatsujun, Hoshimi Tenkai, Unmuken Taigi Sogon, and Kogenshitsu Dokutan Sosan. From the years of 1911 to 1923, Harada held a professor position at Soto-shu Daigakurin. A very strict disciplinarian, he served as abbot at various S≈çt≈ç temples throughout Japan: Hosshin-ji, Chisai-in, Bukkoku-ji, S≈çji-ji and Chigen-ji. Until almost age 90, he conducted week-long sesshin at Hosshin-ji 6 times a year; he also held sesshin elsewhere. Harada Roshi's teaching integrated the Rinzai use of K≈çan, a practice which was abolished in the S≈çt≈ç-school in the 19th century under influence of Gento Sokuchu (1729‚Äì1807). He also departed from the S≈çt≈ç conventions of his day by training lay persons with monks rather than separately. A well-known heir in the West is Hakuun Yasutani R≈çshi, a S≈çt≈ç monk who he also trained in koan study. This led ultimately to the spread of combined S≈çt≈ç and Rinzai methods by the Sanbo Kyodan, a new Zen sect founded by Yasutani which became influential in the West. Harada himself, however, remained within the S≈çt≈ç sect. It is often claimed in the West that he received Rinzai inka shomei (dharma transmission) from Dokutan R≈çshi. Harada R≈çshi may be viewed as an eclectically talented S≈çt≈ç teacher who did not abide by sectarian boundaries in regard to practice method. ==Criticism== Harada has been criticized for his support of the Japanese War-endeavors. A famous quote from Harada, cited in Zen at War, is: ==Dharma heirs== Dharma-heirs from Harada Roshi are:Harada School * Hakuun Yasutani R≈çshi, founder of Sanbo Kyodan * Harada Tangen R≈çshi Head of Bukkoku- ji temple; * Ban Tetsugyu Soin R≈çshi, Head of Tosho-ji temple in Tokyo; * Watanabe Genshu, Head of Soji-ji temple among others. ==See also== * Buddhism in Japan ==ReferencesSources== * * * ==External links== * Sanbo Kyodan teachers and heirs Sanbo Kyodan: Harada-Yasutani School of Zen at the WWW Virtual library (Edited by Dr T.

Brigid Marlin (born 16 January 1936, Washington, D.C.) is an American artist based in Hertfordshire, UK. She studied in Dublin, Montreal, New York, Paris and Vienna where, under the guidance of the Austrian artist Ernst Fuchs, she learned the oil and egg tempera (Mische) technique of the Flemish and Italian Renaissance painters Jan van Eyck and Giovanni Bellini. In 1961 she founded the ins-cape group, which subsequently became the Society for Art of Imagination. Marlin's paintings typically feature visionary and psychic subjects, often with scriptural themes akin to the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. One of her best-known paintings 'The Rod' (shown right) won the 1974 Visions of the Future competition and was greatly admired by J G Ballard, who later commissioned her to reproduce the Belgian surrealist Paul Delvaux's two 'lost' paintings 'The Rape' and 'The Mirror'. Her portrait of Ballard was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1989, and she has also painted portraits of the Dalai Lama and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Marlin is the daughter of artist and children's author Hilda van Stockum. She married in 1957, had three sons (the eldest of whom died in 1979) and divorced in 1980.

The road starts at the junction of Orchard Road and Handy Road, at the ERP gantry towards the Central Business District, and ends at the junction with Nicoll Highway, beyond which it becomes Raffles Boulevard. The road houses several landmarks including Fairmont Singapore, Raffles Hotel, Singapore Art Museum, Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and the Singapore Management University. A MRT station with the same name, Bras Basah MRT station, is on the Circle Line. ==Names== Bras Basah (Modern Spelling: Beras Basah) means \\"wet rice\\" in Malay - beras means harvested rice with husk removed, and basah means wet. The road is said to be so named because in the early days, a small river known as Fresh Water Stream or Sungei Bras Basah (Bras Basah River) used to exist here. The area was the gateway for boats that brought in tons of rice, and the rice may be laid on the river banks to dry, but the rice would often get wet at high tides. The area is now largely filled in, and the river Bras Basah (now the Stamford Canal) is mostly covered up. In the earliest plan of Singapore, Lieutenant Philip Jackson's 1822 Plan of Singapore, Bras Basah Road is shown as two separate roads. This map names the section between North Bridge Road and Beach Road as Church Street due to the presence of a Missionary Society chapel that stood at the corner of North Bridge Road and Bras Basah Road, while the section between North Bridge Road and Selegie Hill is named Selegy Street. Note however that the Jackson Plan is a proposal on how the road may be arranged, and the actual arrangement of the road at that time was different as shown in an actual map of 1825. The road was also referred to as College Street in a lease granted by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1823 for the Raffles Institution as it was the location of the Institution, but the name did not gain currency and was soon forgotten. In an 1826 lease, the road was called Cross Road. The road appears on G.D. Coleman's 1836 Map of Singapore as Brass Bassa Road, the spelling used until the late 19th century when it was changed to Bras Basah. In the old days, the local Chinese referred to the road by several names according to the buildings that may be found along the road. These included Lau kha-ku-keng khau (ËÄÅËÑöÊãòÈñìÂè£, \\"Old Gaol Mouth\\") in Hokkien and Kau ka-ku hau (ËàäÊû∂Âè§Âè£) in Cantonese, a reference to an old gaol that was once located between Stamford Road and Bras Basah Road. The term kha ku means \\"fetters\\" in Hokkien, and the name in Cantonese is an adaptation of the Hokkien term. Another name, Ho-lan-se le-pai-tng pi (ÂíåËò≠Ë•øÁ¶ÆÊãúÂ†ÇÈÇä) meaning \\"beside the French church\\", is a reference to the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd belonging to the French mission here. Another location used was Tek kok seng nong (Âæ∑ÂúãÁ•ûËæ≤) or \\"the German pharmacy\\", referring to a German-own pharmacy named after the mythical ruler Shennong that once stood at a corner of the street. Other names included Hai ki ang-neo toa-oh pi (Êµ∑Â¢òÁ¥ÖÊØõÂ§ßÂ≠∏ÈÇä) or \\"beside the seaside English big school\\", referring to the Raffles Institution once sited here. In Mandarin, this is pronounced as Hai gan hong mao da xue bian, or simply as Da shu guan bian (Â§ß‰π¶È¶ÜËæπ), meaning beside the big school (RI). In Hakka, it may be called Thong kwong sen kei, meaning \\"Thong Kwong Sen Street\\" after a Hakka-owned tailoring establishment on the road. ==Landmarks== View of Cathedral of the Good Shepherd from Bras Basah Road Raffles city beside Bras Basah Road These are the major landmarks along Bras Basah (from east to west): * The Cathay * Rendezvous Hotel * Manulife Centre * Singapore Management University * Former Saint Joseph's Institution (Singapore Art Museum) * Cathedral of the Good Shepherd * SMU Administration Building * Carlton Hotel * CHIJMES * Raffles Hotel * Raffles City and Fairmont Singapore * South Beach, Singapore * Civilian War Memorial ==See also== * Stamford Road * Orchard Road * Downtown Core * Marina Centre ==References== Category:Roads in Singapore ","title":"Bras Basah Road"},{"id":"7453753","text":"Seymour Horace Knox I (April 1861 ‚Äì May 17, 1915), was a Buffalo, New York businessman who made his fortune in five-and-dime stores. He merged his more than 100 stores with those of his first cousins, Frank Winfield Woolworth and Charles Woolworth, to form the F. W. Woolworth Company. He went on to hold prominent positions in the merged company as well as Marine Trust Co. He was the father of Seymour H. Knox II and grandfather of Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, the co-founders of the Buffalo Sabres in the National Hockey League. Knox (center) with Frank and Charles Woolworth ==Biography== He was born in April 1861 in Russell, Saint Lawrence County, New York. His father was James Horace Knox, a farmer married to Jane E. McBrier. James' grandfather had fought in the American Revolution. William Knox, was the first of this line of Knoxes to come to Massachusetts from Belfast, Ireland, in 1737. Seymour attended the Russell district school and at fifteen, though he had never gone to high school, began to teach in school himself. ==Career== Pioneering Urban 5 and dime in Detroit At seventeen he moved to Hart, Michigan, where for a few years he worked as a salesclerk. Then he left for Reading, Pennsylvania, where he entered into a partnership with his first cousins. He later donated the Knox Memorial Central School Building (dedicated on July 30, 1913) that served the town until the Knox Memorial School and Edwards Central School merged. He initially became a partner with the Woolworths by jointly opening a Reading, Pennsylvania, Woolworth & Knox store with them on September 20, 1884, using his entire life savings. The Reading store's first several hours had no sales. However, after the partners took a lunchtime walk, they returned at 1:30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1:00‚Äîwith their paychecks. Sales were brisk, and the partners never looked back. His second store, in Newark, New Jersey, was short lived, but his partnership thrived nonetheless. The third venture, in Erie, Pennsylvania, enabled them to buy out the Newark lease. He partnered with Frank to open the first Buffalo store, at 409 Main Street, on October 13, 1888. By 1889, he was able to buy out his cousins. He maintained a collegial business relationship with his cousins after the buyout. In fact, he bought Woolworth merchandise at wholesale and sometimes traded in competition. He formed another brief partnership with another friendly rival, Earle Perry Charlton, from 1889‚Äì1895, opening his Buffalo \\"S.H. Knox Co.\\" 5 and 10 Cent Store in 1890. In 1890, he made established headquarters in the Buffalo store.Brown, p. 120 Sources disagree on the chronology of later stores. One source says that the second Buffalo store was opened at 549 William Street on June 20, 1891. Another says Knox opened his second store on December 18, 1893, at 519 Main Street four days after the first store at 409 Main Street was destroyed in the Wonderland Building Fire. The 519 Main Street store replaced the 409 Main Street after the December 14, 1893 fire and moved to 395 Main Street in 1895.Brown, p. 121 He continued to build his S.H. Knox Co. 5 and 10 Cent Store empire. By the time of the 1911 incorporation of F. W. Woolworth Company, Knox was the second largest of six store operators with 98 U.S. and 13 Canadian locations. In 1912, he received $12 million of the $65 million merger proceeds and was appointed Director and Senior Vice-Principal of the Corporation. Knox is remembered as the pioneering city center store operator. His Detroit, Michigan store was the first outside of the agricultural and small-market towns. Many of the Woolworth friendly rivals emulated his plan. In 1913, he purchased Stephen Clement's interests in Marine National.

Music from Ding Dong Denny O'Reilly and VT inserts from various Irish personalities including Gerry Ryan, Nell McCafferty, Foster and Allen, PJ Gallagher, Mary Black with their memories and opinions of Podge and Rodge. There were also clips from A Scare at Bedtime. The show was filmed in front of a studio audience of skeletons and one man and his dog. ===A Frightmare Before Christmas (2006)=== Podge and Rodge hosted a special show from Ballydung Manor on 19 December, entitled A Frightmare Before Christmas. It celebrated Christmas from their perspective, a reality where none of the intended guests turned up, and imaginary scenarios where the worst possible guests did. In reality Podge and Rodge and Lucy were left in the darkness of Ballydung Manor as the thunder raged outside, imagining their nightmare guests. Lucy dreamed of interviewing June Rodgers and lo and behold a flashback occurred featuring June being interviewed by the two. In the \\"imaginary\\" interview they made fun of her name, suggesting it had hidden pornographic innuendos. At the end of the flashback, the studio was still empty, leading Lucy to fill time by showing a special report of her interviewing people on the streets and asking them such questions as \\"When do you empty your sack?\\". Podge then revealed his nightmare guest would be George Murphy, and in his imaginary interview an old tape was unearthed of him embarrassing himself on You're a Star. The interview was broken up by a return to reality whereby Podge had fallen asleep out of boredom. In the second half of the show Lucy revealed the reason for the lack of guests; a plague of locusts was flocking towards the Ballydung bypass and Colin Farrell was being held up in a Moscow phone booth. Rodge's nightmare guest was revealed to be Shane MacGowan whom Rodge asked had he sold his soul to Satan. They showed him what he would look like if he had plastic surgery (including face liposuction and ‚Ç¨3000 teeth) before comparing his new appearance to that of Christy Dignam. Podge and Rodge joined George Murphy to sing out the show with \\"The Irish Rover\\". ===Bogmanay (2006)=== Podge and Rodge rang in 2007 on 31 December 2006/1 January 2007 in a special programme lasting over forty minutes instead of the usual thirty-minute format. The New Year's Eve show was called Bogmanay (a play on Hogmanay). It was broadcast on RT√â Two from 11.30p.m. On it the boys looked back at some of the highlights of their year. They also handed out their very own Feckin' Eejit of the Year Awards (FEEJITs) to celebrate the great tradition of Irish Feckin' Eejitry. There were nine nominees chosen from the worlds of TV, entertainment, sport and politics. Guests included Edele and Keavy Lynch of B*Witched fame, Mary Black, Jason Donovan and Freddie Starr returned as the Ballydung Butler for the evening. ===Bogmanay II (2007)=== Such was the success of the original Bogmanay, Podge and Rodge hosted a second Bogmanay to ring in 2008.

The son of wealthy businessman Seymour H. Knox, he owned a palatial home designed by C. P. H. Gilbert.Seymour H. Knox, Jr. House excerpt from Oakland Place: Gracious Living in Buffalo by Martin Wachadlo Buffalo Heritage Unlimited (publisher) ==Early life== He was born on September 1, 1898 to Grace Millard Knox (1862‚Äì1936) and Seymour H. Knox I (1861‚Äì1915), who merged his chain of five-and-dime stores with those of his first cousins, Frank Winfield Woolworth and Charles Woolworth, to form the F. W. Woolworth Company in 1912. Knox was one of three children born to Seymour and Grace: *Dorothy Virginia Knox (1896-1980), who in 1915 married Frank H. Goodyear Jr. (1891-1930). In 1931, after Goodyear's death, she married Edmund Pendleton Rogers (1882-1966) *Seymour Horace Knox II (1898-1990) *Marjorie Millard Knox (1900-1971), who in 1927 married J. Hazard Campbell (1900-1938). In 1948, she married Benjamin Klopp. Knox attended Nichols School in Buffalo and the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. He was a 1920 graduate of Yale University. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. ==CareerBusiness career=== In 1921, upon graduation from Yale, Knox became a Marine Midland Bank director. In 1926, he became vice-president, followed by chairman in 1943 until 1970. He joined the F. W. Woolworth board in 1926 and was chairman from 1943 until reaching the mandatory retirement age forty-five years later in 1971. He became Chairman of The University at Buffalo's governing Council from 1950-69. Knox served on the board of directors of Marine Midland Bank, F. W. Woolworth Company, New York Central Railroad, Penn Central Railroad, and the American Steamship Company. ===Art=== In 1926, he joined the board of Albright Art Gallery. From the beginning, he was a leader in the modernism movement and in modern cultural life in Buffalo.Goldman, p. 105 He spent 60 years working with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and by 1939, he was President of the Academy. He bolstered the Contemporary Abstractionism collection during his tenure. He is best known for his 1962 addition to the Albright Art Gallery, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. After the completion of the addition, the Gallery was renamed the Albright-Knox Art Gallery Knox in his honor. He donated more than 160 works for the new wing, and over 700 pieces over his lifetime. He is said to be in part responsible for the popularity of Jackson Pollock. Under his direction, the Gallery became the first museum to purchase a Clyfford Still, one of the first to purchase a Henry Moore, and as leading champions of Abstractionism, they acquired selections from almost every major abstractionist. In 1965 he was appointed to a commission to choose modern art works for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. ==Personal life== In 1923, he married Helen Northrup (1902-1971), who had attended the Albright Art School. The lived in a mansion at 57 Oakland Place in Buffalo, designed by C. P. H. Gilbert. Construction on the home began in 1924 and was a gift to the couple from Knox's mother, who lived nearby at 800 Delaware Avenue. Together, they had two sons: *Seymour H. Knox III (1926‚Äì1996) *Northrup Rand Knox (1928‚Äì1998) Both sons were the original principal owners of the Buffalo Sabres NHL team. Knox was the subject of the 1985 Andy Warhol painting \\"Portrait of Seymour H. Knox\\". He also donated significant funds to the Yale University Art Gallery, in New Haven, Connecticut, which both the Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art and Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of European and Contemporary Art positions bear his name. He was an avid polo player and led his Aurora team to the United States Championship in 1932, later touring South America, and winning a tournament in Europe. Knox died on September 27, 1990 and was eulogized in Congress by U.S. Representative Bill Paxon. ===Honors=== In 1986, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Ronald Reagan for his contributions to the arts in Buffalo and the nation. ==See also== *Albright-Knox Art Gallery *Knox Farm State Park *National Medal of Arts ==References== * Goldman, Mark, \\"City on The Edge: Buffalo, New York,\\" Prometheus Books, 2007. ==External links== * Sports Illustrated: School of Hard Knox * Knox Family of Buffalo, NY * Seymour H.

It is endemic to this area. It is a deep water shark and is found about 220 to 915 meters below the surface, on the upper continental slopes of the Gulf. E. schultzi is a small shark, about 27‚Äì30 cm long and feeds on squid. It is also bioluminescent, which counter- illuminates it and helps with intraspecific interaction. Due to its limited range and the difficulty of collecting deep water species, it has not been evaluated by the IUCN Red List, but due to recent oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, it is likely that Fringefin lanternsharks have decreased in population. == Taxonomy == The Fringefin lanternshark was first identified in 1953 by H.B. Bigelow, W. C. Schroeder, and S. Springer in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College. Etmopteridae is a family commonly known as lanternsharks because the photophores on their ventral side produce light, making them bioluminescent. The family Etmopteridae is split into 5 genera; the largest of these genera is Etmopterus, of which there are 41 species, including the Fringefin lanternshark. Fringefin lanternsharks are named for the distinct fringing created by ceratotrichia on the edge of their fins. Ceratotrichia are the fibers that support fish fins. == Distribution and habitat == E. shultzi lives at a depth of about 220 to 915 meters below the surface, predominantly on the upper continental slopes of the Gulf of Mexico. It is endemic to the Gulf, and its range extends from the continental slopes of Eastern Mexico, Southern Unites States, and Western Florida. == Description == E. schultzi males are about 27 cm long, while females are 28‚Äì30 cm long. The upper part of their bodies is light brown and their bellies are dusky grey. They have a dark mark behind and above the pelvic fins at the base of their tail. The edges of their fins are given their characteristic fringed appearance by naked ceratotrichia, the filaments that run through fish fins. Their denticles are hooked and mostly cover the snout. Their gill openings are short and their second dorsal fin, the fin located closer to the tail, is about twice the size of the first dorsal fin, which is located closer to the head. Like all shark species, they have heterocercal caudal fins, where the upper part is longer than the lower. == Biology  Feeding === E. schultzi is known to feed on squid. It has also been suggested that these lantersharks school in order to hunt food, but very little research has been done on their feeding behaviors and methods. === Life history === Fringefin lanternsharks likely use the species-specific bioluminescent patterns on their ventral side to find mates. Although Fringefin lanternshark reproduction has not been directly studied, due to their close association with other lanternshark species, Fringefin lanternsharks are presumably ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity is a method of reproduction in which there is internal fertilization and the developing young feed on the egg yolk. The mother then gives birth to live, fully developed young. This method is different from viviparous species like mammals because in mammals the developing young are connected to the mother via a placenta and receive nutrients directly from her. === Bioluminescence === Etmopteridae sharks are bioluminescent and produce from their ventral side. Unlike many bioluminescent marine organisms, Etmopteridae bioluminescence does not come from symbiotic relationships with bioluminescent bacteria, but from their own light-producing organs called photophores. The ventral side of the sharks contains many photophores. Each photophore contains several light-producing vesicles called photocytes and photophores also have an iris-like structure that may allow sharks to control the level of light they produce. Bioluminescence is used in counter-illumination and intraspecific social interactions. Without photophores, the underside of the sharks would be darker than the surface of the ocean above them, which would allow other organisms swimming underneath them to see the sharks‚Äô outline clearly. The photophores lighten the underside of the sharks, reducing the contrast between the shark and the ocean surface. This counter-illumination allows them to hunt prey more effectively and protects them from being seen by potential predators. Bioluminescence is used in social interaction because the placement of the photophores creates patters on the sharks. These patterns are specific to each Etmopteridae species, so it allows sharks to recognize members of the same species from far away (a maximum range of 700 meters was found). This is necessary when schooling together or finding a mate as the low levels of light would otherwise make locating each other extremely difficult. == Human interactions == Fringefin Lanternsharks have no importance to fisheries, but are sometimes bycatch of deepwater trawls. While no study has been done to determine the population status of E. shultzi specifically, there is evidence that the species has been negatively affected by the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A large area of fringefin lanternshark range overlapped with the area of the oil spill, but the species was not studied enough to accurately determine the effect of the oil spill on fringefin lanternshark population. ==References== Category:Etmopterus Category:Fish described in 1953 ","title":"Fringefin lanternshark"},{"id":"7453832","text":"Sokolce (, Hungarian pronunciation:) is a village and municipality in the Kom√°rno District in the Nitra Region of south-west Slovakia. ==Geography== The village lies at an altitude of 112 metres and covers an area of 19.422 km¬≤.

He is most famous for winning the 1968 Hardie- Ferodo 500 (now the Bathurst 1000), defeating both the Holden and Ford factory teams. ==Career== A reproduction of the Holden FE raced by McPhee in Appendix J Touring Car races in the early 1960s At the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500, McPhee drove a Holden Monaro GTS327 painted yellow with black stripes with the number 13. His co-driver, who drove just one lap that day, was Barry Mulholland. McPhee would later claim in Australian Muscle Car magazine that an attempt to sabotage his Monaro was made the night before the race. As the race cars were road registered in that era, McPhee had driven the car back to his motel in Bathurst for the night. When he came out on race morning to fill the car with petrol, a number of tree leaves floated to the top of the filler. Luckily this was found before any potential damage could have put the car out of the race. The Monaro, supplied and sponsored by Wyong Motors, ran the race on one set of used, almost bald tyres, McPhee believing that they were faster than tyres with full tread (race regulations at the time stated the cars had to race on road tyres). Towards the end of the race track marshals around the Mount Panorama Circuit were reporting seeing sparks from the Monaro's Michelin tyres as they had worn down to their steel belts after almost 500 miles (800 km) of racing. McPhee entered the 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 originally intending to run one of the new HT Monaro GTS350's, but when he received no help from Holden to do so he instead drove a privately entered XW Ford Falcon GTHO. Driving with Mulholland who again only drove one lap, the McPhee Falcon finished a close second at Bathurst to the Colin Bond/Tony Roberts HDT Monaro GTS350. Many, including HDT boss Harry Firth, believe that if not for an early pit stop to change a tyre after a clash with another car resulting in a late stop for fuel as they were out of sequence, McPhee and Mulholland would have won in '69 and made it back to back Bathurst 500's. McPhee joined the Ford works team in 1970, driving in the South Pacific Touring Series early in the year, and was given his own Phase II XW GTHO to drive solo at the 1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500. Even though his car was still running near perfectly at the end of the 500 miles, McPhee finished second after following team orders not to pass his teammate, lead driver Allan Moffat. As well as the 1968 outright win in the Holden Monaro, McPhee finished on the podium at Bathurst in 1963 (3rd) in a Ford Cortina Mk.I GT (the first year the race was run at Mount Panorama), 1965 (2nd) in a Ford Cortina Mk.I GT500, 1966 (3rd) in a Morris Cooper S, 1969 (2nd) in a XW Ford Falcon GTHO Phase I and 1970 (2nd) in a XW Ford Falcon GTHO Phase II. McPhee also claimed the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 pole position giving him the dual honour of being the first \\"Bathurst 500\\" race winner for Holden and the first \\"Bathurst 500\\" pole position winner for Holden. ==Personal life== McPhee lived the majority of his life on the NSW Central Coast until his death on 22 September 2009 at the age of 82. ==Career resultsComplete Bathurst 500/1000 results=== {  style=\\"font- size:90%\\" - !

She was married to Malacca's Sultan Mahmud Shah. ==Early life== Through her father's lineage, she is a descendant of both Tun Kudu and Tun Ali's marriage. According to Sejarah Melayu, both were prominent figures in the times of Sultan Muzzafar, the fifth Sultan of Malacca. Tun Kudu was initially married to Muzaffar, who divorced her so that she could marry Tun Ali. Only then would Tun Ali step down from his position as Prime Minister for the more effective Tun Perak, Tun Kudu's brother, to take his place. . ==First marriage To Tun Ali== Tun Fatimah was already married to her cousin, Tun Ali (not to be confused with their ancestor of the same name) when Sultan Mahmud set his sights on her to become his new wife. It is said that the Sultan was upset that Tun Mutahir kept the fact that he had a beautiful daughter away from the sultan and married her off to someone else. To add to the problem, many of the Sultan's courtiers felt alienated with Tun Mutahir who elected members of his clan to important posts in the Malaccan government. One of these courtiers was Shahbandar Raja Mudaliar, the Chief of Port of Malacca who allegedly started a rumour that Tun Mutahir was scheming to take over the throne. Tun Fatimah refused to divorce her husband when the Sultan's courtiers urged her to. This proved to be her ultimate undoing because it led to the execution of all of her male relatives in her family, including Tun Mutahir and also her first husband, Tun Ali. ==Second marriage To Sultan Mahmud== Tun Fatimah finally complied with the Sultan's wishes. She became his fifth wife. During her time as the royal consort, Tun Fatimah was said to have never smiled, and miscarried three times, perhaps due to emotional misery or even as a silent way of exacting revenge for the injustices committed by the Sultan against her family. She only started bearing children when the Sultan guaranteed her son will succeed him as ruler of Malacca. Fatimah eventually bore the Sultan two Princes and two Princesses. Mahmud had his eldest son, Ahmad Shah, with his first wife Tun Teja, who succeeded him while Fatimah's sons were still minors. ==Role as Queen of Malacca== As queen consort, Tun Fatimah made sure those who slandered her father and family were executed. She then went on to become the first Malay woman to lead her people like a charismatic sovereign queen. It is said that the Portuguese were more afraid of the Queen than her reigning Sultan husband. She was known to help the army to lead the Malays in their fight against the invading Portuguese forces in the early 16th century. Unfortunately, the Malays had later lost the war to the Portuguese army. According to Malaysian historians it was a sly foreign Datuk of Malacca who gave out the secrets to them to conquer the city, and thus had eventually made the Malays lost their control of it. Perhaps the fall of Malacca is also partly due to the Sultan's cruelty and disunity among Malaccans at that times. ==Post fall of Malacca== Ahmad Shah was deemed incompetent and was killed by Mahmud Shah himself in 1513 after a failed attempt to retake Malacca from the Portuguese. Mahmud Shah then reclaimed the throne, although by then the Malacca sultanate had been abolished, thus making him a pretender. Fatimah's eldest son, Muzaffar Shah I went on to establish a Sultanate in Perak region while her second son, Raja Raden Ali went on to become the second ruler of the Johor Sultanate as Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah for 36 years. After Malacca fell to Portugal in 1511, it seemed that it was mainly Tun Fatimah's work that expanded the new Malay Johor-Riau from Johore and the Riau islands to parts of Sumatra and Borneo. The Malaccan Sultan's power was almost restricted to a figurehead. Tun Fatimah created an alliance with neighbouring kingdoms by letting her children marry the royal families of Aceh, Minangkabau and Borneo. No one knows how long she had lived for, as well as when and where she died. However, fellow historians of the Malay Archipelago suggested that her tombstone is located in Kampar, Riau on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. == In popular culture == In 1962. Cathay Organisation produced a classic film Tun Fatimah Tun Fatimah was portrayed by Fasha Sandha in 2004 Rosdeen Suboh's theatre production of Bangsawan Tun Fatimah in Istana Budaya, Kuala Lumpur.

The article later formed the basis for his originally self-published book Ben-Gurion's Scandals: How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews. ==BiographyEarly life in Iraq=== Giladi was born Naeim Khalasch () on 18 March 1926 to an Iraqi Jewish family and later lived in Israel and the United States. Giladi describes his family as, \\"a large and important\\" family named \\"Haroon\\" who had settled in Iraq after the Babylonian exile. According to Giladi, his family had owned 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) devoted to rice, dates and Arabian horses. They were later involved in gold purchase and purification, and were therefore given the name, 'Khalaschi', meaning 'Makers of Pure' by the Ottoman Turks who occupied Iraq at the time. He states that he joined the underground Zionist movement at age 14, without his parents' knowledge and was involved in underground activities. He was arrested and jailed by the Iraqi government in 1947, when he was 17 years old. During his two years in Abu Ghraib prison, he expected to be sentenced to death for smuggling Iraqi Jews out of the country to Iran, where they were then taken to Israel. He managed to escape from prison and travel to Israel, arriving in May 1950. ===Experiences in Israel=== Giladi reports that upon entering Israel in 1950, he was \\"asked where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do,\\" and that he volunteered to go to Dafna, a farming kibbutz in the Galilee. He relates that he lasted only a few weeks because, \\"the new immigrants were given the worst of everything‚Ä¶the food was the same, but that was the only thing everyone had in common. For the immigrants, bad cigarettes, even bad toothpaste. Everything. I left.\\" After leaving Dafna, Giladi went to the Jewish Agency to seek reassignment. He says he was told to go to al- Mejdil, an Arab town about nine miles from Gaza, and now a part of Ashkelon, that was to be transformed into a farming community. When the officials at the Labor Office there discovered that he was fluent in Arabic, he relates that they encouraged him to seek employment with the Military Governor's office. He says he was assigned the task of procuring the signatures of the Palestinian inhabitants of al-Mejdil on a set of government forms that stated that they were willingly giving up their lands to go to Gaza, at the time under Egyptian occupation. He relates how he realised in short time that those Palestinians signing such documents were doing so under duress. He argues that they were denied the right to access their agricultural lands and penned up in a small area and so some signed simply to end their agony. He wrote, \\"Those Palestinians who didn't sign up for transfers were taken by force ‚Äì just put in trucks and dumped in Gaza.\\" He left the job disgusted and attempted to procure government work elsewhere. Giladi states he subsequently had difficulty finding employment because of discrimination against Arab Jews. He recalls that when he arrived in Israel, in May 1950, his Iraqi passport had his name as written in Arabic and transliterated using the Latin alphabet. Giladi states that because, \\"the English couldn't capture the \\"kh\\" sound‚Ä¶it was rendered simply as Klaski.\\" At the border, Israeli immigration officials applied what he calls the \\"English\\" version of his name, which had an Eastern European, Ashkenazi sound to it. Giladi writes that \\"in one way, this 'mistake' was my key to discovering very soon just how the Israeli caste system worked. After leaving al-Mejdil, he reports that he wrote letters trying to get a government job elsewhere and got many interviews, but when it was discovered that his face didn't match his Polish/Ashkenazi name, he was rebuffed, advised time and again that \\"we'll give you a call.\\" Eventually, he changed his name to \\"Giladi\\", which he writes was \\"close to the code name, Gilad, that he had in the Zionist underground.\\" While living in Israel, his views of Zionism changed. He writes that, he \\"was disillusioned personally, disillusioned at the institutionalized racism, disillusioned at what I was beginning to learn about Zionism's cruelties. The principal interest Israel had in Jews from Islamic countries was as a supply of cheap labor, especially for the farm work that was beneath the urbanized Eastern European Jews. Ben- Gurion needed the \\"Oriental\\" Jews to farm the thousands of acres of land left by Palestinians who were driven out by Israeli forces in 1948\\". Giladi relates that he became politicized after an experience at the Socialist/Zionist Party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and when he showed up at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the \\"Department for Jews from Islamic Countries\\" by many people who had not even looked at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he \\"was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out.\\" After serving in the Israeli Army between 1967 and 1970, Giladi was active in the Israeli Black Panthers movement. ===Life in the United States=== In the 1980s, he left Israel for New York City. In the U.S., he wrote about an autobiographical account and historical analysis of Zionist misdeeds in Iraq, Palestine, and later Israel in an article titled \\"The Jews of Iraq\\" The article later formed the basis for his originally self-published book Ben- Gurion's Scandal: How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews. He died on 6 March 2010, in a rehabilitation center in New York City after battling a lengthy illness, and was buried in the Jewish tradition by the Hebrew Free Burial Association. ==ControversyAnti-Zionism=== Giladi has strong views on Zionism and its negative effects and his article begins with the following passage: \\"I write this article for the same reason I wrote my book: to tell the American people, and especially American Jews, that Jews from Islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to Israel; that, to force them to leave, Jews killed Jews; and that, to buy time to confiscate ever more Arab lands, Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors. I write about what the first prime minister of Israel called 'cruel Zionism'. I write about it because I was part of it.\\" Giladi's position that the 1950‚Äì1951 Baghdad bombings were \\"perpetrated by Zionist agents in order to cause fear amongst the Jews, and so promote their exodus to Israel\\" is shared by a number of anti-Zionist authors, including the Israeli Black Panthers (1975), David Hirst (1977), Wilbur Crane Eveland (1980), Uri Avnery (1988), Ella Shohat (1986), Abbas Shiblak (1986), Marion Wolfsohn (1980), and Rafael Shapiro (1984). In his article, Giladi notes that this was also the conclusion of Wilbur Crane Eveland, a former senior officer in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who outlined that allegation in his book \\"Ropes of Sand\\". Alternatively, historian Moshe Gat argues that there was little direct connection between the bombings and the exodus of Jewish refugees. Gat questions the guilt of the alleged Jewish bombthrowers who were found guilty in an Iraqi court of having perpetrated one of the bombings. He cites a rumour that a Christian Iraqi army officer \\"known for his anti-Jewish views\\", was initially arrested for the crime, but was evidently not charged despite the large number of explosive materials matching those used in an earlier synagogue bombing that were allegedly found in his home. He further cites a long history of anti-Jewish bomb-throwing incidents in Iraq. Contemporary Israeli officials and mainly Mordechai Ben Porat and Shlomo Hillel, prominent figures at the Iraqi Zionist underground, vehemently deny the charges. An internal investigation conducted in Israel in 1960 found no proof of an order to execute such an attack. More possible responsible parties have been suggested, such as the Iraqi CID and the Muslim Brotherhood. There is however, little in the way of completely definitive evidence either way. Jewish studies scholar, Philip Mendes suggests that, \\"It therefore remains an open question as to who was responsible for the bombings,\\" claiming that \\"memories and interpretations of the events have further been influenced and distorted by the unfortunate discrimination which many Iraqi Jews experienced on their arrival in Israel (Black Panthers 1975:132‚Äì133; Shohat 1988; Swirski 1989; Massad 1996).\\" He does say, however, that Gat argues \\"convincingly\\" that there was \\"little direct connection between the bombings and exodus.\\". Historian Dr. Yosef Meir, a noted Iraqi Zionist underground operative, argues in a rebuttal article that while there is a direct connection, the culprits are the Iraqi government or Arab nationalists. He points to the fact that the bombings in question occurred after the Citizenship relinquishment act of 1950 had already expired and therefore no Jews could register for exit. He also notes that the two zionist operatives hanged were never charged with the masouda shem-tov bombing, but rather three unrelated bombings which occurred later. On the other hand, he lists the motives of the government and the pressure it exerted on \\"Near-East\\" (the company performing the airlifts). Yosef Meir's criticism points to circumstantial evidence that the Zionist movement had no motive while the Iraqi government and Arab nationalists did, and accuses Giladi of withholding this information on purpose, calling it \\"an obvious attempt to mislead readers.\\" Giladi also mentions Mordechai Ben Porat, a former Israeli Member of the Knesset, and a Cabinet minister, who was a key figure in the Zionist underground, as having been cited as one the figures responsible for the bombings by one of the Iraqi investigators into the bombings, in a book titled Venom of the Zionist Viper. Ben-Porat was one of several Israeli undercover Mossad agents arrested in Baghdad after the explosion; he was able to skip bail and flee to Israel.The Iraqi Jews and Their Coming to Israel, from The Black Panther 9 November 1972, cited in Uri Davis and Norton Mezvinsky, Documents From Israel 1967‚Äì1973: Readings for a critique of Zionism, Ithaca Press 1975, , p. 131 Mordechai Ben-Porat has vigorously denied this allegation, which he characterizes as akin to \\"blood libel\\", and which prompted him to write his 1998 book, \\"To Baghdad and Back\\". In it, Mordechai contends that the false charge against him was conceived at Iraq police headquarters. The affair has also been the subject of an anti-libel lawsuit by Ben Porat against a journalist who published Giladi's accusations. The lawsuit has been settled out of court with the journalist publishing an apology.The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948‚Äì1951 by Moshe Gat, p. 187 For his 2006 book Occupied Minds, British journalist Arthur Neslen interviewed Yehuda Tajar, a Mossad agent who spent ten years of a 25-year prison sentence in Iraq, after being convicted for the explosions. Tajar insists that, although his undercover cell was prepared to carry out such acts, they did not in fact do so. The actual explosions, he claims, were the work of the Muslim Brotherhood. After several members of the cell were arrested, however, those still at liberty carried out other grenade attacks, in an attempt to show the innocence of those arrested.Arthur Neslen, Occupied Minds: A Journey through the Israeli Psyche, Pluto Press 2006, , pp. 58‚Äì66. Giladi's article is regularly cited by anti-Zionists, including Jewish anti-Zionists, who claim that Zionism has a negative effect for Jews. Giladi also maintains a controversial stance regarding the Farhud, alleging that the British bear the bulk of responsibility as they instigated the event to blacken the image of the Rashid Ali government. ===Cover Banner: \\"This book banned in Israel and United States\\"=== Cover of Giladi's book. In 2003, Dandelion Books published a second edition of Gilad's book. The book is marked with a banner that reads, \\"Banned in Israel and the United States\\". The press release accompanying the book reads, \\"Banned in Israel and the United States‚Ä¶Dandelion Books, rapidly becoming known for its 'uncensored books and unfettered fiction' has just released a revised edition of this highly controversial book. The details of a direct ban enacted by either the American or Israeli governments are not supplied by the author or publisher. In the foreword of the book, Giladi writes that he did not submit a manuscript in Israel for fear of retribution. \\"Before,\\" he wrote, \\"one can publish a book in Israel, permission had to be granted by the censors.... When I was contemplating writing and publishing this book, two of my colleagues and well known Israeli journalists (Maxim Gilan and Samuel Mour) were arrested and put in jail for exposing the involvement of the Israeli secret police ... in the kidnapping in Paris of Mehdi Ben Barka ..., charged with crimes against national security and ... locked up for six months. Moreover, the Israeli media were gagged and not even allowed to mention that the two journalists had been arrested. If the authorities had wished, the two men would have been kept in jail for the rest of their lives.\\" Also in the foreword, Giladi writes that upon emigrating to the United States in 1980, he found several publishers interested in publishing his work. He says he declined to publish because all interested publishers wanted to reserve the right of editorial control over the finished manuscript and he did not want to agree to this. Twelve years after his arrival in the US, he self-published at a cost of $60,000, which he reports was almost all of the proceeds of the sale of his Israeli property. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:Mass media about the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict Category:Iraqi Jews Category:Iraqi writers Category:Iraqi emigrants to Israel Category:Jewish anti-Zionism in Iraq Category:Jewish anti-Zionism in Israel Category:Jewish anti-Zionism in the United States Category:Jewish socialists Category:American people of Iraqi- Jewish descent Category:Israeli emigrants to the United States Category:People from Hillah Category:2010 deaths Category:Arab Jews ","title":"Naeim Giladi"},{"id":"7454025","text":"Sv√§t√Ω Peter ( or Kom√°romszentp√©ter) is a village and municipality in the Kom√°rno District in the Nitra Region of southwest Slovakia. ==Geography== The village lies at an altitude of 138 metres and covers an area of 34.327 km¬≤.

Following the elections, a ministerial system of government was introduced, with Kamisese Mara of the Alliance Party as Chief Minister. Federation Party leader A. D. Patel became Leader of the Opposition. Under the previous membership system, Patel had held a portfolio. However, under the new system, the government was able to make unilateral decisions. When the Government made no effort to reform Fiji's electoral system, Patel moved a motion on 1 September 1967, calling for a new constitutional conference. When it became clear that the Government would use its majority to vote down the motion, the Federation members walked out of the Legislative Council. After the nine Federation Party members missed three consecutive sittings of the Legislative Council, their seats were declared vacant and new elections called. ==Campaign== A total of 18 candidates contested the nine seats. The Alliance Party and the Federation Party putting forward a full slate of nine, with no independents or other parties running. In the 1966 elections the Alliance had only contested three of the nine seats. All but one of the incumbent Federation Party MPs stood for the party again; the exception was M. T. Khan, who switched to the Alliance. He was replaced as the Federation Party candidate by Ujagar Singh, a teacher. Most of the Federation Party candidates were well-known and respected within the Indo- Fijian community. The Federation Party platform called for immediate independence (as a republic with an ethnic Fijian as president), a common roll electoral system, a bill of rights, the introduction of free education, free healthcare, a minimum wage, pensions and unemployment benefits, as well as nationalising key industries and providing subsidies for food. In addition to Khan, the Alliance candidates consisted of three lawyers, three teachers, a businessman and a travel agent. None of them had run in the 1966 elections and there was little respect for most of them from much of the Indo-Fijian population. Patel accused the Alliance of being \\"white colonialist dominated\\" and party spokesmen referred to Alliance candidates stooges for foreign companies. The Alliance campaign included a continued move towards self- government, move devolved decision making and better roads and communications. ==Results== The Federation Party candidates won all nine seats, with an increased majority in every one, whilst the Alliance candidates lost their deposits in two seats. Across the nine seats, the Federation Party received 46,960 votes (78.5%) and the Alliance Party 12,826 (21.5%).Fiji flare-up as Indians sweep back into opposition Pacific Islands Monthly, October 1968, p20 Voter turnout was 81%, a decrease from the turnout in the constituencies in the 1966 elections. { class= style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats - align=leftNational Federation Party46,96078.59 - align=leftAlliance Party12,82621.50 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes1,399‚Äì‚Äì - align=leftTotal61,1851009 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout75,97380.5‚Äì - align=left colspan=4Source: AnthonyJ.M.

A Twitter poll in 2014 saw Castle voted as Orient's greatest ever captain. He also played League football with Plymouth Argyle, Birmingham City, Gillingham and Peterborough United. Plymouth Argyle boss Peter Shilton was seeking a midfield general to rally his new-look squad following relegation from the second tier in 1992. On the advice of a scout, he took in a game at Brisbane Road and left at half-time, instructing Argyle director Denis Angilley to start negotiations as he had \\"seen enough\\" of his target. A ¬£225,000 transfer fee duly paid, Castle headed to Home Park and was promptly injured in a pre- season friendly. Argyle fans would have to wait until late October to see their new midfield marvel in meaningful action, but it turned out to be well worth the wait. He scored on his debut in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Wigan Athletic, and by season's end had notched up 12 more. He continued in a similar vein the following season as Argyle marched to the playoffs, bagging 16 goals by Christmas and eventually ending the campaign with 22. The undisputed highlight of his Argyle career (and one of his own personal highlights, incidentally) was a record-breaking hat-trick in a fine 3‚Äì2 win at Stockport County in December 1993. His three goals in six second-half minutes were an astonishing feat and one that confirmed his place as a firm favourite of the fans. Indeed, 'Super Stevie Castle' became Home Park's undisputed golden boy thanks to his barnstorming, all-action style and a left foot that developed an intimate relationship with the back of the net. Castle was named alongside his midfield partner Steve McCall in the all-time Argyle XI in a poll taken on the club's website in 2011. He was named in the PFA Second division team of the year for the 1993/94 season before transferring to Birmingham City in 1995. Castle joined Peterborough United on a free transfer as player-coach for the 1997‚Äì98 season, and over the next three seasons he played 122 senior matches and scored 20 goals winning the play-off final at Wembley in his final game. He moved to Leyton Orient on a free for 2000/01. In his final season at Orient Castle gained his UEFA 'A' coaching licence. Castle retired due to a persistent knee injury. ==Managerial career== In September 2006 he became assistant manager to Jimmy Quinn at Cambridge United. ===Royston Town=== On 13 December 2013 he became Royston Town manager with his first game in charge being the Boxing Day home fixture against top of the table Dunstable Town. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1966 births Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Living people Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:St Albans City F.C. players Category:St Albans City F.C. managers Category:Royston Town F.C. managers Category:Footballers from Ilford ","title":"Steve Castle"},{"id":"7454068","text":"Venus in Copper is a 1991 historical mystery crime novel by Lindsey Davis and the third book of the Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries series.Goodreads Set in Rome during AD 71, just after the year of the four emperors, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent.

There, Sabina Pollia informs him that all of the Hortensii (Crepito, Felix, Novus and their wives) live together in the one house. Novus is the only one currently unwed and he is due to marry Severina Zotica, but Sabina Pollia informs Falco that she believes Severina plans to murder Novus. Falco chooses to investigate Sabina's claims. At the same time he also begins to hunt for a new apartment in which to live. During the course of the investigation, Falco is once more arrested and imprisoned in the Latumiae by Anacrites, who then brings forth his charges regarding the lead ingots (from the two novels preceding Venus in Copper) to Titus but Falco persuades Titus to free him, provided he repays whatever is owed for the lead to Emperor Vespasian, and is asked to undertake more work for the Palace. Falco agrees to be available provided he is paid for previous missions that have already been completed. This is agreed to by Titus, who then presents Falco with a huge turbot, which vexes Falco as he not only has to investigate Severina‚Äîbut to find a suitable way of cooking the turbot as well! The arrival of the turbot becomes the cause of an impromptu party amongst friends and family of the Didii. Helena arrives, complete with baggage with which to move in with Falco, only to discover that she had not been invited to the party. Distraught, she attempts to leave, but is prevented by the arrival of another guest, who turns out to be none other than Titus and the Praetorian Guards, who have arrived to sample the fish. At the end of the party, Helena chooses to stay on with Falco. Returning to the house of the Hortensii, Falco discovers that Novus is dead in the privy after a banquet. He has been poisoned. Severina comes under suspicion, but Falco can find no real clue. Sabina wants to pay him off and considers him a failure, when the news arrives that Viridovix, the Hortensii's Gaulish cook, is also dead. He too was poisoned. Continuing to investigate, Falco is beaten up badly by thugs working for Appius Priscillus, a rival of the Hortensii, but is rescued and nursed back to health by Helena in their new apartment. When he finally recovers, he continues to investigate but returns only to see the apartment block in which they are living collapse. Believing Helena to be inside, Falco and others begin to dig. Helena arrives just as all hope seems lost. By a freak accident, Helena and Falco run into Cossus after helping to search for other survivors in the rubble, and after interrogating Cossus‚Äînow revealed to be an operative for the Hortensii‚Äîthey discover that the Hortensii owned Falco's apartment block. Cossus is lynched and crucified by an angry mob. All at once, Falco and Helena conclude that Severina poisoned Novus as revenge because a building owned by Novus had previously collapsed, killing her lover, and had (as Novus' representative) tried to demolish Falco's home to kill Helena out of romantic jealousy. Falco confronts Priscillus, the Hortensii women and Severina Zotica. Priscillus and the Hortensii women are revealed to have been planning to kill Novus (who was threatening to evict the other freedmen from the Hortensii business), but were beaten to him by Severina. Falco forces Priscillus to leave Rome, and blackmails the Hortensii into buying his silence by \\"donating\\" to a charity set up by Helena. As for Severina, Falco is unable to prove anything but Severina nevertheless doesn't go unpunished and is herself blackmailed into marriage by an inquisitive public servant who has managed to obtain evidence of her past misdeeds. Left with no home, Falco and Helena move back into Fountain Court. ==Characters in Venus in CopperFriends, enemies and family=== * Marcus Didius Falco ‚Äì Informer and Imperial Agent from the Aventine. * Helena Justina ‚Äì Daughter of the Senator Decimus Camillus Verus, and romantic interest of Falco. * Lucius Petronius Longus ‚Äì Member of the Vigiles and friend of Falco. * Anacrites ‚Äì Imperial spy. * Asiacus ‚Äì Gladiator and bullyboy for Smaractus * Decimus Camillus Verus ‚Äì Senatorial father of Helena Justina. * Famia ‚Äì Horse doctor and brother-in-law of Falco, married to Maia. * Gaius Baebius ‚Äì Brother-in-law of Falco, married to Junia. * Geminus ‚Äì Auctioneer. * Julia Justa ‚Äì Mother of Helena Justina. * Junia ‚Äì Sister of Falco * Lenia ‚Äì A Laundress. * Maia ‚Äì Sister of Falco * Rodan ‚Äì Gladiator and bullyboy for Smaractus * Smaractus ‚Äì Falco's Landlord. * Titus Caesar ‚Äì Eldest son of the Emperor. * Vespasian Augustus ‚Äì Emperor of Rome. ===Suspects and witnesses=== * Anthea ‚Äì Skivvy * Appius Priscillus ‚Äì Property mogul * Cossus ‚Äì A letting agent * Hortensia Atila ‚Äì Freedwoman and wife of Crepito * Hortensius Crepito ‚Äì Freedman and business partner of Novus * Hortensius Felix ‚Äì Freedman and business partner of Novus * Hortensius Novus ‚Äì A freedman, betrothed to Severina. * Hyacinthus ‚Äì Employed by the Hortensii * Lusius ‚Äì Praetor's clerk * Minnius ‚Äì Cake-seller * Sabina Pollia ‚Äì Freedwoman and wife of Felix * Scaurus ‚Äì Mason * Severina Zotica ‚Äì Suspect 'professional bride' with three deceased husbands. * Thalia ‚Äì Exotic dancer and snake charmer * Tyche ‚Äì Fortune-teller * Viridovix ‚Äì Gallic chef ===Death toll=== * Hortensius Novus ‚Äì Found dead on the privy after being poisoned. * Viridovix ‚Äì Poisoned * Cossus ‚Äì Crucified by the crowd ==Major themes== * The debut of Thalia, a very important recurring character in the Falco series. * Developing relationship of Marcus Didius Falco and Helena Justina. * An insight into the darker side of the real estate trade in ancient Rome. ==Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science== * Set in Rome in AD 71, during the reign of Emperor Vespasian. ==Adaptations in other media== * BBC World: Radio 4 starring Anton Lesser as Falco and Anna Madeley as Helena, with Tracey Wiles as SeverinaBBC Radio 4 Extra: Falco.

They make hallucinatory electronic soundscapes by mixing sampled and heavily synthesized sounds with acoustic arrangements for a variety of instruments including hurdy-gurdy, border pipes, duduk and clarinet. Their approach draws upon diverse forms, including acousmatic, drone music, sound collage, folk and progressive rock. ==Background== Thrower and Brown met in the early 1990s through their mutual association with Coil. Thrower joined Coil for their first album in 1984, he left in 1993 (having worked on the albums Scatology, Horse Rotorvator and Love's Secret Domain) and went on to form the experimental trio Identical, with Gavin Mitchell and Orlando. All three members of Identical worked as The Amal Gamal Ensemble, alongside other musicians including David Knight and Karl Blake of Shock Headed Peters. Thrower is also a film journalist and author of \\"Beyond Terror: The Films of Lucio Fulci\\" and \\"Nightmare USA\\". He appeared in several films by Derek Jarman including The Last of England and Imagining October, as well as co-writing the soundtrack to The Angelic Conversation. Ossian Brown worked with Coil from 1999 until the band‚Äôs cessation following the death of John Balance in 2004. Appearing on several albums, and performing live both as Time Machines and Coil at The Royal Festival Hall, The Barbican in London and numerous venues throughout Europe. He is also the author of \\"Haunted Air\\", a book featuring anonymous Halloween photographs from c.1875‚Äì1955. ==Music== The first Cyclobe album, Luminous Darkness (1999), veered between hard-edged electronic music, Musique concr√®te, Industrial, and acoustic interludes for piano, strings and woodwind. They were joined on several tracks by Calina De La Mare (violin) and Niall Webb (bass clarinet). Next came The Visitors (2001), again featuring De La Mare (violin), alongside Sarah Willson (cello) and Coil‚Äôs Thighpaulsandra (production). Although still assaultive at times, The Visitors developed a warmer, expansive sound, with lush atmospherics and harmonic complexity. A third album followed in the form of a collaboration with Nurse With Wound, called Paraparaparallelogrammatica (2004). Cyclobe took their ‚Äòremix‚Äô of a 40-minute Nurse With Wound composition to the extreme, mostly obliterating the original. With contributions from David Tibet of Current 93, and Coil members/collaborators Thighpaulsandra and Cliff Stapleton, the result was complex electroacoustic psychedelia, completely individual but very much in sympathy with Nurse With Wound's methods. Ossian Brown played on the Current 93 album \\"Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain\\" (2009). Stephen Thrower recorded \\"The Temporal Bends\\", a CD that was released in collaboration with David Knight under the name UnicaZ√ºrn, featuring a rare performance from the artist and musician Danielle Dax. In 2010 Cyclobe released the full-length album \\"Wounded Galaxies Tap at The Window\\" on Phantomcode records. On this album Ossian Brown and Stephen Thrower worked with guest musicians Thighpaulsandra, Cliff Stapleton, Michael J York and John Contreras. The albums centre piece being the 17 minute epic \\"The Woods are Alive with The Smell of His Coming\\", a track that was premiered at the Tate Gallery in St Ives. at the exhibition \\"The Dark Monarch - Magic and Modernity in Modern Art\\". The front cover artwork to \\"Wounded Galaxies\\" was created by the American artist Fred Tomaselli and the insert artwork by the artist Alex Rose. Alex Rose went on to create the front cover artwork for Cyclobe‚Äôs \\"The Eclipser/The Moths of Pre- Sleep\\" single which was also released that same year on Dot Dot Dot Music. Ossian Brown's first book \\"Haunted Air\\" was published in 2010 by Jonathan Cape, with an introduction by David Lynch and an afterword by Geoff Cox. In 2012 Cyclobe released \\"Sulphur-Tarot-Garden\\", soundtracks to three films by the film maker and artist Derek Jarman. This release was a limited edition CD to celebrate their debut live appearance in London at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, which also saw the premiere of these three films with Cyclobe's soundtrack. ==Live== Cyclobe's first live performance was held in Krems, Austria in April 2007 at the Donau Festival, curated by David Tibet from Current 93. Cyclobe's line up for this show was Ossian Brown, Stephen Thrower, Cliff Stapleton and Thighpaulsandra. On 4 August 2012 they made their second appearance performing at Londons Queen Elizabeth Hall as a part of the Meltdown Festival, curated by Anohni of Antony and The Johnsons. Their evening \\"Albion-Hynagogue-Ghost; Hallucinatory Queer British Paganism\\" also had performances from David Tibet and James Blackshaw's Myrninerest as well as screenings of rare super 8 films by Derek Jarman of which Cyclobe premiered soundtracks to three of his films, Sulphur, Tarot and Garden of Luxor. Cyclobe's line up for this concert was Ossian Brown, Stephen Thrower, Michael J York, Cliff Stapleton, Ivan Pavlov, Dave Smith and Antony Hegarty . Incorporating films and projected artworks by Fred Tomaselli, Anna Thew, Alex Rose and David Larcher.

In April 1927 President Relander caught a cold which developed into a life-threatening pneumonia. He had to go on sick leave, and Tanner became the Acting President.

It is thought to be caused by ischemic necrosis (death of tissue due to lack of blood supply) of minor salivary glands in response to trauma. Often painless, the condition is self- limiting and should heal in 6‚Äì10 weeks. Although entirely benign and requiring no treatment, due to its similar appearance to oral cancer, it is sometimes misdiagnosed as malignant. Therefore, it is considered an important condition, despite its rarity. ==Signs and symptoms== The condition most commonly is located at the junction of the hard and soft palate. However, the condition may arise anywhere minor salivary glands are located.Minor salivary glands are found in most mucosal surfaces in the mouth, apart from the front third of the hard palate, the front third of the dorsal surface of the tongue, and the attached gingiva. (see Hupp et al. 2013, p.395) It has also been occasionally reported to involve the major salivary glands. It may be present only on one side, or both sides. The lesion typically is 1‚Äì4 cm in diameter. Initially, the lesion is a tender, erythematous (red) swelling. Later, in the ulcerated stage, the overlying mucosa breaks down to leave a deep, well-circumscribed ulcer which is yellow-gray in color and has a lobular base. There is usually only minor pain, and the condition is often entirely painless. There may be prodromal symptoms similar to flu before the appearance of the lesion. ==Causes== The exact cause of the condition is unknown. There is most evidence to support vascular infarction and ischemic necrosis of salivary gland lobules as a mechanism for the condition. Experimentally, local anaesthetic injections and tying of the arteries is reported to trigger the development of tissue changes similar to NS in lab rats. Factors which are thought to cause this ischemia are listed below, however sometimes there is no evident predisposing factor or initiating event. * Trauma e.g. during intubation, or surgical procedures * Local anesthetic injection * Smoking * Alcohol * Diabetes mellitus * Vascular disease, (e.g. arteriosclerosis) * Pressure from a dental prosthesis * Allergy * Bulimia * Infection * Ionizing radiation ==Diagnosis== Differentiation between this and SCC would be based on a history of recent trauma or dental treatment in the area. Immunohistochemistry may aid the diagnosis. If the lesion is NS, there will be focal to absent immunoreactivity for p53, low immunoreactivity for MIB1 (Ki-67), and the presence of 4A4/p63- and calponin-positive myoepithelial cells. ==Treatment== No surgery is required. ==Prognosis== Healing is prolonged, and usually takes 6‚Äì10 weeks. The ulcer heals by secondary intention. ==Epidemiology== The condition is rare. The typical age range of those affected by the condition is about 23‚Äì66 years of age. It usually occurs in smokers. The male to female ratio has been reported as 1.95:1, and 2.31:1. ==History== NS was first reported by Abrams et al. in 1973. == Notes References External links == Category:Salivary gland pathology ","title":"Necrotizing sialometaplasia"},{"id":"7454226","text":"Vanessa Jean Dedmon (born 28 April 1987 in Braunfels, Hesse to Russell and Waltraud Dedmon) was a semifinalist on Germany's third season of Deutschland sucht den Superstar (the German Version of Pop Idol) being voted out by the audience in the Top 3 Show.

The group, which is based in New York City, was founded in 1986. GS Capital Partners has raised approximately $39.9 billion since inception across seven funds and has invested over $17 billion. On April 23, 2007, Goldman closed GS Capital Partners VI with $20 billion in committed capital, $11 billion from institutional and high-net-worth investors and $9 billion from Goldman Sachs and its employees. GS Capital Partners VI is the current primary investment vehicle for Goldman Sachs to make large, privately negotiated equity investments. In late 2019, Goldman's Chief Executive, David M. Solomon, announced that the firm would combine GS Capital Partners into one division with Goldman's other direct-investing units, such as the Special Situations Group and Growth Equity unit, called the Merchant Banking Division (MBD), to create a private equity powerhouse with $140 billion under management. ==History== Goldman Sachs has historically invested capital in a variety of businesses alongside its investment banking clients. In the early and mid-1980s, Goldman was a slow entrant into the financing of leveraged buyouts and junk bonds and preferred to focus on its traditional mergers and acquisitions advisory business. Beginning in 1983, however, Goldman began making longer-term equity investments in private equity transactions that came through its investment banking and other clients.GS Capital Partners V Closes at $8.5 Billion. PE Source, Apr 13, 2005 Goldman Sachs Capital Partners was founded in 1986, at the same time that similar groups were founded at other investment banks including Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking, Morgan Stanley Capital Partners and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners. Goldman established investment partnerships that allowed its clients to participate alongside the firm in private equity transactions. ===Investment funds=== Since 1992, GSCP has raised third party capital as well as investing on behalf of Goldman, its clients and its employees through institutional private equity funds. GSCP's third party investors include pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. As of the end of 2008, GSCP had completed fundraising for seven investment funds with total committed capital of approximately US$39.9 billion: {  - ! Fund ! Vintage Year !

However, in November the original transaction collapsed, when Burger King failed to meet certain performance targets. In December 2002, the consortium agreed on a reduced $1.5 billion purchase price for the investment. The consortium had support from Burger King's franchisees, who controlled approximately 92% of Burger King restaurants at the time of the transaction. Under its new owners, Burger King underwent a major brand overhaul including the use of The Burger King character in advertising.

SunGard  2005  GS Capital Partners was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. GSCP's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, TPG Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and The Blackstone Group. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. \\"Capital Firms Agree to Buy SunGard Data in Cash Deal.\\" Bloomberg L.P., March 29, 2005Do Too Many Cooks Spoil the Takeover Deal?.

Radala refers to a small minority caste in the Kandyan Kingdom of Sri Lanka. They were the Chiefs of the Kingdom of Kandy. The term Radala is coming from the combination of words Radh (meaning, \\"Royal\\") and Kola or Kula (meaning, \\"caste\\"), which literally means the royal caste. The word \\"Radala\\" came into existence after the throne of the Kingdom of Kandy went to the Nayak Dynasty. Higher officials in the court of Vira Narendra Sinha were offered this state and Nayakkara prince was selected as king over king's son by a local queen. After capturing the Kandyan provinces in 1815 with the aid of locals from both maritime and Kandyan provinces, the British created an extensive class of loyal 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory to assist them in the administration of that province. Traditionally, Radala was not a common term used for all officials of the state. In the Sinhala version of the Kandyan Convention of 1815, only the Adigars, Dissavas and a few others are called Radalas. The 19th century British rulers who created an extensive class of 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory were keen to call them an aristocracy to assist them with its administration. However Sri Lankan history shows that many Kandyan Radalas were civil and military officials of the court and considered aristocratic but not as direct heirs to the Kandyan throne. ==HistoryKandyan Kingdom=== A group of Kandyan Chiefs from Tennent's Ceylon, published in 1859. The offspring of Kandyan Kings from high cast concubines (yakadadoli) were those that were originally considered as Radalas. In addition to a chief queen and one or two secondary queens, Kandyan kings also had a Harem. Harem ladies from royal stock were called Randoli. Hindu princesses were brought over from Madurai in South India as Randolis, after the royal families of the maritime region in Sri Lanka converted to Christianity and were therefore no longer eligible. Ladies of the Radala castes were taken into the harem as Yakadadoli. Favorite concubines frequently received land grants and their offspring were appointed as high officials of the royal court and in a few cases inherited the kingdom. The status disparity between royalty and the Radalas was small and the Radalas only had to call themselves 'serviles' (gett√°s) in the presence of the king and prostrated only at ritual ceremonies to demonstrate their lower status vis a vis the king. This practice continued into the British period and was abhorred as a degrading form of ancient tyranny and abolished by the British in 1818 under the proclamation of November 21, 1818 by Governor Robert Brownrigg. Apart from having to continuously dress in full in the presence of the King, the Radalas didn't have to rise from their seats like other commoners when the king's dirty linen was taken past them (A Historical Relation of Ceylon, Robert Knox, Part II, Chapter2). They were permitted to use their own ancestral and military insignia, swords, umbrellas, jewellery and wear shoes. Some Chiefs were merely personal attendants of the King. The Diyawadana Nilame was the King's personal valet responsible for bathing and dressing of the King. The traditional Kandyan Radala of the past had considered themselves to be an exclusive caste and not part of the Govigama caste. Bryce Ryan observed as recent as 1953 that Radalas repudiated Govi connections and that the status of the Govi caste still remains relatively low in villages where the Radala existed (Caste in Modern Ceylon, page 99). The demand by the Kandyan Radala elite for a separate federal state in independent Ceylon, the representations made to the Donoughmore Commission and the formation of the Kandyan National Assembly (KNA) as recently as in 1924 demonstrates the reluctance of the Kandyan elite to be governed by arriviste low country Govigama families of dubious ancestry, which was to be the inevitable outcome of the British departure. The Radala's as a community had had significant power over the throne of Kandy. This was the case as the last Nayakar King of Kandy, Sri Wickrema Rajasinha lost his throne soon after losing the military and administrative support of the Radalas for his cruelty towards his subjects, and for his licentious forced affairs with their wives and daughters. ===The British Radalas=== A group of British appointed Kandyan chiefs, with Hon. J. P. Lewis, Government Agent in 1905. The chiefs have adopted the dress of traditional Dissawas by this time but still haven't started using other traditional insignia of high office such as jewelry, ceremonial daggers or footwear. A group of British appointed Kandyan chiefs, with a British Governor in 1905. After capturing the Kandyan provinces in 1815, the British soon created an extensive class of 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory to assist them with its administration. As much as the British created class of Sri Lankan Mudaliyars in the low-country, this class too was composed of natives who were most likely to serve the British, Govigama families that had either cooperated with the British to capture Kandy or from miscellaneous lower caste families that had joined the British cause later for financial purposes. They were all from anglicised families and were considered pillars of the Anglican church. They had English first names and their children too were similarly named. In addition they had a string of high sounding Sinhala names taken on when receiving their appointment from the British. Some of these names were from Kandyan families that had ceased to exist or were severely reduced, and from purported ancestors with dubious connections. The new British-made Radala class were immediately rejected by the original Kandyan Radalas. The new British-made Radalas tried unsuccessfully to rename themselves with the names of famous Kandyan Radalas such as the Keppitipolas, Mampitiyas, and Ranarajas. All these attempts were rejected by the British for fear of further dissent by the original Kandyan Radalas. Many of these 'New Radala' families had low- country origins and many intermarried with the anglicized low country Mudaliyar class, and in many cases several times with one family in an apparent bid to create some exclusivity. Most were from the Sabaragamuwa province and not from interior parts of the Kandyan provinces that were less susceptible to British influence. These New Radals too resembled English country squires and most of them had received large land grants from the British for their servitude. Their residences were of unprecedented scale, built in the 19th century in the British colonial style and were referred to by the Tamil word Walauu or Walvoo. They generally held 'Rate Mahattaya' or local administrator positions and had studied under leading Anglican Priests at the Anglican missionary schools S.Thomas' College, Trinity College (Kandy) and High school Ratnapura, which were institutions set up by the British specifically for producing a class of loyal, local, second level administrators. With each successive batch of British Civil Servants and Governors arriving in Sri Lanka, this propped up pseudo-aristocratic group tried harder and harder to generate a greater and higher appearance of nobility and Kandyan lineage. However the descendants of the original Kandyan Radalas rarely marry the descendants of British-made Radalas or any other Govigamas for that matter. If any of them do, those people and all their descendants are classified as lower-caste outcastes by the descendants of the original Radala community. ===20th century=== John Henry Meediniya Adigar with his family in 1905. Rear Centre (standing): his daughter, Alice, who married the low-country newspaper magnate D. R. Wijewardena in 1916. The marriage in 1910 to Kandyan 'New Radala' Mollie Dunuwila, newspaper magnate D. R. Wijewardena's marriage in 1916 to a Meedeniya and finally S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake's marriage in 1940 to Sirimavo Ratwatte appear to have muted some of the antipathy and created the common political power block that has ruled the country since independence from the British in 1948. The Radalas however are still relatively endogamous and even as at date would only rarely marry an average Govigama in an arranged marriage. ===Nilame=== Nilame word referred to the court officials. The names of the officials were given according to their position in each dynasty. Due to the development of language and change of requirements, the positions were changed and its names were changed. In Kandyan dynasty there are several officials in the court or \\"Raja wasala\\". They were Adigar and Dissava. ==Notable members== *William Gopallawa, MBE - First President of Sri Lanka and last Governor-General of Ceylon *Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike - Former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and first female Prime Minister in the world *Keppetipola Disawe - Leader of the Uva Rebellion *P.

If tumor is completely removed, post-operative radiation therapy is typically not needed since acinic cell is considered a low-grade histology. Post-operative radiation therapy for acinic cell carcinoma is used if: 1) margins are positive, 2) incomplete resection, 3) tumor invades beyond gland, 4) positive lymph nodes. b) Neutron beam radiation c) Conventional radiation d) Chemotherapy ==Epidemiology== Acinic cell carcinoma appears in all age groups, but presents at a younger median age (approx. 52 years) than most other salivary gland cancers. Occurrences in children are quite common. ==Acinic cell carcinoma of the lung== Acinic cell carcinoma of the lung is a very rare variant of lung cancer that, in this organ, is classified among the salivary gland-like carcinoma of the lung.

In 1773, Boswell enticed his English friend Samuel Johnson to accompany him on a tour through the highlands and western islands of Scotland. Johnson was then in his mid sixties and well known for his literary works and his Dictionary. The two travellers set out from Edinburgh and skirted the eastern and northeastern coasts of Scotland, passing through St Andrews, Aberdeen and Inverness. They then passed into the highlands and spent several weeks on various islands in the Hebrides, including Skye, Coll, and Mull. After a visit to Boswell's estate at Auchinleck, the travellers returned to Edinburgh. Johnson published his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland on 18 January 1775. It was widely read, discussed and criticised, especially for some skeptical remarks Johnson made questioning the authenticity of the Ossian poems, which were then all the rage. After Johnson's death in 1784, Boswell published his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. This work was based on a diary Boswell had kept during the 1773 tour and included detailed descriptions of where he and Johnson had gone and what Johnson had said. The Journal served as a teaser for the longer biography Boswell was preparing for publication, his Life of Samuel Johnson, which would exhibit the same qualities. Boswell's Journal and Johnson's Journey make an interesting study in contrasts. Johnson considers things philosophically and maintains a high level of generality. Boswell's approach is more anecdotal, even gossipy, and succeeds in large part because of Boswell's keen eye and ear for detail. Both accounts are still widely read and admired today. ==See also== *Scottish literature ==External links== *The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides at Internet Archive (scanned books color illustrated original editions) **The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 1936 edition, expanded from the original manuscript.

It can occur at any age and on a mucous membrane surface. The most common oral locations are on the gingiva of the mandible, tongue, and palate. It is a localized reactive proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. Giant- cell fibroma (GCF) is a benign non-neoplastic lesion first described by Weathers and Callihan (1974). It occurs in the first three decades of life and predominates in females (Houston, 1982; Bakos, 1992). Clinically, the GCF presents as an asymptomatic, papillary and pedunculated lesion. The most predominant location is the mandibular gingiva (Houston, 1982; Bakos, 1992). Histologically, the GCF is distinctive, consisting of fibrous connective tissue without inflammation and covered with stratified squamous hyperplastic epithelium. The most characteristic histological feature is the presence of large spindle-shaped and stellate-shaped mononuclear cells and multinucleated cells. These cells occur in a variety of lesions, such as the fibrous papule of the nose, ungual fibroma, acral fibrokeratoma, acral angiofibroma and desmoplastic fibroblastoma (Swan, 1988; Pitt et al., 1993; Karabela- Bouropoulou et al., 1999; Jang et al., 1999). Despite many studies, the nature of the stellated multinucleate and mononuclear cell is not clear (Weathers and Campbell, 1974; Regezi et al., 1987; Odell et al., 1994; Magnusson and Rasmusson, 1995). ==Diagnosis== PCNA and Ki67 immunoreactivity happens in case of fibroma and peripheral granuloma. ==References== * Kahn, Michael A.

The southern terminus of State Route 218 is at a T-intersection with State Route 217 approximately northwest of Athalia. Its northern terminus is at a T-intersection with State Route 7 about south of Gallipolis. ==Route description== State Route 218 travels through portions of Lawrence and Gallia. There are no segments of this state route that are incorporated within the National Highway System. ==History== When it was first established in 1924, State Route 218 consisted of the entirety of the current routing of State Route 553 from State Route 7 in Crown City northwesterly to its junction with State Route 218, and the current alignment of State Route 218 from the State Route 553 intersection northeasterly to its current northern terminus at State Route 7 south of Gallipolis. Two years later, the southern end of the highway was re-aligned. From its current junction with State Route 553, State Route 218 was routed southwesterly along a previously un-numbered roadway to what is now State Route 218's southern terminus at State Route 217. ==Major intersectionsReferencesExternal links== *State Route 218 Endpoint Photos 218 Category:Transportation in Gallia County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Lawrence County, Ohio ","title":"Ohio State Route 218"},{"id":"7454377","text":"The Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co- operation Scheme (PIC/S) are two international instruments between countries and pharmaceutical inspection authorities. The PIC/S is meant as an instrument to improve co-operation in the field of Good Manufacturing Practices between regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry. The PIC (Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention) was founded in October 1970 by the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), under the title of the Convention for the Mutual Recognition of Inspections in Respect of the Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products. The initial members comprised the 10 member countries of EFTA at that time. In the early 1990s it was realized that because of an incompatibility between the Convention and European law, it was not possible for new countries to be admitted as members of PIC. European law did not permit individual EU countries that were members of PIC to sign agreements with other countries seeking to join PIC. As a consequence the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme was formed on 2 November 1995. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme is an informal agreement between health authorities instead of a formal treaty between countries. PIC and the PIC Scheme, which operate together in parallel, are jointly referred to as PIC/S. PIC/S became operational in November 1995. == Members == Map of the members of PIC/S The following are the state members of PIC/S as of May 2020: {  - ! Country !! Participating entity !!

He served as the Prime Minister of the Alash Autonomy from 1917 to 1920, making him the first person in the history of Kazakhstan to hold such a position. == Early life == Alikhan Bukeikhanov was born on 5 March 1866, in Tokyrauyn Volost, Russian Empire. He was a great grandson of Barak Sultan, former khan of Bukey Horde. Bukeikhanov graduated from the Russian- Kazakh School and Omsk Technical School in 1890. He later studied at the Saint Petersburg Forestry Institute, where he graduated from the Faculty of Economics in 1894. During Bukeikhanov's youth, it is believed that he has been influenced by socialists. Upon graduating, Bukeikhanov returned to Omsk and spent the next fourteen years there working. From 1895 to 1897, he worked as a math teacher in Omsk school for Kazakh children. Bukeikhanov was a participant in the 1896 Shcherbina Expedition, which aimed to research and assess virtually every aspect of Russian Central Asia from the environment and resources to the culture and traditions of its inhabitants. This was the first of a few similar missions which he accepted. Among his recorded contributions were \\"Ovtsevodstvo v stepnom krae\\" (\\"Sheep-Breeding in the Steppe Land\\"), which analyzed animal husbandry in Central Asia. Bukeikhanov was the first biographer of Abay Kunanbayev, publishing an obituary in Semipalatinsky listok in 1905. In 1909, he published collection of Kunanbayev's works. ==Political life== In 1905, Bukeikhanov's political activism began when he joined the Constitutional Democratic Party. In late 1905 at the Uralsk oblast party congress, he tried to create the Kazakh Democratic party but failed. As a result of this action, he was arrested and prohibited from living in the Steppe Oblasts. During his exile, he relocated to Samara. He was elected to the State Duma of the Russian Empire as a member of that party in 1906, and signed the Vyborg petition to protest the dissolution of the Duma by tsar. In 1908, he was arrested again and was exiled in Samara until 1917. While in Samara, he participated in the Samara Guberniya Committee of the People's Freedom party set up in 1915. Akhmet Baitursynov, Alikhan Bukeikhanov and Mirjaqip Dulatuli in Orenburg in 1913. Semipalatinsk in 1918. In April 1917, Bukeikhanov, Akhmet Baitursynov and several other native political figures took the initiative to convening an All-Kazakh Congress in Orenburg. In its resolution the Congress urged the return to the native population of all the lands confiscated from it by the previous regime, and the expulsion of all the new settlers from the Kazakh-Kirghiz territories. Other resolutions demanded the transfer of the local schools into native hands, and the termination of the recruitment introduced in 1916. Within the group, Bukeikhanov sought to direct attention first to economic problems along with Russian liberals, chiefly the Kadets, whereas others sought to unite the Kazakhs with the other Turkic peoples of Russia. Three month later another Kazakh-Kirghiz Congress met in Orenburg. There for the first time the idea of territorial autonomy emerged, and a national Kazakh-Kirghiz political party was formed Alash Autonomy. Before the February Revolution, he collaborated with the Kadets in the hope of getting autonomous status for Kazakhs and contacted the head of the Russian Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky. Kerensky proceeded to make Bukeikhanov a commissar. On March 19, 1917, he was appointed as the Provisional Government Commissioner of Turgay Oblast. After the October Revolution, he was elected in 1917 as president of the Alash Orda government of Alash Autonomy. In 1920, after the establishment of Soviet hegemony, Bukeikhanov joined the Bolshevik party and returned to scientific life. His earlier political activities caused the authorities to view him with suspicion, leading to arrests in 1926 and 1928. In 1926, Bukeikhanov was arrested on the charge of counter-revolutionary activity and put into Butyrka prison in Moscow. But due to the lack of evidence in the criminal case against him, he was released from prison. In 1930, the authorities banished him to Moscow, where he was arrested a final time in 1937 and executed. It was not until 1989 that the Soviet authorities rehabilitated him. ==Writings== Bukeikhanov's major political publication was \\"Kirgizy\\" (\\"The Kazakhs\\") (1910), which was released in the Constitutional Democratic party book on nationalities edited by A. I. Kosteliansky. Bukeikhanov's other activities of this period include assisting in the creation of Qazaq, a Kazakh language newspaper and writing newspaper articles for newspapers including \\"Dala Walayatynyng Gazeti\\" (Omsk), \\"Orenburgskii Listok\\", \\"Semipalatinskii Listok\\", \\"Turkestanskie Vedomosti\\" (Tashkent), \\"Stepnoi Pioner\\" (Omsk) and \\"Sary-Arqa\\" (Semipalatinsk). He was also a contributor to Ay Qap and \\"Sibirskie Voprosy\\". ==ReferencesSources=== * * * ==External links== *The Geography of Civilizations: A Spatial Analysis of the Kazakh Intelligentsia's activities, From the Mid-Nineteenth to the Early Twentieth Century - - Category:1866 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from Karaganda Region Category:People from Semipalatinsk Oblast Category:Russian Constitutional Democratic Party members Category:Members of the 1st State Duma of the Russian Empire Category:Environmental scientists Category:Kazakh-language writers Category:Kazakhstani scientists Category:Members of the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples Category:Saint-Petersburg State Forestry University alumni Category:Executed politicians Category:Great Purge victims from Kazakhstan ","title":"Alikhan Bukeikhanov"},{"id":"7454384","text":"John Benson may refer to: * John Benson (announcer) (1928‚Äì1995), British television announcer and occasional actor * John Benson (artisan) (born 1939), calligrapher and stonecarver.

The story is based upon the legend of Alraune. In this version, the blasphemous sexual union causes the progeny (a daughter) to grow to adulthood quickly, behave in a sexually promiscuous fashion and cause the men who fall in love with her nothing but hardship, heartache and financial ruin, if not death. ==Plot== A wealthy Professor specializing in genetics is ambitious to conduct an experiment with a woman of \\"low social status\\", by impregnating her with a mandrake. The plant is believed by legend to sprout from the semen of hanged prisoners. He instructs his young nephew, Franz, to obtain a woman from the \\"scum of society\\". Franz reluctantly retrieves a prostitute, and the experiment is performed on her. The child from the experiment, Alraune, grows up to become a beautiful woman with a corrupted soul. The Professor adopts her as his daughter and sends her to a convent to study; she sneaks boyfriends into the convent and plays pranks on the nuns. Using her charm, she convinces a boyfriend to steal money from his parents and they elope together aboard a train. While eloping, Alraune attracts the attentions of a circus magician; he puts a mouse on Alraune's leg to surprise her, but she shows no fear. Her jealous boyfriend attacks the magician, leading to a scuffle. Meanwhile, on learning about the experiment, the Professor's nephew Franz is appalled and warns his uncle about the consequences of violating the laws of nature. They then receive the news that Alraune is missing from the convent. After months of searching, the Professor tracks Alraune to a circus, where she is performing as the magician's assistant but also flirting with the lion tamer. The Professor confronts Alraune in her dressing room. Afraid of his reprimands, she decides to leave the circus and return home with him. Alraune is happy for a time in her new life with her \\"father\\", who has fallen for her and wonders if her promiscuous nature is an effect of her mother's promiscuosity. However, when he forbids her marriage to a Viscount, she decides to elope, and that night she discovers the Professor's journal and discovers her origins. Angry at her \\"father\\" for having lied to her, she abandons the Viscount so that she can stay and seek revenge. Alraune continues to attract men and seduce the Professor, and finally reveals to him that she knows about her unnatural origins. He is delighted, as he has become obsessed; he writes in his journal that she either stays with him or he will kill her. The next night, the Professor and Alraune visit a gambling club. Alraune's affluent lifestyle has depleted the Professor's finances, and he asks her to join him at a gambling table, believing the legend that mandrakes give good luck. After a winning streak, Alraune leaves the professor mid-round and rushes home to pack her things and escape. The Professor loses his winnings and returns home to find Alraune packing. He begs her to stay, sell her remaining jewels for money and move to a new place where they can find happiness. She replies that she certainly will, but not with him. Enraged, the Professor grabs a knife and pursues Alraune around the house. Luckily, Franz arrives in time to stop him attacking her. Franz spirits Alraune away, leaving the Professor condemned to a life of loneliness and insanity. ==Cast== *Brigitte Helm as Alraune ten Brinken *Paul Wegener as Prof. Jakob ten Brinken *Iv√°n Petrovich as Franz Braun *Wolfgang Zilzer as W√∂lfchen *Louis Ralph as Der Zauberk√ºnstler *Hans Trautner as Der Dompteur *John Loder as Der Vicomte *Mia Pankau as Die Dirne *Valeska Gert as Ein M√§dchen von der Gasse *Georg John as Der M√∂rder *Alexander Sascha as Ein Herr im Coup√© *Heinrich Schroth as Ein Herr in der Bar ==Release== Alarune was first shown in Germany on 20 January 1928 in Berlin. In the American release prints, for some reason, the Alraune character was renamed \\"Mandrake\\" in the film. Brigitte Helm reprised the Alraune role again two years later when director Richard Oswald remade the film (with sound) in 1930. ==Critical reaction== From contemporary reviews In 1928, C. Hooper Trask of The New York Times wrote, \\"if you like this sort of thing you'll find it a superior product. Heinrich Galeen has directed with photographic imagination‚Äîno question that the picture has atmosphere\\" ; and of Brigitte Helm, \\"all the promises of \\"Metropolis\\" are here fulfilled. To the vampire gallery, which runs from Theda Bara to Greta Garbo, let me add the German Brigitte. She lacks Greta's delectable weakness but she gives in its place power and depth. A most engaging evening's display of erotics.\\" A review credited to \\"Trask.\\" in Variety stated that Galeen \\"squeezes all the horror juice out of [Ewers story], and Brigitte Helm, the vamp, is at least 200 percent.\\" proclaiming on Helm that \\"When will some American director take a look at this extraordinary fascinating girl. She has an individuality of her own.\\" From retrospective reviews, Troy Howarth noted that Brigitte Helm's performance in the film was \\"one of the most genuinely erotic of its time\\" and that Galeen should be \\"admired for approaching the material in such an adult and sophisticated manner....Alraune is, after his The Student of Prague (1926), easily his most impressive feature as director\\". In Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction, a reviewer referred to the film as the best of the five adaptations of Alraune, noting that Galeen allows for an \\"obsessive sexuality to suffuse the whole texture of the film with an intensity rarely equalled in the silent cinema (except perhaps in Murnau's Nosferatu)\\". == References References=== * * == External links == * * Category:1928 films Category:German black-and-white films Category:Films of the Weimar Republic Category:German science fiction horror films Category:German silent feature films Category:German films Category:Films based on German novels Category:Films based on works by Hanns Heinz Ewers Category:1920s science fiction horror films Category:Films directed by Henrik Galeen ","title":"Alraune (1928 film)"},{"id":"7454418","text":"A traumatic neuroma is a type of neuroma which results from trauma to a nerve, usually during a surgical procedure.

The poem is written in the voice of an old woman in a nursing home who is reflecting upon her life. Crabbit is Scots for \\"bad-tempered\\" or \\"grumpy\\". The poem appeared in the Nursing Mirror in December 1972 without attribution. Phyllis McCormack explained in a letter to the journal that she wrote the poem in 1966 for her hospital newsletter. This story was corroborated by an article from the Daily Mail on 12 March 1998, where Phyllis McCormack's son wrote that his mother composed it in the 1960s, when she submitted it anonymously with the title \\"Look Closer Nurse\\" to a small magazine intended just for Sunnyside. The next year, the poem was published in Chris Searle's poetry anthology Elders (Reality Press, 1973), without title or attribution. Subsequently, a wealth of urban legend has sprung up surrounding this humble work. Most of the legend associated with this poem attributes it to a senile elderly woman in a Dundee nursing home (or sometimes an Irish nursing home), where a nurse found it while packing her belongings following her death. Searle himself was quoted in 1998 as saying of the poem's authorship: \\"I don't think we'll ever know. I accepted it as authentic.\\" (i.e. as the authentic writing of an infirm old woman). The poem, which paints a rather sad picture of a decrepit woman's final days in care, has been quoted in various works written for and about the caring professions in order to highlight the importance of maintaining the dignity of the lives of elderly patients. It is also included in the Edexcel IGCSE English Literature poetry anthology.

It is also known as Abrikossoff's tumor, Granular cell myoblastoma, Granular cell nerve sheath tumor, and Granular cell schwannoma.)Granular cell tumors (GCTs) affect females more often than males. ==Pathology== Granular cell tumors show similarity to neural tissue, as can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural evidence using electron microscopy. Multiple granular cell tumors may seen in the context of LEOPARD syndrome, due to a mutation in the PTPN11 gene. These tumors on occasion may appear similar to neoplasms of renal (relating to the kidneys) origin or other soft tissue neoplasms. ==Treatment== The primary method for treatment is surgical, not medical. Radiation and chemotherapy are not needed for benign lesions and are not effective for malignant lesions. Benign granular cell tumors have a recurrence rate of 2% to 8% when resection margins are deemed clear of tumor infiltration. When the resection margins of a benign granular cell tumor are positive for tumor infiltration the recurrence rate is increased to 20%. Malignant lesions are aggressive and difficult to eradicate with surgery and have a recurrence rate of 32%. ==Epidemiology== Granular cell tumors can affect all parts of the body; however, the head and neck areas are affected 45% to 65% of the time. Of the head and neck cases 70% of lesions are located intraorally (tongue, oral mucosa, hard palate). The next most common location that lesions are found in the head and neck area is the larynx (10%).Kahn, Michael A. Basic Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Volume 1. 2001. Granular cell tumors are also found in the internal organs, particularly in the upper aerodigestive tract. Vaginal granular cell tumor is generally rare.

Culm leaves are deciduous with dense pubescence. Leaf blades are narrowly lanceolate. Flowering is not common, and there are no seeds. Fruits are rare due to low pollen viability caused by irregular meiosis. At the interval of several decades, the whole population of an area blooms at once,W. Arthur Whistler, Tropical ornamentals: a guide, pages 77‚Äì78, Timber Press, 2000, and individual stems bear a large number of flowers. Vegetation propagates through clump division, by rhizome, stem and branch cutting, layering, and marcotting.D. Louppe, A.A. Oteng-Amoako and M. Brink (edit.), Timbers 1 (Volume 7), PROTA, 2008, The easiest and most practised cultivation method is culm or branch cutting. In the Philippines, the best results were obtained from one-node cuttings from the lower parts of six-month-old culms. When a stem dies, the clump usually survives. A clump can grow out of stem used for poles, fences, props, stakes, or posts. Its rhizomes extend up to 80 cm before turning upward to create open, fast-spreading clumps. The easy propagation of B. vulgaris explains its seemingly wild occurrence. The average chemical composition is cellulose 41‚Äì44%, pentosans 21‚Äì23%, lignin 26‚Äì28%, ash 1.7‚Äì1.9%, and silica 0.6‚Äì0.7%. ==Taxonomy== The bambusoid taxa have long been considered the most \\"primitive\\" grasses, mostly because of the presence of bracts, indeterminate inflorescences, pseudospikelets (units of inflorescence or flower clusters and glumes or leaf-like structures in woody bamboos that is similar to spikelets or clumps of grassLondofo & Clark, \\"New Taxa of Guadua\\", botanicus.org\\"Spikelets\\", Biology Online), and flowers with three lodicules (tiny scale-like structure at the bottom of a florets or clump of grass flowers, found between lemma, the lowest part of spikelets, and sexual organs of the flower), six stamens, and three stigmas.Clark, LG, W Zhang, JF Wendel. 1995. A Phylogeny of the Grass Family (Poaceae) Based on ndhF Sequence Data. Systematic Botany 20(4): 436‚Äì460. Bamboos are some of the fastest growing plants in the world. B. vulgaris is a species of the large genus Bambusa of the clumping bamboo tribe Bambuseae, which are found largely in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, especially in the wet tropics. The pachymorph (sympodial or superposed in such a way as to imitate a simple axis) rhizome system of clumping bamboos expands horizontally by only a short distance each year.\\"Bamboo Biology ‚Äì Runners vs. Clumpers\\", Complete Bamboo, Bamboo Plant Information Resource The shoots emerge in a tight or open habit (group), depending on the species; common bamboo has open groups. Regardless of the degree of openness of each species' clumping habit, none of the clumpers are considered invasive.\\"Clumping Vs Running Bamboos\\", Tropical Bamboo New culms can only form at the very tip of the rhizome. The Bambuseae are a group of perennial evergreens in subfamily Bambusoideae, characterized by having three stigmata and tree-like behavior,Judd, WS, CS Campbell, EA Kellogg, PF Stevens, MJ Donoghue [eds.]. 2008. Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach, 296‚Äì301. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts USA. that are in turn of the true grass family Poaceae. ===Cultivars=== At least three groupings of B. vulgaris cultivars can be distinguished: * Plants with green stems * Golden bamboo (plants with yellow stems): Plants always with yellow stems and often with green stripes of different intensity. Usually the stems have thicker walls than those of the green stem group. This group is often distinguished as Bambusa vulgaris var. striata. * Buddha's belly bamboo: Plants with stems up to about tall, in diameter, green, with -long inflated internodes in the lower part. This group is often distinguished as B. v. var. wamin. The more common cultivars are:Laurence Hatch, Cultivars of Woody Plants (Volume I: A-G), section Bambusa, TCR Press, 2007, * 'Aureovariegata' (B. v. var. aureovariegata Beadle): With rich golden yellow culms striped in green, sometimes in very thin lines, it is the most common variety of B. vulgaris. * 'Striata' (Bambusa vulgaris var. striata (Lodd. ex Lindl.) Gamble): A common variety, smaller in size than other varieties, with bright yellow internodes and random markings with longitudinal stripes in light and deep green. * 'Wamin' (B. v. f. waminii T.H.Wen): It is smaller in size than other varieties with short and flattened internodes. Likely to have originated in South China, 'Wamin' bamboo is spread throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Basally inflated internodes give it a unique appearance.Bamboo The Amazing Grass, page 44, Bioversity International * 'Vittata' (B. v. f. vittata (Rivi√®re & C.Rivi√®re) McClure): A common variety that grows up to tall, it has barcode-like striping in green. * 'Kimmei': Culms yellow, striped with green * 'Maculata': Green culms mottled with black, turning mostly black with aging * 'Wamin Striata': Grows up to tall, light green striped in dark green, with swollen lower internodes ==Distribution and habitat== B. vulgaris at the S√£o Paulo's Botanical Garden, SP, Brazil Common bamboo is the most widely grown bamboo throughout the tropics and subtropics. Although mostly known only from cultivation, spontaneous (nondomesticated), escaped, and naturalized populations exist throughout the tropics and subtropics in and outside Asia. B. vulgaris is widely cultivated in East, Southeast, and South Asia, as well as tropical Africa including Madagascar. It is highly concentrated in the Indomalayan rainforests. The species is one of the most successful bamboos in Pakistan, Tanzania, and Brazil.Maxim Lobovikov, Lynn Ball and Mar√≠a Guardia, World bamboo resources, pages 13‚Äì18, Food and Agriculture Organization, 2007, Popular as a hothouse plant by the 1700s, it was one of the earliest bamboo species introduced into Europe. It is believed to have been introduced to Hawaii in the time of Captain James Cook (the late 18th century), and is the most popular ornamental plant there.Horace Freestone Clay, James C. Hubbard and Rick Golt, Tropical Exotics, page 10, University of Hawaii Press, 1987, B. vulgaris is widely cultivated in the USA and Puerto Rico, apparently since introduction by Spaniards in 1840. It may have been the first foreign species introduced into the United States by Europeans.Ted Jordan Meredith, Timber Press pocket guide to bamboos, page 49, Timber Press, 2009, ==Ecology== The specimen at Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), Veluppadam, Kerala B. vulgaris grows mostly on river banks, road sides, wastelands, and open ground, generally in the low altitudes. It is a preferred species for erosion control. It grows best under humid conditions, but can tolerate unfavorable conditions like low temperatures and drought. Though adoptable to a wide range of soils, common bamboo grows more vigorously on moist soils. It can tolerate frost down to , and can grow on ground up to above sea level, though in higher altitudes stems grow shorter and thinner. In extreme droughts, it may defoliate completely. ===Pests=== The two major threats to the species are small bamboo borers (Dinoderus minutus), which as adults bore stems in India, China, Philippines, Australia, and Japan, and bamboo weevils (Cyrtotrachelus longimanus), which destroy shoots during their larval stage in South China.D. S. Hill, Pests of Crops in Warmer Climates and Their Control, page 517, Springer, 2008, Other pests include leaf blight (Cercospora), basal culm rot (Fusarium), culm sheath rot (Glomerella cingulata), leaf rust (Kweilingia divina), and leaf spots (Dactylaria). In Bangladesh, bamboo blight caused by Sarocladium oryzae is a serious disease. ==Uses== Common bamboo has a wide variety of uses, including the stems used as fuel and the leaves used as fodder, though a large amount of ingestion of leaves is known to cause neurological disorder among horses. The worldwide production and trade of B. vulgaris is considerable, though no statistics are available. It also has some disadvantages. Working and machining properties of the stems are poor, as they are not straight, not easy to split, and not flexible, but they are thick- walled and initially strong. Because of high carbohydrate content, stems are susceptible to attacks from fungi and insects such as powderpost beetles. Protection from biological threats is essential for long-term use. B. v. var. striata is used as ornamental solitary or as border hedge. Its shoots boiled in water are sometimes used for medicinal qualities. Cultivated around the world, it is generally found in East, Southeast, and South Asia. B. v. f. waminii is cultivated in the US and Europe in addition to Asia. B. v. f. vittata is the most popular variety as an ornamental plant, and is considered to be very beautiful. The 'Kimmei' cultivar is mostly cultivated in Japan. ===Ornamental=== It is widely used as an ornamental plant, and is very popular as that.Ernest Braunton, The Garden Beautiful in California, page 50, Applewood Books, 2008, It often is planted as fences and border hedges.Najma Dharani, Field guide to common trees & shrubs of East Africa, page 198, Struik, 2002, It is also planted a measure for erosion control. ===Construction=== The stems or culms of B. vulgaris are used for fencing and construction, especially of small, temporary shelters, including flooring, roof tiles, panelling, and walls made wither with culms or split stems. The culm is used to make many parts of boats including masts, rudders, outriggers, and boating poles. It also is used to make furniture, basketry, windbreakers, flutes, fishing rods, tool handles, stakes, weapons, bows for fishing nets, smoking pipes, irrigation pipes, distillation pipes, and more. It is used as raw material for paper pulp, especially in India. Paper made from B. vulgaris has exceptional tear strength, comparable to paper made of softwood. It can also be used to make particle boards and flexible packaging grade paper. ===Food=== Young shoots of the plant, cooked or pickled, are edible and eaten throughout Asia. Yellow shoots remain buttercup yellow after cooking. A decoction of the growing tips is mixed with Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi) to make a refreshing drink in Mauritius. The shoots are tender and whitish pink, and have a fair canning quality. A serving of young shoots of green-stem cultivars has 90 g of water, 2.6 g of protein, 4.1 g of fat, 0.4 g of digestible carbohydrates, 1.1 g of insoluble dietary fiber, 22.8 mg of calcium, 37 mg of phosphorus, 1.1 mg of iron, and 3.1 mg of ascorbic acid. A serving of young shoots of yellow-stem cultivars has 88 g of water, 1.8 g of protein, 7.2 g of fat, 0.0 g of digestible carbohydrates, 1.2 grams of insoluble fiber, 28.6 mg of calcium, 27.5 mg of phosphorus, and 1.4 mg of iron. === Indigenous medicine === Golden bamboo is considered in many traditions across Asia to have medicinal value. Many uses are found in herbal medicine, though the effects are not clinically proven. In Java, water stored in golden bamboo tubes is used as a cure of various diseases. In the Congo, its leaves are used as part of a treatment against measles; in Nigeria, an infusion of macerated leaves is taken against sexually transmitted diseases and as an abortifacient ‚Äì the latter has been shown to work in rabbits.MT Yakubu and BB Bukoye, \\"Abortifacient potentials of the aqueous extract of Bambusa vulgaris leaves in pregnant Dutch rabbits\\", PubMed, National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine ==Cultivation== Though not suited for small yards, as it grows in large clumps, young plants of golden bamboo can be grown in large containers.Arthur Van Langenberg and Ip Kung Sau, Urban gardening: a Hong Kong gardener's journal, page 38, Chinese University Press, 2006, Golden bamboo grows well in full sunlight or partial shade. Protection is important, as animals often graze on young shoots. In Tanzania, management of B. vulgaris cultivation entails clearing of the ground around clumps. ==Toxicity== Among all bamboos, only shoots of B. vulgaris contains taxiphyllin (a cyanogenic glycoside) that functions as an enzyme inhibitor in the human body when released,Christopher P. Holstege, Thomas Neer, Gregory B. Saathoff, M.D. and Brent Furbee, Criminal Poisoning: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives, page 65, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2010, but degrades readily in boiling water.I Hunter and Feng‚Äôe Yang, \\"Cyanide in Bamboo Shoots \\", WHO Food Additives Series 30, International Network for Bamboo and Rattan It is highly toxic, and the lethal dose for humans is about 50‚Äì60 mg.S.Satya, L.M.

It designs, and manufactures manual arc welding equipment, welding safety equipment and software, and comprehensive automated welding solutions. It also provides expert services in this field. In 2019, Kemppi had subsidiaries in 16 countries in addition to Finland. It employed over 800 people, half of them in Lahti city where the company also has its headquarters. In 2013 Kemppi's electronics factory was the largest in Finland. Kemppi's main business areas are Europe and Asia. ==History1949-1999=== The electrician Martti Kemppi founded a small repair shop in 1949. The workshop was located in the outbuilding of his home, initially producing concrete carts, milk carts, sauna stoves and welding transformers. In the 1950s, the company began to focus on welding equipment and developed its first welding rectifier. Kemppi's export business began in 1955, supplying 20 welding machines to Turkey. Veljekset Kemppi Oy started manufacturing welding rectifiers, which were manufactured by only two companies worldwide. In the 1960s, Kemppi developed its first MIG/MAG welding machine in addition to a thyristor-controlled rectifier. In the mid-1960s, the company manufactured 50% of Finnish welding transformers and various electrical equipment for industry. Kemppi exported to 30 countries. In 1968 the name of the company was shortened to Kemppi Oy. At the end of the decade, a thyristor controlled Tylarc power supply was introduced. The first subsidiary was established in Sweden in 1972. In 1977 Kemppi introduced the world's first inverter power supply for welding which revolutionized arc welding. The Hilarc inverter family was introduced at Essen welding exhibition. In 1980, Martti Kemppi's son Jouko Kemppi was appointed CEO. The company employed over 650 people. During the 1980s, the company established subsidiaries in several countries in Europe. Kemppi introduced new, lighter and more compact Multisystem industrial inverters. In 1993, Kemppi launched the world's first digital welding power source called Kemppi Pro. Kemppi launched the Mastertig AC/DC welding equipment using the latest digital control technology. ===2000‚Äì2013=== In the early 2000s, CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, ordered Kemppi and its subsidiary Kempower to supply 200 special power supplies to its new LHC particle accelerator. In 2005, Kemppi's net sales increased by approximately 13 percent to EUR 88 million. The company was debt-free and invested in product development, which employed nearly 10 percent of the employees. The company was one of the leaders in welding, both in technology and in sales and marketing, with subsidiaries in 15 countries, Australia being the furthest away. In 2007, Kemppi Capital, the parent company of Kemppi Oy, announced investing approximately EUR 10 million in a new industrial property to be built in Lahti and an extension of 5 million in its existing industrial property. The company had a turnover of EUR 120 million and exported about 90% of its production. Kemppi had two production units in Finland and 730 employees, 135 of whom worked abroad. In 2011, Kemppi opened its first foreign production plant in India. === 2014‚Äìpresent === Teresa Kemppi-Vasama and her cousin Antti Kemppi took over the management of the family business in 2014, when Kemppi-Vasama became Chairman of Kemppi Oy and Kemppi became Chairman of Kemppi Group Oy. Kemppi wanted to be a forerunner in the Industrial Internet of things. It introduced the first universal welding production management software. Kemppi acquired software expertise through acquisitions, JPP-Soft in Lahti and Weldindustry in Norway. In 2015, the company's net sales were EUR 114 million, of which approximately 60 per cent came from Europe. Asia was the second largest market area. In Asia, Kemppi had subsidiaries in China, Malaysia and India, where the Chennai assembly plant was also located. In Singapore, the company had a logistics center operated by a subcontractor. In 2018, Kemppi relocated the production operations of Chennai to Lahti, Finland, where approximately 100,000 welding machines are manufactured each year. Kemppi had a turnover of more than 120 million and over 600 employees. In 2019, Kemppi acquired the Italian torch manufacturer Trafimet Group, which had been operating in the welding industry for over 40 years. The company had a turnover of more than EUR 30 million and more than 200 employees. Trafimet continues to operate under its own brand and owns the brands Trafimet, Sacit and Ferro. Kemppi concentrated its torch and welding gun production in Wuxi, China, as most of its supplier network is located in China. The factory employs about 70 people. Kemppi opened new robotic welding application centers in India and China. They improve interaction with end-users and system vendors. ==Organisation== Kemppi employed more than 800 people at the end of 2019, about half of whom were in Lahti, which also has its corporate headquarters, R&D; department and assembly and electronics factory. The company has production plants in Lahti region, Finland.Bloomberg company overview for Kemppi Oy 80 percent of Kemppi's sales comes from the dealer network.

Autumn leaf color is a phenomenon that affects the normal green leaves of many deciduous trees and shrubs by which they take on, during a few weeks in the autumn season, various shades of yellow, orange, red, purple, and brown. The phenomenon is commonly called autumn colours or autumn foliage in British English and fall colors, fall foliage, or simply foliage in American English. In some areas of Canada and the United States, \\"leaf peeping\\" tourism is a major contribution to economic activity. This tourist activity occurs between the beginning of color changes and the onset of leaf fall, usually around September and October in the Northern Hemisphere and April to May in the Southern Hemisphere. ==Chlorophyll and the green/yellow/orange colors== A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green. In this leaf, the veins are still green, while the other tissue is turning red. This produces a fractal-like pattern Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide. These sugars are the basis of the plant's nourishment the sole source of the carbohydrates needed for growth and development. In their food-manufacturing process, the chlorophylls break down, thus are being continually \\"used up\\". During the growing season, however, the plant replenishes the chlorophyll so that the supply remains high and the leaves stay green. As autumn approaches, with daylight hours shortening and temperatures cooling, the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off as a layer of special cork cells forms at the base of each leaf. As this cork layer develops, water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. During this time, the amount of chlorophyll in the leaf begins to decrease. Often, the veins are still green after the tissues between them have almost completely changed color. Much chlorophyll is in photosystem II (light-harvesting complex II or LHC II), the most abundant membrane protein on earth. LHC II captures light in photosynthesis. It is located in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast and it is composed of an apoprotein along with several ligands, the most important of which are chlorophylls a and b. In the autumn, this complex is broken down. Chlorophyll degradation is thought to occur first. Research suggests that the beginning of chlorophyll degradation is catalyzed by chlorophyll b reductase, which reduces chlorophyll b to 7‚Äëhydroxymethyl chlorophyll a, which is then reduced to chlorophyll a. This is believed to destabilize the complex, at which point breakdown of the apoprotein occurs. An important enzyme in the breakdown of the apoprotein is FtsH6, which belongs to the FtsH family of proteases. Chlorophylls degrade into colorless tetrapyrroles known as nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites. As the chlorophylls degrade, the hidden pigments of yellow xanthophylls and orange beta-carotene are revealed. These pigments are present throughout the year, but the red pigments, the anthocyanins, are synthesized de novo once roughly half of chlorophyll has been degraded. The amino acids released from degradation of light harvesting complexes are stored all winter in the tree's roots, branches, stems, and trunk until the next spring, when they are recycled to releaf the tree. ==Pigments that contribute to other colorsCarotenoids=== Cross-section of a leaf showing color changes Carotenoids are present in leaves the throughout the year, but their orange-yellow colors are usually masked by green chlorophyll. As autumn approaches, certain influences both inside and outside the plant cause the chlorophylls to be replaced at a slower rate than they are being used up. During this period, with the total supply of chlorophylls gradually dwindling, the \\"masking\\" effect slowly fades away. Then other pigments present (along with the chlorophylls) in the leaf's cells begin to show through. These are carotenoids and they provide colorations of yellow, brown, orange, and the many hues in between. The carotenoids occur, along with the chlorophyll pigments, in tiny structures called plastids, within the cells of leaves. Sometimes, they are in such abundance in the leaf that they give a plant a yellow-green color, even during the summer. Usually, however, they become prominent for the first time in autumn, when the leaves begin to lose their chlorophyll. Carotenoids are common in many living things, giving characteristic color to carrots, corn, canaries, and daffodils, as well as egg yolks, rutabagas, buttercups, and bananas. Their brilliant yellows and oranges tint the leaves of such hardwood species as hickories, ash, maple, yellow poplar, aspen, birch, black cherry, sycamore, cottonwood, sassafras, and alder. Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in coloration of about 15-30% of tree species. ===Anthocyanins=== Typical fall foliage in red maple country, in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York English country lane in the autumn Different stages of foliage colors Maple tree Late autumn with brown dominating The reds, the purples, and their blended combinations that decorate autumn foliage come from another group of pigments in the cells called anthocyanins. Unlike the carotenoids, these pigments are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer. They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced. During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll, but in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop. Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries, red apples, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and plums. Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas most famously northern New England up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment. In autumn forests, they appear vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry trees, and persimmons. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. ===Cell walls=== The brown color of leaves is not the result of a pigment, but rather cell walls, which may be evident when no coloring pigment is visible. ==Function of autumn colors== Deciduous plants were traditionally believed to shed their leaves in autumn primarily because the high costs involved in their maintenance would outweigh the benefits from photosynthesis during the winter period of low light availability and cold temperatures. In many cases, this turned out to be oversimplistic other factors involved include insect predation, water loss, and damage from high winds or snowfall. Anthocyanins, responsible for red-purple coloration, are actively produced in autumn, but not involved in leaf-drop. A number of hypotheses on the role of pigment production in leaf-drop have been proposed, and generally fall into two categories: interaction with animals, and protection from nonbiological factors. ===Photoprotection=== American sweetgum at Keokea, Maui, develop bold fall colors in subtropical or tropical areas. According to the photoprotection theory, anthocyanins protects the leaf against the harmful effects of light at low temperatures. The leaves are about to fall, so protection is not of extreme importance for the tree. Photo-oxidation and photoinhibition, however, especially at low temperatures, make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient. By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins, according to the photoprotection theory, the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients (especially nitrogen) more efficiently. ===Coevolution=== According to the coevolution theory, the colors are warning signals to insects like aphids that use trees as a host for the winter. If the colors are linked to the amount of chemical defenses against insects, then the insects will avoid red leaves and increase their fitness; at the same time, trees with red leaves have an advantage because they reduce their parasite load. This has been shown in the case of apple trees where some domesticated apple varieties, unlike wild ones, lack red leaves in autumn. A greater proportion of aphids that avoid apple trees with red leaves manage to grow and develop compared to those that do not. A trade-off, moreover, exists between fruit size, leaf color, and aphids resistance as varieties with red leaves have smaller fruits, suggesting a cost to the production of red leaves linked to a greater need for reduced aphid infestation. Consistent with red-leaved trees providing reduced survival for aphids, tree species with bright leaves tend to select for more specialist aphid pests than do trees lacking bright leaves (autumn colors are useful only in those species coevolving with insect pests in autumn). The coevolution theory of autumn colors was proposed by W. D. Hamilton in 2001 as an example of evolutionary signalling theory. With biological signals such as red leaves, it is argued that because they are costly to produce, they are usually honest, so signal the true quality of the signaller with low-quality individuals being unable to fake them and cheat. Autumn colors would be a signal if they are costly to produce, or be impossible to fake (for example if autumn pigments were produced by the same biochemical pathway that produces the chemical defenses against the insects). The change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help to undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Many plants with berries attract birds with especially visible berry and/or leaf color, particularly bright red. The birds get a meal, while the shrub, vine, or typically small tree gets undigested seeds carried off and deposited with the birds' manure. Poison ivy is particularly notable for having bright-red foliage drawing birds to its off-white seeds (which are edible for birds, but not most mammals). ===Allelopathy=== The brilliant red autumn color of some species of maple is created by processes separate from those in chlorophyll breakdown. When the tree is struggling to cope with the energy demands of a changing and challenging season, maple trees are involved in an additional metabolic expenditure to create anthocyanins. These anthocyanins, which create the visual red hues, have been found to aid in interspecific competition by stunting the growth of nearby saplings (allelopathy).(Frey & Eldridge, 2005) ==Tourism== Hodaka Mountains in Japan The town of Stirling, South Australia, located in the Adelaide Hills, attracts many tourists during autumn. A variety of colors around T≈çfuku-ji temple in Kyoto, Japan Although some autumn coloration occurs wherever deciduous trees are found, the most brightly colored autumn foliage is found in the northern hemisphere, with region that include: most of southern mainland Canada; some areas of the northern United States; Northern, and Western Europe north of the Alps; the Caucasus region of Russia near the Black Sea; and Eastern Asia (including much of northern and eastern China, and as well as Korea and Japan). In the southern hemisphere, colorful autumn foliage can be observed in: southern and central Argentina; the south and southeast regions of Brazil; southeastern Australia (including Tasmania); and much of New Zealand (particularly South Island). ==Climate influences== Fall foliage peak times in the United States Compared to Western Europe, North America provides many more arbor species (more than 800 species and about 70 oaks, compared to 51 and three, respectively, in Western Europe)Heinz Ellenberg, H. Ellenberg: Vegetation Mitteleuropas mit den Alpen: In √∂kologischer, dynamischer und historischer Sicht, UTB, Stuttgart; 5th edition, in German, , 1996 which adds many more different colors to the spectacle. The main reason is the different effect of the Ice ages while in North America, species were protected in more southern regions along north‚Äìsouth ranging mountains, this was not the case in Europe. Global warming and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may delay the usual autumn spectacle of changing colors and falling leaves in northern hardwood forests in the future, and increase forest productivity. Experiments with poplar trees showed that they stayed greener longer with higher CO2 levels, independent of temperature changes. However, the experiments over two years were too brief to indicate how mature forests may be affected over time. Also, other factors, such as increasing ozone levels close to the ground (tropospheric ozone pollution), can negate the beneficial effects of elevated carbon dioxide. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Autumnal tints by Henry David Thoreau *Identifying Common trees in Autumn by their colors * Leaf songs Category:Plant physiology Category:Leaves Category:Pigmentation ","title":"Autumn leaf color"},{"id":"7454571","text":"Pikva is a village in Anija Parish, Harju County in northern Estonia.

If recurrent, the interval during which the lips are enlarged may be weeks or months. The enlargement can cause midline fissuring of the lip (\\"median cheilitis\\") or angular cheilitis (sores at the corner of the mouth). The swelling is non-pitting (c.f. pitting edema) and feels soft or rubbery on palpation. The mucous membrane of the lip may be erythematous (red) and granular. One or both lips may be affected. * Oral ulceration (mouth ulcers) which may be aphthous like, or be more chronic and deep with raised margins. Alternatively, lesions similar to pyostomatitis vegetans may occur in OFG, but this is uncommon. * \\"Full width\\" gingivitis (compare with marginal gingivitis). * Gingival enlargement (swelling of the gums). * Fissured tongue (grooves in the tongue). * Enlargement of the mucous membrane of the mouth, which may be associated with cobblestoning and mucosal tags (similar lesions often occur on the intestinal mucosa in Crohn disease). * Enlargement of the perioral and periorbital soft tissues (the tissues of the face around the mouth and the eyes). The facial skin may be dry, exfoliative (flaking) or erythematous. * Cervical lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes in the neck). * Facial palsy (weakness and altered sensation of the face). The enlargement of the tissues of the mouth, lips and face seen in OFG is painless. Melkersson- Rosenthal syndrome is where OFG occurs with fissured tongue and paralysis of the facial nerve. The cause of the facial paralysis is thought to be caused by the formation of granulomas in the facial nerve, which supplies the muscles of facial expression. ==Causes== The cause of the condition is unknown. The disease is characterized by non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. That is, the granulomas do not undergo the caseating (\\"cheese-like\\") necrosis typical of the granulomas of tuberculosis. There is disagreement as to whether OFG represents an early form of Crohn disease or sarcoidosis, or whether it is a distinct, but similar clinical entity. Crohn disease can affect any part of gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus. When it involves the mouth alone, some authors refer to this as \\"oral Crohn disease\\", distinguishing it from OFG, and others suggest that OFG is the same condition as Crohn disease when it presents in the oral cavity. OFG may represent a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, but the causative antigen(s) is not identified or varies form one individual to the next. Suspected sources of antigens include metals, e.g. cobalt, or additives and preservatives in foods, including benzoates, benzoic acid, cinnamaldehyde, metabisulfates, butylated hydroxyanisole, dodecyl gallate, tartrazine, or menthol, Examples of foods which may contain these substances include margarine, cinnamon, eggs, chocolate or peppermint oil. Some suggest that infection with atypical mycobacteria could be involved, (paratuberculosis), and that OFG is a reaction to mycobacterial stress protein mSP65 acting as an antigen. In response to an antigen, a chronic, submucosal, T cell mediated inflammatory response occurs, which involves cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha), protease-activated receptors, matrix metalloproteinases and cyclooxygenases. The granulomas in OFG form in the lamina propria, and may form adjacent to or within lymphatic vessels. This is thought to cause obstruction of lymphatic drainage and lymphedema which is manifest as swelling clinically. There may be a genetic predisposition to the condition. People who develop OFG often have a history of atopy, such as childhood asthma or eczema. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis is usually made by tissue biopsy, however this cannot reliably distinguish between the granulomas of OFG and those of Crohn disease or sarcoidosis. Other causes of granulomatous inflammation are ruled out, such as sarcoidosis, Crohn disease, allergic or foreign body reactions and mycobacterial infections. ===Classification=== OFG could be classified as a type of cheilitis (lip inflammation), hence the alternative names for the condition using the word cheilitis, and a granulomatous condition. ==Treatment== Anti-tumour necrosis factor Œ± drugs (e.g. infliximab) Dietary restriction of a particular suspected or proven antigen may be involved in the management of OFG, such as cinnamon or benzoate-free diets. ==Epidemiology== OFG is uncommon, but the incidence is increasing. The disease usually presents in adolescence or young adulthood. It may occur in either sex, but males are slightly more commonly affected. ==History== OFG was first described in 1985. == References  External links == Category:Conditions of the mucous membranes Category:Lip disorders ","title":"Orofacial granulomatosis"},{"id":"7454610","text":"Sir Richard William Blundell CBE FBA (born 1 May 1952, Shoreham-by-Sea) is a British economist and econometrician.

The southern terminus of SR 207 is at a diamond interchange with U.S. Route 23 (US 23) nearly north of Chillicothe. Its northern terminus is in Mount Sterling, following a long concurrence with US 62 and SR 3, at the intersection where they meet SR 56\\\\. ==Route description== Along the way, SR 207 passes through northern Ross County, southwestern Pickaway County, northeastern Fayette County and extreme southeastern Madison County. There are no segments of this highway that are included within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. ==History== SR 207 was assigned in 1962. Running along the majority of SR 207's present path, excepting the southernmost portion of the highway between US 23 and SR 104, along with the SR 104 concurrency, the designation replaced the entirety of what was SR 277 prior to that year. The change was necessitated by the coming of the Interstate Highway System to Ohio, which included construction of Interstate 277 in the Akron vicinity. Ohio follows a standard that no route number can be duplicated between different types of state highways, so SR 277 became SR 207. By 2007, SR 207 was extended on the south end via a nearly concurrency with SR 104, and an all-new alignment running east from SR 104 across the Scioto River to a new interchange with the US 23 expressway in northern Ross County, north of Chillicothe. Another extension is planned to run from US 23 east to SR 159. The cost of the extension is $8 million with construction beginning in October 2019 with completion in summer 2020. Originally, the extension was supposed to intersect with SR 180 and SR 159.

Factors which may contribute to the development of a pulp polyp includes: * Persistence of balance between the irritant and tissue resistance * Continuous low-grade inflammation * Well vascularised pulpal tissue with good tissue reactivity * An open carious cavity * Young patients with a good immune system * Wide apical foramen of the affected tooth to prevent the occurrence of pulpal strangulation and necrosis in response to inflammation == Characteristics == Pulp polyps are characterised by overgrowth of the pulp tissue outside the boundary of a tooth's pulp chamber. A pulp polyp may be found in an open carious lesion (tooth cavity), a fractured tooth, or within a cavity with a missing dental restoration. Due to lack of intrapulpal pressure in an open lesion, pulp necrosis does not occur as would be expected in a closed carious cavity. A good vascular supply and immune resistance is required for its development; as such, this condition is more commonly seen in molar teeth of children and young adults and rarely in older age groups. Clinically, pulp polyps present as a small, pink-red, lobulated mass protruding from the pulp chamber and encompassing the open cavity in long standing cavitated molar teeth. The majority of pulp polyps present symptomless, however if it becomes involved in mastication, discomfort may present and the polyp may change appearance to an ulcerated, dark red mass; although unlikely, bleeding may present. Pulp polyps usually show no radiographic apical lesions, however in long standing polyps or in those with extensive pulp involvement, chronic apical periodontitis may develop and present as a radiographic peri-apical lesion due to advancement of the inflammation present. Peri-apical lesions may present as widening of the periodontal-ligament space, an apical radiolucency or with no changes. To differentiate from a polyp of gingival origin, the pulp polyp may be lifted from the walls of the cavity with an excavator revealing the presence of the pedicle with very little or no discomfort experienced by the patient. == Management == There are a number of management options for teeth with pulp polyps. The option chosen depends namely on the amount of sound tooth tissue remaining. Extraction is usually the only option for teeth with a large carious cavity and little sound tooth tissue remaining; however, if a tooth is deemed restorable (i.e. enough sound tooth tissue) an attempt at restoring the tooth can be made. This may involve a combination of treatments including root surface debridement, endodontic therapy, crown lengthening and/or fixed prosthodontics measures. The types of endodontic therapy which may be undertaken are either a pulpotomy or a root canal treatment; other than restorability, the option chosen depends on a number of factors including how far the tooth is from root completion, the extent of pulpal involvement and whether it is a primary or permanent tooth. == References == Category:Acquired tooth pathology ","title":"Pulp polyp"},{"id":"7454668","text":"√úlej√µe is a village in Anija Parish, Harju County in northern Estonia, located just northeast of the town of Kehra, behind the J√§gala River. √úlej√µe has a population of 252 as of 2010.

The local deity of the city was named Ishtaran, represented on Earth by his minister, the snake god Nirah. In the late 3rd millennium, during the reign of Sulgi of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Der was mentioned twice. The Sulgi year name 11 was named \\"Year Ishtaran of Der was brought into his temple\\", and year 21 was named \\"Year Der was destroyed\\".

He also is known to have used the pen names Madiyar and Arghyn. ==Early life== Dulatuli was born on November 25, 1885 in the village of Sarikopa, Kostanay Province. He was from Middle j√ºz, Argin tribe. He lost his mother, Demesh, at the age of two and his father, Dulat, at the age of 12. He received early education in the traditional village school. In 1897, Dulatuli enrolled in a Kazakh-Russian high school and graduated in 1902 as a village teacher. In 1904, he met Akhmet Baitursynov and Alikhan Bukeikhanov in Karkaraly. Under the influence of these two leaders of emerging Kazakh reformist nationalist movement, he developed an anti-colonial, anti-Russian view. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1907 and became a delegate of Constitutional Democratic Party. In St. Petersburg, he published his first poem in the Kazakh journal \\"Serke\\", which ran only one issue. The poem was entitled Jastarga (\\"to the Youth\\"). He contributed another article, Bizdin Maksatimiz (\\"Our Objective\\"), to the second issue of the journal, which was never published. ==Political activities== Mirjaqip's political formation was greatly maturated when he published his first poetry book, Oyan!

Baqitsiz Jamal has been the first novel in the contemporary Kazakh literature. The book narrates the story of oppressed Kazakh women. Thus, in early 1910s, Dulatuli emerges as a leader of emerging Kazakh reformism and nationalist movement. His publications puts him under Russian surveillance, investigations and intimidations. Under Tsarist Russian surveillance, Dulatuli could not have a steady job or settle down in a town for a long time. He was arrested in Semey in 1911 and served one and half years prison term. After his release, Dulatuli regularly contributed to Kazakh language journals Ayqap and Qazaq until 1918 when Qazaq was closed by the Kerensky government. In his essays and poems Dulatuli criticized socio- economic, political conditions of Kazakhs under imperial administration. He also published another poetry, Azamat, \\"Citizen\\" in 1913.Asur Ozdemir, Kazak Turklerinin Buyuk Edibi, Mirjakip Dulatuli, Bilim ve K√ºlt√ºr Dergisi (bilig-3/Fall, 1996) Dulatuli was one of the leaders of Alash Orda Government which was formed to promote Kazakh autonomy under the Menshevik government. Alash leaders, including Baytursunov and Dulatuli, aligned with the Whites, declared independence of Kazakhstan and fought against Bolsheviks between December 1917-May 1919. When the leader of the Whites, Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, turned down requests of Alash leaders for help, the Kazakh nationalists realigned with the Bolsheviks expecting autonomy under Bolshevik government. In 1920, autonomous socialist republic was established and Alash leaders participated in local government. Dulatuli worked as an editor and teacher under Bolshevik government. In 1928, he was arrested on nationalism charges and died in Solovki labour camp in 1935. ==Legacy== Dulatuli was rehabilitated post-humously in 1988. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of modern Kazakh literature, and a leader of Kazakh nationalism. The first novel in Kazakh literature is \\"Miserable Jamal\\" (\\"–ë–∞“õ—ã—Ç—Å—ã–∑ –ñ–∞–º–∞–ª\\"). The author describes Jamal, a Kazakh girl, who becomes a victim of patriarchal- feudal traditions and customs, and exposing the fight between old traditions and new generation on this basis.

Born in Cist√©rniga, Valladolid Province, Orob√≥n was active in labour movement struggles from an early age. An intellectual with a facility for languages, he translated the biography of the well-known German anarchist Max Nettlau written by Rudolf Rocker. In between theoretical writings, Orob√≥n was deeply involved in efforts to form a revolutionary alliance to stem the rising tide of Fascism and to prepare the way towards revolution. For the post-revolutionary period, in his mind the labor unions were to have a major role in re-organising society on the basis of economic and political decentralism. He maintained that Anarcho-syndicalism was the more important revolutionary force in Spain, rejecting Communist concepts that he considered etatist. He opposed the spread of such tendencies in the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), at the time the largest labour union and main Anarchist organization in Spain. The CNT was prominent in combating the coup d'√©tat by General Francisco Franco that led to the Spanish Civil War in 1936. It was at that time, shortly before his death, that Orob√≥n wrote the words of To The Barricades, to the tune of Warszawianka 1905 roku - itself a well-known Polish revolutionary song. With words exhorting workers to fight the Fascist enemy, the song became the anthem of the CNT and one of the most popular songs of the Spanish anarchists during the Civil War.

It originates from Asia, but can be found in many tropical countries. Common names include: awapuhi, bitter ginger, shampoo ginger (Malay = lempoyang) and pinecone ginger. \\"Floridata ‚Äì Zingiber zerumbet\\", Retrieved 2014-03-18 The rhizomes of Z. zerumbet have been used as food flavoring and appetizers in various cuisines while the rhizome extracts have been used in herbal medicine. ==Description== Zingiber zerumbet is a perennial. From autumn until spring it goes dormant above ground as the leafy stems shrivel and die away, leaving the pale brown, creeping stems (rhizomes) at ground level. In the spring, the plant springs up anew. The 10‚Äì12 blade- shaped leaves 15‚Äì20 cm long grow in an alternate arrangement on thin, upright stem to tall. Among the leafy stems, the conical or club-shaped flower heads burst forth on separate and shorter stalks. These appear in the summer, after the leafy stems have been growing for a while. The flower heads are initially green and are long with overlapping scales, enclosing small yellowish-white flowers that poke out a few at a time. As the flower heads mature, they gradually fill with an aromatic, slimy liquid and turn a brighter red color. The flower stalks usually remain hidden beneath the leaf stalks. ==Distribution and history== Z. zerumbet is native to tropical Asia and Australasia. The subspecies Zingiber zerumbet subsp. cochinchinense (Gagnep.) Triboun & K.Larsen (previously Z. cochinchinense) is found in Vietnam.The Plant List: Zingiber zerumbet subsp. cochinchinense (retrieved 18/9/2017) Remains of Z. zerumbet have been identified at the Kuk Swamp archaeological site of New Guinea at the Phase 1 layers dated to 10,220 to 9,910 BP. However, whether it was cultivated or merely exploited from the wild is unknown. Like the ginger, the earliest evidence of its cultivation is from the Austronesian peoples who carried it with them during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP) as canoe plants, reaching as far as Remote Oceania. ==Mythology== 'Awapuhi is said to be one of the Kinolau, multiple forms, of the Hawaiian deity Kane. ==Indigenous practices== The leaves and leaf stalks, which are also fragrant, were used in baking in the imu, underground oven, to enhance the flavor of pork and fish as they cooked. Traditionally, the aromatic underground rhizomes were sliced, dried, and pounded to a powder, then added to the folds of stored kapa (tapa) cloth. Perhaps the most common use of the plant awapuhi is as a shampoo and conditioner. The clear fragrant juice present in the mature flower heads that resemble red pine cones is used for softening and bringing shininess to the hair. It can be left in the hair or rinsed out and can also be used as a massage lubricant. Hawaiian women often pick or cut the red pod flowerheads of this plant in the forest, as they approach a pool or waterfall for a refreshing summer bath, leave the flowers atop a nearby rock, and then squeeze the sweet juices into their hair and over their bodies when the swim is completed. ==Gallery== Zingiber-zerumbet.JPG Zingiber zerumbet2.jpg Zingiber zerumbet 04.JPG ==See also== *Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia ==References== Roscoe ex Sm.

It is a descriptive term and can be caused by several different disorders. ==Signs and symptoms== Desquamative gingivitis involves lesions of the free and attached gingiva. Unlike plaque-induced inflammation of the gums (normal marginal gingivitis), desquamative gingivitis extends beyond the marginal gingiva, involving the full width of the gingiva and sometimes the alveolar mucosa. The term \\"full width gingivitis\\" usually refers to the oral lesions of orofacial granulomatosis however. The color is another dissimilarity between typical marginal gingivitis and desquamative gingivitis, in the latter it is dusky red.

It is a hardy, commonly grown species, often used as a fast-growing screen plant, but it also has the potential to become a weed. It has become naturalised in Western Australia and parts of Victoria. In its natural state, it grows on coastal cliffs and along estuaries. ==Description== Bracelet honey myrtle ranges from a large shrub to a small weeping tree growing to in height. It has rough, grey fibrous bark, distinctive decumbent branching and dense foliage. The leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (\\"decussate\\") at right angles to the pairs above and below so that they appear to be in four rows along the stem. (One source describes the leaves as being spirally arranged and another as being alternate.) The leaves are long, wide and glabrous except when very young, linear to narrow oval in shape, with the end tapering to a distinct hook. The flowers are white, sometimes cream-coloured, rarely pink, and are arranged in cylindrical spikes on the sides of branches, often on older wood. The spikes are up to long and in diameter and contain a large number of individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles known as staminal claws, which are long with each bundle containing eight to 18 stamens. The flowering season is mostly spring to early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long and about in diameter, in cylindrical clusters along the branches. M. armillaris inflorescence showing stamen bundles ==Taxonomy and naming== The species was first formally described in 1788 by Joseph Gaertner in De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum from specimens collected by Joseph Banks during an expedition of James Cook to Australia. It was then given the name Metrosideros armillaris by Daniel Solander. The species was renamed Melaleuca armillaris in 1797 by James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The specific epithet (armillaris) is from the Latin armilla, meaning \\"a bracelet\\", apparently in reference to the appearance of the cylinder of fruits on the branches. The two subspecies are: *Melaleuca armillaris subsp. armillaris which is the more common and widespread subspecies; *Melaleuca armillaris. subsp. akineta F.C.Quinn which has shorter stamens and fewer flowers in the inflorescence. ==Distribution and habitat== Subspecies armillaris occurs in coastal areas south of the Manning River district in New South Wales to far eastern Victoria, some of the Bass Strait islands including Curtis Island and the far north eastern corner of Tasmania. It is also naturalised in other parts of Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, the south of South Australia and the south-west of Western Australia. It is especially common on the far south coast of New South Wales. It grows naturally on coastal headlands and clifftops, often in dense heath. Subspecies akineta is only found in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia, where it grows on ridges and granite outcrops. ==Cultivation== Melaleuca armillaris is cultivated as a fast-growing windbreak or screening plant. It is hardy and will grow in most soils and aspects, resistant to salt spray and suitable for growing under power lines. ==Ecology== This melaleuca is regarded as a serious environmental weed in some locations especially in Victoria. It replaces local species and increases fuel loads making areas more prone to bushfires. After a bushfire, the problem is increased because of the plants' releasing large numbers of seeds after fire. In South Australia, it is a problem in the Mount Lofty Ranges, Adelaide Hills, and Kangaroo Island. In Western Australia, the problems occur in coastal areas of the south-west of that state. Bracelet honey myrtle is a preferred food of species of sawfly (order Hymenoptera, suborder Symphaptera), especially the long-tailed sawfly Pterygophorus facielongus, which can rapidly defoliate an entire tree. == References == armillaris Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Garden plants of Australia Category:Ornamental trees Category:Plants described in 1788 Category:Taxa named by Joseph Gaertner ","title":"Melaleuca armillaris"},{"id":"7454782","text":"Newbattle Abbey was a Cistercian monastery near the village of Newbattle in Midlothian, Scotland, which subsequently become a stately home and then an educational institution. ==Monastery== It was founded in 1140 by monks from Melrose Abbey. The patron was King David I of Scotland (with his son Henry). Its church was dedicated in 1234. The abbey was burned by English royal forces in 1385 and once more in 1544. It became a secular lordship for the last commendator, Mark Kerr (Ker) in 1587. Newbattle Abbey was a filiation of Melrose Abbey (itself a daughter of Rievaulx Abbey) and was situated, according to Cistercian usages, in a beautiful valley along the River South Esk. Rudolph, its first abbot, a strict and severe observer of the rule, devoted himself energetically to the erection of proper buildings. The church, cruciform in shape, was 240 feet in length, and the other buildings in proportion; at one period the community numbered as many as 80 monks and 70 lay-brothers. The abbey soon became prosperous and famous for the regularity of its members, several of whom became well-known bishops. It was especially dear to the kings of Scotland, scarcely one of whom failed to visit it from time-to-time, and they were always its generous benefactors. One of the principal sources of income was the coal mines in its possession, for these monks were among the first, if not the first, coal miners in Scotland. The earliest mention of coal in Scotland is to be found in a charter of an Earl of Winchester, granting to them a coal mine. In 1526 King James V granted them a petition to build a harbour at Morrison's Haven, and it is from this date that Aitchison's Haven Lodge was established as a stonemason's lodge.The Lodge of Aitchison's Haven In 1531, the Abbot of Newbattle agreed with the Abbot of Dunfermline to work his coalmine at Prestongrange so that it would drain water from the neighbouring mines (which belonged to Dunfermline Abbey) to the sea.Registrum, Bannatyne Club (1849), p.xxvi: Registrum de Dunfermelyn Bannatyne Club (1842), pp.362-3. Newbattle suffered much from English incursions at various times, particularly in 1385 when the monastery and church were burned, and the religious either carried away or forced to flee to other monasteries; it required 40 years to repair these losses. A part of the monastery was again destroyed by the Earl of Hertford, but the destruction seems to have been chiefly confined to the church. At the time of the Reformation but few of the monks remained, and these were pensioned by the commendator, Mark Kerr. Kerr made a timely conversion to Protestantism and was able to retain the lands around the abbey. His son, also Mark, became Lord Newbattle in 1596 and Earl of Lothian in 1606. The monastery site, including burial grounds, traces of the chapel and cloisters and some associated buildings, is now a designated scheduled monument. ==Stately home== Newbattle Abbey in 2011 Part of the abbey was converted into a house which survives at the core of the current building. The house incorporates part of the south end of the monastic range, with the dorter undercroft intact. The house was modified and rebuilt successively by John Mylne in 1650, William Burn in 1836 and David Bryce in 1858. The drawing room represents one of Scotland's greatest rooms, decorated by Thomas Bonnar around 1870. The 19th century chapel was created in a vaulted undercroft that may date from the original abbey buildings. The chapel includes a 16th-century font and a fine parquet floor, made using wood from the estate, in the style of original tile-work. The library is oak-lined and features a 17th-century moulded ceiling. The garden to the rear of the house includes a pair of large octagonal 17th century sundials. The main abbey remains lie buried to the west and north of the original house. King George IV visited during his Scottish tour of 1822 and the King's Gate was built in his honour. ==College== Newbattle Abbey remained the home of the Marquesses of Lothian until being given to the nation in 1937 by Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian, to be used as a College of Education. The College was established under trustees from the four ancient Scottish Universities specifically for adults returning to education. New residential building was added in the 1960s and funding came through the Scottish Education Department. In 1987 the Secretary of State for Scotland announced the intention to withdraw funding, threatening the college with closure. However, new forms of financial support have enabled the college to survive. ==Burials at the Abbey== *Marie de Coucy ==See also== * Abbot of Newbattle, for a list of abbots and commendators * Scheduled monuments in Midlothian ==References== * Registrum S.

With three youth Tests before his nineteenth birthday, Weston joined the Durham first team in 1995, where he played for two years. Weston made his debut for Derbyshire in July 1998 against the South Africans and then against Northamptonshire, where he hit a half-century despite an innings defeat. He left Derbyshire at the end of 1999 to join Middlesex. After a shaky first year with Middlesex, Weston made a comeback in 2001, as he made three centuries and finished the season with an average in the 40s. He helped the team in 2002 towards Championship glory. After the 2003 season, Weston abandoned first-class cricket. He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm leg-break bowler. Weston's brother Philip had a somewhat longer career playing for Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. ==External links== *Robin Weston at CricketArchive Category:1975 births Category:English cricketers Category:Durham cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Living people Category:People educated at Durham School Category:NBC Denis Compton Award recipients ","title":"Robin Weston"},{"id":"7454809","text":"The United Indian Patriotic Association was a political organisation founded in 1888 by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad Singh of Benaras. the founder of the Aligarh Muslim University, .

It is a harmless and very common condition. Because it is so common, it has been argued that it may in fact represent a variation of the normal appearance rather than a disease, but empirical evidence suggests that leukoedema is an acquired condition caused by local irritation. It is found more commonly in black skinned people and tobacco users. The term is derived from the Greek words ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåœÇ leuk√≥s, \\"white\\" and Œø·º¥Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ± o√≠dƒìma, \\"swelling\\". ==Signs and symptoms== There is a diffuse, gray-white, milky opalescent appearance of the mucosa which usually occurs bilaterally on the buccal mucosa. Less often, the labial mucosa, the palate or the floor of mouth may be affected. The surface of the area is folded, creating a wrinkled, white streaked lesion. Apart from the appearance, the lesion is entirely asymptomatic. ==Causes== The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by intracellular edema of the superficial epithelial cells coupled with retention of superficial parakeratin. Although leukoedema is thought to be a developmental condition, it may be more common and more pronounced in smokers, and becomes less noticeable when smoking is stopped. Smoking cannabis is known to be linked to this condition. It may also develop in areas subjecte to repeat subclinical irritation, caused by low grade irritants such as spices, oral debris or tobacco. ==Diagnosis== Leukoedema lesions disappear when the mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth. The differential diagnosis is with leukoplakia, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, white sponge nevus, morsicatio buccarum, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis and dyskeratosis congenita. Tissue biopsy is not indicated, but when taken, the histologic appearance is one of increased epithelial thickness, broadening and eleongation of the rete ridges, parakeratosis and intracellular edema of the spinous layer. The cells of the spinous layer are vacuolated, large and possess pyknotic nuclei. The superficial squamous cells have a clear, seemingly empty cytoplasm but it has not been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term edema misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish. The diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance alone, but oral exfoliative cytology has been used as a diagnostic aid. ==Treatment and prognosis== Leukoedema is a harmless condition, and no treatment is indicated. People may be alarmed by the appearance and benefit from reassurance. ==Epidemiology== Leukoedema is common. It occurs in about 70-90% of black skinned adults and about 50% of black skinned children. The prevalence in white skinned people is considerably less, but reports range from less than 10% to more than 90%, probably varying depending upon the population studied, and the methods used in the study, e.g. examination conditions and the diagnostic criteria. The ethnic variation may be explained by genetic factors or simply because black skinned people have greater amount of melanin in the mucosa, making it appear darker (termed racial or physiologic pigmentation). This darker mucosa may make the edematous changes more noticeable, whereas in the mucosa of people with lighter skin types leukoedema gives a milder presentation. ==History== Leukoedema was once thought to be a precursor lesion to leukoplakia, and was not believed to occur in children, but both of these views are now disproved. ==References External links == Category:Oral mucosal pathology ","title":"Leukoedema"},{"id":"7454812","text":"Yantou Quanhuo (; Japanese GƒÅnto ZenkatsuLeighton, 257) (828‚Äì887) was an ancient Ch'an master of Yantou Monastery in Ezhou, China.

His name occurs in the witness lists of two extant charters, both issued by King William of Scotland at Perth, which indicates that he was probably a native of somewhere in southern Perthshire.G. W. S. Barrow, The Acts of William I: King of Scots, 1165-1214, (= Regesta Regum Scottorum, volume ii), (Edinburgh, 1971)p. 37. He seems in fact to have been the lord of Madderty in Strathearn.Ibid., no. 258, pp. 291-2. In either 1172 or 1173 he witnessed King William's grant of Ardross to Merleswain mac Cholba√≠n, a relative of the mormaer of Fife.;Ibid., p. 211. and somewhere between 1178 and 1185 he witnessed the king's grant of lands in Inverness- shire to Gille Brigte, Mormaer of Strathearn. In both of these charters, the grants are to native Scots and Gille Coluim appears alongside other native Scots, such as (in both cases) Gille Cr√≠st mac ingine Samuel (\\"Gillecrist mac inien Sam√ºel\\") and Gille M√≠ch√©il mac Donnchada (\\"Gillemichel mac Dunecan\\"). Gille Coluim in both cases appears with the title \\"Marescal\\", meaning that he was the king's military commander. It appears to be in this role that Gille Coluim was given control of the castle at Auldearn (\\"Heryn\\") in Moray during a rebellion by the Meic Uilleim, a royal kindred who were claiming the throne of Scotland. A charter issued by King William at Linlithgow, between 1187 and 1189 grants Gille Brigte, mormaer of Strathearn, the land of Madderty and states that neither Gille Coluim nor his heirs have any right to the land after giving up Auldearn to the Meic Uilleim.Ibid., no. 258, pp. 291-2.

Since the brain to body's nerve connections pass through the neck, many seemingly random symptoms can be triggered by impingement or entanglement. First described by American otorhinolaryngologist Watt Weems Eagle in 1937, the condition is caused by an elongated or misshapen styloid process (the slender, pointed piece of bone just below the ear) and/or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament, either of which interferes with the functioning of neighboring regions in the body, giving rise to pain. ==Signs and symptoms== Possible symptoms include: Classic eagle syndrome is present on only one side, however, rarely, it may be present on both sides. In vascular Eagle syndrome, the elongated styloid process comes in contact with the internal carotid artery below the skull. In these cases, turning the head can cause compression of the artery or a tear inside the blood vessel, which restricts blood flow and can potentially lead to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Sometimes, compression of the internal jugular vein can also occur and might lead to increased intracranial pressure. ==Cause== Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. However, the cause of the elongation hasn‚Äôt been known clearly. It could occur spontaneously or could arise since birth. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5‚Äì3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. ==Diagnosis== File:Eagle-Syndrom Roe seitlich 002.jpgRadiograph, lateral view showing elongated stylohyoid process and stylohyoid ligament ossification File:Processus styloideus.jpgRadiograph, lateral view showing joint-like formation in ossified stylohyoid ligament File:Ossifikationen im Ligamentum stylohyoideom beidseits - Eagle-Syndrom - CT cor 001.jpgCT scan, coronal section showing bilateral extended styloid process and stylohyoid ligament ossification (incidental finding) File:Verknoechertes Lig stylohyoideum - CT 3D.jpg3D-reconstructed CT scan showing bilateral stylohyoid ligament ossification Proc styloideus.JPG3D reconstructed CT scan showing elongated styloid process (right side) Diagnosis is suspected when a patient presents with the symptoms of the classic form of \\"Eagle syndrome\\" e.g. unilateral neck pain, sore throat or tinnitus. Sometimes the tip of the styloid process is palpable in the back of the throat. The diagnosis of the vascular type is more difficult and requires an expert opinion. One should have a high level of suspicion when neurological symptoms occur upon head rotation. Symptoms tend to be worsened on bimanual palpation of the styloid through the tonsillar bed. They may be relieved by infiltration of lidocaine into the tonsillar bed. Because of the proximity of several large vascular structures in this area this procedure should not be considered to be risk free. Imaging is important and is diagnostic. Visualizing the styloid process on a CT scan with 3D reconstruction is the suggested imaging technique. The enlarged styloid may be visible on an orthopantogram or a lateral soft tissue X ray of the neck. ==Treatment== In both the classic and vascular form, the treatment is surgical. A partial styloidectomy is the preferred approach. Repair of a damaged carotid artery is essential in order to prevent further neurological complications. Regrowth of the stylohyoid process and relapse being a common occurrence is debatable. Medical management may include the use of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, antidepressants, and/or corticosteroids. The overall success rate for treatment (medical or surgical) is about 80%. ==Epidemiology== Approximately 4% of the general population have an elongated styloid process, and of these about 4% give rise to the symptoms of Eagle syndrome. Therefore, the incidence of stylohyoid syndrome may be about 0.16%. Patients with this syndrome tend to be between 30 and 50 years of age but it has been recorded in teenagers and in patients > 75 years old. It is more common in women, with a male:female ratio ~ 1:2. ==History== The condition was first described by American otorhinolaryngologist Watt Weems Eagle in 1937. ==References External links == Category:Diseases of oral cavity, salivary glands and jaws Category:Syndromes ","title":"Eagle syndrome"},{"id":"7454840","text":"Rothhammer (right) at 1972 Olympics Keena Ruth Rothhammer (born February 26, 1957) is an American former competition swimmer, Olympic champion, and former world record-holder in two events.

In classical antiquity, including the Hellenistic world of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, historians and archaeologists view the public and private rituals associated with religion as part of everyday life. Examples of this phenomenon are found in the various state and cult temples, Jewish synagogues, and churches. These were important hubs for ancient peoples, representing a connection between the heavenly realms (the divine) and the earthly planes (the dwelling place of humanity). This context of magic has become an academic study, especially in the last twenty years. == Terminology == Pervasive throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia until late antiquity and beyond, m√°gos, \\"Magian\\" or \\"magician\\", was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek goƒìs (Œ≥œåŒ∑œÇ), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for (Pseudo‚Äë)Zoroaster, who was perceived by the Greeks to be the \\"Chaldean\\", \\"founder\\" of the Magi and \\"inventor\\" of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words \\"magic\\" and \\"magician\\". Authors William Swatos and Peter Kivisto define magic as \\"any attempt to control the environment or the self by means that are either untested or untestable, such as charms or spells.\\" ==General== Herodotus, Xenophon, Plutarch ‚Äì did use magos in connection with their descriptions of (Zoroastrian) religious beliefs or practices, the majority seem to have understood it in the sense of \\"magician\\". Accordingly, the more skeptical writers then also identified the \\"magicians\\" ‚Äì i.e. individual magians ‚Äì as charlatans or frauds. In Plato's Symposium (202e), the Athenian identified them as maleficent, allowing however a measure of efficacy as a function of the god Eros. Pliny paints them in a particularly bad light. According to one source magic in general was held in low esteem and condemned by speakers and writers. Betz notes book burnings in regards to texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, when he cites Ephesus in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 19: 10). And on the account of Suetonius, Augustus ordered the burning of 2,000 magical scrolls in 13 BC. Betz states: Albrecht Dieterich noted the importance of the Greek Magical Papyri for the study of ancient religions because most of the texts combine several religions, Egyptian, Greek, or Jewish, among others. According to Robert Parker, \\"magic differs from religion as weeds differ from flowers, merely by negative social evaluation\\"; magic was often seen as consisting of practices that range from silly superstition to the wicked and dangerous. However, magic seems to have borrowed from religion, adopting religious ceremonies and divine names, and the two are sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish. Magic is often differentiated from religion in that it is manipulative rather than supplicatory of the deities. Some mainstream religious rites openly set out to constrain the gods. Other rough criteria sometimes used to distinguish magic from religion include: aimed at selfish or immoral ends; and conducted in secrecy, often for a paying client. Religious rites, on the other hand, are more often aimed at lofty goals such as salvation or rebirth, and are conducted in the open for the benefit of the community or a group of followers. Religious ritual had the intended purpose of giving a god their just due honor, or asking for divine intervention and favor, while magic is seen as practiced by those who seek only power, and often undertaken based on a false scientific basis. Ultimately, the practice of magic includes rites that do not play a part in worship, and are ultimately irreligious. Associations with this term tend to be an evolving process in ancient literature, but generally speaking ancient magic reflects aspects of broader religious traditions in the Mediterranean world, that is, a belief in magic reflects a belief in deities, divination, and words of power. The concept of magic however came to represent a more coherent and self-reflective tradition exemplified by magicians seeking to fuse varying non-traditional elements of Greco-Roman religious practice into something specifically called magic. This fusing of practices reached its peak in the world of the Roman Empire, in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE. Thorndike comments: \\"Greek science at its best was not untainted by magic\\". The magic papyri we have left to study, present more Graeco-Egyptian, rather than Graeco-Roman beliefs. Betz further notes: ==HistoryMagic in Homeric times=== In Greek literature, the earliest magical operation that supports a definition of magic as a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces (the sympathies and antipathies that make up these forces) of the world (physis ) is found in Book X of the Odyssey (a text stretching back to the early 8th century BCE). Book X describes the encounter of the central hero Odysseus with the Titan Circe, \\"She who is sister to the wizard Aeetes, both being children of the Sun...by the same mother, Perse the daughter of the Ocean,\\" on the island of Aeaea. In the story Circe's magic consists in the use of a wand against Odysseus and his men while Odysseus's magic consists of the use of a secret herb called moly (revealed to him by the god Hermes, \\"god of the golden wand\\") to defend himself from her attack. In the story three requisites crucial to the idiom of \\"magic\\" in later literature are found: # The use of a mysterious tool endowed with special powers (the wand). # The use of a rare magical herb.Pliny in Natural History XXV, 10‚Äì12 states his belief that the \\"origin of botany\\" was closely aligned with what he saw as the practise of magic, he in fact notes that Medea & Circe were early investigators of plants ‚Äì and that Orpheus was the first writer on the subject of botany. # A divine figure that reveals the secret of the magical act (Hermes). These are the three most common elements that characterize magic as a system in the later Hellenistic and greco-Roman periods of history. Another important definitional element to magic is also found in the story. Circe is presented as being in the form of a beautiful woman (a temptress) when Odysseus encounters her on an island. In this encounter Circe uses her wand to change Odysseus‚Äô companions into swine. This may suggest that magic was associated (in this time) with practices that went against the natural order, or against wise and good forces (Circe is called a witch by a companion of Odysseus). In this mode it is worth noting that Circe is representative of a power (the Titans) that had been conquered by the younger Olympian gods such as Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. ===Magic in Classical Greece=== The 6th century BCE gives rise to scattered references of magoi at work in Greece. Many of these references representing a more positive conceptualisation of magic. Among the most famous of these Greek magoi, between Homer and the Hellenistic period, are the figures of Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Empedocles. Orpheus Orpheus is a mythical figure, said to have lived in Thrace \\"a generation before Homer\\" (though he is in fact depicted on 5th-century ceramics in Greek costume). Orphism, or the Orphic Mysteries, seems also to have been central to the personages of Pythagoras and Empedocles who lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Pythagoras for example is said to have described Orpheus, as, \\"the...father of melodious songs.\\" Since Aeschylus (the Greek Playwright) later describes him as he who \\"haled all things by the rapture of his voice,\\" this suggests belief in the efficacy of song and voice in magic. Orpheus is certainly associated with a great many deeds: the most famous perhaps being his descent to the underworld to bring back his wife, Eurydice. Orpheus‚Äô deeds are not usually condemned or spoken of negatively. This suggests that some forms of magic were more acceptable. Indeed, the term applied to Orpheus to separate him, presumably, from magicians of ill repute is theios aner or ‚Äòdivine man‚Äô. Pythagoras Pythagoras of Samos. Magical powers were also attributed to the famous mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras (c. 570 ‚Äì 495 BCE), as recorded in the days of Aristotle. The traditions concerning Pythagoras are somewhat complicated because the number of Vitae that do survive are often contradictory in their interpretation of the figure of Pythagoras. Some of the magical acts attributed to him include: # Being seen at the same hour in two cities. # A white eagle permitting him to stroke it. # A river greeting him with the words \\"Hail, Pythagoras!\\" # Predicting that a dead man would be found on a ship entering a harbor. # Predicting the appearance of a white bear and declaring it was dead before the messenger reached him bearing the news. # Biting a venomous snake to death (or in some versions driving a snake out from a village).These miracles of Pythagoras are found in Hellenistic collections such as Apollonius‚Äô Historia Thaumasiai VI or Aelian's Varia Historia II.26 and IV.17. Empedocles, the extant fragments / edited with an introduction, commentary, and concordance by M. R. Wright. These stories also hint at Pythagoras being one of these \\"divine man\\" figures, theios aner, his ability to control animals and to transcend space and time showing he has been touched by the gods. Empedocles Empedocles (c. 490 ‚Äì c. 430 BCE) too has ascribed to him marvelous powers associated with later magicians: that is, he is able to heal the sick, rejuvenate the old, influence the weather and summon the dead. E.R. Dodds in his 1951 book, The Greeks and the Irrational, argued that Empedocles was a combination of poet, magus, teacher, and scientist. Dodds argued that since much of the acquired knowledge of individuals like Pythagoras or Empedocles was somewhat mysterious even to those with a rudimentary education, it might be associated with magic or at least with the learning of a Magus. It is important to note that after Empedocles, the scale of magical gifts in exceptional individuals shrinks in the literature, becoming specialized. Individuals might have the gift of healing, or the gift of prophecy, but are not usually credited with a wide range of supernatural powers as are magoi like Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles. Plato reflects such an attitude in his Laws (933a-e) where he takes healers, prophets and sorcerers for granted. He acknowledges that these practitioners existed in Athens (and thus presumably in other Greek cities), and they had to be reckoned with and controlled by laws; but one should not be afraid of them, their powers are real, but they themselves represent a rather low order of humanity. An early Christian analogy is found in the 1st century CE writings of the Apostle Paul. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians conceptualizes the idea of a limitation of spiritual gifts. ===Magic in the Hellenistic period=== The Hellenistic period (roughly the last three centuries BCE) is characterized by an avid interest in magic, though this may simply be because from this period a greater abundance of texts, both literary and some from actual practitioners, in Greek and in Latin remains. In fact many of the magical papyri that are extant were written in the 1st centuries of the Common Era, but their concepts, formulas and rituals reflect the earlier Hellenistic period, that is, a time when the systematization of magic in the Greco-Roman world seems to have taken place‚Äîparticularly in the ‚Äòmelting pot‚Äô of varying cultures that was Egypt under the Ptolemaic Kingdom and under Rome. The ascendancy of Christianity by the fifth century had much to do with this. This is reflected by the Acts of the Apostles, where Paul the Apostle convinces many Ephesians to bring out their magical books and burn them. The language of the magical papyri reflects various levels of literary skill, but generally they are standard Greek, and in fact they may well be closer to the spoken language of the time than to poetry or artistic prose left to us in literary texts. Many terms are borrowed, in the papyri, it would seem, from the mystery cults; thus magical formulas are sometimes called teletai (literally, \\"celebration of mysteries\\"), or the magician himself is called mystagogos (the priest who leads the candidates for initiation). Much Jewish lore and some of the names for God also appear in the magical papyri. Jao for Yahweh, Sabaoth, and Adonai appear quite frequently for example.There is a number of other texts among the Greek magical papyri also indebted to Judaism for some of their content. There is a \\"Charm of Solomon that produces a trance\\" in PGM IV.850‚Äì929, but its religious content is otherwise pagan. Various versions of the \\"Eighth Book of Moses\\" appear in PGM XIII.1‚Äì343; 343‚Äì646; 646‚Äì734, followed by a \\"Tenth (?) Hidden [Book of] Moses\\" in 734‚Äì1077, but the content of these too, is almost entirely pagan. As magicians are concerned with secrets it must have seemed to many outsiders of Judaism that Yahweh was a secret deity, for after all no images were produced of the Jewish God and God's real name was not pronounced, as the basis of speculation on magic. The texts of the Greek magical papyri are often written as we might write a recipe: \\"Take the eyes of a bat...\\" for example. So in other words the magic requires certain ingredients, much as Odysseus required the herb Moly to defeat the magic of Circe. But it is not just as simple as knowing how to put a recipe together. Appropriate gestures, at certain points in the magical ritual, are required to accompany the ingredients, different gestures it would seem produce various effects. A magical ritual done in the right way can guarantee the revealing of dreams and the rather useful talent of interpreting them correctly. In other cases certain spells allow one to send out a daemon or daemons to harm one's enemies or even to break up someone's marriage. This self-defined negative aspect to magic (as opposed to other groups defining your practices as negative even if you don‚Äôt) is found in various ‚Äòcurse tablets,‚Äô (tabellae defixionum) left to us from the Greco-Roman world. The term defixio is derived from the Latin verb defigere, which means literally \\"to pin down,\\" but which was also associated with the idea of delivering someone to the powers of the underworld. It was also possible to curse an enemy through a spoken word, either in his presence or behind his back. But due to numbers of curse tablets that have been found it would seem that this type of magic was considered more effective. The process involved writing the victim's name on a thin sheet of lead along with varying magical formulas or symbols, then burying the tablet in or near a tomb, a place of execution, or a battlefield, to give spirits of the dead power over the victim. Sometimes the curse tablets were even transfixed with various items ‚Äì such as nails, which were believed to add magical potency. For most magic acts or rituals, there existed magics to counter the effects. Amulets were one of the most common protections (or counter-magics) used in the Greco-Roman world as protection against such fearful things as curses and the evil eye; which were seen as very real by most of its inhabitants. While amulets were often made of cheap materials, precious stones were believed to have special efficacy. Many thousands of carved gems were found that clearly had a magical rather than an ornamental function. by Internet Archive on 26 May 2015. Amulets were also made of organic material, such as beetles. Amulets were a very widespread type of magic, because of the fear of other types of magic such as curses being used against oneself. Thus amulets were actually often a mixture of various formulas from Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek elements that were probably worn by those of most affiliations so as to protect against other forms of magic. Amulets are often abbreviated forms of the formulas found in the extant magical papyri. Magical tools were thus very common in magical rituals. Tools were probably just as important as the spells and incantations that were repeated for each magical ritual. A magician's kit, probably dating from the third century, was discovered in the remains of the ancient city of Pergamon in Anatolia and gives direct evidence of this. The find consisted of a bronze table and base covered with symbols, a dish (also decorated with symbols), a large bronze nail with letters inscribed on its flat sides, two bronze rings, and three black polished stones inscribed with the names of supernatural powers. What emerges then, from this evidence, is the conclusion that a type of permanence and universality of magic had developed in the Greco-Roman world by the Hellenistic period if not earlier. The scholarly consensus strongly suggests that although many testimonies about magic are relatively late, the practices they reveal are almost certainly much older. However the level of credence or efficacy given to magical practices in the early Greek and Roman worlds by comparison to the late Hellenistic period is not well known. == High and low magic == Magical operations largely fall into two categories: theurgy () and goetia (). Theurgy in some contexts appears simply to try and glorify the kind of magic that is being practiced ‚Äì usually a respectable priest-like figure is associated with the ritual. Of this, scholar E. R. Dodds claims: In a typical theurgical rite, contact with divinity occurs either through the soul of the theurgist or medium leaving the body and ascending to heaven, where the divinity is perceived, or through the descent of the divinity to earth to appear to the theurgist in a vision or a dream. In the latter case, the divinity is drawn down by appropriate \\"symbols\\" or magical formulae. According to the Greek philosopher Plotinus (205‚Äì270), theurgy attempts to bring all things in the universe into sympathy, and man into connection with all things via the forces that flow through them. Theurgia connoted an exalted form of magic, and philosophers interested in magic adopted this term to distinguish themselves from the magoi or g√≥ƒìtes (, singular g√≥ƒìs, \\"sorcerer, wizard\\") ‚Äî lower-class practitioners. Goetia was a derogatory term connoting low, specious or fraudulent mageia. Goetia is similar in its ambiguity to charm: it means both magic and power to (sexually) attract. == Personages of the Roman Empire == There are several notable historical personages of the 1st century CE who have many of the literary characteristics earlier associated with the Greek \\"divine men\\" (Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles). Of particular note are Jesus the Christ, Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana. From an outsider's point of view Jesus was a typical miracle-worker. He exorcised daemons, healed the sick, made prophecies and raised the dead. As Christianity grew and became seen as a threat to established traditions of religion in the Greco-Roman world (particularly to the Roman Empire with its policy of emperor worship) Jesus (and by inference his followers) were accused of being magic users. Certainly Christian texts such as the Gospels told a life story full of features common to divinely touched figures: Jesus‚Äô divine origin, his miraculous birth, and his facing of a powerful daemon (Satan) being but a few examples.These themes are shared amongst divine men figures: Abaris yielded to Pythagoras, and Zoraster had to resist evil daemons for examples The gospel of Matthew claims that Jesus was taken to Egypt as an infant, this was actually used by hostile sources to explain his knowledge of magic; according to one rabbinical story, he came back tattooed with spells. It is also argued in rabbinical tradition that Jesus was mad, which was often associated with people of great power (dynamis). Scholars such as Morton Smith have even tried to argue that Jesus was a magician. Morton Smith, in his book, Jesus the Magician, points out that the Gospels speak of the \\"descent of the spirit,\\" the pagans of \\"possession by a daemon,\\". According to Morton Smith both are explanations for very similar phenomena. If so this shows the convenience that using the term \\"magic\\" had in the Roman Empire ‚Äì in delineating between what \\"they do and what you do\\". However Barry Crawford, currently Co-Chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's Consultation on Redescribing Christian Origins, in his 1979 review of the book states that \\"Smith exhibits an intricate knowledge of the magical papyri, but his ignorance of current Gospel research is abysmal\\", concluding that the work has traits of a conspiracy theory. Simon is the name of a magus mentioned in the canonical book of Acts 8:9ff, in apocryphal texts and elsewhere. In the Book of Acts Simon the Magus is presented as being deeply impressed by the apostle Peter's cures and exorcisms and by the gift of the Spirit that came from the apostles‚Äô laying on of hands; therefore, he \\"believed and was baptized\\". But Simon asks the apostles to sell him their special gift so that he can practice it too. This seems to represent the attitude of a professional magician. In other words, for Simon, the power of this new movement is a kind of magic that can be purchased ‚Äì perhaps a common practice for magicians in parts of the Greco-Roman world. The Apostles response to Simon was emphatic in its rejection. The early church drew a strong line of demarcation between what it practiced and the practices of magic users.There is a parallel story in Acts 13:6‚Äì12. (though in this case perhaps an insider being chastised). As the church continued to develop this demarcation Simon comes under even greater scrutiny in later Christian texts. The prominent Christian author Justin Martyr for example, claims that Simon was a magus of Samaria, and that his followers committed the blasphemy of worshiping Simon as God. The veracity of this is not certain, but proves the desire of the early Christians to escape an association with magic. The third magus of interest in the period of the Roman Empire is Apollonius of Tyana ( 40 AD- c. 120 AD). Between 217 and 238 Flavius Philostratus wrote his Life of Apollonius of Tyana, a lengthy, but unreliable novelistic source. Philostratus was a prot√©g√© of the empress Julia Domna, mother of the emperor Caracalla. According to him, she owned the memoirs of one Damis, an alleged disciple of Apollonius, and gave these to Philostratus as the raw material for a literary treatment. Some scholars believe the memoirs of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone else and used by Philostratus. The latter possibility is more likely. In any case it is a literary fake. From Philostratus‚Äô biography Apollonius emerges as an ascetic traveling teacher. He is usually labeled a new Pythagoras, and at the very least he does represent the same combination of philosopher and magus that Pythagoras was. According to Philostratus Apollonius traveled far and wide, as far as India, teaching ideas reasonably consistent with traditional Pythagorean doctrine; but in fact, it is most likely that he never left the Greek East of the Roman Empire. In Late Antiquity talismans allegedly made by Apollonius appeared in several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from plagues and other afflictions. == Jewish tradition == Jewish tradition, too, has attempted to define certain practices as \\"magic\\". Some Talmudic teachers (and many Greeks and Romans) considered Jesus a magician, and magical books such as the Testament of Solomon and the Eighth Book of Moses were ascribed to Solomon and Moses in antiquity. The Wisdom of Solomon, a book considered apocryphal by many contemporary Jews and Christians (probably composed in the first century BCE) claims that Thus Solomon was seen as the greatest scientist, but also the greatest occultist of his time, learned in astrology, plant magic, daemonology, divination, and physika ( \\"science\\"). These are the central aims of magic as an independent tradition ‚Äì knowledge and power and control of the mysteries of the cosmos. Such aims can be viewed negatively or positively by ancient authors. The Jewish historian Josephus for example, writes that: \\"God gave him [Solomon] knowledge of the art that is used against daemons, in order to heal and benefit men\\". Elsewhere however, \\"there was an Egyptian false prophet [a magician] that did the Jews more mischief... for he was a cheat\\". The idea of magic can thus be an idiom loosely defined in ancient thinking. But whether magic is viewed negatively or positively the substance of it as a practice can be drawn out. That is, that magic was a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces of the cosmos, and the sympathies and antipathies that were seen to make up these forces. == Authors of the Roman Empire == The Natural History of Pliny the Elder (CE 23/24-79) is a voluminous survey of knowledge of the late Hellenistic era, based according to Pliny on a hundred or so earlier authorities. This rather extensive work deals with an amazing variety of issues: cosmology, geography, anthropology, zoology, botany, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy and many others. Pliny was convinced of the powers of certain herbs or roots as revealed to humanity by the gods. Pliny argued that the divine powers in their concern for the welfare of humanity wish for humanity to discover the secrets of nature. Pliny indeed argues that in their wisdom the gods sought to bring humans gradually closer to their status; which certainly many magical traditions seek ‚Äì that is by acquiring knowledge one can aspire to gain knowledge even from the gods. Pliny expresses a firm concept is firmly being able to understand this \\"cosmic sympathy\\" that, if properly understood and used, operates for the good of humanity. While here lies expressed the central tenets of magic Pliny is by means averse to using the term \\"magic\\" in a negative sense. Pliny argues that the claims of the professional magicians were either exaggerated or simply false. Pliny expresses an interesting concept when he states that those sorcerers who had written down their spells and recipes despised and hated humanity (for spreading their lies perhaps?). To show this Pliny link arts of the magicians of Rome with the emperor Nero (who is often portrayed negatively), whom Pliny claims had studied magic with the best teachers and had access to the best books, but was unable to do anything extraordinary. Pliny's conclusion, however, is cautious: though magic is ineffective and infamous, it nevertheless contains \\"shadows of truth\\", particularly of the \\"arts of making poisons\\". Yet, Pliny states, \\"there is no one who is not afraid of spells\\" (including himself presumably). The amulets and charms that people wore as a kind of preventive medicine he neither commends or condemns, but instead suggests that it is better to err on the side of caution, for, who knows, a new kind of magic, a magic that really works, may be developed at any time. If such an attitude prevailed in the Greco-Roman world this may explain why professional magicians, such as Simon Magus, were on the lookout for new ideas. Pliny devotes the beginning of Book 30 of his work to the magi of Persia and refers to them here and there especially in Books 28 and 29. Pliny defines the Magi at times as sorcerers, but also seems to acknowledge that they are priests of a foreign religion, along the lines of the druids of the Celts in Britain and Gaul. According to Pliny, the art of the magi touches three areas: \\"healing,\\" \\"ritual,\\" and \\"astrology.\\" To the Platonist philosopher Plutarch (c. 45‚Äì125) we owe the treatise On Superstition. Plutarch defines \\"'superstition\\" as \\"fear of the gods.\\" Specifically, he mentions that fear of the gods leads to the need to resort to magical rites and taboos, the consultation of professional sorcerers and witches, amulets and incantations, and unintelligible language in prayers addressed to the gods. Although Plutarch himself takes dreams and omens seriously, he reserves superstition for those who have excessive or exclusive faith in such phenomena. Clearly, it is a matter of discrimination. He also takes for granted other magical practices, such as hurting someone by the evil eye. He also believes in daemons that serve as agents or links between gods and human beings and are responsible for many supernatural events in human life that are commonly attributed to divine intervention. Thus, a daemon, not Apollo himself, is the everyday power behind the Pythia. Some daemons are good, some are evil, but even the good ones, in moments of anger, can do harmful acts. In general then, Plutarch actually accepts much of what we today might define as superstition in itself. So what he is really defining as superstition are those practices not compatible with his own philosophical doctrine. A later Platonist, Apuleius (born c. 125),Apuleius. and John A. Hanson, Metamorphoses (Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press, 1989). gives us a substantial amount of information on contemporary beliefs in magic, though perhaps through no initial choice of his own. Apuleius was accused of practicing magic, something outlawed under Roman law. The speech he delivered in his own defense against the charge of magic, in c. 160 CE, remains and it is from this Apologia that we learn how easy it was, at that time, for a philosopher to be accused of magical practices. Perhaps in a turn of irony or even a tacit admission of guilt, Apuleius, in his Metamorphoses (or The Golden Ass), which perhaps has autobiographical elements, allows the hero, Lucius, to dabble in magic as a young man, get into trouble, be rescued by the goddess Isis, and then finds true knowledge and happiness in her mysteries. Like Plutarch, Apuleius seems to take for granted the existence of daemons. They populate the air and seem to, in fact, be formed of air. They experience emotions just like human beings, and despite this their minds are rational. In light of Apuleuis‚Äô experience it is worth noting that when magic is mentioned in Roman laws, it is always discussed in a negative context. A consensus was established quite early in Roman history for the banning of anything viewed as harmful acts of magic. The laws of the Twelve Tables (451‚Äì450 BCE) for example expressly forbid anyone from enticing his neighbors‚Äô crops into his fields by magic. An actual trial for alleged violation of these laws was held before Spurius Albinus in 157 BCE. It is also recorded that Cornelius Hispanus expelled the Chaldean astrologers from Rome in 139 BCE ostensibly on the grounds that they were magicians. In 33 BCE, astrologers and magicians are explicitly mentioned as having been driven from Rome. Twenty years later, Augustus ordered all books on the magical arts to be burned. In 16 CE magicians and astrologers were expelled from Italy, and this was reinstated by edicts of Vespasian in 69 CE and Domitian in 89 CE. The emperor Constantine I in the 4th century CE issued a ruling to cover all charges of magic. In it he distinguished between helpful charms, not punishable, and antagonistic spells. In these cases Roman authorities specifically decided what forms of magic were acceptable and which were not. Those that were not acceptable were termed \\"magic\\"; those that were acceptable were usually defined as traditions of the state or practices of the state's religions. == Summary == John Middleton argues in his article \\"Theories of Magic\\"\\" in the Encyclopaedia of Religion that: Magic is usually defined subjectively rather than by any agreed upon content. But there is a wide consensus as to what this content is. Most peoples in the world perform acts by which they intend to bring about certain events or conditions, whether in nature or among people, that they hold to be the consequences of those acts. Under this view, the various aspects of magic that described, despite how the term \\"magic\\" may be defined by various groupings within the Greco- Roman world, is in fact part of a broader cosmology shared by most people in the ancient world. But it is important to seek an understanding of the way that groups separate power from power, thus \\"magic\\" often describes an art or practices that are much more specific. This art is probably best described, as being the manipulation of physical objects and cosmic forces, through the recitation of formulas and incantations by a specialist (that is a magus) on behalf of him/herself or a client to bring about control over or action in the divine realms. The Magical texts examined in this article, then, are ritual texts designed to manipulate divine powers for the benefit of either the user or clients. Because this was something done in secret or with foreign methods these texts represent an art that was generally looked upon as illegitimate by official or mainstream magical cults in societies. == See also == * Curse tablet * Ephesia Grammata * Folk religion * Greek Magical Papyri * Magi * Magic and religion * Ancient Greek religion * Religion in ancient Rome * Sex magic * Theurgy * Alchemy ** Hermes Trismegistus * Goetia == Notes  References == ; Citations == Further reading == * Apollonius, Rhodius, and Peter Green.

This x-ray was taken for an unrelated assessment of wisdom teeth, and the Stafne defect was a chance finding. computed tomograph of the same person. The Stafne defect appears as a well corticated 1 cm round defect in the medial cortex of the mandible in the right angle of the jaw (arrowed). computed tomograph of the same person (Stafne defect arrowed). The Stafne defect (also termed Stafne's idiopathic bone cavity, Stafne bone cavity, Stafne bone cyst (misnomer), lingual mandibular salivary gland depression, lingual mandibular cortical defect, latent bone cyst, or static bone cyst) is a depression of the mandible, most commonly located on the lingual surface (the side nearest the tongue). The Stafne defect is thought to be a normal anatomical variant, as the depression is created by ectopic salivary gland tissue associated with the submandibular gland and does not represent a pathologic lesion as such. ==Classification== It is a classed as a pseudocyst, since there is no epithelial lining or fluid content. This defect is usually considered with other cysts of the jaws, since it can be mistaken for such on a radiograph. ==Signs and symptoms== There are no symptoms, and no signs can be elicited on examination. Medical imaging such as traditional radiography or computed tomography is required to demonstrate the defect. Usually the defect is unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral. ==Causes== The Stafne defect is thought to be caused by an ectopic portion of the submandibular salivary gland which causes the bone of the lingual cortical plate to remodel. Rarely, the defect can be completely surrounded by bone, and this has been theorized to be the result of entrapment of embryonic salivary gland tissue within the bone. Similar, but rarer, defects may be present in the anterior portion of the lingual surface of the mandible. These are not termed Stafne defects which specifically refers to the posterior location. The anterior defects may be associated with the sublingual salivary gland. ==Diagnosis== Stafne's defect is usually discovered by chance during routine dental radiography. Radiographically, it is a well-circumscribed, monolocular, round, radiolucent defect, 1‚Äì3 cm in size, usually between the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the inferior border of the posterior mandible between the molars and the angle of the jaw. It is one of the few radiolucent lesions that can occur below the IAN. The border is well corticated and it will have no effect on the surrounding structures. Computed tomography (CT) will show a shallow defect through the medial cortex of the mandible with a corticated rim and no soft tissue abnormalities, with the exception of a portion of the submandibular gland. Neoplasms, such as metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the submandibular lymph nodes or a salivary gland tumour, could create a similar appearance but rarely have such well defined borders and can usually be palpated in the floor of the mouth or submandibular triangle of the neck as a hard mass. CT and clinical exam is typically sufficient to distinguish between this and a Stafne defect. The Stafne defect also tends to not increase in size or change in radiographic appearance over time (hence the term \\"static bone cyst\\"), and this can be used to help confirm the diagnosis. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated, but if carried out, the histopathologic appearance is usually normal salivary gland tissue. Sometimes attempted biopsy of Stafne defects reveals an empty cavity (possibly because the gland was displaced at the time of biopsy), or other contents such as blood vessels, fat, lymphoid or connective tissues. Defects of the anterior lingual mandible may require biopsy for correct diagnosis at this unusual location. The radiolucent defect here may be superimposed on the lower anterior teeth and be mistaken for an odontogenic lesion. Sometimes the defect may interrupt the contour of the lower border of the mandible, and may be palpable. Sialography may be sometimes used to help demonstrate the salivary gland tissue within the bone. ==Treatment== No treatment is required, but neoplastic processes (metastatic malignancy to the submandibular lymph nodes and/or salivary gland tumours) should be ruled out. This is usually done with clinical exam and imaging. Very rarely, since the defect contains salivary gland tissue, salivary gland tumors can occur within an established defect but there is likely no difference in the risk of neoplasia in salivary gland tissue at other sites. ==Epidemiology== Stafne defect is uncommon, and has been reported to develop anywhere between the ages of 11 and 30 years old, (although the defect is developmental, it does not seem to be present from birth, implying that the lesion develops at a later age). Usually the defect is unilateral (on one side only) and most commonly occurs in men. ==History== This entity was first described in 1942 by Edward C. Stafne.Stafne, EC. _Bone cavities situated near the angle of the mandible_. JADA 1942;29:1969‚Äì1972.

The Bilston Glen Colliery produced coal for the British Empire, finally closing in 1989. It is located next to woodland and the Bilston Glen industrial estate. The village is overlooked by a tower which used be part of the Dryden House, which was set on a hill overlooking the River Forth. Bilston Burn is a tributary of the River North Esk. It flows east from the village, and the woods it runs through are classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). John Comyn stayed in the woods with his troops before the Battle of Roslin in 1303. There is also a cave reputed to have been used as a hiding place by William Wallace. Bilston has a primary school, Bilston Primary. Police Scotland run a control room at Bilston Glen and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland set up a coronavirus control centre there. ==Bypass and camp== A proposed bypass, taking the A701 east of the village from Straiton to Milton Bridge outside Penicuik, was put forward by Midlothian Council in 2000. It was included in the local development plan. One of the proposed routes of the bypass was through the SSSI woodland at Bilston Glen. Despite objections from local people and conservationists who submitted 700 objections, Midlothian Council and the Scottish Executive approved the route. It was challenged legally but the Scottish transport minister Sarah Boyack declined to open an inquiry about the ¬£18.5 million scheme. In response, Bilston Glen was occupied in 2002 in order to prevent the SSSI being destroyed. Ten years later, the camp was still there, with protestors careful not to build any permanent structures which would damage the woodland. It became known as one of the longest-running tree protection sites in the world.

In Middle English staddle or stadle is stathel, from Old English stathol, a foundation, support or trunk of a tree. They can be mainly found in England, Norway (\\"stabbur\\"), Galicia and Asturias (Northern Spain). == Origins == Staddle stone minus its top at The Coach House, Cunninghamhead The name itself and evidence from surviving vernacular buildings with wooden 'feet' suggest that at first the staddles or supports were made of wood, such as at Peper Harow granary in Surrey.Quiney, Anthony. (1995). The Traditional Buildings of England. Thames & Hudson. p.174. Stone staddles were longer lasting and a more reliable means of supporting structures which were sometimes a considerable weight. The name has become integrated into the landscape with bridges, houses, farms and other structures incorporating the name 'staddle'. ==Design== A cast iron Stathel at Wester Kittochside, near East Kilbride. The staddle stones usually had a separate head and base which gave the whole structure a 'mushroom' like appearance. Different areas in the United Kingdom had different designs. The base varied from cylindrical to tapered rectangular to near triangular. Flat topped cone shaped staddle stones are to be found in parts of the Isle of Wight. The tops are flat to support the beams, however some variation exists, such as square tops, fluted designs, slate tops, etc. Granary sitting on staddle stones at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum.A fine example is the English Granary built 1731, supported on staddle stones, which can be seen in the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum in West Sussex, UK. Such structures were common in Southern England in the 18th century. At Higher Farm in Heathfield, Tavistock, staddle stones are part of the substantial barns built by the Duke of Bedford in the 19th century. The dressed granite stone bases have specially hewn slate tops. The materials used depended on the stone available, giving rise to sandstone, red sandstone, granite examples, etc. The tower mill at Reigate on the Wray Common ceased to work in 1895. The mill had a granary standing next to it, supported by a large number of staddle stones.Bryan, Anthony (2006). Francis Frith's Windmills & Watermills. Pub. Frith Collection. . p. 91. The Museum of Scottish Country Life at Wester Kittochside near East Kilbride has two 'Stathels', made in Edinburgh of cast iron. The structure is basically a cast iron version of a set of staddle stones with its wooden framework. These rare survivals are still in use. ==Function== The base stones taper towards the top with an overlapping cap stone placed above, making it almost impossible for a rodent to climb up and into the hay or grain stored above. The air could freely circulate beneath the stored crops and this helped to keep it dry.Book of the British Countryside. Pub. London : Drive Publications, (1973). p. 213. A wood framework was placed onto the tops of the stones, the staddles being arranged in two or three rows, giving sixteen or more stones. The hayricks, Tithe barns, granaries, etc. were built on top of this frame. ===Granaries and beehives=== Staddle stones supporting beehives, circa 1880 These were often constructed with wooden weather-boards such as at Blaxland Farm in Sturry, Kent, which has nine staddles. However, if the grain was stored loose then the sides were filled in with brick nogging and light lath-and-plaster at the wall tops. Wooden steps up to the buildings were detachable and stored by hanging them up on the side of the structure. If stone or brick steps were built then the top step was not built, thus denying access to rats and other vermin. Some of these granaries had a 'cat flap' and others had a recess inside the steps which served as a dog kennel.Peters, J.E.C. (2003). Discovering Traditional Farm Buildings. Shire Publications. . Most granaries were used for the storage of two or three separate crops, having a capacity of 500 to 2500 bushels. The arrangement of the stones to support the structure and its weight when in use, required nine, twelve or sixteen staddles. The production of staddles was therefore a fairly significant local industry. Small granaries could make do with five, one being in the middle. The Upper Hexford granary in Oxfordshire uses thirty-six staddles. Beehives were often set on top of staddle stones to keep out predators and provide dry and airy conditions.Foster, A.M. (1988). Bee Boles and Bee Houses. Shire Publications. . p.9. ===Game larders=== Small staddle stones were used to support small roofed box-shaped game larders which were used on the larger estates for storage of game, such as pheasant, brought back by shooting parties, etc. H√≥rreo (Galician granary) on staddle stones ===Barns=== Timber-framed barns raised onto staddle stones were sometimes found in the south of England. Apart from the usual benefits it seems that some correlation between this barn type and the builder being a tenant exists. Being on staddles such barns remained the property of the tenant. In Galicia and Asturias (NW Spain), these barns are called h√≥rreos. ==Landscape gardening== Staddles are often found in architectural salvage yards as they may be seen as attractive structures. They are also sold new, being made from moulded concrete. Chainsaws are used to produce wooden 'staddle stones' for use as garden seats or ornaments. In this context the staddle stones are often called mushroom stones. ==Conservation== Staddle stones are often well over a century old and have developed a good lichen 'patina' with slow and fast growing species adhering to the surfaces. They are better not cleaned as the lichen flora is well worth preserving to add to the biodiversity of a garden scene. ===Surveyors marks=== Old land deeds in northeastern United States often refer to Oak Staddle or Walnut Staddle. These deeds are from the late 18th century to the middle 19th century. Either the owners would cut a tree leaving the stump and request that the surveyors measure to it, or the surveyor would measure out to the location of a new lot corner and a staddle would be inserted into the ground like a boundary stone. ==See also== * The Lands of Cunninghamhead.

In the generalized form, all teeth are involved. In the localized form, only a few teeth are involved. The most common teeth affected are the upper lateral incisors and third molars. Teeth affected by microdontia may also have abnormal shape, and the abnormal size may affect the whole tooth, or only a part of the tooth. ==Definition== Males tend to have larger teeth than females, and tooth size also varies according to race. Abnormal tooth size is defined by some as when the dimensions are more than 2 standard deviations from the average. Microdontia is when the teeth are abnormally small, and macrodontia is when the teeth are abnormally large. ==Classification== There are 3 types of microdontia: ===True generalized=== All the teeth are smaller than the normal size. True generalized microdontia is very rare, and occurs in pituitary dwarfism. Due to decreased levels of growth hormone the teeth fail to develop to a normal size. ===Relative generalized=== All the teeth are normal size but appear smaller relative to enlarged jaws. Relative generalized microdontia may be the result of inheritance of a large jaw from one parent, and normal sized teeth from the other. ===Localized (focal)=== Localized microdontia is also termed focal, or pseudo-microdontia. A single tooth is smaller than normal. Localized microdontia is far more common than generalized microdontia, and is often associated with hypodontia (reduced number of teeth). The most commonly involved tooth in localized microdontia is the maxillary lateral incisor, which may also be shaped like an inverted cone (a \\"peg lateral\\"). Peg laterals typically occur on both sides, and have short roots. Inheritance may be involved, and the frequency of microdontia in the upper laterals is just under 1%. The second most commonly involved tooth is the maxillary third molars, and after this supernumerary teeth. ==Causes== There are many potential factors involved. * Congenital hypopituitarism * Ectodermal dysplasia * Down syndrome * Ionizing radiation to the jaws during tooth development (odontogenesis) * Chemotherapy during tooth development * Marshall syndrome * Rieger syndrome * Focal dermal hypoplasia * Silver-Russell syndrome * Williams syndrome * Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome * Coffin‚ÄìSiris syndrome * Salamon syndrome * Cleft lip and palate Others include trichorhinopharyngeal, odontotrichomelic, neuroectodermal and dermo- odontodysplasia syndromes. ==Treatment== Unerupted microdonts may require surgical removal to prevent the formation of cysts. Erupted microdonts, peg laterals especially, may cause cosmetic concern. Such teeth may be restored to resemble normal sized teeth, typically with composite build ups or crowns. Orthodontics may be required in severe cases to close gaps between the teeth. ==Epidemiology== Females are affected more than males, and the condition occurs in permanent (adult) teeth more than deciduous (baby teeth or milk teeth). ==References External links == Category:Developmental tooth disorders ","title":"Microdontia"},{"id":"7454947","text":"First edition of Juditha triumphans Juditha triumphans devicta Holofernis barbarie (Judith triumphant over the barbarians of Holofernes), RV 644, is an oratorio by Antonio Vivaldi, the only survivor of the four that he is known to have composed. Although the rest of the oratorio survives completely intact, the overture has been lost. The Latin libretto was written by Iacopo Cassetti based upon the Book of Judith. The exact date of composition and performance of Juditha triumphans are not known, but the allegorical treatment of the Venetian defense of Corfu dominated public discussion in Venice throughout 1716. This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians (the Christians) over the Turks in August 1716. The work was commissioned to celebrate the victory of the Republic of Venice over the Turks during the siege of Corfu: in July 1716, the Turks had landed on Corfu and set siege to the island. The population resisted the occupation and, in August, Venice signed an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. On 18 August, under the leadership of count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, the decisive battle was won and the Turks abandoned the island. Although widely reported to have been performed at the Ospedale della Piet√† in November 1716, the victorious General Schulenburg could not have been in the audience of any performance prior to January 3, 1717. ==Score== All characters, male and female, were interpreted by women of the Ospedale della Piet√†. They are: * Juditha, contralto, a young Bethulian widow * Holofernes, contralto, Assyrian general * Vagaus, soprano, eunuch, Holofernes's squire * Abra, soprano, Juditha's handmaid * Ozias, contralto, high priest of Bethulia An all-female choir sings the parts of the Assyrian soldiers and of the Bethulian women. The string orchestra is augmented by timpani, 2 trumpets, mandolino, 4 theorbos, 5 lyra viols (viols), 1 viola d'amore, 2 recorders, 2 chalumeaux (soprano), 2 oboes, organ. ==Plot== The Assyrian king Nebuchadnezzar sends an army against Israel to demand overdue tributes. Under the leadership of the general Holofernes, the Assyrians lay siege to the town of Bethulia and are about to conquer it. The young Jewish widow Judith goes to him to implore mercy. He falls in love with her and she indulges him. After a rich banquet and having drunk much wine, Holofernes falls asleep. Judith beheads him, flees the enemy camp, and returns victorious to Bethulia. ==Recordings== * 1941: Elena Nicolai (J), Antenore Reali (H), Gino del Signore (V), Rina Corsi (A), Antonio Cassinelli (O); Orchestra dell'Accademia Musicale Chigiana / Unione Corale Senese e Piccolo Coro dell'Accademia di Santa Cecilia di Roma - Vittorio Baglioni (maestro del coro); Antonio Guarnieri (conductor) ‚Äî Fonitcetra. * 1951: Maria Amadini (J), Marcello Cortis (H), Emilio Cristinelli (V), Rosanna Giancola (A), Giuliano Ferrein (O); Chorus of the Teatro La Fenice, Venice / Symphony Orchestra of the Scuola Veneziana - Angelo Ephrikian ‚Äî The Opera Society. * 1964: Zsuzsa Barlay (J), Zsolt Bende (H), J√≥szef R√©ti (V), Margit L√°szl√≥ (A), J√≥szef Dene (O); Budapest Madrigal Choir (Gy√∂rgy Czig√°ny) / Hungarian State Orchestra - Ferenc Szekeres ‚Äî Hungaroton. * 1968: Oralia Dominguez (J), Irene Compa√±ez (H), Bianca Maria Casoni (V), Emilia Cundari (A), Maria Grazia Allegri (O); Chorus of the Accademia Filarmonica Romana (Luigi Colacicchi) / Angelicum Chamber Orchestra - Alberto Zedda ‚Äî Angelicum. * 1974: Birgit Finnil√§ (J), Julia Hamari (H), Elly Ameling (V), Ingeborg Springer (A), Annelies Burmeister (O); Rundfunks-Solistenvereinigung Berlin (Dietrich Knothe) / Berlin Chamber Orchestra - Vittorio Negri ‚Äî Philips Classics. * 1976: Verena Piller (J), Philippe Huttenlocher (H), Pierre-Andr√© Blaser (V), Kathrin Graf (A); Ensemble Alauda de Gen√®ve (Jean-Louis Rebut) / Collegium Academicum de Gen√®ve - Robert Dunand ‚Äî Concert Hall. * 1990: Gloria Banditelli (J), Judit N√©meth (H), Annette Markert (V), Maria Z√°dori (A), Katalin G√©mes (O); Savaria Vocal Ensemble (Istv√°n De√°ky) / Capella Savaria - Nicholas McGegan ‚Äî Hungaroton. * 1997: Ann Murray (J), Susan Bickley (H), Mar√≠a Cristina Kiehr (V), Sarah Connolly (A), Jean Rigby (O); The Choir of the King's Consort / The King's Consort - Robert King ‚Äî Hyperion. * 2000: Magdalena Ko≈æen√° (J), Maria Jos√© Trullu (H), Marina Comparato (V), Anke Herrmann (A), Tiziana Carraro (O); Coro da Camera dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (Martino Faggiani) / Montis Regalis Academy - Alessandro de Marchi ‚Äî Opus 111 / Naive. * 2000: Barbara di Castri (J), Lucia Sciannimanico (H), Nicki Kennedy (V), Alessandra Rossi (A), Rowena Anketell (O); Coro da Camera Italiano, Roma / Modo Antiquo - Federico Maria Sardelli ‚Äî Amadeus. * 2001: Delores Ziegler (J), Gloria Banditelli (H), Cecilia Gasdia (V), Manuela Custer (A), Laura Brioli (O); Coro Filarmonico Antonio Vivaldi (Giampaolo Grazioli)/I Solisti Veneti; Claudio Scimone ‚Äî Warner Fonit. * 2007: Sara Mingardo (J), Guillemette Laurens (H), Roberta Invernizzi (V), Manuela Custer (A), Tiziana Pizzi (O); Coro della Radio Svizzera / I Barocchisti - Diego Fasolis ‚Äî RTSI Multimedia. * 2007: Sally-Anne Russell (J), David Walker (H), Fiona Campbell (V), Sara Macliver (A), Ren√©e Martin (O); Cantillation / Orchestra of the Antipodes - Attilio Cremonesi ‚Äî ABC Classics. * 2019: Marianne Beate Kielland (J), Marina de Liso (H), Rachel Redmond (V), Luc√≠a Mart√≠n-Cart√≥n (A), Kristin Mulders (O); La Capella Reial de Catalunya / Le Concert des Nations - Jordi Savall ‚Äî Alia Vox. ==References== * Gianfranco Formichetti, Venezia e il prete col violino.

His parents owned a ventorrillo (rudimentary market stall) that sold homemade foodstuff such as pi√±onate, a local delicacy made of sweetened pine-nut kernels. Most of these were sold on the street by Gregorio and his siblings in order to help the family livelihood. Around the age of 14, Gregorio began working for Pedro Eduardo Dubocq, a local timber businessman of French origin. While working there, he displayed a strong strength of character and a knack for getting any job assigned to him completed in the best possible fashion. Because of this, Mr. Dubocq promoted Gregorio to a management position. Mr. Dubocq also allowed Gregorio to spend time in his personal library because Gregorio wanted to enrich his intellect. In 1861, the annexation of the Dominican Republic by Spain took place. Gregorio was only 22 years old at the time but a sense of nationalism began to swell within him. During one instance, Gregorio was arrested but managed to escape and flee to the United States for protection. Shortly thereafter, Gregorio managed to return to the Dominican Republic through the town of Monte Cristi in time to take part in the uprising of Sabaneta (1863). However, this uprising was short-lived due to the quick Spanish response. After the failure at Sabaneta, Gregorio and his compatriots hid in the mountains of La Vega in order to prepare for a full-scale revolution against the Spanish forces. ==Legacy== The Gregorio Luper√≥n International Airport in Puerto Plata, a metro station in Santo Domingo, and the Gregorio Luper√≥n High School for Math & Science in New York are named after him. The small city of Luperon, located 50 km west of Puerto Plata, is also named after him. ==References External links == * - Category:1839 births Category:1897 deaths Category:People from Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic Category:Presidents of the Dominican Republic Category:Vice Presidents of the Dominican Republic Category:Dominican Republic military personnel Category:Independence activists ","title":"Gregorio Luper√≥n"},{"id":"7454951","text":"Macrodontia is a type of localized gigantism in which teeth are larger than normal for the particular type(s) of teeth involved. The three types of macrodontia are true generalized macrodontia, relative generalized macrodontia, and macrodontia of a single tooth. True generalized macrodontia is very rare. Macrodontia of a single tooth is more common. Some kind of macrodontia in the permanent dentition occurs in 1.1% of the total population. It should not be confused with taurodontism (bull teeth), fusion (double tooth) or the jaws being relatively small, giving the appearance of macrodontia. ==Definition== Males tend to have larger teeth than females, and tooth size also varies according to race. Abnormal tooth size is defined by some as when the dimensions are more than 2 standard deviations from the average. Macrodontia is when the teeth are abnormally large, and microdontia is when they are abnormally small. It may cause different types of bites and crowding of the teeth. This is best investigated using radiographs. ==Complications== The usual complications of macrodontia are associated with crowding, malocclusion and impaction unless treated. == Types  True generalized === In true generalized macrodontia, all teeth grow in larger than normal. This is seen in cases of growth hormone excess called pituitary gigantism. It is the rarest of the types. . Other patients may have a disease called Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome which predisposes to generalised macrodontia. This causes insulin resistance and is an autosomal recessive disorder. === Relative generalized=== All teeth appear slightly larger than normal; usually, the jaws are smaller than average. It is sometimes called \\"pseudomacrodontia\\", as small jaws give the illusion that the teeth are abnormally large. Genetics play a major role in this type of macrodontia; offspring inherit small jaw size from one parent and relatively large teeth from the other parent. === Single tooth === A single tooth is larger than the rest. This is unusual and could be the result of fusion and germination that cause enlarged crowns. ==Causes== Macrodontia of a single tooth is attributed to a disturbance of morphodifferentiation. Generalized macrodontia is usually attributed to some hormonal imbalance (e.g., pituitary gigantism). It can also be associated with facial hemihyperplasia. Macrodontia stems from systematic disturbances. These include KBG syndrome, otodental syndrome, and insulin- resistant diabetes. Ethnicity and gender also factors that influence macrodontia. Asians and males are more likely to be affected. ==Treatment== Before treatment the correct diagnosis must be made which is easily done by a radiograph. It can be seen the tooth/teeth concerned will be larger than normal which can be seen clinically in the mouth or whilst they are unerupted. Teeth affected by macrodontia are either contoured, aligned or extracted. Contouring involves shaving the tooth down to change shape and size. However, the result is minimal change as this could be dangerous for the dentin and dental pulp. Aligning involves the use of braces to straighten, align, and make space for larger teeth to grow.

Around 190 BC, under the king Artashes I, Armenia conquered Vaspurakan and Paytakaran from Media, Acilisene from Cataonia, and Taron from Syria. Some have suggested that Utik was among the provinces conquered by Artashes I at this time, though Strabo doesn't list Utik among Artashes' conquests. King Urnayr of Caucasian Albania invaded Utik. But in 370 AD, the Armenian sparapet Mushegh Mamikonyan defeated the Albanians, restoring the frontier back to the river Kura.Pavstos Buzand, \\"History of Armenia,\\" 5.13, 4th century AD. In 387 AD, the Sassanid Empire helped the Albanians to seize from the Kingdom of Armenia a number of provinces, including Utik.

However, Ancient Greco-Roman writers placed the Udis beyond Utik, north of the Kura River. Pliny the Elder names both the Uti and the Udini among the tribes living in eastern Transcaucasia and calls the latter a Scythian tribe (\\"Scytharum populus\\"). This suggests the possibility that some Iranian-speaking or, less likely, Finnic peoples may have settled in the area and adopted the language of the local Caucasian population).More likely, however, the terms refer not to any specific ethnic group in the modern sense but simply the inhabitants of the eponymous region. ==See also== *List of regions of old Armenia ==References== Category:Provinces of the Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity) Category:Ancient history of Azerbaijan ","title":"Utik"},{"id":"7454971","text":"Mamadou 'Madinho' Dansoko (born July 31, 1982 in Abidjan) is a football winger who last plays for United Arab Emirates club Al-Hissan. == Career == He began his career at ASEC Abidjan, a club based in Ivory Coast which is famed for its Youth Academy started by Jean-Marc Guillou, playing alongside the likes of Kolo Tour√©, before moving to Europe to play for K.S.K.

He tells them the facts of the \\"crime of the century\\" that sent him to prison thirty-five years earlier (\\"Why\\"). But this time he reveals more than ever, hoping it will lead to his release. In his memory, he goes back to 1924 Chicago, where, as a nineteen- year-old boy, he anxiously meets up with Richard Loeb, a classmate with whom he has shared friendship, sex and participation in minor crimes. Richard, who has been away at college, treats Nathan indifferently. Nathan begs to renew their relationship before separating again after the summer to attend different law schools (\\"Everybody Wants Richard\\"). Richard relents and allows Nathan to join in his activity for the evening ‚Äì setting an abandoned warehouse on fire. In front of the blaze (\\"Nothing Like a Fire\\"), which arouses Richard, Nathan finally gets what he wants. The next day, Nathan implores Richard, who is voraciously reading Nietzsche, to stop the criminal activity. Instead Richard, now empowered by the theory of the Superman, threatens to drop Nathan completely unless they create \\"A Written Contract\\" detailing that Richard will satisfy Nathan's sexual needs only in exchange for Nathan's expertise as his accomplice in petty crimes. Reluctantly, Nathan agrees. They sign in blood and their crime spree continues until Richard fails to live up to his end of the agreement (\\"Thrill Me\\"). Richard explains that he is bored with the misdemeanors and wants to commit a \\"superior\\" crime: the murder of a young boy (\\"The Plan\\") and a phony ransom scheme after the killing. Richard insists that their intellect and meticulous plotting will prevent them from being caught. Nathan has no choice but to agree or risk Richard's wrath. Back in 1958 at Joliet before the Parole Board, Nathan explains his feelings (\\"Way Too Far\\") as he recalls how Richard prepared the murder weapons and supplies: rope, a crowbar and a bottle of acid. Richard lures the victim by promising a ride in his \\"Roadster\\". While cleaning up the murder scene, Richard extols the virtues of being \\"Superior\\" to a shaken Nathan. Back at Richard's house they compose the bogus \\"Ransom Note\\" and proceed with their plans. The next day, the newspapers reveal that, despite their careful planning, the body has been found. As a few more days go by, Nathan's missing eyeglasses are discovered near the scene of the crime. While Nathan panics, Richard tries to calm him (\\"My Glasses/Just Lay Low\\") over the phone. When the glasses are eventually traced to Nathan, Richard helps him concoct an emergency alibi and coaches him in how to answer the cops (\\"I'm Trying to Think\\"). After Nathan is successful with the police, Richard declares their relationship over so he can protect his future as a lawyer. He reminds Nathan that everything would have been fine if the glasses hadn't been dropped. Feeling betrayed, Nathan cuts a deal with prosecutors, turning in Richard in exchange for a lighter sentence. When arrested, Richard realizes there is no way out and works his charms on Nathan (\\"Keep Your Deal With Me\\") by convincing him to give up the deal and accept the same punishment. While awaiting the penalty trail in his jail cell, Richard doesn't realize Nathan can hear him muttering to himself that he is truly \\"Afraid\\" despite his strong fa√ßade. Thanks to the cunning strategies of their lawyer, Clarence Darrow, they escape the death penalty and are sentenced to prison. Behind bars, Nathan finally reveals his own shocking plan: fearing the loss of Richard, he went along with the murder but stayed one step ahead the entire time, even deliberately planting his glasses, knowing that all this would ensure his desire to be together forever, or at least for \\"Life Plus 99 Years\\". Now that the whole truth has finally been exposed, back at Joliet prison Nathan is granted parole. It is a bittersweet victory; since Richard was murdered by another inmate years before, Nathan must face the outside world alone (\\"Finale\\"). ==Song list== *Prelude *Why- Nathan *Everybody Wants Richard- Nathan *Nothing Like a Fire- Richard and Nathan *A Written Contract- Richard and Nathan *Thrill Me- Nathan and Richard *The Plan- Richard and Nathan *Way Too Far- Nathan *Roadster- Richard *Superior- Nathan and Richard *Ransom Note- Richard and Nathan *My Glasses/Just Lay Low- Nathan and Richard *I'm Trying to Think- Richard and Nathan *Way Too Far (reprise)- Nathan *Keep Your Deal With Me- Richard and Nathan *Afraid- Richard *Life Plus 99 Years/Finale- Nathan and Richard ==Critical reception== The piece garnered some very positive reviews.

Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch, arresting and a bit breathtaking.... Credit [the] lean approach to the storytelling....

But because AM 1510 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WLAC in Nashville, WRNJ must reduce power at night to 230 watts. Programming is also heard on three FM translator stations: 92.7 W224AS in Washington, 104.7 W284AQ in Hackettstown and 105.7 W289CR in Glen Gardner. ==Programming== WRNJ plays mostly adult contemporary music and classic hits from previous decades. The library includes hits from the 1980s to the present. The station features world and national news from ABC News Radio at the beginning of every hour. Live local news airs after ABC News on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. News Director Joyce Estey, who has been at the station since March 1998, anchors the mornings and Tom O'Halloren anchors afternoons and evenings. The station's news staff received several awards for coverage in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. While the power was out, staff slept overnight at the station to keep providing updates to listeners. ==FM translators== In addition to its main signal on 1510 AM, WRNJ broadcasts on the following FM translators: The radio station can also be heard on the station's website and the TuneIn app. ==HistoryOriginal 1510 Morris County license=== The original station, known as WRAN (representing its location in RANdolph Township) had an unusual signal day and night. During the day the station transmitted at 10,000 watts, using a very directional signal resembling an hourglass. The station reached about 10 miles east and west but about 50 miles north and south. Some places 30 miles away from WRAN's transmitter had a better signal than some points only 10 miles away. At night the station only put out 500 watts and reached about 10 miles all around. 1510 WRAN signed on the air on August 19, 1964, using a full service Contemporary Hits/Top 40 format. It was licensed to Dover, New Jersey. By the 1970s, the station switched to a hybrid format of adult contemporary, Top 40, and oldies. Over time, the station moved closer to all oldies. WRAN called itself \\"Solid Gold WRAN\\" at one point. It was locally owned until 1980 when Sillerman and Morrow Broadcasting (owned by Cousin Brucie Morrow) purchased it, along with several other AM and FM radio stations in the New York City metropolitan area. WRAN was upgraded with new equipment and the music was adjusted. But the Top 40/AC/Oldies hybrid format continued. Sillerman and Morrow sold WRAN along with their other stations to Bell Broadcasting in 1982. In 1984 WRAN was sold to Saddle River Holdings. The station was profitable under Cousin Brucie, but once he was no longer associated with WRAN, many advertisers pulled their commercials from the station. WRAN continued on with an adult contemporary format until the spring of 1987. At that point the station switched to an oldies format using satellite programming most of the time. The station at that point became WMHQ. Saddle River Holdings eventually put WMHQ up for sale in 1988, but no one was interested in the station. As a result, the station was taken dark and the license was returned to the FCC. A website devoted to the history of the Dover station, which includes jingles, photos, and memorabilia, was created by a former employee. ===AM 1000 license=== WRNJ began operation on AM 1000 on August 26, 1976. It was a daytime only station with no pre-sunrise or post- sunset authorization, except for local emergencies. WRNJ employed a full service adult contemporary format with an emphasis on local and national news. WRNJ also had local talk shows featuring local leaders and volunteers. Larry Tighe originally owned the radio station. For many years WRNJ was not profitable. By the early 1980s, there were rumors that the station may even go dark. At that point, Norman Worth, who was the only person selling a substantial amount of advertising, became sales manager. Months later the station began turning a profit. By the late 1980s, Worth became part owner of the station and took over as General Manager and eventually as Chief Operating Officer. In 1992, Worth was awarded an FM license on 107.1 FM. That station became WRNJ-FM and aired a country music format. In 1996, WRNJ AM was granted a 24-hour license on 1510 kHz. AM 1000 to Westinghouse Broadcasting, freeing the company to boost the power of its New York City AM station WINS 1010. That year, WRNJ moved from AM 1000 to 1510. It kept the Adult Contemporary format initially. It also began operating from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. In 1997, it was determined that the station's towers could not transmit the correct nighttime patterns. WRNJ reverted to daytime-only operation. The current music also was phased out and the station evolved to more of an oldies format. By 1998, it was known as \\"Oldies 1510 WRNJ\\". The station still continued to be profitable despite the daytime only operation. At the same time, management sold the FM station at 107.1 MHz to Big City Radio. WRNJ-FM became WWYY and joined the Country Music Y 107 triplecast making that station a quadcast. It switched to a Spanish-language tropical music format in 2002. In 2003 those stations were sold to Nassau and Nassau broke up the quadcast. Today the station is licensed to Belvidere, but broadcasts from Stroudsburg. It simulcasts country station WCTO in Easton, Pennsylvania. In 1999, Oldies 1510 WRNJ bagan 24-hour-a-day operations. It aired satellite-delivered oldies programming for much of the day. But WRNJ retained its morning show, specialty shows, local news, and local talk shows. In 2004, WRNJ dropped the satellite programming. It aired a full-service format that plays adult contemporary but talk shows were also featured. The sale of WRNJ-FM in 1998 excluded the FM translators on 92.7 in Washington Township and on 104.7 in Hackettstown. WRNJ's owners retained these to rebroadcast the AM signal. In 2009, the oldies format evolved to a classic hits format focusing on 1970s and '80s hits. In 2014, the station returned to a mix of adult contemporary and classic hits, with the slogan \\"Today's Hits and Yesterday's Favorites.\\" The playlist was mostly from the '80s, '90s, and 2000s, but with a few titles from the '60s and '70s. ==Notable air personalities== * Russ Long * Bernie Wagenblast * Deirdre Bryant (later with ABC News Radio) * Kevin Scholla * Rick Adams (News) * Jim West * Ken Griffin * Bill Summers * Jeff Grant * David Kendall (1984 - 1986 at WRNJ-1000) * Vince Santarelli (Morning Host 1983 - 1985) * Jeff Yablon (The Computer Answer Guy - 1995-2000) * Larry Daniels (Morning Host 1981-1983) * Harlin Jeffries (Sports Director 2004-2012) * Jay Edwards ==ReferencesExternal links== *WRNJ Radio homepage Category:Radio stations established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in New Jersey Category:Hackettstown, New Jersey RNJ Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States ","title":"WRNJ"},{"id":"7455050","text":"Nighthawk Records was an American independent record label, founded by Robert Schoenfeld who began operations in 1976 with the release of four vintage post- war blues reissue albums.

In 1948, Roberto Gonz√°lez and Aldo V√°zquez, neighbors of Nueva Pompeya at the south of Buenos Aires, decided to form a football team to play the Evita championships. V√°zquez played at River Plate lower divisions and contacted former player Carlos Peucelle (who was the coordinator by then) with the objective of River Plate allowed some of its players to play for the recently formed team. The name \\"Sacachispas\\" was taken from the fictitious squad that starred in Pelota de Trapo, a movie that had been a huge success in Argentina. Sacachispas reached the Evita championship final at Estadio Monumental, with president Juan Per√≥n and his wife Eva Duarte (who had given her name to the tournament) attending the match. After Per√≥n noted that Sacachispas did not have a field, he made the arrangements to get a land where the club could build a stadium. The first stadium was built in Lacarra and Corrales Avenue. The club set an official date of foundation on October 17, 1948, as a tribute to Per√≥n's intercession. Sacachispas affiliated to the Argentine Football Association in 1954, winning the Primera D tournament in its debut season. Nevertheless, Sacachispas has never reached the Primera Divisi√≥n.

It usually involves only two teeth. The most commonly involved teeth are upper second and third molars. The prevalence rate is 0.04%. == Signs and symptoms == * Occlusion problems causing cheek biting and traumatic ulcers. * Involved teeth may have difficulty erupting or may not erupt completely. * May possibly cause localized periodontal destruction due to aetiological factors. * May cause fracture of the tuberosity or floor of the maxillary sinus. == Cause == This condition arises as the result of traumatic injury or overcrowding of teeth. True concrescence occurs during root formation phase, whereas acquired concrescence occurs after the radicular phase of development is complete. == Diagnosis == It is difficult to diagnose clinically. Radiographs taken at different angles can aid detection of concrescence. Histological examination for extracted teeth could confirm diagnosis. == Treatment == If the condition is not affecting the patient, no treatment is needed.

Profiles describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection space (PCS). This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or CIEXYZ. Mappings may be specified using tables, to which interpolation is applied, or through a series of parameters for transformations. Every device that captures or displays color can be profiled. Some manufacturers provide profiles for their products, and there are several products that allow an end-user to generate his or her own color profiles, typically through the use of a tristimulus colorimeter or a spectrophotometer (sometimes called a spectrocolorimeter). The ICC defines the format precisely but does not define algorithms or processing details. This means there is room for variation between different applications and systems that work with ICC profiles. Two main generations are used: the legacy ICCv2 and the December 2001 ICCv4. Since late 2010, the current version of the format specification (ICC.1) is 4.3.Version 4 ICC Specification ICC has also published a preliminary specification for iccMAX (ICC.2) or ICCv5, a next-generation color management architecture with significantly expanded functionality and a choice of colorimetric, spectral or material connection space.Details are at http://www.color.org/iccmax/. == Details == A 3D view of two ICC profiles To see how this works in practice, suppose we have a particular RGB and CMYK color space, and want to convert from this RGB to that CMYK. The first step is to obtain the two ICC profiles concerned. To perform the conversion, each RGB triplet is first converted to the Profile connection space (PCS) using the RGB profile. If necessary the PCS is converted between CIELAB and CIEXYZ, a well defined transformation. Then the PCS is converted to the four values of C,M,Y,K required using the second profile. So a profile is essentially a mapping from a color space to the PCS, and from the PCS to the color space. The profile might do this using tables of color values to be interpolated (separate tables will be needed for the conversion in each direction), or using a series of mathematical formulae. A profile might define several mappings, according to rendering intent. These mappings allow a choice between closest possible color matching, and remapping the entire color range to allow for different gamuts. The reference illuminant of the Profile connection space (PCS) is a 16-bit fractional approximation of D50;Specification ICC.1:2004-10 (Profile version 4.2.0.0) Image technology colour management ‚Äî Architecture, profile format, and data structure; its white point is XYZ=(0.9642, 1.000, 0.8249). Different source/destination white points are adapted using the Bradford transformation. Another kind of profile is the device link profile. Instead of mapping between a device color space and a PCS, it maps between two specific device spaces. While this is less flexible, it allows for a more accurate or purposeful conversion of color between devices. For example, a conversion between two CMYK devices could ensure that colors using only black ink convert to target colors using only black ink. == References in standards == The ICC profile specification, currently being progressed as International Standard ISO 15076-1:2005,ICC profile specification published as ISO 15076-1:2005ISO 15076-1:2005.

Coming to New Spain as part of a government-sponsored botanical expedition, he fell out with his superiors and struck off on his own. He traveled from Cabo San Lucas to Monterey between January and September 1792. Although some sources state that Longinos performed cataract surgery in New Spain, available evidence indicates that he managed cataracts conservatively. However, he favored the procedure of cataract extraction over that of couching, and may have encouraged Narciso Esparragosa of Guatemala to begin performing cataract extractions. Perhaps because of the rapidity of his journey, his account of the region was sometimes superficial, second-hand, or inaccurate. Nonetheless, it documented substantial otherwise-lost information, particularly on the lifeways of the native peoples. Longinos travelled to Guatemala in 1795.

The prevalence of condition is 0.3 - 10%, affecting more males than females. The condition is presented in two forms, coronal and radicular, with the coronal form being more common. DI is a malformation of teeth most likely resulting from an infolding of the dental papilla during tooth development or invagination of all layers of the enamel organ in dental papillae. Affected teeth show a deep infolding of enamel and dentine starting from the foramen coecum or even the tip of the cusps and which may extend deep into the root. Teeth most affected are maxillary lateral incisors (80%), followed by maxillary canines (20%). Bilateral occurrence is not uncommon (25%). ==Signs and symptoms== Tooth affected by this condition has a higher risk of developing caries and periradicular pathology. The thin layer of the infolding enamel could be chipped off easily, providing entrance for microorganisms into the tooth canal. This can cause abscess formation, displacement of dental structures (i.e. teeth). Preventive measures should be taken. ==Cause== Cause of DI is unclear. However, there are several theories: *Infection *Trauma *Growth pressure of the dental arches during odontogenesis *Rapid proliferation of the internal enamel epithelium invades the underlying dental papilla ==Diagnosis== During clinical examination, abnormally shaped tooth can be observed. Tooth with this condition can have a conical shape or deep pit on the lingual side or have an exaggerated talon cusp. Although examination may reveal a fissure on the surface of anterior tooth, radiographic examination is the way.Radicular Dens Invaginatus: Report of a Rare Case https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crid/2012/871937/ On a periapical radiograph, the invagination lesion will appear as a radiolucent pocket. It is usually seen beneath the cingulum or incisal edge. Larger lesions can appear as fissures. A radio-opaque could be shown. Pulp may be involved and the root canal could have complex anatomy. Two periapical radiographs are often required to make sure that it is not a masked lesion. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is useful in diagnosing DI. It provides clinicians a detailed 3D image and could aid treatment planning. Feasibility of root canal treatment or apical surgery or other procedures could be assessed. ===Oehler's classification=== *Class I - Partial invagination. It is limited to the crown of tooth. The lesion does not extend pass the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or the pulp. *Class II - Partial invagination. It extends beyond the crown and CEJ. Pulp may be involved but remain within the root anatomy. There is no communication of the lesion with periodontal ligament (PDL). *Class IIIa - Complete invagination.

Premolars are more likely to be affected than any other tooth. It could occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Dens evaginatus (DE) typically occurs bilaterally and symmetrically. This may be seen more frequently in Asians (including Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, Filipino and Indian populations). The prevalence of DE ranges from 0.06% to 7.7% depending on the race. It is more common in men than in women, more frequent in the mandibular teeth than the maxillary teeth. Patients with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti achromians, Mohr syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Sturge Weber syndrome are at a higher risk of having DE. == Signs and symptoms == It is important to diagnose DE early and provide appropriate treatment to help prevent periodontal disease, caries, pulpal complications and malocclusion. It occurs on the cingulum/occlusal surface of the teeth. The extra cusp can cause occlusal interference, displace of the affected tooth and/or opposing teeth, irritates the tongue when speaking and eating and decay the developmental grooves. Temporomandibular joint pain could be experienced secondarily due to occlusal trauma caused by the tubercle. This cusp could be worn away or fractured easily. In 70% of the cases, the fine pulpal extension were exposed which can lead to infection, pulpal necrosis and periapical pathosis. === Associated anomalies === * Additional tubercules * Aesthetic and/or occlusion problems * Agenesis * Bifid cingula * Exaggerated cusp of Carabelli * Gemination * Impaction * Labial drifting * Labial groove * Mesiodens * Megadont * Odontoma * Peg-shaped lateral incisor * Prominent marginal ridge * Shallow groove in the lateral incisor * Shovel-shaped incisor * Supernumerary == Cause == The cause of DE is still unclear. There is literature indicating that DE is an isolated anomaly. During the bell stage of tooth formation, DE may occur as a result of an unusual growth and folding of the inner enamel epithelium and ectomesenchymal cells of dental papilla into the stellate reticulum of the enamel organ. == Diagnosis == Diagnosis of DE can be difficult when there is no signs and symptoms of necrotic or infected pulp. It is a challenging task to differentiate between a true periapical lesion and a normal periapical radiolucency of a dental follicle of an immature apex. * Pulp tests (test results of immature teeth can be misleading, as they are known to give unreliable results) * Check and see if there is ant elevated, flat wear facet on the occlusal surface of the tooth * Test cavity which has an absence of pain sensation and has an empty pulp chamber/ canal. * Radiographs (usually periapical) - a V-shaped radiopaque structure could be seen superimposing on top of the affected crown. It could detect DE before tooth eruption. However, DE presentation on the radiograph can be quite similar to a mesiodens or a compound odontoma. === Classification === The anterior DE tubercles have an average width of 3.5mm and length of 6.0mm, while posterior tubercles have an average 2.0mm in width and length of up to 3.5mm. If the cusp of Carabelli is present, the tooth associated are often larger mesiodistally and it is not uncommon that a DE involved tooth has an abnormal root pattern. There are 4 different ways to classify/ categorize DE involved teeth. # Schulge (1987) classification, teeth falls into 5 categories according to the location of the tubercles #* #* Tubercle on the inclined plane of the lingual cusp #* Cone-like enlargement of the buccal cusp #* Tubercle on the inclined plane of the buccal cusp #* Tubercle arising from the occlusal surface obliterating the central groove # Lau's classification, divide teeth into groups according to their anatomical shape #* Smooth #* Grooved #* Terraced #* Ridged # Oehlers classification, teeth categorized depending on the pulp contents within the tubercle (histological appearance of the pulps were examined) #* Wide pulp horns (34%) #* Narrow pulp horns (22%) #* Constricted pulp horns (14%) #* Isolated pulp horn remnants (20%) #* No pulp horn (10%) # Hattab et al. classification #*Anterior teeth #** Type 1 - Talon, a well defined additional cusp that projects palatally and extends at least half the distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the incisal edge #** Type 2 - Semitalon, an additional cusp that extends less than half the distance from the CEJ to the incisal edge #** Type 3 - Trace talon, prominent cingula #* Posterior teeth #** Occlusal DE #** Buccal DE #** Palatal DE/ Lingual DE == Management == If the tooth involved is asymptomatic or small, no treatment is needed and a preventative approach should be taken. Preventative measures include: * Oral hygiene instruction * Scaling and polishing * Application of topical fluoride on reduced cusp * Application of fissure sealant * Frequent dental check-up, pay extra attention to fissures * Perform direct or indirect pulp capping in cases with pulpal extension, to try increase the rate of reparative dentin formation (but may result in obliteration of the canal) * Seal exposed dentin with microhybrid acid-etched flowable light-cured resin * Perform pulpotomy with MTA using a modified Cvek technique For teeth with normal pulp and mature apex, reduce the opposing occluding tooth. Reinforce the tubercle by applying flowable composite. Occlusion, restoration, pulp and periapex assessment should be done yearly. When there is adequate pulp recession, tubercle can be removed and tooth can be restored. For teeth with normal pulp and immature apex, reduce the opposing occluding tooth. Apply flowable composite to the tubercle. Occlusion, restoration, pulp and periapex assessment should be done every 3‚Äì4 months until the apex matures. When there is signs of adequate pulp recession, tubercle can be removed and tooth can be restored. For teeth with inflamed pulp and mature apex, conventional root canal treatment could be carried out and restored accordingly. For teeth with inflamed pulp and immature apex, shallow MTA pulpotomy could be performed and then restore with glass ionomer and composite. For teeth with necrotic pulp and mature apex, conventional root canal therapy could be done and restored. For teeth with necrotic pulp and immature apex, MTA root-end barrier could be carried out. Glass ionomer layer and composite could be used to restore the tooth. If there is occlusal interference, the opposing projection should be reduced. Make sure that the tubercle does not contact other teeth in all excursive movement. This is usually done over a few appointments, 6 to 8 weeks apart to allow the formation of reparative dentin to protect the pulp. Fluoride varnish should be applied onto the ground surface. Recall the patient for follow-up after 3, 6 and 12 months. In some cases, extraction could be considered (e.g. for orthodontic purposes, failed apexification) == References  External links == Category:Developmental tooth disorders ","title":"Dens evaginatus"},{"id":"7455164","text":"Daniela Ceccarelli (born 25 September 1975 in Rocca Priora) is an Italian former Alpine skier.

By him she was the mother of Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich. ==Biography== Born Auguste Henriette Mendel in Darmstadt, Hessen-Darmstadt, she was the daughter of Adam Mendel and of Anna Sophie M√ºller. In English she is usually known as Henrietta Mendel. The family was reportedly Jewish,\\"Royal Jewesses\\", The Inquirer & Commercial News, Perth, 25 February 1898, via the National Library of Australia but since centuries Protestants. She was an actress at Darmstadt's Gro√üherzoglich Hessisches Hoftheater when she and Ludwig Wilhelm, Duke in Bavaria fell in love. As a Duke in Bavaria (Herzog in Bayern), Ludwig was a high-ranking member of Bavaria's Royal House of Wittelsbach. He was a cousin of Maximilian II of Bavaria (and thus a great-cousin of the future \\"Mad King\\" Ludwig II of Bavaria). He was the brother in law of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, to whom his younger sister Elisabeth (Sissi) was married. Henriette and Ludwig had an illegitimate daughter, Marie Louise, born on February 24, 1858. Marie would later become famous under her married name, Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich. When Henriette became pregnant a second time, a morganatic marriage was arranged. Ludwig renounced succession rights to the Bavarian throne on March 9, 1859. The couple's son Karl Emanuel was born on May 9, 1859, Henriette was created Freifrau von Wallersee on May 19, 1859, and the marriage occurred on May 28, 1859 in Augsburg, Bavaria, at which time her children became Freiin and Freiherr von Wallersee. For the marriage she had to convert to Catholicism. Karl Emanuel only survived a few months, dying on August 1, 1859. The couple had no more children. The baroness died November 12, 1891 in Munich, Bavaria of uterine cancer.

He is best known for leading the AOL team that simplified the online service provider's user interface, making it possible for millions of consumers to gain easy access to the Internet. ==Early life and education== Schuler grew up in West New York, New Jersey. As a youth, Schuler was encouraged early on by his parents to explore the arts as well as electronics. He turned his family's basement into a darkroom while helping his father, a warehouse owner and part-time repair man, tinker with television sets and other gadgetry. In the mid-1970s, while completing a bachelor's degree in psychology at Rutgers University, Schuler became captivated by filmmaking. In 1976, he left the university to produce and direct commercial and industrial films. An avid computer hobbyist and reader of Popular Electronics, Schuler befriended a group of technical enthusiasts who were developing software applications for microcomputers. After assembling a do-it-yourself IMSAI computer and experiencing first hand the potential of at-home computing, Schuler saw the technology's ability to positively disrupt and enhance the way people lived and worked. == Career  Early companies === In 1978, he established CMP Communications, an advertising and marketing company devoted to helping high tech entrepreneurs spread the word about the impending revolution in microcomputing. Schuler quit CMP in 1988 and took a position as president and CEO of Cricket Software, overseeing the development and marketing of color desktop applications for Apple Computer's Macintosh, including a Postscript driven drawing program. Cricket also developed the first color, graphical desktop presentation software, \\"Cricket Presents\\". Cricket was ultimately sold to Computer Associates International in 1991. Schuler was President of San Francisco-based Jasmine Technologies from 1989 to 1990. Jasmine was a leading Macintosh peripherals developer that buckled under the weight of bitter lawsuits and mounting customer dissatisfaction. Jasmine declared bankruptcy in March 1990 and Schuler resigned shortly thereafter. Looking to take advantage of the opportunities that a new \\"Interactive\\" medium would bring, Schuler teamed up with now-wife Tracy and David Goldman shortly after and established Medior Inc., a multimedia development company, Medior Inc. In 1994, the company entered into a joint venture with, Apple Computer Inc., and Redgate Communications and launched 2Market, considered to be the first rich media online shopping service. That same year, AOL (America Online) also enlisted Medior's help designing its product to give consumers with little or no computing expertise easy access to its online information services. While at Medior, Schuler and company co-developed a music creation game with Nick Tenbrock and Gary Levenberg of San Francisco-based Interactive Audio. The software, called Rock, Rap and Roll, allowed Macintosh users to quickly build soundtracks in a variety of musical styles.Rothman, Matt. \\"Tech News.\\" Variety, March 4, 1993.

Schuler, brought over from Medior by AOL founder and CEO Steve Case, was charged with helping him and then president Ted Leonsis to transform the online service provider into a broad based, consumer-driven medium. Schuler worked his way up the ranks at AOL becoming president of its Interactive Services group in 1998. During this time, he led the design team that integrated an Internet browser directly in AOL's proprietary user interface (version 5.0) making it possible for millions of computer users to access the Internet through a Web-based portal. He also advocated the opening up of AOL's proprietary message service known as IM, a key development that allowed its subscriber base to \\"chat\\" electronically over the Internet with non-AOL computer users free of charge.Cooper, Charles. \\"Microsoft is 'confusing and deceiving people.'\\" ZDNet U.K, July 29, 1999.]Retrieved November 2007. http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,2072870,00.htm?r=1 By January 2001, the same month that AOL announced its merger with Time-Warner, the company's 26 million subscribers were sending an estimated 660 million instant messages daily. It was on the heels of the Time Warner merger that Schuler was appointed chairman and CEO of the AOL unit. He was charged with finding ways to turn AOL into an interactive outlet for Time-Warner's various media divisions, which included film, music, television and publishing. The goal was to transform AOL into a high-speed, Internet-based,\\" one-stop shop for movies, music, interactive video games, phone service, and more.\\" In a July 2, 2001 article, BusinessWeek reporter Amy Borrus wrote that Schuler, \\"deserves just as much credit for AOL's explosive success\\" as then AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steve Case or co-Chief Operating Officer Robert Pittman. The reporter pointed to the three years Schuler spent running AOL's Interactive Services group, \\"putting his stamp on much of the design that makes it so simple to use and features that make it so popular with families.\\" Schuler's objective of converging a souped-up version of AOL's online distribution platform with Time Warner's various media outlets hit several roadblocks one being reluctance on the part of cable companies to open up their network to Internet service providers such as AOL. Likewise, internal dissent over the best ways to merge AOL's distribution channels with Time Warner's more traditional media content plagued the online unit. Against this backdrop, AOL was struggling with declining advertising sales due to an economic downturn as well as a leveling out of its still dial-up driven subscriber growth. The unit took a further hit when its parent was forced to restate its earnings forecast in January 2002, in part due to the slowdown in AOL's business. Schuler stepped down as head of the unit in April 2002, taking over a newly created digital development unit charged with overseeing the formation of interactive digital products and services for all of AOL Time Warner.Scanlon, Mavis. \\"Exec Shuffle: No Cure-All at AOL Time Warner.\\" Cable World.

Ablation Industries, Inc was commercializing (Ultrashort pulse laser) USP laser technology funded by the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA. When Mr Schuler invested in the company, the name of the company was changed to Raydiance, where he raised a significant amount of venture capital funding to help commercialize new technologies of national interest, among them ultrashort pulse lasers. A form of optoelectronics, the lasers emits short pulses of highly concentrated energy that can be used to break down atoms. In 2004, Schuler joined Raydiance Inc. to develop commercial applications for ultra-short pulse lasers. In July 2007, Wired Magazine reported that Raydiance had signed a deal with the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to explore laser therapies, ranging from common laser eye treatments to the cell-by-cell tumor ablation. In addition to serving as CEO of Raydiance, Schuler is managing director of the Draper Fisher Jurvetson Growth Fund and serves on the boards of UBMatrix, Hands On Mobile, UU See, Synthetic Genomics, and Visto. Schuler is an investor in Adirondack Pictures. He also co-produced and helped finance the film Look, a drama shot entirely from the point of view of surveillance cameras. Written and directed by Adam Rifkin with Brad Wyman as his fellow producer. The film was digitally shot in high-definition with all the special effects, post production and music done on Apple's Macintosh computers in a \\"virtual studio\\" setting. Look, released in December 2007, is distributed by Liberated Artists, another Schuler venture. It won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2007 CineVegas Film Festival. It also won Special Jury Prize at The Lone Star International Film Festival and was an official selection in both AFI Fest and The Chicago International Film Festival. Schuler lives in Napa, California. A vocal proponent of public education reform, he co-founded the Blue Oak School, an independent, not-for-profit entity for students, kindergarten through eighth grade. Schuler is a national advisory member for the New Technology Foundation, a non-profit organization established in 1999 with the objective of achieving national education reform.New Technology Foundation. .

Through his affiliation with the foundation, Schuler has helped drive and co-funded the implementation of Internet-based technology to establish a project-based learning methodology consistent with the implementation of the 21st Century Learning Initiative. Schuler is a member of the Rutgers Hall of Distinguished Alumni. ===Meteor Vineyard=== Schuler and his wife Tracy co-own Meteor Vineyard, located in the Coombsville region of the Napa Valley, with winemakers Bill and Dawnine Dyer. Meteor Vineyard is a property established in 1998. Through 2004, Meteor Vineyard's grapes were sold in bulk to a handful of Napa Valley properties including Dyer, Arietta, Etude and Vineyard 29. In 2005, the Schulers entered into a partnership with winemakers Dawnine Dyer and Bill Dyer to produce a single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon bottled under the Meteor Vineyard. The team bottled their first vintage later that year, and the wine was released beginning 2008. Soil conditions in the Coombsville area are a mix of well- draining river rock and mineral-rich volcanic ash, both of which are considered suitable for Bordeaux varietals, including Cabernet Sauvignon.Swinchatt, Jonathan, Howell, David.

It was endemic to the island of Grand Cayman in the Caribbean. ==Description== It was generally ashy grey with a white underbelly. Undertail coverts and the tips of the outer tail feathers were coloured white too. Exposed skin was red on the bill, feet, and around the eye. The wing length was 13.5 centimetres and the length of the tail was 11 centimetres. The bill reached a length of 2.4 centimetres and the legs were about 3.8 centimetres long. ==Habitat== Its habitat was in the north and north-east of Grand Cayman. It consisted of swamps and mangroves with poisonous Manchineel trees (Hippomane mancinella) as well as of areas with knife-edged coral rocks and the climbing cactus (Epiphyllum hookeri). ==Extinction== Charles B. Cory described them as common in 1886 but shortly after its discovery, it became a favorite object for bird collectors. Twenty-one specimens were collected on four occasions in total. The first four specimens were taken in August 1886. Another three were killed in 1892 and one female was obtained in 1896. Finally, thirteen specimens were shot between April and July 1916 by bird collector W. W. Brown, Jr. Suddenly this bird was vanished and several surveys to find this species again have failed until zoologist C. Bernard Lewis observed one individual north of East End in the eastern of Grand Cayman in the summer of 1938. This was the last reliable report of a living Grand Cayman thrush. Causes of its extinction were most likely deforestation and the destroying of its habitat by hurricanes between 1932 and 1944. Stuffed specimens can be seen in the following museums: six in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, one in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, two in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, one in the Natural History Museum of Berlin, seven in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, one in the Natural History Museum in London, one in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. and one in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ==References== *Cory, C.

(Most exchanges though have several exchange codes.) Within Australia, the area code is only required to call from one area code to another. Australia is divided geographically into a small number of large area codes, some of which cover more than one state and territory. Prior to the introduction of eight-digit numbers in the early-to-mid-1990s, telephone numbers were seven digits in the major capital cities, with a double-digit area code, and six digits in other areas with a three-digit area code. There were more than sixty such codes by 1990, with numbers running out, thus spurring the reorganization. Following reorganization of the numbering plan between 1994Austel: Australia's Telephone Number Plan p. 14 and 1998, the following numbering ranges are now used: *00 International and Emergency access *01 Alternative phone services **014 Satellite phones **0163 Pager numbers **0198 Data numbers (e.g. 0198 308 888 is the dial-up PoP number for Telstra) *02 Geographic: Central East region (NSW, ACT) *03 Geographic: South-east region (VIC, TAS) *04 Digital Mobile services (3G, 4G, 5G and GSM) *0550 Location Independent Communication Services *07 Geographic: North-east region (QLD) *08 Geographic: Central and West region (SA, NT, WA) *1 Non-geographic numbers (mostly for domestic use only) National numbers have no geographic significance. Other numbers relate to a particular telephone service area. However, allowances are made for regional variations; sometimes the codes do not strictly follow state borders. For example, Broken Hill in New South Wales uses the 08 area code, due to its closer proximity to Adelaide than the state capital Sydney, and Broken Hill area's inclusion in the Australian Central Standard Time zone. The previous area code for Broken Hill was (080). Other examples include towns in Southern New South Wales close to the border with Victoria that use the 03 (Victoria and Tasmania) prefix, including: Balranald, Wentworth and Deniliquin). Some parts of the Tweed Coast of New South Wales have an area code of 07 followed by a subscriber number of 55xx xxxx (and new numbers 56xx xxxx). This means it is the cost of a local call to phone the Gold Coast in neighbouring Queensland, since the metropolis covers both sides of the NSW/Qld border. It is also a local call to adjoining NSW 02 667x xxxx numbers from these areas, and other southern Gold Coast exchanges (07 prefix numbers must dial the 02 to access these). ===Australian Antarctic Territory=== Country Code: +672 1x International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ===Christmas Island=== Country Code: +61 8 9164 - part of the Australian numbering system International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: 0 ===Cocos (Keeling) Islands=== Country Code: +61 8 9162 - part of the Australian numbering system International Call Prefix: 0011 Trunk Prefix: 0 ===Norfolk Island=== Country Code: +672 3 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Easter Island== Country Code: +56 32 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==East Timor== Country Code: +670 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Federated States of Micronesia== Country Code: +691 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Fiji== Country Code: +679 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==French Polynesia== Country Code: +689 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Kiribati== Country Code: +686 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Marshall Islands== Country Code: +692 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Nauru== Country Code: +674 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==New Caledonia== Country Code: +687 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==New Zealand== Country Code: +64 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: 0 Since 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and seven-digit local numbers, the first three of which generally specify the exchange and the final four a line at that exchange. The domestic long distance prefix is '0'. The dialing plan used in NZ reflects the national structure implemented by the New Zealand Post Office prior to the privatisation of the telecommunications services (and the creation of the Telecom New Zealand corporation). Domestic phone numbers with a first digit in range 2-8 are generally managed by Telecom. Phone numbers beginning with 9 are usually those from other companies, for example TelstraClear. These allocations were firm until April 2007, whereupon full number portability was introduced; numbers can now be moved between carriers. . There are currently no regions issued numbers starting with 1 - except for the national emergency services access number, '111'. There are five regional area codes in use for landline calls, For example, a domestic toll call destined for a South Island location requires the dial prefix '03', being domestic-long-distance + 3 for the South Island. {  - 01Telecom NZ Special Services (e.g. Directory 018 (Domestic) 0172 (International)) - 024099Scott Base in the Ross Dependency - 02Mobile (Cellular and Paging) - 03South Island and the Chatham Islands - 04Wellington Region except the Wairarapa and parts of the Kapiti Coast - 05\\"Other\\" network access (Non Telecom NZ services) - 06Remaining southern and eastern North Island: * Taranaki * Manawat≈´-Whanganui except Taumarunui * Hawke's Bay * Gisborne * Wairarapa and parts of the Kapiti Coast - 07Waikato, the Bay of Plenty and Taumarunui - 08Telecom NZ Special Services (e.g. Internet Dialup services, Toll Free) - 09Auckland and Northland } Mobile phone numbers are prefixed with 02, followed by one digit and the subscriber's number, which is either six, seven or eight digits, dialled in full, e.g. 021 xxx xxx or 027 xxx xxxx. With the introduction of number portability the number prefix is no longer a sure indicator as to the terminating network, but the following table lists the \\"default\\" mobile numbering prefixes: {  - 020Orcon - 021Vodafone - 0222degrees - 025Telecom TDMA (No longer in service) - 026Pager Services - 027Telecom CDMA - 028CallPlus - 029TelstraClear } Free call services generally use the prefix 0800 (via Telecom NZ) or 0508 (via TelstraClear), while local rate (usually internet access numbers) have the prefix 08xx. Premium rate services use the code 0900 followed by five digits. Neither of these are accessible internationally. The International dialing prefix is '00', though other prefixes are available (i.e. 0161, for discounted rates, or 0168, for access to USA 1800 numbers). To dial into New Zealand from overseas, the leading 0 should be dropped from all area codes. (For example, an 021 xxx xxxx number would be reached by dialing +64 21 xxx xxxx). ===Cook Islands=== Country Code: +682 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ===Niue=== Country Code: +683 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ===Tokelau=== Country Code: +690 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Palau== Country Code: +680 International Call Prefix: 011 or 012 Trunk Prefix: ==Papua New Guinea== Country Code: +675 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Pitcairn Islands== Country Code: +64 xx - previously +870 satellite phone only International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Samoa== Country Code: +685 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Solomon Islands== Country Code: +677 International Call Prefix: 00 or 01 Trunk Prefix: ==Tonga== Country Code: +676 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==United States Territories== The following territories of the United States are part of the North American Numbering Plan, and no longer have their own country codes: * +1-670 - Northern Mariana Islands from 1 July 1998 (previously +670) * +1-671 - Guam from 1 July 1998 (previously +671) * +1-684 - American Samoa from 2 October 2004 (previously +684) ==Vanuatu== Country Code: +678 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: ==Wallis and Futuna== Country Code: +681 International Call Prefix: 00 Trunk Prefix: == See also == * List of country calling codes * List of international call prefixes * Telephone numbering plan * :Category:Telephone numbers by country == References == Category:International telecommunications Category:Telecommunications in Oceania Category:Telephone numbers Category:Telecommunications in Australia Category:Telecommunications in New Zealand ","title":"Telephone numbers in Oceania"},{"id":"7455272","text":"Thomas William Green (30 March 1894 ‚Äì 29 March 1975) was a British racewalker who won a gold medal in the men's 50 km walk at the 1932 Summer Olympics. The son of a police constable, Green could not walk until the age of five, owing to his affliction with rickets. He lied about his age and joined the British Army in 1906 and served during the First World War, where he was wounded on three occasions and gassed while fighting in France. Returning to Britain, he eventually settled in Eastleigh where he worked at a railway works before being encouraged by a blind friend to take up racewalking. Green's career began to rise during the late 1920s and reached its peak during the 1930s, when he became the first British national and Olympic 50 km racewalking champion. He continued his success through the mid-1930s, but placed fourth at the 1936 National Championships and was thus unable to compete in that year's Summer Olympic Games. He retired from competitive athletics and had a career as a publican prior to spending his retirement as a sports promoter and administrator. Tommy Green Walk in Eastleigh is named in his honour. ==Early life== Green was born in the town of Fareham in Hampshire, England on 30 March 1894. His family was Anglican and his father, Tom, was a police constable. The younger Green was afflicted with rickets as a child and thus unable to walk until he was five years old. He left school at the age of 12 and briefly worked as a butcher's assistant before lying about his age and joining the 20th Hussars of the British Army in 1906. He was invalided four years later after a horse fell on him, but recalled up to service at the onset of the First World War. He fought in France with the 3rd The King's Own Hussars where he was wounded three times and gassed so severely that the army sent him back to Britain in 1917. ==Athletic career== Green settled in the town of Eastleigh where he held numerous jobs until finally finding more stable employment with Eastleigh Railway Works, a repair facility for trains and carriages. He also trained as a boxer and long-distance runner in his spare time until he was encouraged by a blind friend to take up the sport of racewalking. He entered ‚Äì and won ‚Äì his first race at the age of 32 in 1926 and soon thereafter joined the Belgrave Harriers. His breakthrough year was 1929, winning several national competitions and coming in second at an international 100 km event in Milan. Green's prominence grew in 1930 as he set a new world record while becoming Britain's first national 50 km racewalking champion in July. After a string of victories in other British events, he captured his first international title at the international 100 km race in Milan. His continuing success through 1931 and 1932 earned him a trip to the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where he won a gold medal in the first ever men's 50 km walk at the Games. At the time he was 38 years old and he remains, as of 2008, the oldest person to have won the event. He contested fewer races in 1933 and 1934, but he set his sights on making an appearance at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and resumed his heavy regimen of training in 1935. He was runner-up to Harold Whitlock for the British 50 km title that year, but he slid to fourth place in the following year's competition and was not selected for the Berlin Games. Whitlock, who captured the 1936 National Championship with a world record time, became the eventual winner of the 1936 Olympic 50 km walk. ==Later life== Green retired from competitive athletics after 1936 and, having lost a thumb in an industrial accident at Eastleigh Railway Works in 1934, took up a career as a publican. He did participate in a Victory Walk following the Second World War where, at the age of 53, he finished 17th in a field of 146 competitors. His final race came in 1946, where he was victorious in an event that stretched from Poole to Wareham in Dorset. In retirement he dedicated the remainder of his life to promoting sports and served as President of the Eastleigh Cricket Association. He died on 29 March 1975 in Eastleigh, where Tommy Green Walk was named in his honour. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1975 deaths Category:British male racewalkers Category:English male racewalkers Category:English Olympic medallists Category:Olympic gold medallists for Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1932 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:British publicans Category:People from Fareham Category:Medalists at the 1932 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:British masters athletes ","title":"Tommy Green (athlete)"},{"id":"7455277","text":"There are many architectural projects under construction in Belgrade, Serbia.

Gadow was born in Pomerania, the son of an inspector of the Prussian royal forests. He studied at the universities of Berlin, Jena and Heidelberg. At Jena he studied under Ernst Haeckel and at Heidelberg under the anatomist Karl Gegenbaur. After graduation, he travelled to the Natural History Museum in London at the request of Albert G√ºnther, to work on the museum's Catalogue of Birds. Gadow also established the first new sequence of bird orders and families that departed from earlier works in being based on phylogenetic ideas derived from anatomical and morphological features. The sequence was continued with modification by Alexander Wetmore and James L. Peters. Gadow prepared Volume VIII on the titmice, shrikes and nuthatches, and Volume IX on the sunbirds and honeyeaters. In 1884 Gadow succeeded Osbert Salvin as Curator of the Strickland Collection at Cambridge University, as well as being appointed Lecturer on the Morphology of Vertebrates. He became a member of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1881 and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. He married Clara Maud Paget, daughter of Sir George E. Paget. In 1895 and 1896 Gadow and his wife made two journeys along northern Spain, from the Basque Country to Galicia. In 1897 Gadow published In Northern Spain, the book that gathered together the very interesting observations on geography, ethnography, and fauna and flora he had made. Gadow's publications included Classification of the Vertebra (1898), a translation of Haeckel's work entitled The Last Link (1898) and the articles on anatomy in Alfred Newton's Dictionary of Birds. Hans Friedrich Gadow is commemorated in the scientific names of three species of Mexican lizards: Anolis gadovii, Mesaspis gadovii, and Urosaurus gadovi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Belgrade, Serbia has an abundance of religious architecture. The city has numerous Serbian Orthodox churches and temples and it is also the seat of the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Its two most prominent Orthodox Christian places of worship are the Saborna Crkva (the Cathedral Church) and the Temple of St. Sava, the largest Eastern Orthodox church in the world. Other notable Belgrade churches include St. Mark's Church, in which rests the body of the first Serbian Emperor, Stefan Du≈°an. The architecture of this church was greatly inspired by the Graƒçanica monastery in the province of Kosovo. The church of Sveta Ru≈æica in the Kalemegdan Fortress is one of the holiest places in Belgrade for Serbian Orthodox Christians since this was the site where the body of St. Paraskeva was preserved for several years after the Ottoman conquest, before being taken to Romania where it still rests today. St. Paraskeva (Sv. Petka) is one of the most important saints to the Eastern Orthodox Christians. Belgrade is the seat of a Catholic archdiocese, with a small Catholic community and several Catholic churches. One of these, St Anthony's, was designed by the noted Slovenian architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. There is also a Muslim community in Belgrade and only one mosque, the Bajrakli Mosque built in 1526 by the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. It is one of the oldest surviving structures in contemporary Belgrade. The Jewish community is served by the Belgrade Synagogue, which is the only currently active Jewish place of worship in the entire country, although not the only such structure within the city limits. Belgrade also had an active Buddhist temple in the first half of the 20th century.

The film involves a scientist (von Stroheim) who creates a woman (Knef) who is beautiful and yet soulless, lacking any sense of morality. ==Plot== Medical student Frank Braun (Karlheinz Bohm) arrives at his uncle's estate, Professor Jacob ten Brinken (Erich von Stroheim), to ask for a loan in order to continue his studies to become a doctor. Instead he comes across a beautiful woman Alraune (Hildegard Knef) gazing outside on the second story of the house. Upon asking the maid (Gardy Brombacher), she claims to not know of any guests staying at the moment and to return the next day to see his uncle. He meets with his friends Ralph Goutram (Rolf Henniger) and Count \\"Gerald\\" Geroldingen, (Harry Meyenrin). Desperately anxious to know the identity of the mysterious woman, they decide return to ten Brinken's home. While Gerald and Ralph don't meet her, Frank manages to strike a conversation with Alraune, and learn's she is his daughter, who ran away from the university, and asks him to meet her again the next day at the nearby sundial. Later, Frank meets with his uncle who greatly refuses to loan him the money he needs, so he goes to see an old family friend, Fuerstin Wolkonska (Trude Hesterberg). Wolkonski believes Frank to be a good match of a husband for her daughter Olga (Julia Koschka), so she offers to loan the money Frank needs on the condition that he continues his studies at the Sorbonne University in Paris, as a means to keep him away from Alraune. When asked, she explains how his uncle was once a medical doctor who was expelled from the university for constructing bizarre abnormal experiments with artificial insemination. She further elaborates this as reasoning as to why ten Brinken refused to loan him money. The next day, Frank and Alraune meet as planned, they quickly profess their love and desire to be together. Though Frank informs her that he'll be leaving for Paris the next day, Alraune wishes to accompany him and leave her father. The two come up with a plan to meet the next day again at the sundial. Once ten Brinken learns of the their plan, he changes his mind about the loan, as a way to keep Alraune at bay, to which Frank refuses as confesses his love for Alraune. Ten Brinken sees no other option than to tell the truth surrounding his \\"daughter\\". He learns, through a medical diary, that with the help of Fuerstin he was able to successfully artificially impregnate a seedy prostate with the sperm of a murderer trialed to be hanged. He goes on to elaborate how the seed of evil and malefic traits from her biological parents have only grown since her \\"unnatural birth\\". Ten brink details how she has the ability \\"lures men to their demise\\", to which Frank is horrified by the true counts of her nature. He leaves for Paris that night without Alraune. Devastated and betrayed, she begins to show more signs of lacking any soul or morality and begins. She suggests to Ten brink to buy acres of land, but upon arriving they learn that it is covered with sulfur spring. While her mother travels to Paris, Olga stays with ten Brinken in his home. She receives a later from her mother in regards to her pre-arranged engagement to Frank, which doesn't sit well with Alraune. Alraune manages to convince Olga that no man who truly loves a woman would pronounce a proposal through a letter. Devastated though influenced by Alraune, Olga attempts suicide by poisoning herself. Alraune then begins using her sexual appeal to flirt with men that have fallen for her. She goes horseback riding with Gerald during a rainstorm, carriage riding with Mathieu, ten Brinken's coachman, and poses herself for Ralph to paint her. When one of Alraune's necklace winds up missing, she accuses her teacher, Mademoiselle Duvaliere (Denise Vernac), which in fact was found inside her luggage, who is then fired for theft. She later discovers that in fact it was Doctor Mohn (Harry Halm) who stole the necklace from Alraune's jewelry box and framed Duvaliere, all to gain attention from Alraune. Months later, Frank returns from Paris having completed his studies. Upon returning, Alraune still proclaims her love towards him, though Frank resent's her. Alraune, now distraught by this begins unleashing her \\"true nature of evil\\". Mathie's carriage falls over a cliff, Ralph gets sick and dies from pneumonia while Gerald is killed by Dr.Mohn. With no man seemingly able to make her happy, Alraune questions her own morality and emotions for Frank. She pleads Frank for his help, even going as far to cry real tears. Frank, taken back by this, realizes that everything he was told about this \\"unnatural being\\" is false, she can evoke emotions and not as \\"soulless\\" as originally described, he takes her back and they plan to go run away together. Alraune tells ten Brinken about their plans, but he refuses to let her go, his reasoning in that she will destroy him and herself, just as she did with the other men. He gives her the diary detailing who she is and her parent's and upon reading it, decides not to go away with Frank. Days later, the sulfur spring has died out and Dr.Mohn is threatening to expose ten Brinken for his illegal experiments. He plans to run away to Germany with the left over money from the land with Alraune. Duvaliere worries that she will be too be exposed for her involvement with the experiments. She talks with Frank about the ordeal and is surprised to learn of his true feelings for Alraune. They both travel to ten Brinken's estate. Upon arriving, Duvaliere accuses ten Brinken of being \\"mad\\" and is incredibly jealous of Alraune's affection for Frank. Frank pursues Alraune through the forest where she hallucinates in seeing her dead \\"lovers\\" and overwhelmed by this, she faints. Upon awakening, Frank confesses his love once more for Alraune and reasons with her as not being the factor in his friends deaths. She disagrees, convinced that she is nothing but \\"the bringer of destruction\\" as she is the direct result of a cruel trial of her ungodly father, heightened by the evil thoughts of her parents. He convinces her that both good and evil are always present in each individual, regardless of circumstances, and that the good can in her can win over the evil. Frank carries Alraune back to the estate, where as they arrive, ten Brinken is convinced that she will leave him for Frank. He then pulls out his gun and shoots her -\\"Now the toy is broken-the crime against nature that God didn‚Äôt want.‚Äù Alraune dies, dissolving into a mandrake root body with the seed of her true nature finally destroyed. Ten brinken is arrested and then hanged for the murder of \\"his child\\". == Cast  Production  Development === In an Interview given back in February 1989 he stated how his involvement begin with \\"Carlton was Stapenhorst, and then there was an Austrian producer who made his money primarily from petrol stations and was a very stubborn, mindless, peasant person. He had a contract with the Knef and, according to his idea, the Knef should be the Mandrake after the sinner (1951) and Erich von Stroheim the genius-crazy scientist.\\" Even from its earliest stage, Alraune was stirring controversy Just the announcement \\"Erich von Stroheim and Hildegard Knef in Alraune\\" led to a scandal. The church pulpits were spoken against the film, against the topic of artificial insemination; at that time the church had a great influence on cultural politics. Stapenhorst was happy about the advertisement, but he also feared the power of the church. Our task now was to dramatize the magically demonic element in the sex and horror material in a Catholic affirmative....It was really an ordeal, I think we wrote 16 versions of the script and changed it until the shoot. Now Stapenhorst, who was an old professional, had once had a blackout and Stroheim had the right to write his own dialogues. And Stroheim, who used to be a great director, now saw himself as a writer and came every morning with four pages of new text and from the well-behaved version that we had struggled to find, again and again made Stroheim a sharp horror film. But the audience didn't want horror, the war was still deep in everyone's bones. And the church didn't want sex...\\" === Casting === At the time the cast was considered to be 'All- star\\", even more so as Eric von Strohiem was respectfully known as \\"one of the great silent film director\\", who had all but retired from acting by the time Alraune was to begin filming. Hildegard Knef had also achieved fame in both her native country Germany and international fame. Robert Craig would later write in his book, It Came from 1957: A Critical Guide to the Year's Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, that \\"Knef's sultry, smoking sexuality was perfect for her role...it gives the film much of its palpable tension\\". === Mis-en-scene === Alraune is rooted from an actual plant Mandrake, which is German for mandragora. While the book stays relatively faithful to the book, unlike the 1928 film, there is a shot in the film which depicts Alraune's wide eyed face fades out of focus into the grotesque version of a mandrake. The pant is deeply rooted in German literature and folklore. The plant is believed to bring good fortune and solidarity while also bring death and destroying all who curate it. The film seems to suggest that when humanity forgets its place in the natural order, it is destined to be eradicated. Set Decoration was done by Robert Health with the costume design by Herbrert Ploberger. === Music === The film's soundtrack and music was composed by Werner Richard Heymann, who had a well known career in the German industry and Hollywood. The only two songs on the soundtrack were sung by Hildegard Knef, with the songs \\"Huet' befall' ice mir\\" and \\"Das lied von kinsmen m√§chden\\" written by lyricist Robert Gilbert. The sound team consisted of Heinz Terworth and Klang-Film Eurocord. ==Release== Alraune was released in Germany on 23 October 1952 where it was distributed by Gloria-Filmverleih. In 1957 Hal Roach Junior's, Distributors Corporation of America released Alraune, now renamed Unnatural: The Fruit of Evil, in an English dubbed version to arthouse and grindhouse theaters. The English Language Version was recorded by the American Dubbing Company. It is also available for streaming service on Amazon Prime Video. and YouTube. == Adaptations == A number of films and other works are based on or inspired by the novel Alraune. Alraune (1952) is the fifth adaptation of Ewer's book, the first being the 1918 silent version directed by Michael Curtiz which has long been believed to no longer exist in studio archives. The second adaptation came shortly after which, despite the title, has very little to no connection to the novel other than the Mandrake root. A third adaptation was then released a decade later with Alraune (1928 film), a black and white version though silent, with it being widely considered the best adaptation which was directed by Henrik Galeen. In comparison to the film in 1928, C. Hooper Trask of The New York Times wrote, \\"if you like this sort of thing you'll find it a superior product. Heinrich Galeen has directed with photographic imagination‚Äîno question that the picture has atmosphere\\". In 1995 a character named \\"Professor Ten Brincken\\", in Kim Newman's vampire novel The Bloody Red Baron, is the 'mad scientist' who creates Alraune. A black and white miniseries of comics books was released between 1998‚Äì2004: Alraune, was illustrated by Tony Greis. The comic books deviate significantly from the novel as the main character is cursed and must live as if she is Alraune until she can find a way out from under the curse. ==Reception== The film has received collaborative reviews over the years though many have seemed negative. In a contemporary review, Variety noted that \\"in the early 1900s, when the H. H. Ewers novel Alraune cut a swatch in the German-language world [...] the very thought of artificial insemination of humans was mentionable only in whispers.\\" and that \\"times and sensations change.\\" The review opined that Knef's acting had \\"limited range\\" and that von Stroheim produces \\"only a laboured setting for a range of costumes changes and phony thunderstorms for the lethal Alraune\\". In regards to von Stroheim's performance, Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"A magisterial, crazily comprehensive biographical study of the original renegade director\\" while Times Literary Supplement wrote \\" A monument to the awful Good Old Days of an infant Hollywood\\" Michael Den Boer writes that \\"Though this film has a Gothic Horror vibe, it‚Äôs far-fetched premise ventures into the realm of science fiction. With that being said, there is one area where this film does not fully deliver in regards to its most unusual premise. And that is how the film does not exploit the more salacious aspects of its premise and how the narrative resembles something more akin to what one would expect from a melodrama\\". Dennis Schwartz \\"It‚Äôs a hokum sci-fi film that only resonates because Von Stroheim is at his Prussian best as a man possessed by his incestuous love for his foster daughter and arrogant about his superior intellect. Von Stroheim‚Äôs a treat to watch, but it‚Äôs still a dull visual film that never made good use of its unusual premise and was never emotionally satisfying as a drama.\\" == See also == * Alraune (1918 film) * Alraune (1928 film) * Alraune (1930 film) * Artificial insemination * Science fiction * West Germany * Mandragora officinarum *German folklore *Cinema of Germany *Black and white == References Footnotes=Sources=== * == Further reading == * == External links == * * Alraune at filmportal.de/en *Alraune on Amazon Prime *Alraune on YouTube Category:1952 films Category:1952 horror films Category:1950s science fiction horror films Category:German science fiction films Category:German fantasy films Category:West German films Category:German-language films Category:German black-and-white films Category:Films based on German novels Category:Films based on works by Hanns Heinz Ewers Category:Films directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt Category:German film remakes Category:Erotic fantasy films Category:Films set in the 1900s ","title":"Alraune (1952 film)"},{"id":"7455316","text":"Created under the McKinney-Vento Act, The PATH (Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness) Program, is a formula grant program that funds the 50 States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and four U.S. Territories to support service delivery to individuals with serious mental illnesses, as well as individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders, who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.

She also introduced overseas research to Japan, for example through translations of work by Jerry Mander, Catharine MacKinnon, David Buckingham) and the Ontario Teacher's Association. In addition, Suzuki maintained an exceptionally high level of international networking. She was an active member of the World Association of Christian Communication (WACC), a co-founder and core member of the Asian Network of Women in Communication (ANWIC), a long-term member of the International Association of Media and Communications Research (IAMCR), and on the International Exchange Committee of the Japan Society for Studies in Journalism and Mass Communication ÔºàÊó•Êú¨„Éû„Çπ„Éª„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„Ç±„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥Â≠¶‰ºö). She also participated in UNESCO-sponsored research and projects, and was involved in the Global Media Monitoring Project (1994, 2000 and 2005), for which she served as a steering committee member and a Japanese liaison. Although Suzuki had received her master's degree in mass communications from Stanford University in 1966, she soon became critical of the mass communications research approach, especially its inherent view of people as 'passive receivers' or consumers of information. She instead began to develop a citizen-centered approach. Through her work with the Forum for Citizen's Television and Media (FCT), which she co-founded in 1977, she focused on informed criticism of commercial television programming, especially for children, as well as of gender stereotypes and other misconceptions and biases found in the mainstream Japanese media. Suzuki noted that \\"critical is creative\\" and saw media literacy as part of a bigger vision for media democratization. An early advocate for communication rights in Japan, she championed an active role for citizens in media society, including in policy making. ==Published works== (In Japanese) *Suzuki, Midori (1992) Terebi - dare no tame no media ka?

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the mid-20th century, the vestry board decided to procure a vestry hall for the Parish of St. Leonard's; the site they selected had been occupied by some old almshouses known as \\"Fuller's Hospital\\". The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, John Thwaite, in 1865. The new building, the eastern section of the current complex, was designed by Caesar Augustus Long in the Italianate style, built by John Perry of Stratford and completed in 1866. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Old Street; the central section featured a tetrastyle porch with Ionic order columns on the ground floor; there were windows interspersed with Corinthian order columns and pilasters on the first floor and a large pediment above. At the time it was described as \\"the grandest vestry hall in London\\". The building was embellished with symbolic statuary alluding to the borough motto, \\"More Light, More Power\\", which refer to the council's aim of generating its own electricity to power local industry.R. Crosley, London's coats of arms and the stories they tell (Robert Scott, London, 1928) On 12 November 1888 the inquest into the death of Mary Jane Kelly, the last victim of the Whitechapel murders, was held in the building. Following the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch in 1899, the building was extended westwards by adding a tower and an extra three bays to the five bays that already existed. The foundation stone for the extension was laid by the mayoress, Mrs Sarah Ellen Kershaw, on 9 September 1901. The design by William Hunt created a monumental structure which was completed in 1902. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber and mayor's parlour at the rear of the building on the ground floor and a large assembly hall in the east part of the building on the first floor. After a major fire in the assembly hall, that part of the building was rebuilt to the designs of Alfred Cross in 1904. An additional wing to the south of the main building was added in 1938. The building ceased to be the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965. It was subsequently used as a venue for boxing and other events and in 1969 Ulric Regis died from brain injuries soon after being outpointed by Joe Bugner at the town hall. In the 1990s the assembly hall served as a night club featuring trance music hosted by the Whirl-Y-Gig dance club. After a period of neglect, it passed into the ownership of the newly formed Shoreditch Town Hall Trust in 1997. Following an extensive restoration programme, the building reopened as an events venue in 2004 and, after a further programme of works, it re-opened as an arts centre in 2012. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Hackney Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1866 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Shoreditch Town Hall"},{"id":"7455329","text":"Idris Gaibov is the Deputy Prime Minister of Chechnya in the government of Ramzan Kadyrov as of 2006.

The label demoed the band and released a limited edition (500) 7\\" single \\"Gentleman's Soiree\\" / \\"Silver Boots\\" before agreeing to record and release a full-length album. After a brief tour of the UK with Cable the band went into the studio to start recording tracks for their debut long player. A further single, \\"Gracelands\\" (1996) and more tours (with A amongst others) followed, but financial difficulties forced EXP to fold before the full album was released. The band were soon picked up by Mantra Records (part of the Beggars Banquet group), and further tours followed before the album Half Nelson, recorded for EXP two years earlier, was eventually released by Mantra in 1998. The album chronicled the band's obsessions with Americana, the Rat Pack, working class humour, the seedier side of personal and sexual relationships and classic 1970s movies, with an ever-present combination of metal, punk, blues and rockabilly at its core. They began to accumulate a small but loyal fanbase, helped by features in Kerrang! and NME, a series of incendiary live shows and a growing (if not necessarily accurate) reputation for on- and off-stage violence. Tours of the UK and Europe followed (with Carter USM, Therapy? and Mot√∂rhead amongst others) and the band eventually had the opportunity to tour their spiritual home, the United States. A double headline tour with the London-based band Penthouse (who were renamed 'Fifty Tons of Black Terror' for the occasion, after a legal run-in with the head of the adult magazine who shared their name) ensued. By 1998, most of the band had moved from their hometown of Doncaster to the neighbouring city of Sheffield, but returned to Axis Studios in Doncaster, to again work with Matt Elliss. They recorded their second album Every Six Seconds, after potential plans to record in Steve Albini's studio in Chicago were scrapped. A UK tour with The Yo-Yos and up and coming indie hotshots The Hives as first on, preceded the release of Every Six Seconds late in 2000. The album showcased a more sonic vocabulary and more diverse songwriting. A number of favourable reviews followed, but the band knew Mantra were not in a financial position to back the band. After meetings the band decide to leave the label before a decision was made on their behalf, as the label was culling its roster. Within three months the second album had sold as many as the debut release. A series of unfortunate events followed. With the loss of their management, booking agent and lack of financial funds, Kelly made the decision to quit the band in December 2000. Fowkes and Spiby decided to continue and eventually recruited a new drummer, Alex Thomas, for a handful of gigs. They recorded a new demo in the mid-2001. This lineup was short-lived however, and the band had permanently split by the end of the year. ==Personnel== *Pete Spiby sang with Boneyard prior to Groop Dogdrill. After Groop Dogdrill, Spiby formed Future eX Wife releasing two mini albums on Captains of Industry and a live album via Careless Talk Costs Lives magazine.

They are usually found in the area between roots, which is called a furcation, of molars. Enamel pearls are not common in teeth with a single root. The most common location of enamel pearls is the furcation areas of the maxillary (75%)and mandibular third molar roots. Enamel pearls are formed from the Hertwig's Epithelial root sheath. After the initiation of the formation of dentin in the root area of the tooth, the root sheath disintegrates and moves away from the root surface so that the cells of the dental sac can come in contact with predentin to differentiate into cementoblasts and start deposition of cementum. However, if the cells of epithelial root sheath remain adherent to predentin, they may differentiate into fully functional ameloblasts and deposit enamel. Such droplets of enamel are called enamel pearls. ==References== *Kahn, Michael A. Basic Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.

He invented the first successful light farm tractor, and the Ivel Safety bicycle. ==Childhood== Born 12 September 1860 at Biggleswade, Bedfordshire to Edward and Edith Albone. The youngest of eight children, they lived at the Ongley Arms inn, between the Great North Road and the River Ivel. For his ninth birthday he received a Boneshaker bicycle, and so began his long association with cycling. By the age of 13, he had designed and built his own bicycle, complete with suspension, and was winning local races. On leaving school, he undertook an apprenticeship with a Biggleswade firm of millwrights and engineers, Thomas Course & Son of Hitchin Street. ==Cyclist== Albone won over 180 cycling prizes, including winner of the: *1885 two mile open at Oundle, Northamptonshire. *1885 one mile open handicap at Crystal Palace, London. *1887 one mile open and two-mile open at Oundle, Northamptonshire. *1888 International Tricycle scratch race, Scheveningen, Netherlands. In 1885 he was a founder member of the North Road Cycling Club, dedicated to cycle racing. It attracted other national cycling champions, such as George Pilkington Mills and Monty Holbein. ==Cycle manufacturer== At the age of 20 he founded the Ivel Cycle Works in the yard of the Ongley Arms, making bicycles for himself and his fellow sports cyclists. His first products were the Ivel Light Roadster and the Ivel Racer. In 1882 he introduced the Ivel Tricycle, and in 1884, in collaboration with Laurence Huber the Ivel Automatic Steerer tricycle. In 1885 John Kemp Starley exhibited his Rover Safety bicycle at the Stanley show. Albone copied this idea, and combined it with the Hillman, Herbert and Cooper cross frame design to produce the Ivel Safety cycle, in April 1886. This became very popular with sports cyclists. On 5 October 1886 George Pilkington Mills, on an Ivel Safety, achieved a world record 24-hour distance of . Albone went on to invent a tandem safety bicycle with Arthur James Wilson, cycle pump clamps with Richard Tingey, and a child carrier accessory for his cycles. By 1893 a general downturn in the economy had put many cycle manufacturers out of business, and Albone put the Ivel Cycle Works into voluntary liquidation. ==Ball bearing wheels== In 1886 Albone applied his knowledge of low friction wheels to produce a strong, light weight pony trap. This had a steel axle with ball bearings, and bicycle type steel and rubber wheels. The result was smooth and fast, and the pony trap was popular. The axles were also sold separately, to the Great Northern Railway company. ==Motor manufacturer== Ivel motor car, electric ignition independent suspension Ladies' Ivel motor bicycle In the 1890s many cycle manufacturers moved into motor manufacture (for example William Morris and Armand Peugeot). Albone also developed a motor car, based on a single cylinder Benz engine. He was driving a prototype around Bedfordshire in 1898, and exhibited it in London in 1900. A five seat version was developed, called the Ivel Landaulette, with a twin cylinder engine. A natural progression was the Ivel motor bicycle, in 1901. This was a strengthened bicycle, with a engine driving the rear wheel. ==Tractor manufacturer== Dan Albone with his 1902 prototype Ivel Agricultural Motor { align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"margin: 0 1em 1em 1em; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - !colspan=\\"2\\"Ivel Agricultural Motor 1902 - Power  - Weight 403 kg - Maximum load 2540 kg (2.5 tons) - Maximum speed  - Engine size 2900 cc (177 cubic inches) - Cylinders 2 - Stroke 4 } During the late 19th century, power on farms was provided mainly by horses. Steam-powered portable engines and self-propelled traction engines had been introduced for agricultural work from about 1850, but the traction engines were too heavy for direct ploughing of the heavy soil found in Britain. In the 1890s, internal combustion engines started to become more common, but these were stationary engines for belt-driven agricultural machinery. An oil-powered traction engine had been developed, by Hornsby- Ackroyd in 1897, but like the steam-powered traction engines, this was very heavy at 8600 kg (8.5 tons). Albone conceived a light-weight petrol-powered general purpose agricultural vehicle. By November 1901 he had completed his tractor design, and filed for a patent on 15 February 1902. On 12 December 1902 he formed Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited. The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor, the word 'tractor' did not come into common use until later. Dan's \\"tractor\\" won silver medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904; and in February 1904 an Ivel Agricultural Motor won a Gold Medal in the Chester Ploughing Match held at Waverton, this being the first occasion on which a competition of that kind had been open to mechanically propelled ploughs.The Automotor Journal, 5 March 1904, p298 About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used. Over time it became heavier and more powerful, but it failed to keep pace with its rivals. The company declined after 1910, and in 1920 it went into receivership. The assets were bought by United Motor Industries Limited. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel, with solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A pulley wheel on the left hand side allowed it to be used as a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was ¬£300. ==Family and sudden death== Albone's grave in Biggleswade Cemetery Dan Albone married Elizabeth Martha Moulden (1860‚Äì1936) in August 1887. They had two children, Stanley Dan (1889‚Äì1913) and Alwyne Patricia Edwards (1900‚Äì1954). On 30 October 1906, while at work, Albone suffered a stroke and died. He was buried in Biggleswade Cemetery on 2 November. ==Memorials== *Albone Way, Biggleswade SG188BN. *Dan Albone Memorial Picnic area, Biggleswade.

As a result, the floor of the pulp and the furcation of the tooth is moved apically down the root. The underlying mechanism of taurodontism is the failure or late invagination of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, which is responsible for root formation and shaping causing an apical shift of the root furcation. The constriction at the amelocemental junction is usually reduced or absent. Taurodontism is most commonly found in permanent dentition although the term is traditionally applied to molar teeth. In some cases taurodontism seems to follow an autosomal dominant type of inheritance. Taurodontism is found in association with amelogenesis imperfecta, ectodermal dysplasia and tricho-dento-osseous syndrome. The term means \\"bull like\\" teeth derived from similarity of these teeth to those of ungulate or cud-chewing animals. According to Shaw these can be classified as hypotaurodont, hypertaurodont and mesotaurodont. According to Mangion taurodontism may be: *A retrograde character *A primitive pattern *Mendelian recessive character *Atavistic feature *A mutation It has also been reported in Klinefelter syndrome, XXYY and Down syndrome . The teeth involved are invariably molars, sometimes single and at the other times multiple teeth may be involved. The teeth themselves may look normal and do not have any particular anatomical character on clinical examination. On a dental radiograph, the involved tooth looks rectangular in shape without apical taper. The pulp chamber is extremely large and the furcations may be only a few millimeters long at times. ==Anthropology== The condition is of anthropological importance as it was seen in Neanderthals.

He was a trustee of the University of North Carolina for thirty years between 1802 and 1832. In 1803, Jones moved from Smithfield to Raleigh. He served in the House of Commons for Wake County in 1807, and was elected Intendant of Police of Raleigh the same year. In 1808, Jones became an editor with the Raleigh Star, an early local newspaper. He sold his shares to his partner, Thomas Henderson, in 1815. == Military service == In 1798, Jones served in the Johnston County regiment of the North Carolina militia. His regiment received a signed letter from President John Adams in 1798, thanking them for their preparedness to serve during the Quasi-War. After the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair in 1807, President Thomas Jefferson called for 7,003 troops from North Carolina. Jones, now a captain, organized the Wake Troop of Cavalry. After the troops were deemed unnecessary, Jones continued to train them. His efforts were recognized when he was appointed adjutant general of North Carolina in 1808. After the War of 1812 broke out, Jones resigned from his position to become Major General of the Seventh North Carolina District of Militia. The British landed at Ocracoke and Portsmouth with a 74-gun man-of-war, six frigates, two privateers, two schooners, and up to 70 smaller vessels in 1813. He and his troops showed enough force to send the British off after five days of raids. ==Later life== In 1820, Jones relocated out of Raleigh to what is now Wake Forest, to a plantation which later gave its name to the surrounding town. He was postmaster of the small village that soon surrounded his land. The property was purchased by the North Carolina Baptist Convention in 1832 and became the first home of Wake Forest College. Wake Forest was part of an envisioned network of plantations across the South, including his second farm in Bolivar, Tennessee, named \\"Pontine\\", supposedly for the Pontine Marshes near Rome, or perhaps, for the pons network of the brain, representing his idea of network of plantations. After the sale of Wake Forest, Jones moved to Bolivar, where he died in 1846. == Family and legacy == Jones was first engaged to Ruina J. Williams, daughter of Major William Williams of Franklin County. Ten years after she died in 1809, Jones married her sister, Temperance Boddie Jones, widow of Thomas Jones of Warrenton. Their children were: * Montezuma Jones (1819 ‚Äì 1922), married Elizabeth Wood. * Octavia Rowena Jones (1826 ‚Äì 1917), married Edwin Polk. * Paul Tudor Jones (1828 ‚Äì 1904), married first Jane M. Wood and second Mary Kirkman. Of the known portraits of Jones, one is held at the Historical House and the other is in Dallas with his descendants. The main dwelling on his Wake Forest plantation, built circa 1820, is now a museum for the Wake Forest College Birthplace Society. The museum is known as Calvin Jones House, and features exhibits about the history of Wake Forest College and the town of Wake Forest, including the Wake Forest College Sports Hall of Fame. The Society also maintains historic archives about the college and town that are available to researchers by appointment.

It affects both primary and permanent dentitions in approximately 1 in every 100,000 patients. It is characterized by presence of normal enamel but atypical dentin with abnormal pulpal morphology. Witkop in 1972 classified DD into two types which are Type I (DD-1) is the radicular type, and type II (DD-2) is the coronal type. DD-1 has been further divided into 4 different subtypes (DD-1a,1b,1c,1d) based on the radiographic features. == Signs and symptoms == Clinically the teeth look normal in colour and morphologic appearance; however, they are commonly very mobile and exfoliated prematurely. Both primary and permanent dentitions can be affected by either type I or type II dentin dysplasia. However, deciduous teeth affected by type II dentin dysplasia have a characteristic blue-amber discolouration, whilst the other dentition appears normal. == Causes == The mutation in collagen type 1 (COL1 A1, COL1 A2) causes DI-1. It is similar to the systemic condition dental features known as osteogenesis imperfect. DI-2, DI-3 and DD-2 share the same genetic mutation of dentin sialophosphoprotein, that is located on chromosome 4. They are autosomal-dominant diseases with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Due to the same genetic mutation, these diseases would often result in overlapping clinical and radiographic features. Therefore, prevailing theories suggests that DI-2, DI-3 and DD-2 are categorized as a single disease entity with variable severity of expression. However, the causes of DD-1 have yet to be theorized. == Diagnosis == Diagnosis is mostly based on general examination and radiographs, and it should be taken when abnormality of the teeth is suspected as most of the affected teeth have normal clinical appearance. Differential diagnosis is very important to have a definitive diagnosis as some radiographic or histologic features of dentine dysplasia may bear a resemblance to different disorders: * Dentinogenesis Imperfecta * Odontodysplasia * Calcinosis * Osteogenesis imperfecta * Ehlers Danlos syndrome * Goldblatt syndrome * Schimke immuno- osseous dysplasia * Brachio-skeleto-genital syndrome. === Type I: Radicular type === Type I has been known as radicular dentine dysplasia because the teeth have undeveloped root(s) with abnormal pulp tissue. Morphology and colour of the crown mostly appear normal, but occasionally teeth appear slightly amber coloured or bluish-brown shine in primary teeth with no or only immature root development. The teeth are mostly maligned and have higher risk of fracture.  Radiographic feature  In other words, affected primary teeth usually have abnormal shaped or shorter than normal roots. ‚ÄúCrescent/half-moon shaped‚Äù pulp chamber remnant in permanent teeth can be seen on x-rays. The roots may appear to be darker or radiolucent/pointy and short with apical constriction. Dentine is laid down abnormally and causes excessive growth within the pulp chamber. This will reduce the pulp space and eventually cause incomplete and total pulp chamber obliteration in permanent teeth. Sometimes periapical pathology or cysts can be seen around the root apex. Most cases of DD associated with peri-apical radiolucency/ pathology have been diagnosed as radicular cysts, but some of them have been as diagnosed peri-apical grauloma instead. === Type II: Coronal type === Type II would mostly cause discolouration to the primary teeth. Affected teeth usually appear as brownish-blue, brown or yellow. Translucent ‚Äúopalescence‚Äù is often one of the characteristics to describe teeth with DD-2. In some cases teeth might show slightly amber coloured but in most of the cases permanent teeth are unaffected and appear normal regardless of colour, shape and size. Dental X-rays are the key to diagnose dentine dysplasia, especially on permanent teeth. Abnormalities of the pulp chamber is the main characteristic to make a definitive diagnosis. In the primary teeth, coronal dentin dysplasia may appear similar to Dentinogenesis Imperfecta type II (DG-II) but if abnormalities features appear to be more pronounced in the permanent teeth, then consider changing the diagnosis to DGI-II instead of DD-2.  Radiographic features  In coronal type, teeth show normal roots containing enlarged pulp with abnormal extensions towards the roots, which is often described as ‚Äúthistle tube‚Äù shaped on dental radiographs. As well as this, numerous pulp stones can be often found in the pulp chambers due to abnormal calcifications. In primary teeth, the pulp chamber is usually completely obliterated but in permanent teeth, the pulp may become partially obliterated after eruption. === Histological features === There are a few studies and proposals that were designed to explain the pathogenesis of DD but the main reason of the cause still remains unclear in the dental literature. Logan et al., suggested that dental papilla is the cause of abnormal root growth or development. They also proposed that calcification of multiple degenerative foci within the papillae reduce the growth and eventually leads to pulpal obliteration. Wesley et al., suggested that odontoblasts with abnormal function and/ or differentiation are mainly due to atypical interaction between odontoblasts and ameloblasts. Histopathologically, deeper layer of the teeth shows abnormal dentine tubular pattern with unstructured, unorganised, atubular areas with normal enamel appearance. Globular or small mass of rounded or irregular shape of atypical dentine is often seen in the pulp. == Treatment == With various options available to dentists, the treatment of this condition can still be difficult. Endodontic treatment is not advised for teeth with complete obliteration of root canals and pulp chambers. An alternative treatment for teeth with periapical abscesses and pulpal necrosis is dental extraction. Retrograde fillings and periapical surgery is a treatment option for teeth with longer roots, as well as orthodontic treatment. However, orthodontic treatment can lead to even more resorption of the roots, which could lead to further tooth mobility and premature exfoliation. Another proposed treatment, for successful oral rehabilitation, is to extract all teeth, curette any cysts and provide the patient with a complete denture. A combination of bone grafting and a sinus lift technique can also be successful to accomplish implant placement. == Management == The best method of maintaining the health of teeth is to practice exemplary oral hygiene. More tooth loss is likely to occur if intervention takes place. However, factors such as present complaint, patient age, severity of the problem, can affect the treatment plan or options. === Stainless steel crowns === Stainless steel crowns which also known as \\"hall crowns\\" can prevent tooth wear and maintain occlusal dimension in affected primary teeth. However, if demanded, composite facings or composite strip crowns can be added for aesthetic reasons. === Endodontics Treatment === Endodontic intervention can help conserve the existing health of affected permanent teeth. It is difficult to perform an endodontic therapy on teeth that develop abscesses as a resultant of obliteration of the pulp chambers and root canals. An alternative to conventional therapy would be retrograde filling and periapical curettage. However, these therapies are not recommended for teeth with roots that are too short. === Removable dentures === Teeth with short thin roots and marked cervical constrictions are less favourable for indirect restorations such as crown placements. If endodontics treatment fails, and abscess develops around the root apex, extraction of the affected teeth would be the best treatment option. Dentures or over dentures can be considered, as rehabilitation until growth is completed. Cast partial dentures could also be an alternative treatment option and it only works if there are a few teeth that has enough root length to serve as retentive purpose. === Dental implants === Dental implant is one of the treatment options that can be considered when growth is fully attained. For patients who experience maxillo-mandibular alveolar atrophy due to early loss of teeth, alveolar ridge augmentation procedure is recommended prior to the implant placement. Both onlay bone grafting and sinus lift techniques can be carried out together to accomplish implant placement. ==References External links == Category:Developmental tooth disorders ","title":"Dentin dysplasia"},{"id":"7455519","text":"Karl Peter Wildoer is a Swedish drummer in the bands Darkane, Electrocution 250 & Grimmark.

The condition is nonhereditary. There is no predilection for race, but females are more likely to get regional odontodysplasia. The enamel, dentin, and pulp of teeth are affected, to the extent that the affected teeth do not develop properly. These teeth are very brittle. On radiographs the teeth appear more radiolucent than normal, so they are often described as \\"ghost teeth\\".Kahn, Michael A. Basic Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Volume 1. 2001. Most cases are considered idiopathic, but some cases are associated with syndromes, growth abnormalities, neural disorders, and vascular malformations. Permanent teeth usually show effects of regional odontodysplasia if the deciduous tooth was affected. Many of these teeth do not erupt, and those that do have an increased risk of caries and periapical inflammation. ==Treatment and prognosis== Treatment and prognosis are usually based upon keeping these teeth and preserving the alveolus. For erupted teeth, endodontics is an option if the tooth is devitalized and restorable. For unerupted teeth, function can be restored with a removable partial denture until all major growth has been completed and a final restoration can be placed.Neville, Brad et al.

Thermal neutrality is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. The main factors that influence thermal comfort are those that determine heat gain and loss, namely metabolic rate, clothing insulation, air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and relative humidity. Psychological parameters, such as individual expectations, also affect thermal comfort. The thermal comfort temperature may vary greatly between individuals and depending on factors such as activity level, clothing, and humidity. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models. It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions. The adaptive model, on the other hand, was developed based on hundreds of field studies with the idea that occupants dynamically interact with their environment. Occupants control their thermal environment by means of clothing, operable windows, fans, personal heaters, and sun shades. The PMV model can be applied to air- conditioned buildings, while the adaptive model can be applied only to buildings where no mechanical systems have been installed. There is no consensus about which comfort model should be applied for buildings that are partially air-conditioned spatially or temporally.

Buildings modify the conditions of the external environment and reduce the effort that the human body needs to do in order to stay stable at a normal human body temperature, important for the correct functioning of human physiological processes. The Roman writer Vitruvius actually linked this purpose to the birth of Architecture. David Linden also suggests that the reason why we associate tropical beaches with paradise is because in those environments is where human bodies need to do less metabolic effort to maintain their core temperature. Temperature not only supports human life; coolness and warmth have also become in different cultures a symbol of protection, community and even the sacred. In building science studies, thermal comfort has been related to productivity and health. Office workers who are satisfied with their thermal environment are more productive.Wargocki, Pawel, and Olli A. Sepp√§nen, et al. (2006) \\"Indoor Climate and Productivity in Offices\\". Vol. 6. REHVA Guidebooks 6. Brussels, Belgium: REHVA, Federation of European Heating and Air-conditioning Associations. The combination of high temperature and high relative humidity reduces thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Although a single static temperature can be comfortable, people are attracted by thermal changes, such as campfires and cool pools. Thermal pleasure is caused by varying thermal sensations from a state of unpleasantness to a state of pleasantness, and the scientific term for it is positive thermal alliesthesia. From a state of thermal neutrality or comfort any change will be perceived as unpleasant. This challenges the assumption that mechanically controlled buildings should deliver uniform temperatures and comfort, if it is at the cost of excluding thermal pleasure. ==Influencing factors== Since there are large variations from person to person in terms of physiological and psychological satisfaction, it is hard to find an optimal temperature for everyone in a given space. Laboratory and field data have been collected to define conditions that will be found comfortable for a specified percentage of occupants. There are six primary factors that directly affect thermal comfort that can be grouped in two categories: personal factors - because they are characteristics of the occupants - and environmental factors - which are conditions of the thermal environment. The former are metabolic rate and clothing level, the latter are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and humidity. Even if all these factors may vary with time, standards usually refer to a steady state to study thermal comfort, just allowing limited temperature variations. ===Metabolic rate=== People have different metabolic rates that can fluctuate due to activity level and environmental conditions. The ASHRAE 55-2010 Standard defines metabolic rate as the level of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities within an organism, usually expressed in terms of unit area of the total body surface. Metabolic rate is expressed in met units, which are defined as follows: 1 met = 58.2 W/m¬≤ (18.4 Btu/h¬∑ft¬≤), which is equal to the energy produced per unit surface area of an average person seated at rest. The surface area of an average person is 1.8 m¬≤ (19 ft¬≤). ASHRAE Standard 55 provides a table of met rates for a variety of activities. Some common values are 0.7 met for sleeping, 1.0 met for a seated and quiet position, 1.2-1.4 met for light activities standing, 2.0 met or more for activities that involve movement, walking, lifting heavy loads or operating machinery. For intermittent activity, the Standard states that it is permissible to use a time-weighted average metabolic rate if individuals are performing activities that vary over a period of one hour or less. For longer periods, different metabolic rates must be considered. According to ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, estimating metabolic rates is complex, and for levels above 2 or 3 met ‚Äì especially if there are various ways of performing such activities ‚Äì the accuracy is low. Therefore, the Standard is not applicable for activities with an average level higher than 2 met. Met values can also be determined more accurately than the tabulated ones, using an empirical equation that takes into account the rate of respiratory oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Another physiological yet less accurate method is related to the heart rate, since there is a relationship between the latter and oxygen consumption.Thermal Comfort chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ASHRAE Handbook, ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005 The Compendium of Physical Activities is used by physicians to record physical activities. It has a different definition of met that is the ratio of the metabolic rate of the activity in question to a resting metabolic rate. As the formulation of the concept is different from the one that ASHRAE uses, these met values cannot be used directly in PMV calculations, but it opens up a new way of quantifying physical activities. Food and drink habits may have an influence on metabolic rates, which indirectly influences thermal preferences. These effects may change depending on food and drink intake. Body shape is another factor that affects thermal comfort. Heat dissipation depends on body surface area. A tall and skinny person has a larger surface-to-volume ratio, can dissipate heat more easily, and can tolerate higher temperatures more than a person with a rounded body shape. ===Clothing insulation=== The amount of thermal insulation worn by a person has a substantial impact on thermal comfort, because it influences the heat loss and consequently the thermal balance. Layers of insulating clothing prevent heat loss and can either help keep a person warm or lead to overheating. Generally, the thicker the garment is, the greater insulating ability it has. Depending on the type of material the clothing is made out of, air movement and relative humidity can decrease the insulating ability of the material. 1 clo is equal to 0.155 m¬≤¬∑K/W (0.88 ¬∞F¬∑ft¬≤¬∑h/Btu). This corresponds to trousers, a long sleeved shirt, and a jacket. Clothing insulation values for other common ensembles or single garments can be found in ASHRAE 55. ===Air temperature=== The air temperature is the average temperature of the air surrounding the occupant, with respect to location and time. According to ASHRAE 55 standard, the spatial average takes into account the ankle, waist and head levels, which vary for seated or standing occupants. The temporal average is based on three-minutes intervals with at least 18 equally spaced points in time. Air temperature is measured with a dry-bulb thermometer and for this reason it is also known as dry-bulb temperature. ===Mean radiant temperature=== The radiant temperature is related to the amount of radiant heat transferred from a surface, and it depends on the material's ability to absorb or emit heat, or its emissivity. The mean radiant temperature depends on the temperatures and emissivities of the surrounding surfaces as well as the view factor, or the amount of the surface that is ‚Äúseen‚Äù by the object. So the mean radiant temperature experienced by a person in a room with the sunlight streaming in varies based on how much of his/her body is in the sun. ===Air speed=== In HVAC, air speed is defined as the rate of air movement at a point, without regard to direction. According to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55, it is the average speed of the air to which the body is exposed, with respect to location and time. The temporal average is the same as the air temperature, while the spatial average is based on the assumption that the body is exposed to a uniform air speed, according to the SET thermo-physiological model. However, some spaces might provide strongly nonuniform air velocity fields and consequent skin heat losses that cannot be considered uniform. Therefore, the designer shall decide the proper averaging, especially including air speeds incident on unclothed body parts, that have greater cooling effect and potential for local discomfort. ===Relative humidity=== Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air to the amount of water vapor that the air could hold at the specific temperature and pressure. While the human body has sensors within the skin that are fairly efficient at feeling heat and cold, relative humidity is detected indirectly. Sweating is an effective heat loss mechanism that relies on evaporation from the skin. However at high RH, the air has close to the maximum water vapor that it can hold, so evaporation, and therefore heat loss, is decreased. On the other hand, very dry environments (RH < 20-30%) are also uncomfortable because of their effect on the mucous membranes. The recommended level of indoor humidity is in the range of 30-60% in air conditioned buildings, but new standards such as the adaptive model allow lower and higher humidities, depending on the other factors involved in thermal comfort. Recently, the effects of low relative humidity and high air velocity were tested on humans after bathing. Researchers found that low relative humidity engendered thermal discomfort as well as the sensation of dryness and itching. It is recommended to keep relative humidity levels higher in a bathroom than other rooms in the house for optimal conditions. Skin wetness Skin wetness is defined as \\"the proportion of the total skin surface area of the body covered with sweat\\". The wetness of skin in different areas also affects perceived thermal comfort. Humidity can increase wetness in different areas of the body, leading to a perception of discomfort. This is usually localized in different parts of the body, and local thermal comfort limits for skin wetness differ by locations of the body. The extremities are much more sensitive to thermal discomfort from wetness than the trunk of the body. Although local thermal discomfort can be caused by wetness, the thermal comfort of the whole body will not be affected by the wetness of certain parts. Interplay of temperature and humidity Various types of apparent temperature have been developed to combine air temperature and air humidity. For higher temperatures, there are quantitative scales, such as the heat index. For lower temperatures, a related interplay was identified only qualitatively: > High humidity and low temperatures cause the air to feel chilly. > Cold air with high relative humidity \\"feels\\" colder than dry air of the same > temperature because high humidity in cold weather increases the conduction > of heat from the body. > There has been controversy over why damp cold air feels colder than dry cold > air. Some believe it is because when the humidity is high, our skin and > clothing become moist and are better conductors of heat, so there is more > cooling by conduction. For more recent data look for Morris NB et al, Ann Int Med 2019, doi:10.7326/M19-0512 ===Natural ventilation=== Many buildings use an HVAC unit to control their thermal environment. Other buildings are naturally ventilated and do not rely on mechanical systems to provide thermal comfort. Depending on the climate, this can drastically reduce energy consumption. It is sometimes seen as a risk, though, since indoor temperatures can be too extreme if the building is poorly designed. Properly designed, naturally ventilated buildings keep indoor conditions within the range where opening windows and using fans in the summer, and wearing extra clothing in the winter, can keep people thermally comfortable. ==Models== When discussing thermal comfort, there are two main different models that can be used: the static model (PMV/PPD) and the adaptive model. ===PMV/PPD method=== The PMV/PPD model was developed by P.O. Fanger using heat-balance equations and empirical studies about skin temperature to define comfort. Standard thermal comfort surveys ask subjects about their thermal sensation on a seven-point scale from cold (-3) to hot (+3). Fanger's equations are used to calculate the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) of a group of subjects for a particular combination of air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation. PMV equal to zero is representing thermal neutrality, and the comfort zone is defined by the combinations of the six parameters for which the PMV is within the recommended limits (-0.5 Although predicting the thermal sensation of a population is an important step in determining what conditions are comfortable, it is more useful to consider whether or not people will be satisfied. Fanger developed another equation to relate the PMV to the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). This relation was based on studies that surveyed subjects in a chamber where the indoor conditions could be precisely controlled. The PMV/PPD model is applied globally but does not directly take into account the adaptation mechanisms and outdoor thermal conditions. ASHRAE Standard 55-2017 uses the PMV model to set the requirements for indoor thermal conditions. It requires that at least 80% of the occupants be satisfied. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE 55 allows users to input the six comfort parameters to determine whether a certain combination complies with ASHRAE 55. The results are displayed on a psychrometric or a temperature- relative humidity chart and indicate the ranges of temperature and relative humidity that will be comfortable with the given the values input for the remaining four parameters. The PMV/PPD model has a low prediction accuracy. Using the world largest thermal comfort field survey database, the accuracy of PMV in predicting occupant's thermal sensation was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation is correctly predicted one out of three times. The PPD was overestimating subject's thermal unacceptability outside the thermal neutrality ranges (-1‚â§PMV‚â§1). The PMV/PPD accuracy varies strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climates. Elevated air speed method ASHRAE 55 2013 accounts for air speeds above separately than the baseline model. Because air movement can provide direct cooling to people, particularly if they are not wearing much clothing, higher temperatures can be more comfortable than the PMV model predicts. Air speeds up to are allowed without local control, and 1.2 m/s is possible with local control. This elevated air movement increases the maximum temperature for an office space in the summer to 30 ¬∞C from 27.5 ¬∞C (). Virtual Energy for Thermal Comfort \\"Virtual Energy for Thermal Comfort\\" is the amount of energy that will be required to make a non-air-conditioned building relatively as comfortable as one with air-conditioning. This is based on the assumption that the home will eventually install air-conditioning or heating. Passive design improves thermal comfort in a building, thus reducing demand for heating or cooling. In many developing countries, however, most occupants do not currently heat or cool, due to economic constraints, as well as climate conditions which border lines comfort conditions such as cold winter nights in Johannesburg (South Africa) or warm summer days in San Jose, Costa Rica. At the same time, as incomes rise, there is a strong tendency to introduce cooling and heating systems. If we recognize and reward passive design features that improve thermal comfort today, we diminish the risk of having to install HVAC systems in the future, or we at least ensure that such systems will be smaller and less frequently used. Or in case the heating or cooling system is not installed due to high cost, at least people should not suffer from discomfort indoors. To provide an example, in San Jose, Costa Rica, if a house were being designed with high level of glazing and small opening sizes, the internal temperature would easily rise above and natural ventilation would not be enough to remove the internal heat gains and solar gains. This is why Virtual Energy for Comfort is important. World Bank's assessment tool the EDGE software (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) illustrates the potential issues with discomfort in buildings and has created the concept of Virtual Energy for Comfort which provides for a way to present potential thermal discomfort. This approach is used to award for design solutions which improves thermal comfort even in a fully free running building. Despite the inclusion of requirements for overheating in CIBSE, overcooling has not been assessed. However, overcooling can be an issue, mainly in the developing world, for example in cities such as Lima (Peru), Bogota, and Delhi, where cooler indoor temperatures can occur frequently. This may be a new area for research and design guidance for reduction of discomfort.  Standard effective temperature  Standard effective temperature (SET*) is a model of human response to the thermal environment. Developed by A.P. Gagge and accepted by ASHRAE in 1986, it is also referred to as the Pierce Two-Node model. Its calculation is similar to PMV because it is a comprehensive comfort index based on heat-balance equations that incorporates the personal factors of clothing and metabolic rate. Its fundamental difference is it takes a two- node method to represent human physiology in measuring skin temperature and skin wettedness. ASHRAE 55-2010 defines SET as \\"the temperature of an imaginary environment at 50% relative humidity, < average air speed, and mean radiant temperature equal to average air temperature, in which total heat loss from the skin of an imaginary occupant with an activity level of 1.0 met and a clothing level of 0.6 clo is the same as that from a person in the actual environment, with actual clothing and activity level\\". Research has tested the model against experimental data and found it tends to overestimate skin temperature and underestimate skin wettedness. Fountain and Huizenga (1997) developed a thermal sensation prediction tool that computes SET. = Cooling Effect = ASHRAE 55-2017 defines the Cooling Effect (CE) at elevated air speed (above ) as the value that, when subtracted from both the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature, yields the same SET value under still air (0.1 m/s) as in the first SET calculation under elevated air speed . : SET(t_{a}, t_{r}, v, met, clo, RH) = SET(t_{a} - CE, t_{r} - CE, v = 0.1, met, clo, RH) The CE can be used to determine the PMV adjusted for an environment with elevated air speed using the adjusted temperature, the adjusted radiant temperature and still air (). Where the adjusted temperatures are equal to the original air and mean radiant temperatures minus the CE. =Radiant temperature asymmetry= Large differences in the thermal radiation of the surfaces surrounding a person may cause local discomfort or reduce acceptance of the thermal conditions. ASHRAE Standard 55 sets limits on the allowable temperature differences between various surfaces. Because people are more sensitive to some asymmetries than others, for example that of a warm ceiling versus that of hot and cold vertical surfaces, the limits depend on which surfaces are involved. The ceiling is not allowed to be more than + warmer, whereas a wall may be up to + warmer than the other surfaces. =Draft= While air movement can be pleasant and provide comfort in some circumstances, it is sometimes unwanted and causes discomfort. This unwanted air movement is called \\"draft\\" and is most prevalent when the thermal sensation of the whole body is cool. People are most likely to feel a draft on uncovered body parts such as their head, neck, shoulders, ankles, feet, and legs, but the sensation also depends on the air speed, air temperature, activity, and clothing. =Vertical air temperature difference= Thermal stratification that results in the air temperature at the head level being higher than at the ankle level may cause thermal discomfort. ASHRAE Standard 55 recommends that the difference not be greater than 3 ¬∞C (5.4 ¬∞F) for seated occupants or for standing occupants 4 ¬∞C (7.2 ¬∞F). =Floor surface temperature= Floors that are too warm or too cool may cause discomfort, depending on footwear. ASHRAE 55 recommends that floor temperatures stay in the range of in spaces where occupants will be wearing lightweight shoes. ===Adaptive comfort model=== Adaptive chart according to ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 The adaptive model is based on the idea that outdoor climate influences indoor comfort because humans can adapt to different temperatures during different times of the year. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors, such as having access to environmental controls, and past thermal history can influence building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. Numerous researchers have conducted field studies worldwide in which they survey building occupants about their thermal comfort while taking simultaneous environmental measurements. Analyzing a database of results from 160 of these buildings revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed, air-conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on outdoor conditions. These results were incorporated in the ASHRAE 55-2004 standard as the adaptive comfort model. The adaptive chart relates indoor comfort temperature to prevailing outdoor temperature and defines zones of 80% and 90% satisfaction. The ASHRAE-55 2010 Standard introduced the prevailing mean outdoor temperature as the input variable for the adaptive model. It is based on the arithmetic average of the mean daily outdoor temperatures over no fewer than 7 and no more than 30 sequential days prior to the day in question. It can also be calculated by weighting the temperatures with different coefficients, assigning increasing importance to the most recent temperatures. In case this weighting is used, there is no need to respect the upper limit for the subsequent days. In order to apply the adaptive model, there should be no mechanical cooling system for the space, occupants should be engaged in sedentary activities with metabolic rates of 1-1.3 met, and a prevailing mean temperature of . This model applies especially to occupant-controlled, natural-conditioned spaces, where the outdoor climate can actually affect the indoor conditions and so the comfort zone. In fact, studies by de Dear and Brager showed that occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a wider range of temperatures. This is due to both behavioral and physiological adjustments, since there are different types of adaptive processes.La Roche, P. (2011). Carbon-neutral architectural design. CRC Press. ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 states that differences in recent thermal experiences, changes in clothing, availability of control options, and shifts in occupant expectations can change people's thermal responses. Adaptive models of thermal comfort are implemented in other standards, such as European EN 15251 and ISO 7730 standard. While the exact derivation methods and results are slightly different from the ASHRAE 55 adaptive standard, they are substantially the same. A larger difference is in applicability. The ASHRAE adaptive standard only applies to buildings without mechanical cooling installed, while EN15251 can be applied to mixed-mode buildings, provided the system is not running.EN 15251 Standard 2007, Indoor environmental input parameters for design and assessment of energy performance of buildings addressing indoor air quality, thermal environment, lighting and acoustics There are basically three categories of thermal adaptation, namely: behavioral, physiological, and psychological. Psychological Adaptation An individual's comfort level in a given environment may change and adapt over time due to psychological factors. Subjective perception of thermal comfort may be influenced by the memory of previous experiences. Habituation takes place when repeated exposure moderates future expectations, and responses to sensory input. This is an important factor in explaining the difference between field observations and PMV predictions (based on the static model) in naturally ventilated buildings. In these buildings, the relationship with the outdoor temperatures has been twice as strong as predicted. Psychological adaptation is subtly different in the static and adaptive models. Laboratory tests of the static model can identify and quantify non-heat transfer (psychological) factors that affect reported comfort. The adaptive model is limited to reporting differences (called psychological) between modeled and reported comfort. Thermal comfort as a \\"condition of mind\\" is defined in psychological terms. Among the factors that affect the condition of mind (in the laboratory) are a sense of control over the temperature, knowledge of the temperature and the appearance of the (test) environment. A thermal test chamber that appeared residential \\"felt\\" warmer than one which looked like the inside of a refrigerator. Physiological Adaptation The body has several thermal adjustment mechanisms to survive in drastic temperature environments. In a cold environment the body utilizes vasoconstriction; which reduces blood flow to the skin, skin temperature and heat dissipation. In a warm environment, vasodilation will increase blood flow to the skin, heat transport, and skin temperature and heat dissipation. If there is an imbalance despite the vasomotor adjustments listed above, in a warm environment sweat production will start and provide evaporative cooling. If this is insufficient, hyperthermia will set in, body temperature may reach , and heat stroke may occur. In a cold environment, shivering will start, involuntarily forcing the muscles to work and increasing the heat production by up to a factor of 10. If equilibrium is not restored, hypothermia can set in, which can be fatal. Long-term adjustments to extreme temperatures, of a few days to six months, may result in cardiovascular and endocrine adjustments. A hot climate may create increased blood volume, improving the effectiveness of vasodilation, enhanced performance of the sweat mechanism, and the readjustment of thermal preferences. In cold or underheated conditions, vasoconstriction can become permanent, resulting in decreased blood volume and increased body metabolic rate. Behavioral Adaptation In naturally ventilated buildings, occupants take numerous actions to keep themselves comfortable when the indoor conditions drift towards discomfort. Operating windows and fans, adjusting blinds/shades, changing clothing, and consuming food and drinks are some of the common adaptive strategies. Among these, adjusting windows is the most common. Those occupants who take these sorts of actions tend to feel cooler at warmer temperatures than those who do not. The behavioral actions significantly influence energy simulation inputs, and researchers are developing behavior models to improve the accuracy of simulation results. For example, there are many window-opening models that have been developed to date, but there is no consensus over the factors that trigger window opening. People might adapt to seasonal heat by becoming more nocturnal, doing physical activity and even conducting business at night. ==Specificity and sensitivityIndividual differences=== The thermal sensitivity of an individual is quantified by the descriptor FS, which takes on higher values for individuals with lower tolerance to non-ideal thermal conditions. This group includes pregnant women, the disabled, as well as individuals whose age is below fourteen or above sixty, which is considered the adult range. Existing literature provides consistent evidence that sensitivity to hot and cold surfaces usually declines with age. There is also some evidence of a gradual reduction in the effectiveness of the body in thermo-regulation after the age of sixty. This is mainly due to a more sluggish response of the counteraction mechanisms in lower parts of the body that are used to maintain the core temperature of the body at ideal values. Seniors prefer warmer temperatures than young adults (76 vs 72 degrees F). Situational factors include the health, psychological, sociological, and vocational activities of the persons. ===Biological gender differences=== While thermal comfort preferences between sexes seems to be small, there are some average differences. Studies have found males on average report discomfort due to rises in temperature much earlier than females. Males on average also estimate higher levels of their sensation of discomfort than females. One recent study tested males and females in the same cotton clothing, performing mental jobs while using a dial vote to report their thermal comfort to the changing temperature. Many times, females will prefer higher temperatures. But while females tended to be more sensitive to temperatures, males tend to be more sensitive to relative-humidity levels. An extensive field study was carried out in naturally ventilated residential buildings in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. This investigation explored the sexes thermal sensitivity to the indoor environment in non-air-conditioned residential buildings. Multiple hierarchical regression for categorical moderator was selected for data analysis; the result showed that as a group females were slightly more sensitive than males to the indoor air temperatures, whereas, under thermal neutrality, it was found that males and females have similar thermal sensation.. ===Regional differences=== In different areas of the world, thermal comfort needs may vary based on climate. In China the climate has hot humid summers and cold winters, causing a need for efficient thermal comfort. Energy conservation in relation to thermal comfort has become a large issue in China in the last several decades due to rapid economic and population growth. Researchers are now looking into ways to heat and cool buildings in China for lower costs and also with less harm to the environment. In tropical areas of Brazil, urbanization is creating urban heat islands (UHI). These are urban areas that have risen over the thermal comfort limits due to a large influx of people and only drop within the comfortable range during the rainy season.. Urban heat islands can occur over any urban city or built-up area with the correct conditions.United States Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Air and Radiation. Office of the Administrator.; Smart Growth Network (2003). Smart Growth and Urban Heat Islands. (EPA-content) In the hot, humid region of Saudi Arabia, the issue of thermal comfort has been important in mosques, because they are very large open buildings that are used only intermittently (very busy for the noon prayer on Fridays) it is hard to ventilate them properly. The large size requires a large amount of ventilation, which requires a lot of energy since the buildings are used only for short periods of time. Temperature regulation in Mosques is a challenge due to the intermittent demand, leading to many Mosques being either too hot or too cold. The stack effect also comes into play due to their large size and creates a large layer of hot air above the people in the mosque. New designs have placed the ventilation systems lower in the buildings to provide more temperature control at ground level. New monitoring steps are also being taken to improve efficiency.Nasrollahi, N. (2009). Thermal environments and occupant thermal comfort. VDM Verlag, 2009, . ==Thermal stress== The concept of thermal comfort is closely related to thermal stress. This attempts to predict the impact of solar radiation, air movement, and humidity for military personnel undergoing training exercises or athletes during competitive events. Values are expressed as the wet bulb globe temperature or the discomfort index. Generally, humans do not perform well under thermal stress. People's performances under thermal stress is about 11% lower than their performance at normal thermal wet conditions. Also, human performance in relation to thermal stress varies greatly by the type of task which the individual is completing. Some of the physiological effects of thermal heat stress include increased blood flow to the skin, sweating, and increased ventilation. ==Research== The factors affecting thermal comfort were explored experimentally in the 1970s. Many of these studies led to the development and refinement of ASHRAE Standard 55 and were performed at Kansas State University by Ole Fanger and others. Perceived comfort was found to be a complex interaction of these variables. It was found that the majority of individuals would be satisfied by an ideal set of values. As the range of values deviated progressively from the ideal, fewer and fewer people were satisfied. This observation could be expressed statistically as the percent of individuals who expressed satisfaction by comfort conditions and the predicted mean vote (PMV). This approach was challenged by the adaptive comfort model, developed from the ASHRAE 884 project, which revealed that occupants were comfortable in a broader range of temperatures. This research is applied to create Building Energy Simulation (BES) programs for residential buildings. Residential buildings in particular can vary much more in thermal comfort than public and commercial buildings. This is due to their smaller size, the variations in clothing worn, and different uses of each room. The main rooms of concern are bathrooms and bedrooms. Bathrooms need to be at a temperature comfortable for a human with or without clothing. Bedrooms are of importance because they need to accommodate different levels of clothing and also different metabolic rates of people asleep or awake. Discomfort hours is a common metric used to evaluate the thermal performance of a space. Thermal comfort research in clothing is currently being done by the military. New air- ventilated garments are being researched to improve evaporative cooling in military settings. Some models are being created and tested based on the amount of cooling they provide. In the last twenty years, researchers have also developed advanced thermal comfort models that divide the human body into many segments, and predict local thermal discomfort by considering heat balance. This has opened up a new arena of thermal comfort modeling that aims at heating/cooling selected body parts. ===Medical environments=== Whenever the studies referenced tried to discuss the thermal conditions for different groups of occupants in one room, the studies ended up simply presenting comparisons of thermal comfort satisfaction based on the subjective studies. No study tried to reconcile the different thermal comfort requirements of different types of occupants who compulsorily must stay in one room. Therefore, it looks to be necessary to investigate the different thermal conditions required by different groups of occupants in hospitals to reconcile their different requirements in this concept. To reconcile the differences in the required thermal comfort conditions it is recommended to test the possibility of using different ranges of local radiant temperature in one room via a suitable mechanical system. Although different researches are undertaken on thermal comfort for patients in hospitals, it is also necessary to study the effects of thermal comfort conditions on the quality and the quantity of healing for patients in hospitals. There are also original researches that show the link between thermal comfort for staff and their levels of productivity, but no studies have been produced individually in hospitals in this field. Therefore, research for coverage and methods individually for this subject is recommended. Also research in terms of cooling and heating delivery systems for patients with low levels of immune-system protection (such as HIV patients, burned patients, etc.) are recommended. There are important areas, which still need to be focused on including thermal comfort for staff and its relation with their productivity, using different heating systems to prevent hypothermia in the patient and to improve the thermal comfort for hospital staff simultaneously. Finally, the interaction between people, systems and architectural design in hospitals is a field in which require further work needed to improve the knowledge of how to design buildings and systems to reconcile many conflicting factors for the people occupying these buildings. ===Personal comfort systems=== Personal comfort systems (PCS) refer to devices or systems which heat or cool a building occupant personally. This concept is best appreciated in contrast to central HVAC systems which have uniform temperature settings for extensive areas. Personal comfort systems include fans and air diffusers of various kinds (e.g. desk fans, nozzles and slot diffusers, overhead fans, high-volume low-speed fans etc.) and personalized sources of radiant or conductive heat (footwarmers, legwarmers, hot water bottles etc.). PCS has the potential to satisfy individual comfort requirements much better than current HVAC systems, as interpersonal differences in thermal sensation due to age, sex, body mass, metabolic rate, clothing and thermal adaptation can amount to an equivalent temperature variation of 2-5 K, which is impossible for a central, uniform HVAC system to cater to. Besides, research has shown that the perceived ability to control one's thermal environment tends to widen one's range of tolerable temperatures. Traditionally, PCS devices have been used in isolation from one another. However, it has been proposed by Andersen et al. (2016) that a network of PCS devices which generate well-connected microzones of thermal comfort, and report real-time occupant information and respond to programmatic actuation requests (e.g. a party, a conference, a concert etc.) can combine with occupant-aware building applications to enable new methods of comfort maximization. ==See also== * ASHRAE * ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 * Air conditioning * Building insulation * Mean radiant temperature * Mahoney tables * Povl Ole Fanger * Psychrometrics * Ralph G.

Historically Mj√∏ndalen was known for its industry; including paper & pulp production and a substantial cellulose industry. The production of wood products and furniture are also traditional commercial activities. All the paper mills closed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ==Sports and media== Mj√∏ndalen has a friendly sports rivalry with the neighbouring communities of Solbergelva and Krokstadelva. The rivalry is mostly in sports such as football and bandy and cross-country skiing. In football, Mj√∏ndalen IF Fotball plays in Eliteserien, the top tier in the Norwegian league system. In bandy, Mj√∏ndalen IF have become Norwegian champions several times. The newspaper Eikerbladet is published in Mj√∏ndalen. Mj√∏ndalen Church ==Mj√∏ndalen Church== Mj√∏ndalen Church (Mj√∏ndalen Kirke) was opened in 1983. It was built after drawings by architect Elisabeth Breen Fidjest√∏l. The building was constructed of brick and wood and has 380 seats. The building consists of the church sanctuary and adjacent church hall, offices, chapel and youth department and group rooms. It is part of the Church of Norway and belongs to Eiker Prosti in the Diocese of Tunsberg. ==Port√•sen== Port√•sen - childhood home of poet Herman Wildenvey Port√•sen is a museum honouring the life and writing of Herman Wildenvey, a prominent Norwegian poet. Herman Wildenvey lived the first three years of his life in Mj√∏ndalen. At three years of age, he was moved to the Port√•sen farm on the edge of the forest above the village. Today Port√•sen, Wildenveys rike is a cultural centre, meeting place and venue for local, regional and national artists. The site includes a newly renovated farmhouse and farm buildings.

One of the most successful R&B; groups of the early 1950s, the Dominoes helped launch the singing careers of two notable members, Clyde McPhatter and Jackie Wilson. ==Career== Billy Ward (born Robert L. Williams, 19 September 1921, Savannah, Georgia, died 16 February 2002, Inglewood, California) grew up in Philadelphia, the second of three sons of Charles Williams and Cora Bates Williams, and was a child musical prodigy, winning an award for a piano composition at the age of 14.Warner, Jay (2006). American Singing Groups: A History from 1940s to Today, pp. 312-15. Hal Leonard Corporation. Following military service with the Coast Guard Artillery Choir, he studied music in Chicago, and at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, something that very few blacks like Ward had achieved. While working as a vocal coach and part- time arranger on Broadway, he met talent agent Rose Marks, who became his business and songwriting partner. The pair set out to form a vocal group from the ranks of his students, hoping to cash in on the new trend of vocal quintets in R&B.; The group was at first called the Ques, composed of Clyde McPhatter (lead tenor), whom Ward recruited after McPhatter won \\"Amateur Night\\" at the Apollo Theater, Charlie White (tenor), Joe Lamont (baritone), and Bill Brown (bass). Ward acted as their pianist and arranger. After the group made successful appearances on talent shows in the Apollo Theater and on the Arthur Godfrey show in 1950, Rene Hall recommended them to Ralph Bass of Federal Records, a subsidiary of King, where they were signed to a recording contract and renamed themselves the Dominoes. Their first single release, \\"Do Something For Me\\", with McPhatter‚Äôs lead vocal, reached the R&B; charts in early 1951, climbing to number 6. After a less successful follow-up, the group released \\"Sixty Minute Man\\", on which Brown sang lead, and boasted of being able to satisfy his girls with fifteen minutes each of \\"kissin'\\" \\"teasin'\\" and \\"squeezin'\\", before \\"blowin'\\" his \\"top\\". It reached number 1 on the R&B; chart in May 1951 and stayed there for 14 weeks, and crossed over to the pop charts, reaching number 17 and voted \\"Song of the Year\\" of 1951. It was an important record in several respects‚Äîit crossed the boundaries between gospel singing and blues, its lyrics pushed the limits of what was deemed acceptable, and it appealed to many white as well as black listeners. In later years, it became a contender for the title of \\"first rock 'n' roll record\\". The group toured widely, building up a reputation as one of the top R&B; acts of the era, edging out the Five Keys and the Clovers (two of the top R&B; groups of the early 1950s) and commanding audiences which crossed racial divides. However, Ward's strict disciplinarian approach, and failure to recompense the singers, caused internal problems. Ward is remembered as a petty tyrant who levied fines against group members for infractions, including arriving late for rehearsals and wearing un-shined shoes on stage. Jackie Wilson recalled, \\"Billy Ward was not an easy man to work for. He played piano and organ, could arrange, and he was a fine director and coach. He knew what he wanted, and you had to give it to him. And he was a strict disciplinarian. You better believe it! You paid a fine if you stepped out of line.\\"Shaew, Arnold (1978). Honkers and Shouters: The Golden Years of Rhythm and Blues. New York: Crowell-Collier Press. p. 443. Ward most likely got the idea of levying fines against group members from his tenure in the military. Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice gives a unit commander authority to mete a certain amount of punishment to troops under his or her command without going through a court- martial, which includes fines (partial forfeiture of pay). The name \\"The Dominoes\\" was owned by Ward and Marks, who had the power to hire and fire and to pay the singers a salary. Clyde McPhatter was being paid barely enough to live on, even though most of the Dominoes' success was due to McPhatter's soaring vocal abilities. \\"Whenever I'd get back on the block where everybody'd heard my records‚Äîhalf the time I couldn't afford a Coca-Cola,\\" according to McPhatter.Grendysa, Peter. \\"The Drifters: Let the Boogie Woogie Roll, 1953‚Äì1958\\". Atlantic Records 81927-1. Allegedly, Ward paid his singers $100 a week (US$ in dollars), minus deductions for taxes, food and hotel bills.Shaw, Honkers and Shouters, 1978, p. 283. McPhatter often found himself billed as \\"Clyde Ward\\" to fool fans into thinking he was Billy Ward's little brother. Others assumed Ward was doing the lead singing. White and Brown both left in 1951 to form the Checkers and were replaced by James Van Loan (1922‚Äì1976) and David McNeil (1932‚Äì2005, previously of the Larks). In March 1952, the Dominoes were chosen to be the only vocal group at Alan Freed's \\"Moondog Coronation Ball\\". The hits continued, with \\"Have Mercy Baby\\" topping the R&B; charts for 10 weeks in 1952. Later records were credited to \\"Billy Ward and His Dominoes\\". In early 1953, McPhatter left to form his own group, the Drifters. His replacement in the Dominoes was Jackie Wilson, who had been coached by McPhatter while also singing with the group on tour. Lamont and McNeil also left and were replaced by Milton Merle and Cliff Givens (Givens had been in the Southern Sons Gospel Quartet; he joined the Ink Spots in 1944 upon the death of original bass Orville \\"Hoppy\\" Jones). With Wilson singing lead, singles such as \\"You Can't Keep a Good Man Down\\" continued to be successful, although the Dominoes did not enjoy quite the same success as they had with McPhatter as lead tenor. In 1954, Ward moved the group to Jubilee Records and then to Decca Records, with which they had a number 27 pop hit, \\"St. Therese of the Roses\\", featuring Wilson on tenor, giving the Dominoes a brief moment in the spotlight again. However, the group was unable to follow that success on the charts, and there were a succession of personnel changes. They increasingly moved away from their R&B; roots with appearances in Las Vegas and elsewhere. Elvis Presley went to hear Jackie Wilson and the Dominoes in Las Vegas in 1956 and was so impressed with Wilson's singing that he went back to Sun Studios and cut the Million Dollar Quartet's version of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". Presley introduced the song by saying how Wilson sang it much better and then proceeded to do an impersonation of the much slower Dominoes version, backed by Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis. In late 1957, Wilson left for a solo career and was replaced by Gene Mumford of the Larks, after which the group signed a contract with Liberty Records. They had a #13 pop hit with \\"Star Dust\\". \\"Star Dust\\" was one of the earliest multitrack recordings in the rock and roll era. The session was on March 7, 1957. The tapes have been mixed into true stereo, making the recording one of the first songs (1957) by a rock and roll/R&B; artist in true stereo. The track also reached #13 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1957. It was to be their only million seller. It was followed by \\"Deep Purple\\". This proved to be their last major success, although various lineups of the group continued recording and performing into the 1960s. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2006. ==DiscographySingles=== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Single (A-side, B-side) Both sides from same album except where indicated ! colspan=\\"3\\" Chart Positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font-size:small;\\" ! width=\\"40\\" US Pop ! width=\\"40\\" US R&B; ! width=\\"40\\" UK -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 1951  align=\\"left\\" \\"Harbor Lights\\" b/w \\"'No!'

While president of Georgia Tech, Pettit advanced the causes of research and industrial development at the school; Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark and Pettit headed Tech's $100 million Centennial Campaign. ==Early life and career== Joseph M. Pettit was born in Rochester, Minnesota. He earned a B.S. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1938, an engineering degree from Stanford University in 1940, and a Ph.D. from Stanford in 1942. From 1940 to 1942, Pettit served as an instructor at the University of California. He then joined the World War II radar countermeasures project at the Radio Research Laboratory of Harvard University. Following the war effort, Pettit became supervising engineer with Airborne Instruments Laboratory in New York. In 1947, Pettit joined the faculty of Stanford University, and was named Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1954. He was named Dean of the Stanford School of Engineering in 1958, and would remain in the position until 1972. ==Georgia Tech== Pettit became president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top tier research institution. Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten. In 1975, the Georgia General Assembly designated the Engineering Experiment Station (now the Georgia Tech Research Institute) as the \\"Georgia Productivity Center\\". Georgia was the first state to designate such a center to encourage business productivity. In the aftermath of the launch of Scientific Atlanta by Glen P. Robinson and the subsequent disputes, Georgia Tech's culture encouraged hard work, but did not encourage start-ups. This changed during Joseph Pettit's administration; Pettit was at Stanford during the development of Silicon Valley and worked to change the culture to inspire something similar in Atlanta. \\"That was when Tech began actively encouraging faculty, staff and students to be entrepreneurial... In some ways it was a shift back to our roots, with Tech beginning to reconnect with the state through the Advanced Technology Development Center, the Economic Development Institute and the Georgia Research Alliance\\", according to Bob McMath. During Pettit's tenure as Georgia Tech's president, the Institute progressed into top tier of technological education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark for the first time in its history. In addition, Pettit spearheaded Tech's historic $100 million Centennial Campaign. A total of $202.7 million was raised during the Centennial Campaign, which was Georgia Tech's first major fundraising effort. Pettit worked closely with J. Erskine Love, Jr. with regards to these fundraising efforts; Love was later asked to deliver the eulogy at Pettit's funeral. Numerous research centers were established during Pettit's tenure at Georgia Tech. In 1978, Georgia Tech established the Georgia Mining Resources Institute, which was linked to the U. S. Bureau of Mines; they also established the Fracture and Fatigue Research Laboratory. Other centers established around this time included the Computational Mechanics Center in 1979; the Center for Rehabilitation Technology in 1980; the Advance Technology Center, the Technology Policy and Assessment Center, and the Microelectronics Research Center in 1981; the Materials Handling Research Center, Center for Architecture Conservation, Center for Excellence in Rotary Wing Aircraft, and Communication Research Center in 1982; the Research Center for Biotechnology in 1983; and the Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, and the College of Architecture Construction Research Center in 1986. The general assembly granted $15 million in funding for the Center of Excellence in Microelectronics in 1985. Pettit also oversaw Georgia Tech's application and admittance into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), an athletic league founded in 1953 which included seven charter members. Georgia Tech had withdrawn from the Southeastern Conference in January 1964 and had operated as an Independent until 1975 when Georgia Tech joined the Metro Conference. Georgia Tech was admitted to the ACC on April 3, 1978. The ACC has expanded from 8 to 12 members since that time. Pettit died of cancer in 1986, and his vice president of academic affairs, Henry C. Bourne, Jr., served as interim president. ==Honors and awards== Pettit was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1949 for his contributions during World War II. He was named a Fellow of the Institute of Radio Engineers (now part of IEEE) in 1954 and served on that organization's board of directors from 1954 to 1955. He was elected as a life member of IEEE in 1982. While in IRE and later IEEE, Pettit founded two academic conferences: Wescon in 1949 and Southcon in 1981. Pettit was also involved in the American Society for Engineering Education, serving two terms on their board of directors and one term, 1972-1973, as their president. He served on the National Science Board from 1977 to 1982, and also served as an advisor to the National Science Foundation. The Joseph Mayo Pettit Distinguished Service Award, conferred by the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, is named after Pettit. ==See also== * History of Georgia Tech#Research expansion ==ReferencesExternal links== *IEEE Profile of Joseph M.

Kathy Reichs herself is a forensic anthropologist who works for Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of North Carolina, and for the Laboratoire des Sciences Judiciaires et de M√©decine L√©gale for the province of Quebec. ==Plot== The plot of the story revolves around Brennan trying to decipher the clues left behind by the skeletons of three girls found in a pizza parlor basement in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which has a colourful history. Brennan's forensic expertise tells her that the people were buried after 1955, but homicide detective Luc Claudel is convinced the bones are pre-1955, and dismisses the case. Brennan's frustration at Claudel for not investigating the case grows and she decides to take it on herself. From simply the remains of the three girls, she follows the clues which include a frightened old lady, a crazed man with a S&M; fetish, and finally a girl who has been subjected to so much sexual torture, she develops a taste for it herself. ==Inspiration== At the end of the book, Reichs writes that her inspiration for the plot was three skeletons she was sent to investigate that were found in a pizza parlor basement. The girls' bones showed that they had died before 1955 so there was no police investigation into the deaths. Reichs writes she has always wondered who the girls were and how they came to be buried under the parlor. The other inspiration the story is based upon is revealed in-story in chapters 29 & 30, where the Kidnapping of Colleen Stan is recounted and later discovered as the inspiration of antagonist Menard (copycat crime). ==Dedication== The dedication at the start of the book reads; \\"To Deborah Minor and my baby sister Harry\\". Deborah Minor is Reichs' publisher and Harry is her younger sister, upon whom a character in the book, Brennan's sister Harry, is based. ==External links== * About.com review * Kathy Reichs' official website summary Category:2004 American novels Category:Novels by Kathy Reichs Category:Novels set in North Carolina Category:Heinemann (publisher) books Category:Charles Scribner's Sons books ","title":"Monday Mourning"},{"id":"7455726","text":"Idiopathic osteosclerosis, also known as enostosis or dense bone island, is a condition which may be found around the roots of a tooth. It is usually painless and found during routine radiographs. It appears as a radiopaque (light area) around a tooth, usually a premolar or molar. There is no sign of inflammation of the tooth. ==Signs and symptoms== Focal radiodensity of the jaw which is not inflammatory, dysplastic, neoplastic or a manifestation of a systemic disease. This is common and affects 5% of the population, usually seen in teens and those in their 20s. Typically asymptomatic and is an incidental finding on a radiograph. found anywhere in the jaw, most commonly in the mandibular premolar-molar region. The shape ranges from round to linear streaks to occasional angular forms. ==Cause == A reaction to past trauma or infection but it's difficult to rule out in some cases. ==Diagnosis== Usual diagnosis is via radiograph, patient history, biopsy is rarely needed. Periodic follow ups should included additional radiographs that show minimal growth or regression. ===Radiology=== Well defined, rounded or triangular radiodensity, that is uniformly opaque. There is no lucent component. Found near the root apex or in the inter-radicular area. Root resorption and tooth movement are rare. ===Differential Diagnosis=== Condensing osteitis, sclerosing osteomyelitis, Enostosis cementoblastoma, hypercementosis, Exostoses (tori). Condensing osteitis may resemble idiopathic osteosclerosis, however, associated teeth are always nonvital in condensing osteitis. ==Treatment== No treatment is necessary. ==References External links == Category:Pathology of the maxilla and mandible ","title":"Idiopathic osteosclerosis"},{"id":"7455730","text":"Michael Eugene Stamm (born August 6, 1952) is an American former backstroke swimmer who earned a gold medal as a member of the winning U.S. team in the men's 4√ó100-meter medley relay at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.

This was due to the efforts of educationist, Ami Chandra and support from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which owned a large Sugar Mill in Ba. By 1940 there were four teams playing in a local league, with more clubs joining in the 1950s. The football team took part in a league organised by the Northern District Association in which teams from the north west districts of Viti Levu. In 1962 the Fiji Indian Football Association changed its name to the Fiji Football Association and the Ba Indian Football Association changed its name to the Ba Football Association so players of all races could play with the Ba FC. The team is currently sponsored by 4R Electric.

He was rated the best all- around polo player in the United States for eight consecutive years, a golfer who competed in the U.S. Open, and a pioneer racecar driver who vied for the Gordon Bennett Cup. In addition to his substantial involvement in flat racing, he was also a founding member of the National Steeplechase Association. ==Biography== He was born in San Francisco, California on December 18, 1867 to Sarah Jay Daingerfield and James Robert Keene. At the time of his birth, his father was president of the San Francisco Stock Exchange. James R. Keene was also a major owner/breeder of thoroughbred racehorses and a founder of The Jockey Club from whom Foxhall Keene inherited Castleton Farm, an important breeding operation near Lexington, Kentucky. Keene was an avid golfer who competed in the 1897 U.S. Open and who made it to the quarterfinals in the 1898 U.S. Amateur. Although he played at a high level in a number of sports, he excelled at the game of polo. A 10-goal player, he was a member of the Rockaway Hunting Club in Lawrence, Nassau County, New York, today the oldest country club in the United States. With team captain Tommy Hitchcock, in 1886 he was part of the first U.S. international polo team that competed in the inaugural International Polo Cup matches against England. He was rated the best all-around polo player in the United States for eight consecutive years and won the Gold Medal in Polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Following its formation, he was inducted posthumously into the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame in 1992. Keene also competed as a top-level tennis player, reaching the semifinals of the 1883 U.S. National Championships and the quarterfinals in 1885. With the advent of automobile racing, Keene competed in the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup at Athy, County Kildare, Ireland driving a Mercedes. In a race won by Camille Jenatzy, he did not finish after his car experienced axle problems. Keene maintained a country home at Monkton, Maryland and a home in England with a stable at Melton Mowbray where he kept up to ten field hunters for fox hunting. In addition, he had a seasonal residence at Ayer's Cliff, Quebec on Lake Massawippi. He died in poverty on September 25, 1941 at Ayer's Cliff, Quebec. ==Legacy== His father named one of his horses Foxhall who won the 1882 Ascot Gold Cup in England. Recently, two Thoroughbred racehorses, one born in 1983 and another in 2002, were named after Foxhall Keene. Several publications, including The American Heritage Cookbook and Illustrated History of American Eating and Drinking and the Encyclopedia of North American Eating and Drinking Traditions, Customs and Rituals claim that Chicken √† la King was prepared at Keene's suggestion. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Hatch, Alden and Foxhall Keene.

It is twice as common in females and is more likely to occur before age 30. Central giant-cell granulomas are more common in the anterior mandible, often crossing the midline and causing painless swellings. == Signs and symptoms == CGCG is the most common giant cell lesion of the jaws. These lesions are localised fibrous tissue tumours which contain osteoclasts and are usually several centimetres across. Frequently, a painless swelling that grows and expands rapidly is present. This growth can also erode through bone including the alveolar ridge, resulting in a soft tissue swelling that is purple in colour. Paresthesia of the lip has also been observed. Resorption of tooth roots is seen in 37% of cases compared to displacement of teeth in 50%. Two-thirds of lesions are found anterior to molars in the mandible, where teeth have deciduous predecessors. CGCGs are twice as likely to affect females and usually seen in those under 30-years. However, can be seen in a broad age range. === Noonan syndrome === Multiple CGCGs can be found in individuals with Noonan syndrome. Mutations in PTPN11 or RAS pathway genes are seen. == Diagnosis == Radiographically, CGCGs have a rounded cyst-like radiolucent area with a well-defined margin with 53% showing scalloped margins. They can have a multilocular (honeycomb or soap bubble) appearance. Histologically similar to brown tumour found in hyperparathyroidism. Biochemical investigation through serum calcium, to exclude hyperparathyroidism. ===Histology=== Unknown pathogenesis. Histology of CGCG shows a lobulated mass composed of vascular connective tissue and multinucleated giant cells (osteoclasts). The giant cells may be diffusely located throughout the lesion or focally aggregate in the lesion, often clustered around hemorrhagic areas hemosiderin deposits. Lobules of the lesion can be separated by fibrous tissue or even thin layer of bone or osteoid that can be seen radiographically. Giant cells are thought to form in response to signals produced by fibroblasts and blood vessels or as a response to cytokines. === Differential diagnosis === *Odontogenic keratocyst *Ameloblastoma *Odontogenic myxoma *Hemangioma *Central odontogenic fibroma *Brown tumour of hyperparathyrodism *Cherubism *Aneurysmal bone cysts == Treatment == The treatment for enlarged CGCG is usually thorough curettage. Recurrence ranges from 15%‚Äì20%, second curettage is sufficient to prevent further recurrence. Rapidly growing tumours are more likely to recur and can sometimes require full excision with surrounding bone. Large lesions can require en bloc resections. Alternatives or adjuncts to surgery: *Corticosteroids which convert lesions into fibrous tissue *Calcitonin which slows growth *Interferon Œ±-2a which slow growth *Bisphosphonates which slow growth These therapeutic approaches provide possible alternatives for large lesions which can not go through immediate surgery or in children where facial growth following surgery might be affected. However, no significant differences have been found in the use of surgical and non-surgical methods for treating CGCGs. The long term prognosis of giant-cell granulomas is good and metastases do not develop. == See also == Peripheral giant-cell granuloma ==References External links == Category:Pathology of the maxilla and mandible ","title":"Central giant-cell granuloma"},{"id":"7455789","text":"Govind Park is a multi-use stadium in Ba, Fiji.

He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1827, but pursued journalism and became the editor of the Greenville Mountaineer in 1832. The paper was adamantly against nullification and Perry was able to parlay his influence by being elected as a delegate to both the Union Convention and the Nullification Convention. Turner Bynum, who was editor of the pro-Calhoun Greenville Sentinel newspaper, met Perry in a duel. The duel was staged on an island in the Tugaloo River near Hatton's Ford on August 17, 1832. Perry fatally wounded Bynum who died that night. ==Political career== In 1836, Perry was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served for six years until 1842, he had lost to Warren R. Davis in 1834. He gained election to the South Carolina Senate in 1844, but returned to the House of Representatives in 1849 and remained a member until 1860. As the secession movement was sweeping the state in the years prior to the Civil War, Perry founded The Southern Patriot in 1851 to counter and spread a unionist message. Even though Perry was adamantly against secession, he embraced the state when it did secede and rallied the residents in the Upstate in favor of the Confederate cause. He was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1862 and served until being appointed as a Confederate States District Judge in 1864. On June 30, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson appointed Perry as the provisional Governor of South Carolina,Presidential Proclamation No. 46, 30 June 1865, , 770 because of the strong unionist views he had held prior to the war. Perry was directed by the president to enroll voters and to lead the state in the writing of a new state constitution. The delegates at the constitutional convention largely followed Perry's guidelines for the constitution, but they strayed by adopting the black codes to prevent black suffrage. President Johnson, as well as several leading statesmen of South Carolina, urged the granting of suffrage to blacks while also including a property qualification clause. A property qualification would essentially disenfranchise all blacks without giving the appearance of impropriety towards blacks and prevent the imposition of harsh terms by the Radical Republicans. Benjamin Franklin Perry said in 1865, \\"The African ... has been in all ages, a savage or a slave. God created him inferior to the white man in form, color, and intellect, and no legislation or culture can make him his equal... His hair, his form and features will not compete with the caucasian race, and it is in vain to think of elevating him to the dignity of the white man. God created differences between the two races, and nothing can make him equal\\". ==Later life== Sans Souci, former home of Gov. Perry. Upon the completion of the constitution, elections were called and Perry sought election to the U.S. Senate. He was elected along with John Lawrence Manning, but the Radical Republicans in charge of Congress refused to seat them. In 1872, he unsuccessfully ran for the 4th congressional district House seat against Republican Alexander S. Wallace. His son, William Hayne Perry, did successfully gain election to the House and was a member from 1885 to 1891. Perry died in Greenville on December 3, 1886 and was interred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery. ==References== *Old Stone Church ==External links== *SCIway Biography of Benjamin Franklin Perry *NGA Biography of Benjamin Franklin Perry Category:1805 births Category:1886 deaths Category:South Carolina lawyers Category:American newspaper founders Category:19th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Members of the South Carolina House of Representatives Category:South Carolina state senators Category:People of South Carolina in the American Civil War Category:Judges of the Confederate States Category:Politicians from Greenville, South Carolina Category:Governors of South Carolina Category:University of South Carolina trustees Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American journalists Category:American male journalists Category:19th-century American male writers Category:19th-century American politicians Category:American white supremacists ","title":"Benjamin Franklin Perry"},{"id":"7455858","text":"Traumatic bone cyst, also called a simple bone cyst, is a condition of the jaws.

As a set it is a singleton, and as a magma has a trivial structure, which is also an abelian group. The aforementioned abelian group structure is usually identified as addition, and the only element is called zero, so the object itself is typically denoted as }. One often refers to the trivial object (of a specified category) since every trivial object is isomorphic to any other (under a unique isomorphism). Instances of the zero object include, but are not limited to the following: * As a group, the zero group or trivial group. * As a ring, the zero ring or trivial ring. * As an algebra over a field or algebra over a ring, the trivial algebra. * As a module (over a ring ), the zero module. The term trivial module is also used, although it may be ambiguous, as a trivial G-module is a G-module with a trivial action. * As a vector space (over a field ), the zero vector space, zero-dimensional vector space or just zero space. These objects are described jointly not only based on the common singleton and trivial group structure, but also because of shared category-theoretical properties. In the last three cases the scalar multiplication by an element of the base ring (or field) is defined as: : , where . The most general of them, the zero module, is a finitely-generated module with an empty generating set. For structures requiring the multiplication structure inside the zero object, such as the trivial ring, there is only one possible, , because there are no non-zero elements. This structure is associative and commutative. A ring which has both an additive and multiplicative identity is trivial if and only if , since this equality implies that for all within , :r = r \\\\times 1 = r \\\\times 0 = 0 . In this case it is possible to define division by zero, since the single element is its own multiplicative inverse. Some properties of } depend on exact definition of the multiplicative identity; see ' below. Any trivial algebra is also a trivial ring. A trivial algebra over a field is simultaneously a zero vector space considered below. Over a commutative ring, a trivial algebra is simultaneously a zero module. The trivial ring is an example of a rng of square zero. A trivial algebra is an example of a zero algebra. The zero- dimensional is an especially ubiquitous example of a zero object, a vector space over a field with an empty basis. It therefore has dimension zero. It is also a trivial group over addition, and a trivial module mentioned above. == Properties == { table align=right valign=center width=\\"32em\\" style=\\"margin- left:2em\\" - align=center  bgcolor=#66FFFF align=right  2‚Üï  \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix}  style=\\"font-size:200%\\"  =  \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\end{bmatrix}  [ ]  bgcolor=#66FFFF align=left  ‚Äπ0 - bgcolor=#66FFFF align=center   ‚Üî 1   ^ 0  ‚Üî 1  -  colspan=6 style=\\"font-size:75%\\"  Element of the zero space, written as empty column vector (rightmost one), is multiplied by 2√ó0 empty matrix to obtain 2-dimensional zero vector (leftmost). Rules of matrix multiplication are respected. } The trivial ring, zero module and zero vector space are zero objects of the corresponding categories, namely Rng, -Mod and Vect. The zero object, by definition, must be a terminal object, which means that a morphism } must exist and be unique for an arbitrary object . This morphism maps any element of to . The zero object, also by definition, must be an initial object, which means that a morphism must exist and be unique for an arbitrary object . This morphism maps , the only element of }, to the zero element , called the zero vector in vector spaces. This map is a monomorphism, and hence its image is isomorphic to }. For modules and vector spaces, this subset is the only empty-generated submodule (or 0-dimensional linear subspace) in each module (or vector space) . === Unital structures === The } object is a terminal object of any algebraic structure where it exists, like it was described for examples above. But its existence and, if it exists, the property to be an initial object (and hence, a zero object in the category- theoretical sense) depend on exact definition of the multiplicative identity 1 in a specified structure. If the definition of requires that , then the } object cannot exist because it may contain only one element. In particular, the zero ring is not a field. If mathematicians sometimes talk about a field with one element, this abstract and somewhat mysterious mathematical object is not a field. In categories where the multiplicative identity must be preserved by morphisms, but can equal to zero, the } object can exist. But not as initial object because identity-preserving morphisms from } to any object where do not exist. For example, in the category of rings Ring the ring of integers Z is the initial object, not }. If an algebraic structure requires the multiplicative identity, but neither its preservation by morphisms nor , then zero morphisms exist and the situation is not different from non-unital structures considered in the previous section. == Notation == Zero vector spaces and zero modules are usually denoted by (instead of }).

The population of the community was 943 in 2011.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000477 The built- up area had a population of 627.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000275 == History  Early history === The placename Templeton may derive from ‚ÄúThe Templar's Farm‚Äù or (‚ÄúTun‚Äù). It is possible that the Knights Templar had some form of religious house here before their possessions were taken over by the Knights Hospitallers, which had a commandery at nearby Slebech, which, by 1282 passed to the Mortimers, Lords of Narberth. In 1282 Templeton was referred to as \\"Villa temparil\\" which means the ‚ÄúVil‚Äù or settlement of the Templars and \\"Villa Templarorium Campestris\\" ‚Äì the vil of the Templars in the fields. In 1283 there was also a reference to ‚ÄúBurgesses‚Äù. These burgesses were \\"de vento\\" - \\"of the wind\\" meaning they were not property owners within the settlement but were permitted to come in and out of trade on a regular basis. Burgesses at Templeton are again recorded in the 16th century. The Boars Head pub The layout of the present village is an example of deliberate planning in the Middle Ages, with a single main street fronted by houses with their respected plots extending behind each dwelling. These houses and plots, the \\"burgages\\" of the Middle Ages, form a coherent unit imposed on the landscape and set in a regular system of fields, which themselves still show the narrow strips representing recent enclosures from an extensive medieval \\"open field\\" agricultural field system. It is not certain that the Templars were responsible for creating the planned settlement. It is possible that this was done by Mortimer incorporating an earlier agricultural holding or farm established by the Templars. It was once a marcher borough. Owen, in 1603, described it as one of nine Pembrokeshire \\"boroughs in decay\\".Owen, George, The Description of Pembrokeshire, by George Owen of Henllys, Lord of Kemes, Henry Owen (Ed), London, 1892; reprinted (1994), Llandysul, Cardiganshire: Gomer Press, In the 17th century Narberth Mountain was stocked with Red Deer and covered of woodland. The Pembrokeshire county history records also show open fields in Molleston and Templeton being enclosed for pasture. The establishment of the Tavernspite Turnpike Trust in the 1770s led to a turnpike road toll gate being built at Catershook to the south of the village; its position on an important trading route from Tenby to Cardigan undoubtedly contributed to the growth of Templeton. In the late 18th century the countryside continued to change with woodland disappearing, more land being enclosed and farming dominating the landscape. The 1870 Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Templeton as \\"a chapelry, with a village, in Narberth parish, Pembroke; 5 miles SSW of Narberth-Road r. station. It was constituted in 1863: and it has a post-office under Narberth. Pop., 650. A property here belonged to the Knights Templars. The living is a p. curacy in the diocese of St. Davids. Value, ¬£182. Patron, the Crown. The church was built in 1862. There is a dissenting chapel.\\" === Sentence Castle === Sentence Castle is a raised fortification, a \\"ringwork\\", thought to date from the 12th century. This was probably the castle of arberth which was attacked and destroyed by Gruffydd ap Rhys in 1116, according to a chronicle in the Cotton library; the stone castle at Narberth was not built until over 100 years later.Record of RCAHMW : Legends as recorded in the 13th century Third Branch of the Mabinogi (concerning Manawydan fab Ll≈∑r) mention the area of Arberth and a place called Gorsedd Arberth, thought by some authorities to be Sentence Castle. The embanked earthworks are about 15M across and the site is a Scheduled monument. === Margaret's Well === Located adjacent to Sentence Castle is one of the 'Holy Wells of Wales', known as Margaret's Well. Set into a bank, the well chamber is lined with stone and has a corbelled roof. ===Templeton Railway Station=== Templeton Station On 4 September 1866 a railway line was completed to link south Pembrokeshire with the main rail line at Whitland. In Templeton a high limestone bridge was built to span Tanner's Lane and a small station was built in 1867. This was mainly used by the adjacent brickworks until World War I when a new platform was built. There were also extensive sidings that were used twice for overnight stops for the Royal Train. The station was closed on the 16 June 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts and has since been removed. ===Templeton Airfield=== Opened in 1943, RAF Templeton had three concrete runways and was originally a base for 306 Ferry Training Unit which used twin engined Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber aircraft. Templeton was also used by 595 Squadron target towing Spitfires, as well as Spitfires and Mosquito bombers of A Flight, No. 8 Operational Training Unit in 1945, when operations moved to RAF Benson and the airfield closed. The disused runways are now occasionally used for military exercises and low flying training with Hercules transport aircraft. Some sources (including the UK Ordnance Survey) place the 1081 Battle of Mynydd Carn within the boundary of the airfield. ===Templeton today=== Templeton's importance declined with the closures of the brickworks and the blacksmith but it remains active with a nineteenth-century pub, the Boars Head, a primary school, church and park. ==See also== * RAF Templeton == References  External links == * Photos of Templeton and surrounding area on geograph.org.uk Category:Villages in Pembrokeshire Category:Communities in Pembrokeshire ","title":"Templeton, Pembrokeshire"},{"id":"7455909","text":"Asher Keddie (born 31 July 1974) is an Australian actress. Beginning her career in the television series Five Mile Creek in the mid 1980s, Keddie received wide recognition for her role in the critically acclaimed series Offspring. Her significant repertoire in television has led to her being dubbed as the 'Golden Girl of Australian Television'. Keddie also had a small role in the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, as Dr. Carol Frost. Aside from television and film work, she has several theatre credits, including in the Melbourne Theatre Company production of Les Liaisons dangereuses as Madame de Tourvel. She won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress five times in a row between 2011 and 2015. Keddie won the 2013 Gold Logie award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, for her role as Dr Nina Proudman in the Network Ten drama Offspring.

It was the seat of the former canton of Aurignac (population 4,160), which was composed of 19 communes. It is part of the ancient region known as the Comminges. ==Geography== The town of Aurignac is located 60 km southwest of Toulouse and is, on average, 400m above sea level. It is in the region of rolling hills known as the Petites Pyr√©n√©es and is dominated by a ridge-shaped hill upon which the old town is built with the remains of a 13th-century castle at the top. ==History== Aurignac is best known for the 1860 discovery, by √âdouard Lartet, of prehistoric remains at the Cave of Aurignac, which led to the definition of the Aurignacian culture, an important phase in human prehistory. Evidence of early modern humans (often called Cro-Magnon man) has been found in Africa as far back as 160,000 years ago. When they came to Europe, about 45,000 years ago, their culture appears to have flourished with major advances in the use of tools and the development of figurative art. The Aurignacian culture has been called the first modern humans in Europe. The origins of the town are not defined, although the 1957 discovery of the remains of a Roman habitation, with a well-preserved bath- house, from the present-day town suggests that the area was inhabited during the Gallo-Roman period. In 777 a Benedictine priory was founded in Aurignac as a dependency of the Abbey of Saint Tiberi in the diocese of Agde. The first known official record is from 1109, regarding Roger d'Aurignac, the Seigneur of the town. In 1234, Bernard V, Count of Comminges, received the territory from his mother. By 1240, he had built a castle (the Ch√¢teau d'Aurignac) on the hill, around which the village grew. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Aurignac was one of the more important towns of the Comminges, with over 40 communes in its dependence, and an important centre of commerce, based on the production of pottery and leather and holding frequent markets and fairs. During the French wars of religion (1562‚Äì1598) the Comminges remained Catholic and Aurignac became an important military centre. Its population was recorded as 2,500 in 1699. Henry IV ordered the destruction of the castle in the early 17th century and, although it was still partly inhabited in 1627, it fell into disuse not long afterwards. ==PopulationThe old town== The old part of the town is centred on the remains of the castle dating from the 13th century, including the church, a well-restored keep (donjon), towers, gateways and the parts of the ramparts, some of which have been incorporated into houses. Extending down the hill is the 14th/15th century area, also originally walled. ==Church== The church of St-Pierre aux Liens dates from the 13th century, although there is a papal bull record of a church in Aurignac in 1120. The body of the church is original, but the building has been restored several times during its history. The main restoration in 1791 added the ornate entrance from the 16th-century chapel of St Michel, which was demolished during the revolution. The church contains a chapel of the Penitents Bleus, a civil religious organisation that played a major role in the community from the 17th to 19th centuries. ==Museum== The Aurignac cave, type site of the Aurignacian period. In 1968, a museum of prehistory was established in the town to house a collection of Aurignacian artifacts from the local site and others in France and abroad. The poor standard of accommodation for the museum resulted in its closure in 2006. However, in 2014 a larger museum was opened in a purpose-designed building containing a larger display of artifacts and information. ==Commerce and leisure== The commune has, for its size, a large number of shops and local businesses, including a quarry, agricultural and small-scale commercial enterprises. Aurignac has a gendarmerie, La Poste and two schools: primary and secondary, which serve the canton and some other surrounding communes. The town has a hotel, cafe, a brasserie, a gym, and a gastronomic restaurant. The leisure centre has an outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts and a football field. There are a number of festivals during the year, most notably the three-day summer festival in August which includes a fairground, communal outdoor dining and a number of live bands and performers in the main square. Aurignac is on the GR86, one of the less well-known Grande Randonn√©e, running from Toulouse to Bagn√®res-de-Luchon. ==See also== * Communes of the Haute-Garonne department * Cave of Aurignac ==References== * INSEE * Office de Tourisme d'Aurignac * Terres d'Aurignac, L'Histoire au Coeur de la Nature https://web.archive.org/web/20120211100049/http://www.cc-canton- aurignac.fr/bienvenue * http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/mairie-aurignac.html * Aurignac la medievale, Association de Sauvegarde de Vieil Aurignac, 2009 * Concise_Britannica:_Aurignacian Encyclop√¶dia Britannica * Aurignacian, The First Modern Humans http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery- pages/2002marchaurignacianpage1.htm * History of the Keep - Notice erected by the Mairie of Aurignac * Aurignac, Histoire et Monuments, A.

He married Sheila on 1 March 1959.Long Weekend (Neil Gaiman, blog, 15 March 2009) He eventually decided to go into business for himself, much to his father's displeasure, and the family moved away from their home in Portchester in 1962. When the Gaimans discovered Scientology they moved to East Grinstead, West Sussex in 1965. David Gaiman joined the staff of the Church of Scientology at nearby Saint Hill Manor, eventually becoming the Church's chief UK media spokesman. == Guardian's Office == He joined the Guardian's Office (GO), the Church's public relations bureau / intelligence agency. In 1969, Gaiman was involved in an attempt by the Church to take over the National Association for Mental Health (now Mind), a British mental health charity. Some 300 Scientologists joined the group and nominated Gaiman, among others, for high office. Gaiman was nominated for the Chairmanship. Eventually, the Scientologists were asked to resign but contested that request in court. Scientologists also held demonstrations for, according to Gaiman, \\"humane treatment and a bill of rights for mental patients and the protection of their bodies and their well-being. We want an independent inquiry into conditions in mental hospitals. We want no more whitewashing from certain mental health organisations like the one across the road. Our stand is not on being asked to resign but for humane psychiatry.\\"C.H.

According to documents in the US vs Kember and Budlong case, Gaiman issued an order in 1975 for an operation to put false information in US security agency computers using planted agents. It was known as 'Operation Cat'. Kember also credited Gaiman with the strategy to claim that CoS plants inside the American Medical Association were reporters for Freedom magazine.US vs Kember and Budlong was part of the fallout of the 1978 United States v. Hubbard case, which charged many CoS members with conspiracy and other crimes related to Operation Snow White.

In 1987 G&G; moved to larger premises and began to manufacture its own label vitamins for the first time. With David‚Äôs leadership the demand for G&G;‚Äôs own-brand label and manufacturing expertise grew dramatically and in 1997 they moved to a 31,000 square foot factory and built a customised clean-room for optimum high speed production lines. It was from here that G&G; expanded its contract manufacturing arm, building up to the current capacity to manufacture 14,000,000 capsules per month for numerous companies across the UK and Europe under their own label. Today G&G; is still a family-owned business under the leadership of Mauro Calcioli, David‚Äôs son- in-law. Mauro, who was appointed as Chairman in April 2009, is assisted by his wife Lizzy Calcioli and Sheila Gaiman. Sheila stands today as one of the longest serving members of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. In April 2009 they appointed Myles McEntyre as Managing Director to run G&G; on a day-to-day basis. The Gaimans were prominent figures in the local community and well known for their sponsorship of the local arts scene. Gaiman was also a trustee of Greenfield's School from its formation in the 1980s.

It is seen as an opportunity to diversify the European Union's gas supplies. ==History== The idea of the trans-Saharan pipeline was first proposed in the 1970s. On 14 January 2002, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Algerian national oil and gas company Sonatrach signed the Memorandum of Understanding for preparations of the project. In June 2005, NNPC and Sonatrach signed a contract with Penspen Limited for a feasibility study of the project. The feasibility study was completed in September 2006, and it found the pipeline to be technically and economically feasible and reliable. On the meeting on 20 February 2009, NNPC and Sonatrach agreed to proceed with the draft Memorandum of Understanding between three governments and the joint venture agreement. The intergovernmental agreement on the pipeline was signed by energy ministers of Nigeria, Niger and Algeria on 3 July 2009 in Abuja. Safety concerns about the operations have been heightened due to the In Am√©nas hostage crisis of 2013. Nigeria, Niger and Algeria are among the least secure areas in the region because of various active terrorist movements that destabilise them. ==Route== The pipeline will start in the Warri region in Nigeria and run north through Niger to Hassi R'Mel in Algeria. In Hassi R'Mel the pipeline will connect to the existing Trans-Mediterranean, Maghreb‚ÄìEurope, Medgaz and Galsi pipelines. These supply Europe from the gas transmission hubs at El Kala and Beni Saf on Algeria's Mediterranean coast. The length of the pipeline would be : in Nigeria, in Niger, and in Algeria. ==Technical features== The annual capacity of the pipeline would be up to 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. It would have a diameter of . The pipeline was originally expected to be operational by 2015. The original investment for the pipeline was expected to be around US$10 billion and for gas gathering centers around $3 billion. In the year 2019 the project is still in the prospect phase https://www.nnpcgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Pages/Nigeria-Gas.aspx ==Operator== The pipeline is to be built and operated by the partnership between the NNPC and Sonatrach. The company would include also the Republic of Niger. Initially NNPC and Sonatrach would hold a total 90% of shares, while Niger would hold 10%. Russian gas company Gazprom has negotiated with Nigeria about its possible participation in the project. Also Indian company GAIL, France's Total S.A., Italy's Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell have expressed interest in participating in the project. According to the Algerian energy minister Chakib Khelil \\"only partners that can bring something to the project, not just money, should be there.\\" Energy ministers of Algeria and Nigeria have said that \\"if things go well, there will be no need to bring international oil companies into the project\\" and \\"if the need for partnership in the project arises, not every partner will be welcome on board on the project.\\" ==Opposition to the pipeline== The pipeline is opposed by the Nigerian militant group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.

Jemima had only known of Philip some fourteen days before their marriage: Pepys did ask her if she could like Philip as a husband, and was relieved when she answered that she thought she could like him very well. It was noted that Jemima failed to arrive in time for the ceremony at the church, but the marriage is thought to have been reasonably happy. Jemima died in childbirth in 1671. Philip was father of four children, including George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret. Knighted in 1667, he became Gentleman of the King's Chamber in 1670.

It is found on all the main Hawaiian islands except Kahoolawe and Niihau. OlonƒÅ has alternate leaves whose shape greatly varies depending upon the environment from thin lancolate to broad elliptic. The large range in leaf variation once divided T. latifolia into more than 10 species, which are currently considered to be one. OlonƒÅ typically flowers between the months of May through December Link text, Herbarium Vouchers. The female flowers are borne on branching cymes which become fleshy orange berry- like achenes, and the male flowers are white. OlonƒÅ is easily cultivated (83% germination rate), and sprouts readily from cuttings, but does not transplant well due to its fragile roots. ==Cultural use== right Ancient Hawaiians cultivated olonƒÅ for cordage, and it was considered one of the finest grades of fibers. Its intertwining strands makes it one of the strongest natural fibers on earth. OlonƒÅ was used extensively in Hawaiian weaponry: as cordage on the wrist loop of pƒÅhoa (daggers); for fastening shark teeth on the heads of leiomano; and as the cord in \\"tripping weapons\\", such as the pƒ´koi. OlonƒÅ was also used for fishing nets and carrying baskets called k≈çk≈ç. The fine cordage was once sought by many people around the world, like climbers and sailors, because of its incomparable strength and durability. OlonƒÅ was typically cultivated near an upland stream area which was used to soak the newly harvested fibers between 24‚Äì72 hours before placing it on long board and using a scraper (sometimes made out of shell or turtle) to remove the excess outer bark. Once the olonƒÅ was prepared and dry, there was so much fiber in the bark that it peels off in sheets of ribbon.

The line was known as La Ficelle (The String) and used water balance as the means of raising and lowering the cars. In 1958 the funicular was rebuilt into a rack and pinion railway using the Strub system and intermediate stations at Jordils and Montriond were opened. The line became known by the name m√©tro, although to the natives and its many regular users it was always La Ficelle. Until 1954 there was no direct connection between the freight station of S√©beillon and the Flon valley and this line was used by freight trains from the main station to the storage area of the harbour (in Flon). The line was sold by the operating company to the town of Lausanne in 1984 and on 22 January 2006 it was closed to be rebuilt as part of the new Line M2 of the Lausanne Metro. The rolling stock was sold to the French city of Villard-de-Lans with the intention of it being used on their new rack railway, La Patache. The Lausanne Metro's M2 line opened in October 2008. === Timeline === * 1877, creation of the funicular Ouchy - CFF Station - Flon * 1879, creation of the funicular CFF Station - Flon, parallel to the initial one * Traction cables driven by water turbines in the top station * 1954-1958, transformation of the line to the rack mode * 1984, sold to the city of Lausanne * 21 January 2006, end of the operations to allow the conversion into Metro M2 and extension to Epalinges * 19 September 2008, inauguration of the M2 line == Network == The M√©tro-Ouchy railway was made up of two parallel lines: * Ouchy - Jordils - Montriond - CFF Station - Flon (M√©tro-Ouchy) * CFF Station - Flon (M√©tro-Gare) === Line characteristics === * Ouchy - Flon ** length 1568 yards (1482m) ** altitude differential 106 m ** slope 11,6% ** train every 8 minutes * CFF Station - Flon ** length 318 m ** altitude differential 37 m ** slope 12% ** continuous circulation without timetable === Technical details === The system consists of two lines, both single-track. The first line ran from Ouchy, through Jordils, Montriond and the SBB-CFF-FFS railway station (Gare CFF) to Flon. This is known as ‚ÄúMetro ‚Äì Ouchy‚Äù. A second line paralleled the M√©tro-Ouchy from Gare CFF to Flon stations, using its own separate to one side of a double-track tunnel. This service was known as ‚ÄúMetro ‚Äì Gare‚Äù. The line between Ouchy and Flon is 1482 m. in length, and rises 106 m. at a maximum gradient of 11.6% ( 1 in 8.66 ). This journey is completed in 8 minutes. The system is single track with a passing track at Montriond station to allow trains to meet (See photograph). The second line from the Gare CFF to Flon is just 318 m. in length, rises 37 m. at a maximum gradient of 12% (1 in 8.33 ). The trains were two 2-car units and offered a fast service, with trains every 6 to 10 minutes. The line is now referred to as M√©tro-Ouchy or M2. Ouchy station was the southern terminal of the Ouchy line. It contained 3 tracks with one platform to the east side of the easternmost track. The 2 additional tracks were used as a stabling point for trains. A switchback allowed trains to enter the maintenance facility, located in a building to the north and sightly to the west of the station. The station itself was level, as it was just before the start of the stiff 11% grade that took the mainline into the city. Jordils station was a relatively simple affair. It consisted of a single track and a single platform to the east of the mainline. Fare control was located inside a building to the east of the platform dating back to the days of the Ouchy funicular. Montriond station was at the halfway point of the line and contained 2 tracks and 2 platforms. The platforms and tracks were positioned rather unconventionally. Northbound (uphill) trains stopped at a proper platform, but the northbound track at the station was built into the surface of the platform to the south of the northbound platform which southbound trains stopped at. The rolling stock only had doors on the east side so this arrangement was necessary to accommodate both the passing track and the station. Such an arrangement also required the northbound train to arrive at the station before its southbound counterpart as it would block the southbound platform. On late evenings and weekends when only 1 train was service it used the northbound platform for both directions of travel. The line entered the tunnel under Lausanne just to the north of the station. Gare CFF was the first underground station on the line. The station had 2 tracks and 2 platforms. The platform on the east side was for Lausanne- Ouchy trains and was located on the steep grade of that line. The platform on the west side of the station was used trains running the M√©tro-Gare service. The cars for this line only had doors on the west side and thus could not be used on the Lausanne-Ouchy. The Lausanne-Gare platform and track were not located on the steep grade of the Ouchy line, creating a level shelf next to the Ouchy track and what was essentially a 2-level station. Both tracks ascended the grade inside the 1877-built tunnel to Flon. The two lines were connected via a single crossover roughly at the halfway point of the tunnel. ;Flon Station Flon was the Northern terminal for both M√©tro Ouchy and M√©tro Gare trains. The underground station contained 2 tracks with 2 platforms to either side of the tracks. This station facilitated transfer to the Tramway Sud-Ouest de Lausanne (which later became the M1 line of the Lausanne Metro). ==Rolling stock and equipment== The trains for the Lausanne-Ouchy line consisted of 2 unpowered passenger cars and a locomotive in push-pull configuration. There were 3 rack locomotives numbered 121-123, designated He 2/2, rated at 622 hp, 6.25 m in length and weighing 18.1 tons, with a top speed of 32 km/h. They were built by Swiss Lokomotivfabirk Winterthur using electrical components from Maschienefabrik Oerlikon in 1958. There were five unpowered passenger cars numbered 1-5, model Bt. All cars had driving controls. 3 of the cars contained segregated operator's cabs used when the locomotives were in push mode, at the rear of the train. The passenger cars, like the locomotives, were built in 1958. None of the passenger cars were equipped with pinions. The Lausanne-Gare line was always operated by a single electric railcar built to the same specifications as the locomotives but with a length of 11.9 m and a weight of 18.5 tons. The two original cars were built in 1958 and numbered 101-102. In 1975 these cars were replaced by 2 newer cars built by SIG-Oerlikon numbered 111-112, built, again, to the same specifications as the locomotives. Both locomotives and railcars collected power from overhead wires with a scheren (rhombus-shaped) pantograph. Trains on the Ouchy line were made up of 2 passenger cars and a locomotive. The locomotives were on always the south (downhill) end of the train to prevent runaway trains. There were 2 trains on the line requiring 2 locomotives and 4 passenger cars, with 1 locomotive and passenger car held as spares. The Flon- Gare line was operated by one railcar with the other held at the yard as a spare. In addition, there were 2 flat cars and a line car used to maintain the overhead wires. The locomotives were used to propel these cars. ==New life for M√©tro Ouchy== In January 2006, the line was shut down to be rebuilt into the new, fully automated, rubber-tired M2. Since the line was being rebuilt, the rack equipment was no longer needed. The trains were still in excellent condition and were sold to the French town of Villiard-de-Lans for use on their new (planned) rack railway, 'La Patache'. The trains were moved to a storage location to be overhauled for the French railway, including asbestos removal. \\"La Patache\\" was ultimately cancelled, and a new use had to be found for the trains. An idea that the locomotives and passenger cars could be used as snack booths in downtown Lausanne surfaced but even this fell through. The Swiss Transport Museum at Lucerne refused to preserve the trains. A final preservation effort by a group called \\"Save La Ficelle!\\" attempted to raise 600,000 Swiss francs, the amount needed to purchase the trains from Villiard- de-Lans. They fell several thousand francs short of the required amount. The equipment was sold to a Swiss scrap dealer and was cut up in early 2010. ==New line== The new M2 line of the Lausanne Metro opened in 2008, incorporating the original M√©tro Ouchy route, along with 8 entirely new stations on a new northern extension. The new line uses 15 two-car MP89CA trains, similar to those on Line 14 of the Paris M√©tro. The urban tunnel sections were built using \\"cut and cover\\" construction techniques, the disruption causing much anger amongst residents and commercial premises owners along its length, with much dispute and comment over the chosen route. The construction and trackwork was completed in February 2007. ==M√©tro Ouchy today== Nothing remains of the original M√©tro-Ouchy today. The new M2 uses part of the open cut near Montriond station formerly used by the Ouchy line. Montriond station no longer exists, it was replaced with two new stations, D√©lices and Grancy. M2 runs above-ground between these stations. The rest of the cutting has been decked over and developed into a park, with the yard at Ouchy being redeveloped. The new line has a short single-track section between Gare CFF and Grancy where it runs through the 1877-built tunnel used by the M√©tro-Ouchy, before transitioning to a newly built tunnel north of Flon. ==See also== * Lausanne Metro ==References== * LO Category:Railway lines in Switzerland Category:Transport in Lausanne Category:Railway lines opened in 1877 Category:Railway lines closed in 2006 Category:Railway lines opened in 2008 ","title":"M√©tro Lausanne‚ÄìOuchy"},{"id":"7456111","text":"\\"Made Niggaz\\" is the last single for which Tupac Shakur made an official video before he died.

Vedi is the term for \\"sacrificial altar\\" in the Vedic religion. Such altars were an elevated outdoor enclosure, generally strewed with Kusha grass, and having receptacles for the sacrificial fire; it was of various shapes, but usually narrow in the middle. They were used in various types of Yajna rituals, of which the lengthiest was the agnicayana, lasting twelve days. In Vedic times, offerings, often including animals, were burnt in the fire, and fully consumed by it. This contrasts with modern Hindu offerings to gods, which are all vegetable, and are preserved to be consumed by the devotees (which was also the case in other religions, such as ancient Greek religion). Fire altars remain part of the rituals in some Hindu festivals and rites of passage; in particular circling around a sacred fire (saptapadi) remains an essential part of Hindu weddings. Although Agni, the Vedic god of fire, has an important place in the mandala setting out the plan in Hindu temple architecture, in the south-east part of the temple, fire altars are not now a normal part of regular Hindu temple rituals. Modern fire sacrifices are covered at Homa rituals. ==Types== homa ritual gets under way in Gujarat As deduced from descriptions in ancient texts, the types of vedi were: *mahavedi, the great or entire altar *uttaravedi, the northern altar made for the sacred fire (agnyayatana) *dhishnya, a sort of subordinate or side-altar, generally a heap of earth covered with sand on which the fire is placed *drona, an altar shaped like a trough (Shulbas. 3.216) *adhvaradhishnya, a second altar at the Soma sacrifice The uttaravedi was in the shape of a falcon (alajacita = \\"piled up in the shape of the bird Alaja\\"), and was piled up with bricks in the Agnicayana ritual. Vedic altars are described in the circum-Vedic texts dealing with Kalpa (the proper performance of sacrifice), notably the Satapatha Brahmana, and the Sulbasutras say that the Rigveda corresponds to an altar of mantras.BSS 7, ASS 14. Fire altars are already mentioned in the Rigveda. According to Taittiriya Samhita 5.2.3., they are made of twenty-one bricks. In ≈öBM 10.4.3.14-20, the altar is made of 396 (360 + 36) yajusmati (special) bricks, and of 10,800 lokamprna (ordinary) bricks. 10,701 lokamprna bricks belong to the ahavaniya altar, 78 to the dhisnya hearths and 21 to the garhapatya. Around the altar are 360 parisrita stones (261 around ahavaniya, 78 around dhisnya, 21 around garhapatya). ≈öBM 10.3.1. describes that the altar is symbolically built with gayatri (24 syllables), usnih (breath, 28 syllables), pankti (mind, 40 syllables), tristubh (ear, 44 syllables), jagati (awakening) (48 syllables) and generative breath. The gayatri altar's height is to the knees, the tristubh's to the navel and the jagati's to a man's height. == Agnicayana == { class= - Layer Number of yajusmati bricks in SB - 5 138 - 4 47 - 3 71 - 2 41 - 1 98 - } In the Agnicayana ritual, the mahavedi (great altar) has a length of 24 prakrama in the east, 30 in the west and 36 in the north and south.With 24+30+36=90. Inside the mahavedi, an altar is placed. In the smaller ritual space to the west of the mahavedi (pracinavamsa, pragvamsa), three altars are placed: the garhapatya (earth, W), ahavaniya (sky, E) and daksinagni (or anvaharyapacana, SW). The round garhapatya and the square ahavaniya have the same area.(one square vyama/purusa) SB 7. TS 5.

He served as Bishop of Erie from 1868 to 1899. ==Biography== Tobias Mullen was born in Urney, County Tyrone, the youngest of the six sons of James and Mary (n√©e Travers) Mullen. He was educated at Castlefin school and at Maynooth College, where he studied theology and received minor orders. In 1843, he accepted an invitation from Bishop Michael O'Connor to join the Diocese of Pittsburgh in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. After completing his theological studies, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop O'Connor on September 1, 1844. He served for about two years as curate at the Cathedral of Pittsburgh, and was afterwards charged with the care of congregations at Johnstown and in Jefferson County. He was transferred to the rectorship of St. Peter's Church at Allegheny in 1854, and served as vicar general of the Diocese of Pittsburgh from 1864 to 1868. On March 3, 1868, Mullen was appointed the third Bishop of Erie by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 2 from Bishop Michael Domenec, with Bishops James Frederick Wood and Louis Amadeus Rappe serving as co- consecrators. During his 31-year-long administration many priests were ordained, parishes established, churches and schools built, and conferences for the clergy held. He also founded the weekly Lake Shore Visitor, an orphanage, and two hospitals. His greatest accomplishment was the erection of St. Peter's Cathedral. Originally dubbed as \\"Mullen's Folly,\\" its cornerstone was laid in 1875 and it was later dedicated in 1893. Mullen suffered a paralytic stroke on May 20, 1897. He received John Edmund Fitzmaurice as his coadjutor bishop the following year.

There is a suspension bridge connecting the island to Hampton. The entire island is listed within the River Thames site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation, with the western end of the island being listed as part of the Metropolitan Green Belt. It is the westernmost island on the River Thames in Greater London. ==History== The name of the island is derived from Platt of Molesey who used it for growing withers.http://www.richmond.gov.uk/conarea58_a3_rgb.pdf Boatbuilding began on the island in 1868, when Thomas Tagg, who had been running a business since 1841 on Tagg's Island, about downstream, expanded by building a boatyard and house on the eastern end of Platt's Eyot. A waterworks and electrical works with a charging station were also constructed on the island; the latter was used to power electrically powered pleasure launches and canoes that were built on the island. Around 1904 John Isaac Thornycroft set up the Hampton Launch Works on the island, an offshoot of the Chiswick boatyard that he had established in the 1860s. This boatbuilding works concentrated on cabin cruisers and speedboats, but the success of Thorneycroft's operations on Platt's Eyot led to the award of contracts from the Admiralty. A new and larger facility was built in Southampton, which became Thorneycroft's principal yard, but the Platt's Eyot yard continued to operate in both World Wars to build small naval craft. In 1916 the Admiralty commissioned a new type of fast torpedo-carrying motor launch which Thorneycroft constructed secretly in its Platt's Eyot facility. Four new boat sheds were constructed on the island, probably in the same year (though the date is disputed by some), to a design by Augustine Alban Hamilton Scott. They were built using the Belfast truss system, developed during the First World War to roof wide structures such as aircraft hangars. Very few boat sheds were constructed using the technique, and these examples are now Listed and inspected by Historic England. During the Second World War, the boatyard was used to construct motor torpedo boats, motor launches and landing craft. Thornycrofts closed its boatbuilding operation on Platt's Eyot when it was taken over by Vospers in the mid-1960s. In 1960 the island was bought by Port Hampton Ltd., which diversified the use of industrial space. In 1941 the island was connected to the Hampton, Middlesex bank of the River Thames, by a suspension bridge assembled by the Corps Of Royal Engineers. The island was transferred from Esher Urban District in Surrey to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in Greater London on 1 April 1970,The Greater London and Surrey Order, 1970 using a provision of the London Government Act 1963.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/45021/pages/666 ==See also== *Islands in the River Thames ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Thames from Hampton Court to Sunbury Lock Category:Islands of the River Thames Category:Geography of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames ","title":"Platt's Eyot"},{"id":"7456196","text":"Albert Lovejoy Gutterson (August 23, 1887 ‚Äì April 7, 1965) was an American athlete who won a gold medal in the long jump at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

It may develop rapidly from a periapical granuloma, as a consequence of untreated chronic periapical periodontitis. Periapical is defined as \\"the tissues surrounding the apex of the root of a tooth\\" and a cyst is \\"a pathological cavity lined by epithelium, having fluid or gaseous content that is not created by the accumulation of pus.\\" Most frequently located in the maxillary anterior region, the cyst is caused by pulpal necrosis secondary to dental caries or trauma. Its lining is derived from the epithelial cell rests of Malassez which proliferate to form the cyst. Such cysts are very common. Although initially asymptomatic, they are clinically significant because secondary infection can cause pain and damage. In radiographs, the cyst appears as a radiolucency (dark area) around the apex of a tooth's root. == Signs and symptoms == Visual image of the face of the person shown on the CT scan above. Swelling can be observed in the right cheek. Periapical cysts begin as asymptomatic and progress slowly. Subsequent infection of the cyst causes swelling and pain. Initially, the cyst swells to a round hard protrusion, but later on the body resorbs some of the cyst wall, leaving a softer accumulation of fluid underneath the mucous membrane. Secondary symptoms of periapical cysts include inflammation and infection of the pulp causing dental caries. This infection is what causes necrosis of the pulp. Larger cysts may cause bone expansion or displace roots. Discoloration of the affected tooth may also occur. Patient will present negative results to electric and ice test of the affected tooth but will be sensitive to percussion. Surrounding gingival tissue may experience lymphadenopathy. The alveolar plate may exhibit crepitus when palpated. === Complications === Expansion of the cyst causes erosion of the floor of the maxillary sinus. As soon as it enters the maxillary antrum, the expansion rate increases due to available space for expansion. Performing a percussion test by tapping the affected teeth will cause shooting pain. This is often clinically diagnostic of pulpal infection. ==Causes== Dental cysts are usually caused due to root infection involving tooth decay. Untreated dental caries then allow bacteria to reach the level of the pulp, causing infection. The bacteria gains access to the periapical region of the tooth through deeper infection of the pulp, traveling through the roots. The resulting pulpal necrosis causes proliferation of epithelial rests of Malassez which release toxins at the apex of the tooth. The body's inflammatory response will attack the source of the toxins, leading to periapical inflammation. The many cells and proteins that rush to an area of infection create osmotic tension in the periapex which is the source of internal pressure increase at the cyst site. These lesions can grow large because they apply pressure over the bone, causing resorption. The toxins released by the breakdown of granulation tissue are one of the common causes of bone resorption. There are two schools of thought regarding cyst expansion. # Complementary response to inflammation # Chemical reaction with Interleukin and Prostaglandin == Mechanisms == Periapical cysts develop due to an inflammatory stimulus in 3 stages: # Initial stage: Epithelial cells from the rests of Malassez at the apex of the roots of a non-vital tooth (one where the nerve and blood supply in the tooth have degenerated and no longer exist) become stimulated due to the body's inflammatory response to bacterial endotoxins infecting the pulp or as a direct response to necrotic pulp tissue, therefore re-entering the growth phase. Bacterial byproducts then are able to seep into the periapical region through the infected pulp. # Cyst development stage: Epithelial cells form strands and are attracted to the area which contains exposed connective tissue and foreign substances. Several strands from each rest converge and surround the abscess or foreign body. # Cyst growth stage: Fluid flows into the cavity where the forming cyst is growing due to the increased osmolality of the cavity in relation to surrounding serum in capillaries. Pressure and size increase. The definitive mechanism by which cysts grow is under debate; several theories exist. === Biomechanical theory === Pressure and concentration differences between the cystic cavity and the growth surroundings influence fluid movement into the cyst, causing size increase. === Biochemical theories === a. Collagenase (breakdown of collagen) in the jaw bone leads to bone degeneration, providing room for cysts to develop. Substances released by the body's immune system as a result of the connective tissue breakdown, such as cytokines and growth factors, contribute to the mobilization and proliferation of epithelial cells in the area. b. Bone resorption caused by metabolism of acidic substances produced by cysts contributes to cyst growth. Such substances include Prostaglandin-2 and Interleukin-1 which are both produced by the cyst itself. === Nutritional deficiency theory === Epithelial cells will form a mass inside the cavity and the innermost cells become deprived of nutrients because they are far from the source of nutrients (the blood vessels). The innermost cells die and form an aggregate of dead tissue. The inner cells undergo ischemic liquefactive necrosis which creates the cavity space surrounded by growing epithelial cells. This theory is unlikely in the absence of malignant transformation of epithelial cells as it does not follow the existing relationship between connective tissue and epithelium. === Abscess theory === Epithelial cells have an inherent quality to reproduce and cover any connective tissue that is not already lined with epithelia. Formation of an abscess must precede the epithelial proliferation in order for the cells to carry out this tendency. This theory explains why cysts are lined in epithelia but not why the initial cysts itself forms. == Diagnosis == A non-vital tooth is necessary for the diagnosis of a periapical cyst, meaning the nerve has been removed by root canal therapy. ===Oral examination=== The surrounding intraoral anatomical structures should be palpated to identify the presence of bone expansion or displacement of tooth roots as well as crepitus noises during examination, indicating extensive bone damage. Bulging of the buccal or lingual cortical plates may be present. Age of occurrence in the patient, the location of the cyst, the edges of cystic contours, and the impact that the cyst has on adjacent structures must all be considered for proper diagnosis. ===Radiology=== Several lesions can appear similarly in radiographic appearance. Intraoral X-rays or a 3-D cone beam scan of the affected area can be used to obtain radiological images and confirm diagnosis of cysts in the periapical area. Circular or ovoid radiolucency surrounding the root tip of approximately 1-1.5 cm in diameter is indicative of the presence of a periapical cyst. The border of the cyst is seen as a narrow opaque margin contiguous with the lamina dura. In cysts that are actively enlarging, peripheral areas of the margin may not be present. Periapical cysts have a characteristic unilocular shape on radiographs. There is also a severe border of cortication between the cyst and surrounding bone. Pseudocysts, on the other hand, have a fluid filled cavity but are not lined by epithelium, therefore they have a less severe and more blurred border between the fluid and bony surroundings. ===Histopathology=== Histopathology of a periapical cyst, with metaplastic changes of mucous secreting cells (B), and ciliated cells (C). Cholesterol clefts of a periapical cyst of the jaw. In light microscopy, periapical cysts show: Topic Completed: 1 March 2014.

Resolution of this type of cyst requires surgical treatment such as a cystectomy. # Periapical pocket cysts - epithelium lined cavities that have an opening to the root canal of the affected tooth. Resolution may occur after traditional root canal therapy. === Differentiation === Radiographically, it is virtually impossible to differentiate granuloma from a cyst. If the lesion is large it is more likely to be a cyst. Radiographically, both granulomas and cysts appear radiolucent. Many lesions of the mandible in particular appear cystlike in appearance. It is often necessary to obtain a biopsy and evaluate the tissue under a microscope to accurately identify the lesion. ==Treatment== The infected tissue of the periapical cyst must be entirely removed, including the epithelium of the cyst wall; otherwise, a relapse is likely to occur. Root canal treatment should be performed on the tooth if it is determined that previous therapy was unsuccessful. Removal of the necrotic pulp and the inflamed tissue as well as proper sealing of the canals and an appropriately fitting crown will allow the tooth to heal under uninfected conditions. Surgical options for previously treated teeth that would not benefit from root canal therapy include cystectomy and cystostomy. This route of treatment is recommended upon discovery of the cyst after inadequate root canal treatment. A cystectomy is the removal of a cyst followed by mucosa and wound closure to reduce chances of cyst regeneration. This type of treatment is more ideal for small cysts. A cystostomy is recommended for larger cysts that compromise important adjacent anatomy. The cyst is tamponaded to allow for the cyst contents to escape the bone. Over time, the cyst decreases in size and bone regenerates in the cavity space. Marsupialization could also be performed, which involves suturing the edges of the gingiva surrounding the cyst to remain open. The cyst then drains its contents and heal without being prematurely closed. The end result is the same as the cystostomy, bone regeneration. For both a cystostomy and marsupialization, root resectioning may also be required in cases where root resorption has occurred. == Epidemiology == Relative incidence of odontogenic cysts. Periapical cysts are labeled at left. Periapical cysts comprise approximately 75% of the types of cysts found in the oral region. The ratio of individuals diagnosed with periapical cysts is 3:2 male to female, as well as individuals between 20 and 60 years old. Periapical cysts occur worldwide.

It most often affects the posterior mandible and most commonly presents in the third decade of life. Odontogenic keratocysts make up around 19% of jaw cysts. In the WHO/IARC classification of head and neck pathology, this clinical entity had been known for years as the odontogenic keratocyst; it was reclassified as keratocystic odontogenic tumour (KCOT) from 2005 to 2017. In 2017 it reverted to the earlier name, as the new WHO/IARC classification reclassified OKC back into the cystic category. The WHO/IARC classification no longer considers it a neoplasm, because the evidence supporting that hypothesis (for example, clonality) is considered insufficient. However, this is an area of hot debate within the head and neck pathology community, and some pathologists still regard OKC as a neoplasm despite the reclassification. ==Signs and symptoms== Peak incidence during second and third decades of life. At least 50% of odontogenic keratocysts are found in posterior part and lower ramus of the mandible. Swelling is the most common presenting complaint; however, OKCs may be asymptomatic and found incidentally on dental radiographs. Rarely symptoms can arise due to infection or expansion of the bone. Relative incidence of odontogenic cysts. Odontogenic keratocyst is labeled at bottom right. ==Pathogenesis== Odontogenic keratocysts originate from the odontogenic epithelium (dental lamina) in the alveolus left from tooth development stages. They are mainly thought to arise from rests of Serres. ===Genetics=== Sporadic (non-syndromic) and syndromic OKCs are associated with mutations in the gene PTCH found on chromosome 9q, which is part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.PATCHED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PTCH1. OMIM. URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=601309. Accessed on: December 25, 2008. PTCH is a tumour suppressor gene. Loss of PTCH activity leads to a brake in the cell cycle. A third of OKCs show mutations in PTCH, resulting in the cyst epithelium undergoing highly proliferative activity. This leads to growth of the cyst wall and when removed favours recurrence if following incomplete removal of the epithelium. ==Nevoid basal- cell carcinoma syndrome== Multiple odontogenic keratocysts are a feature, and major diagnostic criteria, of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, also known as Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome). Almost all individuals with NBCCS have odontogenic keratocysts which require numerous treatments. Consideration of the syndrome needs to be taken into account if found in children or if multiple OKCs are present; diagnosis of multiple OKCs in a child necessitates referral for genetic evaluation. Histologically, the cysts are indistinguishable to non-syndromic cysts and over 80% will have PTCH mutations. ==Diagnosis== Classic look of an odontogenic keratocyst of the right mandible in the place of a former wisdom tooth. Well defined, unilocular, radiolucent lesion within the bone. Diagnosis is usually radiological. However, definitive diagnosis is through biopsy. Aspirational biopsy of odontogenic keratocysts contains a greasy fluid which is pale in colour and contains keratotic squames. Protein content of cyst fluid below 4g% is diagnostic of odontogenic keratocysts. Smaller and unilocular lesions resembling other types of cysts may require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. On a CT scan, the radiodensity of a keratocystic odontogenic tumour is about 30 Hounsfield units, which is about the same as ameloblastomas. However, ameloblastomas show more bone expansion and seldom show high density areas. Radiographs of odontogenic keratocysts show well-defined radiolucent areas with rounded or scalloped margins which are well demarcated. These areas can be multilocular or unilocular. The growth pattern of the lesion is very characteristic from which a diagnosis can be made as there is growth and spread both forward and backward along the medullary cavity with little expansion. No resorption of teeth or inferior dental canal and minimal displacement of teeth is seen. Due to lack of expansion of the odontogenic keratocyst, the lesion can be very large when radiographically discovered. ===Differential diagnosis === Radiologically *Odontogenic myxoma *Ameloblastoma *Central giant-cell granuloma *Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor *Dentigerous cyst (follicular cyst) Histologically *Orthokeratocyst *Radicular cyst (particularly if the OKC is very inflamed) *Ameloblastoma === Histology === Odontogenic keratocysts have a diagnostic histological appearance. Under the microscope, OKCs vaguely resemble keratinized squamous epithelium;Thompson LDR. Head and neck pathology - (Foundations in diagnostic pathology). Goldblum JR, Ed.. Churchill Livingstone. 2006. . however, they lack rete ridges and often have an artifactual separation from their basement membrane. The fibrous wall of the cyst is usually thin and uninflamed. The epithelial lining is thin with even thickness and parakeratinised with columnar cells in the basal layer which have focal reverse polarisation (nuclei are on the opposite pole of the cell). The basal cells are an indication of the odontogenic origin as they resemble pre-ameloblasts. The epithelium can separate from the wall, resulting in islands of epithelium. These can go on to form 'satellite' or 'daughter' cysts, leading to an overall multilocular cyst. Presence of daughter cysts is particularly seen in those with NBCCS. Inflamed cysts show hyperplastic epithelium which is no longer characteristic of OKCs and can have resemblance to radicular cysts instead. Due to areas of focal inflammation, a larger biopsy is required for correct diagnosis of odontogenic keratocysts.

A 2015 Cochrane review found that there is currently no high quality evidence to suggest the effectiveness of specific treatments for the treatment of odontogenic keratocysts. Treatment depends on extent of multilocularity and cyst. Small multilocular and unilocular cysts can be treated more conservatively through enucleation and curretage. Treatment options: *Wide (local) surgical excision to remove the whole cyst lining. *Curettage involving simple excision and scraping-out of cavity. *Carnoy's solution fixative (ethanol, chloroform and acetic acid) which is usually used in conjunction with excision and curretage. Cavity wall can be treated with the fixative either before enucleation to kill the lining of the wall or added after curretage to bony walls, killing any residual epithelial cells to a depth of 1-2mm. Used with care near mandibular canal and the neurovascular bundle within. *Marsupialization which involves the surgical opening of the cyst cavity and a creation of a marsupial-like pouch. This allows the cavity to be in contact with the outside of the cyst for an extended period of time. Marsupialisation results in slow shrinkage of the cyst allowing later enucleation. However, resolution can take up to 20 months and patients are required to clean the open cavity and irrigate it. * Peripheral ostectomy after curettage and/or enucleation. Extensive cysts may require a bone graft after bone resection and reconstruction of the area. *Simple excision *Enucleation and cryotherapy. Decompression followed by enucleation has been shown to be most successful with lowest recurrence rates. * Topical application of 5FU after enucleation Ledderhof, N.J., Caminiti, M.F., Bradley, G. and Lam, D.K., 2017. Topical 5-fluorouracil is a novel targeted therapy for the keratocystic odontogenic tumor. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 75(3), pp.514-524. === Follow-up === Annual radiographic review has been recommended. Long-term clinical follow-up is also recommended due to recurrences occurring many years after treatment. ===Recurrence and neoplastic nature=== Malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma may occur, but is unusual. Recurrence is likely when treated by simple enucleation. Contributing causes include thin and fragile epithelium leading to incomplete removal, cyst extensions extending into cancellous bone, satellite cysts found in the wall, experience of the surgeon, formation of further new cysts from other remnants of the dental epithelium. With current treatment techniques the recurrence rate is around 2-3%. Recurrence is usually seen within 5 years of treatment. Early findings of recurrence can be easily treated with minor surgery and curretage. The neoplastic nature of odontogenic keratocysts has been debated. Due to high recurrence rate, late detection when the cyst has grown very large and causation by tumour suppressor gene inactivation, some have classified OKCs as benign neoplasms. The best evidence to suggest that this type of cyst is not a neoplasm is that it responds very well to marsupialisation. == See also == Cysts of the jaws ==References External links == Category:Jaw disorders Category:Odontogenic tumors ","title":"Odontogenic keratocyst"},{"id":"7456369","text":"Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Harper (3 August 1902 ‚Äì 9 October 1979) was an English athlete who competed for Great Britain in the 1924, 1928 and 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1924 he finished fifth in the 10000 metre and fourth in the individual cross country event. He was the only British finisher in this race; therefore, the British team was unplaced in the team cross country competition. Just fifteen of the thirty-eight starters finished the event due to the extreme heat, The Times reporting the scenes at the end of the race: Some way behind Harper a figure in the scarlet drawers of Spain appeared in the entrance, turned the wrong way, was stopped, and then ran horribly round in little circles till he plunged on his face. Immediately another figure appeared, Sewell of the British team. He also tried to run the wrong way, was checked, and turned round, ran giddily a few yards, staggered, met another competitor, a Finn, also reeling, and the two fell together in a dreadful heap. Meanwhile a Frenchman had entered and ran three-quarters of the distance to the winning line, began to zig-zag, threw up his arms helplessly, and crashed full length on the ground. It was all heartbreaking to watch. Never, surely, in any race ‚Äì not even in a Grand National ‚Äì was there anything like the proportion of casualties; and the race ought never to have been run in the heat of such a day. It was altogether a terrible race. Harper‚Äôs performance was a fine one. In 1928 Harper finished 22nd in the Olympic marathon; he improved to second place at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Harper earned praise for advising eventual winner Sohn Kee-chung not to chase after Juan Carlos Zabala, who had opened a big lead. Zabala eventually pulled out of the race. Sohn was later reported to have said: \\"Please say Mr Harper is a very fine man for telling me about Zabala.\\" At the 1930 Empire Games Harper won the silver medal in the six miles event. Harper ran for Hallamshire Harriers and Athletic Club in Sheffield. His record in the national cross-country championships was: *1923 ‚Äì 3rd *1924 ‚Äì 2nd *1925 ‚Äì 2nd *1926 ‚Äì 2nd *1927 ‚Äì 1st *1928 ‚Äì 14th *1929 ‚Äì 1st *1930 ‚Äì 2nd In addition he won numerous Yorkshire and Northern cross-country titles and represented England in International Cross Country Championships in 1923‚Äì1931, winning the individual competition in 1926. Harper had a fine reputation for sportsmanship. As well as the 1936 marathon incident mentioned above, in a 1924 international cross-country race he waited for another competitor, as described in The Times: [The collapse of Ryan], besides causing much excitement, left Harper with every prospect of coming in first. Instead of making the most of his opportunity, however, Harper turned and waved for Cotterell to come along. Cotterell came up with a bound, and the pair ran abreast until about twenty-five yards from the tape, when Cotterell made a great sprint, leaving Harper apparently standing still, and won a sensational race. Cotterell must have put in some wonderful running in the last two-and-a- half miles to make up the ground he did. Without in the least trying to discount the excellence of his victory, however, every credit must be given to Harper, a young runner who, to say the least of it, displayed great unselfishness. There is no means of knowing exactly how much [Cotterell] had in reserve at the finish, but it certainly seemed that Harper deliberately sacrificed his chance of being the first man home. Apocryphal stories tell of him helping up competitors who had fallen, and re-directing someone who had taken a wrong turn on a cross-country course. More prosaically, he was once said to have vacated his seat on a full bus to allow another passenger to sit, instead running behind the vehicle all the way up the steep hill to his home. In 1939 Harper turned professional. Around that time he lived with his married daughter, who settled in Australia. ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Chesterfield Category:English male marathon runners Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for England Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1930 British Empire Games Category:International Cross Country Championships winners Category:Medalists at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic cross country runners ","title":"Ernie Harper"},{"id":"7456388","text":"Peter Cantor (died 1197), also known as Peter the Chanter or by his Latin name Petrus Cantor, was a French Roman Catholic theologian.Peter Cantor - Catholic Encyclopedia article He received his education at Rheims, and later moved on to Paris, where, in 1183, he became Chanter (hence his name) at Notre Dame.

Subsequent Rulers of Oldenburg were all his descendants. ==History== The town was first mentioned in 1108, at that time known under the name of Aldenburg. It became important due to its location at a ford of the navigable Hunte river. Oldenburg became a small county in the shadow of the much more powerful Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. The earliest recorded inhabitants of the region now called Oldenburg were a Teutonic people- the Chauci. The genealogy of the counts of Oldenburg can be traced to the Saxon hero Widukind (opponent of Charlemagne), but their first historical representative was Huno of Rustringen (died 1059). Huno's descendants appear as vassals of the dukes of Saxony and were occasionally rebellious. They were given the title of princes of the Empire when the emperor Frederick I dismembered the Saxon duchy in 1189. At this time the county of Delmenhorst formed part of the dominions of the counts of Oldenburg, but afterwards it was on several occasions separated from them to form an appanage for younger branches of the family, namely in ca. 1266-1436, 1463-1547, and 1577-1617. The northern and western parts of what would become the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg were in the hands of independent, or semi-independent, Frisian princes, who were usually pagan, and the counts of Oldenburg seized much of these lands in a series of wars during the early part of the 13th century. The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and the bishop of M√ºnster also frequently warred with the counts of Oldenburg. In 1448, the son and heir of Count Dietrich (died 1440), named Christian but called Fortunatus, became king of Denmark as Christian I. Although far from the Danish borders, Oldenburg then became a Danish exclave. The control over the town was left to the king's brothers, who established a short-lived tyranny. In 1450, Christian became king of Norway and in 1457 king of Sweden; in 1460 he inherited the Duchy of Schleswig and the County of Holstein, which significantly affected Oldenburg's future. In 1454, he handed over Oldenburg to his brother Gerhard (c. 1430-1499), who constantly warred with the bishop of Bremen and other neighbors. However, in 1483 Gerhard was compelled to abdicate in favor of his son, and he died whilst on a pilgrimage in Spain. The County of Oldenburg in the 15th century Guard house and the Lamberti-Church Early in the 16th century, Oldenburg was again enlarged at the expense of the Frisians. Protestantism was introduced into the county by Count Anton I (1505-1573), who also suppressed the monasteries. However, he remained loyal to Charles V during the war of the league of Schmalkalden, and was able thus to increase his territories, obtaining Delmenhorst in 1547. One of Anton's brothers, Count Christopher of Oldenburg (c. 1506-1560) also won a reputation as a soldier. Anton's grandson, Anton G√ºnther (1583-1667), who succeeded in 1603 significantly enlarged and enriched his territories. He thus considered himself the wisest prince who ever had ruled Oldenburg. Jever had been acquired before his ascension, but in 1624 he added Knipphausen and Varel to his lands; thus, in 1647 Delmenhorst was finally united. Through neutrality during the Thirty Years' War and by donating valuable horses to warlord Count of Tilly, Anton G√ºnther protected his dominions from the devastation levied on nearly all other German states. He also obtained from the emperor the right to levy tolls on vessels passing along the Weser, a lucrative grant. In 1607 he erected a Renaissance castle. Oldenburg was a wealthy town in a time of war and turmoil and its population and power grew considerably. However, after the death of Anton G√ºnther, Oldenburg fell again under Danish authority, and 1667 the town was struck by a disastrous plague epidemic and shortly thereafter was destroyed in a fire. The Danish kings became uninterested in the town and it lost its former importance. In 1773 Danish rule ended and, in 1774, the Oldenburg region became a duchy. The destroyed buildings in the city were then rebuilt in a Classicist style. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1090s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1091 establishments in Europe Category:1774 disestablishments in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"County of Oldenburg"},{"id":"7456417","text":"Kati-Claudia Fofonoff (8 December 1947 in Ivalo ‚Äì 12 June 2011) was a Skolt Saami author and translator who wrote in Skolt Saami and Finnish.

First rebellion started after 10 days of his coronation when his brother-in-law Qilifa Shifa (‰øüÂäõÁôºÁ§∫Áôº) rose against him, killing Anagui's younger brother Yujiul√º Yijufa (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠‰πôÂ±Ö‰ºê) and his mother Hou Luling (‰æØÂëÇÈôµ) on his attack, paving way for Anagui's cousin Yujiul√º Poluomen. Having lost the fight, Anagui fled to Northern Wei. Emperor Xiaoming sheltered him and ordered his advisors to bring him to palace. As Khagan asked for troops to regain his throne, emperor recognized him but postponed any idea of going to war. Restless Anagui bribed Yuan Cha to leave capital. Emperor suddenly changed his idea when Anagui was about to leave in 521, helped him from martial and economic perspective. == Second reign == Back in Rouran, Qilifa Shifa this time opposed Yujiul√º Poluomen, invading his domains. Poluomen's further defeat by Gaoche forced Northern Wei to divide Rouran between Anagui and Poluomen in order to establish stability. Anagui resided in Huaishuo (modern Guyang, Inner Mongolia), while Poluomen ruled from Xihai (modern Ejin, Inner Mongolia). Poluomen later fled to Hephtalites in 524, but was arrested and brought to Northern Wei court, who executed him and made Anagui ruler of both parts of the khaganate. Swaying unto Chinese influence, Anagui reformed Rouran after Chinese bureaucracy, made a Han Chinese his chancellor. In 522, he asked for millet for sowing and received 10000 bags from China. However his agricultural project didn't work out, therefore he started to raid Wei frontier towns due to hunger in 523. Later in 525, he answered Wei call for suppressing revolt in Six Frontier Towns with 100.000 strong Rouran army, plundering rebellious people. He tried to maintain balance between Wei and Liang following years, sending gifts to both parties. He asked for a princess in marriage in 533, a request that was accepted. Emperor Xiaowu sent a cousin of his, Princess Lanling (Ëò≠ÈôµÂÖ¨‰∏ª) as his bride. In 535, he managed to get another princess for his family, this time to his brother Yujiul√º Tahan (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â°îÂØí), who was married to Princess Huazheng (ÂåñÊîøÂÖ¨‰∏ª), daughter of a Northern Wei official Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÁøå). He also forced Emperor Wen to divorce Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen agreed, and divorced Empress Yifu, making her a Buddhist nun. He then married Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter and created her empress. For a while, this brought peace with Rouran. In 540, she was pregnant when Rouran launched a major attack on Western Wei ‚Äî causing the Western Wei officials to believe that the attack was launched because she was jealous of the former Empress Yifu, who was by then a Buddhist nun. Emperor Wen, under pressure, ordered Empress Yifu to commit suicide. Later in the year, when Empress Yujiul√º herself was about to give birth, she heard unusual barking noises in the palace, and she suspected them as from the spirit of Empress Yifu. She therefore grew depressed, and she died either during or shortly after childbirth in 540. Eastern Wei regent Gao Huan skillfully used this opportunity, sent Zhang Weiquan, who transmitted a letter to the Khagan. The letter said that Yuwen Tai killed Emperor Wen, poisoned the empress and wants to destroy the Rouran. At the military council, the nobles of Rouran spoke in favor of recognizing Eastern Wei. Anagui paid a small tribute in recognition of Eastern Wei. After lengthy negotiations, Gao Huan decided to send Princess Le'an (Ê®ÇÂÆâÂÖ¨‰∏ª) for Yujiul√º Anluochen. In 541, the khagan sent 1,000 horses and asked to bring the princess, who was now renamed Princess Lanling (Ëò≠ÈôµÂÖ¨‰∏ª). In view of the importance of an alliance with the Rouran, Gao Huan personally presided the collection of the dowry and led the princess and her retinue to Rouran. Anagui was very pleased with the marriage. This year he also ended the Gaoche threat for once and all. The alliance with Eastern Wei turned out to be quite bountiful. Now northern China was weakened by the civil war between Western and Eastern Wei (between the Yuwen Tai and Gao Huan, the actual rulers) and the Rouran didn't fear devastating invasions of their lands. Population increased and Anaguy became one of the strongest rulers in the region. His Han Chinese secretary of the khagan, persuaded him not to sign the messages as a vassal - but as an equal sovereign. Anagui often switched between sides. In fall 545, due to an alliance between Western Wei and Rouran to attack Eastern Wei, Gao Huan sued for peace with Rouran by requesting a marriage between a daughter of Anagui and Gao Cheng. Yujiul√º Anagui refused, stating that it would only be sufficient if Gao Huan himself married her. Gao Huan himself initially refused, but Princess Lou, Gao Cheng and Wei Jing all persuaded him otherwise, and he married Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter, referring to her as the Princess Ruru (Ë†ïË†ïÂÖ¨‰∏ª).eds. Lee, Stefanowska, Wiles 2007, p. 316.Gao Huan, as demanded by Yujiul√º Anagui as one of the peace terms between Eastern Wei and Rouran, married the Princess Ruru in 545, and had her take the place of Princess Lou as his wife, but never formally divorced Princess Lou. After Gao Huan's death, pursuant to Rouran customs, the Princess Ruru became married to Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng, who also, however, did not formally divorce his wife. To facilitate this marriage, Princess Lou moved out of the mansion, but Gao Huan and Princess Lou were not formally divorced. Next year, in 546, his bannerman Ashina Tumen suppressed a Tiele revolt against Rouran.Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 159. Following this, Tumen felt entitled to request of the Rouran a princess as his wife. Anagui sent an emissary to Bumin to rebuke him, saying, \\"You are my blacksmith slave.

In 1279, while the various nations of the University of Paris were quarrelling about the rectorship, Simon de Brion, papal legate, appointed Peter of Auvergne to that office; in 1296 he was elected to it. ==Works== His published works are: *\\"Supplementum Commentarii S.

In 1169 he succeeded Peter Comestor in the chair of scholastic theology. His lectures were inspired the enmity of Gauthier de St- Victor, one of the bitterest opponents of Scholasticism, who ranked him with Gilbert de la Porr√©e, Abelard, and Peter Lombard in the pamphlet wherein he tries to throw ridicule on the four doctors, under the name of the Four Labyrinths of France. As Chancellor of the Church of Paris he displayed great zeal on behalf of poor students, and to supply their want of text-books, which were very expensive, he had a kind of synopsis engraved on the walls of the classrooms for their assistance. In 1191 he was appointed by Pope Celestine III to settle a dispute between the Abbeys of St-Eloi and St-Victor. He was a constant correspondent of Celestine III and Pope Innocent III. Certain writers believe that he died Bishop of Embrun; the Gallia Christiana Nova shows that he was only Chancellor of Paris. ==Works== In 1179 he published five books of sentences which are a synopsis of his lectures. His doctrine is orthodox, but, though containing no condemned proposition, it arguably exhibits more subtlety than theology based on Holy Scripture. He wrote commentaries, still unedited, on Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and the Psalms. A chronological and genealogical abridgment of the Bible is attributed to him, but the authorship is uncertain.

Hence LPCs are regarded as the intraosseous form of the extraosseous GCA. They are commonly found along the lateral periodontium or within the bone between the roots of vital teeth, around mandibular canines and premolars. Standish and Shafer reported the first well-documented case of LPCs in 1958, followed by Holder and Kunkel in the same year although it was called a periodontal cyst. Since then, there has been more than 270 well-documented cases of LPCs in literature. == Signs and symptoms == Observable clinical signs of a LPC include a small, soft-tissue swelling found just below or within the interdental papilla. However, as it is usually asymptomatic in nature, LPCs are usually detected through radiography. On radiographs, the LPC appears with a well-defined round, oval or sometimes tear-drop shape. It also has an opaque outline along the edge of the tooth root. In rare situations, possible implications include loss of enamel and dentine of adjacent teeth, loss of lamina dura and enlargement of the periodontal ligament space. Under the microscope, the LPC is seen as a cystic cavity with a thin layer of epithelium along its margin and held up by a connective tissue. In most cases, no inflammatory cells cells are present, but in some rare instances, inflammation in the fibrous capsule can be observed. Many transparent cells rich in glycogen can found in either plaques or in the outermost epithelium layers. There is often thickening of the epithelium or plaque formation seen. == Formation/Pathophysiology == The origin of the LPC remains controversial, with extensive debate in the literature over the different hypotheses. Base on the findings, the pathogenesis of LPC may be related to three etiopathological hypotheses. === Reduced enamel epithelium === The hypothesis suggested that the cyst is lined by nonkeratinized epithelium reminiscent of the reduced enamel epithelium which is supported by PCNA immunohistochemical expression. === Remnants of dental lamina=== LPC histopathologically presents glycogen- rich clear cells, which are also seen in the dental lamina. Therefore LPC might be related to dental lamina remnants. === Cellular remnants of Malassez=== The epithelial cell rests of Malassez (ERM) presented in the roots surface, principal location of the LPC, play a role in LPC formation. Several additional theories had been proposed regarding the origin of lateral periodontal cysts, including the possibility that the lesions may arise as a result of pulpal infection manifesting itself in a lateral position or chronic periodontal disease activating the rests of Malassez. == Diagnosis, prognosis and predictive factors == Lateral periodontal cysts are asymptomatic and are usually exposed in patients routine radiography. The onset of lateral periodontal cyst are insidious and subtle, with a yearly growth rate of 0.7 mm. Adjacent teeth vitality is of great importance when contemplating a pre- surgical working diagnosis of lateral periodontal cyst as missing adjacent teeth or past endodontic treatment would affect and confuse the differential diagnosis. It is rare but have been reported in literature that cysts can display mandibular or maxillary bone expansion, bone perforation and overlying gingiva communication. Lateral periodontal cysts radiographically present as a rounded, teardrop shape that are usually less than 10mm in size, presenting with a uni-cystic well-delineated radiolucency. Lesions are situated usually between the tooth lateral surface between the root apex and alveolar crest. A prominent cortical boundary is also usually observed. Associated teeth root divergence and absorption is seldom observed, with loss of periodontal ligament space and lamina dura also possible. Lateral periodontal cysts have to undergo surgical removal by excision or conservative enucleation, with post surgery radiographic follow up for several years, monitoring recurrence. Bone regeneration within the bony defect usually occurs from 6 months to 1 year. Recurrence is unlikely but have occurred and reported in literature. Root divergence due to lateral periodontal cysts are normalised or reduced after surgical treatment, without orthodontic intervention required. Squamous cell carcinoma development has been reported within literature to occur in lateral periodontal cysts. == Classification == Lateral periodontal cysts can be classified into two morphological types: Unicystic and Multicystic. Botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) was once classified as one type of LPC by Altini and Shear in 1992. It was opposed by Van der Waal in the same year as he stated that BOC extends well beyond the lateral area of root, therefore should not be considered as a variant of LPC. But it is possible that the cells of origin for both cysts are the same. == Treatment and management == Successful treatment of LPC consists of surgical removal of the lesion by conservative enucleation with guided bone regeneration technique (GBR) with xenograft and resorbable collagen membrane. This is often achieved without affecting the periodontal health of adjacent teeth. Periodic radiographic follow-up monitoring of the patient for any recurrence is also recommended. Typically, bone regeneration of the bony defect is achieved within 6‚Äì12 months, by placing an osteoconductive bone substitute material into the defect and covering it with a barrier membrane (such as a resorbable collagen barrier membrane (RCM)). The reported recurrence rate remains very low. LPC is usually reported as a coincidental finding during routine radiograph analysis, and usually does not show any symptoms due to its non-inflammatory nature, unless the cystic lesion is subject to secondary infection. == References == Category:Cysts of the oral and maxillofacial region ","title":"Lateral periodontal cyst"},{"id":"7456512","text":"Kamratm√§sterskapen (literally, \\"The Comrade Championships\\") was a Swedish football cup tournament played 1901-1924 and 1940-1945\\\\.

Running along the Ohio River, the route existed from 1932 until about 2012. For most of its history, SR 338 ran along the river between Racine and Lebanon Township with both ends at SR 124. At the time of its removal from the state highway system, the last remnant of the route was a segment (designated by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) as SR 338-J) between US 33 near the Ravenswood Bridge and SR 124. ==Route description== Route of SR 338 highlighted in red The following description is the description of SR 338-J SR 338 began at an intersection with US 33 near Racine. The route headed northward, running near the banks of the Ohio River. SR 338 intersected with a few private roads leading to nearby homes. A field is visible to the east, as the highway made its namesake turn as Great Bend Road. Through the bend, SR 338 turned and headed into a dense forest. After a short distance, SR 338 broke out of the dense patch of trees. With the Ohio River in view, the highway terminated at an intersection with SR 124 northeast of Racine. ==History== The original route was certified in 1932; originally routed from Letart Falls (about south of Racine) to east of Letart Falls. The highway was extended to Racine in 1937 along a previously unnumbered road from Letart Falls to Antiquity, and along the former SR 337 from Antiquity to Racine. SR 338 was extended east of Racine along the previous and current alignment of SR 124. In 1941, SR 338 swapped alignments with SR 124 from to east of Racine; SR 338 was given the southern alignment along the Ohio River. By 2003, SR 338 was truncated at the new alignment of US 33 approximately east of Racine; the former alignment of SR 338 from Racine south along the river and back up north to east of Racine designated as SR 124; from east of Racine to US 33 decertified. When SR 338 was truncated in 2003, the remains of the highway became known as SR 338-J. At the time of the truncation, the route was unsigned and the \\"J\\" suffix meant that the route was awaiting abandonment. ODOT was making constant repairs to SR 338 due to its close proximity to the river, which led to soil instability. Between 2008 and 2012, the last segment of SR 338 had been removed from the state's jurisdiction.

Heather was a young attractive career lady and it seemed strange that she would fall for Nicholas. As with the later character, John Harrison (Geoffrey Leesley), the writers attempted to make the character more interesting by giving him a flaw. In this case, Nicholas and Charlie were heroin addicts. Nicholas lied to Heather about his addiction and despite Barry Grant's (Paul Usher) warnings, Heather ignored this until it was too late. Nicholas overdosed on heroin and his ex-wife advised Heather to leave him. Heather stayed with him, however it wasn't long before he was stealing from her to fund his habit.

Esposizione del salmo 68, 1500 Born at Florence, his parents were common folk, and he himself lacked higher education. But he attached himself with fanatical zeal to Savonarola, and, by diligent attendance at his sermons and zealous study of his writings, acquired a wide but superficial theological knowledge. Peter preached to the people in the public squares of Florence and, during the lifetime of Savonarola and after his death, he propagated secretly some revolutionary doctrines. According to him, the Church must be renewed with the sword; until this was accomplished, there was no need to confess, since all priests, secular and regular, were unworthy. According to the Florentine chronicler Bartolomeo Cerretani, about twenty adherents of Savonarola formed a secret society and elected Peter pope. Tha latter, who was then twenty-five years old, assumed special ecclesiastical functions and anointed his followers with oil. The members attended no Divine Service, but during their meetings prayed in spirit under the leadership of Peter, whom they regarded as a prophet. The association was discovered by the archbishop and at his request the Council of Florence proscribed its meetings. In 1502 the members left the town secretly and proceeded to Mirandola where Count Gian Francesco, a zealous supporter of Savonarola, gave them a friendly reception. When, a little later, the count was besieged by two of his brothers, who claimed Mirandola, Peter declared it God's will that Gian Francesco should overcome his enemies. However, Mirandola was taken and the count lost his territory in August, 1502. The sectaries falling into the hands of the victors, Peter and some of his companions were burned as heretics; the remainder were expelled or dispatched to Florence. ==References== *Pastor, History of the Popes, tr.

She was credited in France as Maria Casar√®s. ==Early life== Casares was born Mar√≠a Victoria Casares y P√©rez in A Coru√±a, Galicia, the daughter of Santiago Casares Quiroga, a minister in Manuel Aza√±a's government and Prime Minister of Spain, and of Gloria P√©rez. She was a volunteer in Madrid hospitals already at age fourteen. Her father was a member of the Republican government so at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), the family was forced to flee Spain. Her father went to London, but she and her mother sought refuge in Paris. There, Mar√≠a attended the Victor Duruy school, where she learned French and was befriended by a teacher and his Spanish wife, who inspired her to go into the theatre. After graduation, she took voice classes with Ren√© Simon. She enrolled in the Paris Conservatoire, where she won First Prize for tragedy and Second Prize for comedy. ==Career== In July 1942, she auditioned for Marcel Herrand who engaged her for his Th√©√¢tre des Mathurins. There, over the course of the next three years, she appeared in several plays including, Deirdre of the Sorrows by J. M. Synge, The Master Builder by Ibsen, Le Malentendu (The Misunderstanding) by Albert Camus (with whom she would later have a passionate affair), and an especially important premiere, F√©d√©rico, after Prosper M√©rim√©e, with G√©rard Philipe. ===Film=== She began to appear in films. Her first film role was in Marcel Carn√©'s Les Enfants du paradis (1945), one of the great classics of French cinema. She also made Les dames du Bois de Boulogne (1945) for Robert Bresson, La Chartreuse de Parme (The Charterhouse of Parma) (1948) for Christian-Jaque, co-starring G√©rard Philipe. For Cocteau, she played Death in his Orph√©e (1950) with Jean Marais and Fran√ßois P√©rier and in his Testament d'Orph√©e (Testament of Orpheus) (1960). In 1989, she was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Best Supporting Actress in La Lectrice. ===Stage success=== From 1952 onward, although she continued to appear in occasional films, she devoted herself mainly to the stage. She joined the Festival d'Avignon, the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire under the leadership of Jean Vilar. Before her, no one actor or actress of foreign origin had ever played at Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. She toured extensively throughout the world, appearing in the great classics of French theatre, including, in 1958, Corneille's Le Cid, Victor Hugo's Marie Tudor and Marivaux' Le Triomphe de l'Amour (The Triumph of Love) on Broadway. ==Personal life and death== Casares took French nationality in 1975 and three years later married Andr√© Schlesser, an actor known professionally as Dade, who had been her longtime companion and theatrical co-star.

The three books are Lord of Snow and Shadows (2003), Prisoner of the Iron Tower (2004), and Children of the Serpent Gate (2005). They are published by Bantam Press in the United Kingdom and Bantam Spectra in the United States. The series follows the protagonist Gavril Andar, later Gavril Nagarian under his father‚Äôs name, from his humble beginnings as a portraitist from Smarna through to becoming the High Steward of Azhkendir. ==Overview== Background Information Artamon was the former emperor of Rossiya, a kingdom that comprised Tielen, Smarna, Muscobar, Azhkendir and Khitari. Artamon‚Äôs sons fought vehemently between themselves over land and title and once possessed by Drakhaouls they tore the empire apart. A grand ruby of their father was broken into pieces and each son took one each, these became referred to as the Tears of Artamon. Four out of five of the Drakhaouls were driven back and banished from the mortal realm by Saint Sergius, however the final Drakhaoul, Khezef, defeated and killed Sergius. Khezef continued to dwell among mortals by inhabiting the ruling monarch of Azhkendir, through the generations. The remainder of Artamon‚Äôs descendants spread out across the fragmented empire and over time all knowledge of the Drakhaouls was forgotten. Synopsis Gavril Andar who has a surprisingly vivid dream, and is subsequently kidnapped from his home in Smarna, where he resided with his mother, Elysia. He is taken to Azhkendir and informed that he is the son of the recently deceased Lord Volkh Nagarian and that he is to assume power as his father‚Äôs heir. Gavril soon comes to understand that his father‚Äôs Drakhaoul, Khezef, had sought him out and possessed him as the rightful inheritor and one of Artamon‚Äôs descendants. During the course of this first instalment in the trilogy, Gavril must learn to adjust to the new culture and environment he has so suddenly found himself enveloped in, and come to terms with his birthrights. While battling with his unwanted Drakhoul in his father‚Äôs Kastel he forms a fondness toward one of the young maids, Kiukiu, a girl who falls in love with Gavril. Despite endeavouring to discover methods of banishing his Drakhaoul, Gavril embraces him in a battle against an advancing army, under the leadership of Eugene of Tielen, in order to save his Kastel and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, Kiukiu has uncovered her true heritage as a Spirit Singer after she unexpectedly met her (previously unknown to her) grandmother, Malusha. At the climax of the book, Gavril persuades Malusha to help him exorcise Khezef, which he achieves at a terrible cost to himself and those around him. Prisoner of the Iron Tower expands the wealth of characters; following the lives of many key figures this instalment successfully threads together various elements to create the wider story. At the onset of 'Prisoner of the Iron Tower,' Gavril is confined to an asylum known as Arnskammar, in southern Tielen far from Azhkendir. There he is experimented upon and pushed to the brink of death until, in desperation, he pleads for Khezef to return and save him. Unbeknownst to Gavril, Kiukiu has undertaken the journey to Arnskammar in search of him, after Gavril escapes with the aid of Khezef, Kiukiu is misled by Eugene of Tielen‚Äôs trusted magus Kaspar Linnaius. She is lured to the aid of Karila, Eugene‚Äôs sickly daughter, and while trying to heal the young princess she becomes trapped in a spirit realm by Nagar (also referred to as The Dread Prince Nagazdiel) who drains her, leaving her trapped inside her own ever-aging body. Before she is trapped, however, she discovers the spirits of the first set of Drakhaouls‚Äô children who were also imprisoned by Nagazdiel, and the spirits of these children have found their living counterparts. The taxing strain of these spirits means that the living children are often sickly, much like Karila, who is Khezef‚Äôs child. Throughout this book, Eugene and Linnaius work to discover the location of the Serpent Gate, a gate that will loose the four other Drakhaouls into the mortal realm. Found on the island of Ty Nagar, the gate can only be opened by the reconstructed ruby of Artamon, which Eugene of Tielen had reunited to claim the title of Emperor of New Rossiya. Hearing of this plan, Gavril tries to stop Eugene but arrives at Ty Nagar after Eugene has freed the Darkhouls and been possessed by Belberith. The two fight, but as Gavril and Khezef have been weakened they are left for dead on the shores of Ty Nagar. Eugene returns to his empire and the three other Drakhaouls seek out the descendants of Artamon. Sahariel finds Oskar Alvborg, the illegitimate brother of Eugene, Adramelech finds Andrei Orlov, the brother of Astasia, Eugene‚Äôs newlywed wife, and Nilaihah seeks out the fervently religious Enguerrand of Francia under the guise of an angel. Throughout Children of the Serpent Gate, these three men are driven by the desires of their Drakhaouls to kidnap the Drakhouls‚Äô children and take them to Ty Nagar, where they would be sacrificed in order to free Nagazdiel and plunge the world into darkness. Kiukiu and Malusha embark on a long journey to the Jade Springs in Khitari in order to give Kiukiu her youth back, and on their voyage they come into contact with the sickly Prince Bayar, another of the Drakhaouls‚Äô children, and his father Khan Vachir of Khitari. After successfully regaining her youth, Kiukiu is determined to help the Drakhaouls and send them from her world into their home in the Ways Beyond. When discovering that both Karila, and the newborn Rostevan, have been kidnapped by other Drakhouls Eugene allies himself with Gavril in order to stop the plan to free Prince Nagar. Although Za‚Äôafiel is freed, who is the Drakhaoul that must sacrifice the children in order to free Nagar, Eugene and Gavril manage to destroy the gate and prevent the summoning of Nagar. Unfortunately, Karila is mortally wounded in the process, and as Eugene weeps for her and Kiukiu simultaneously (from Khitari) sings for the trapped spirits of the original Drakhaouls‚Äô children to find their way to the Ways Beyond, a portal appears on Ty Nagar. The Drakhaouls all peacefully leave their hosts and step through to the spirit world and are reunited with their children, as a parting gift Khezef heals Karila of her ailments and give her new life, sending her spirit back to her body and her grieving father. At the end of Children of the Serpent Gate Eugene‚Äôs family is reunited, and he stipulates that should Oskar Alvborg return to New Rossiya he should be immediately detained in Arnskammer, also that Andrei Orlov is exiled from New Rossiya on pain of death. Eugene awards Gavril with the title of High Steward of Azhkendir, who returns to his princedom and proposes marriage to Kiukiu. ==The Seven Drakhaoulim, Hosts and Children== Drakhaouls and their Hosts Khezef The Bringer Of Death‚Äì Gavril Nagarian: Khezef possesses Gavril's body supposedly after his father's death.

He was a boyfriend of Ruth Smith until it came to light that he had been abusing her son Luke. Dan Morrisey is no relation to the Brookside character Susannah Morrisey. ==StorylinesIntroduction=== The Gordon family moved onto Brookside Close in 2002. The eldest daughter Ruth (Lynsey McCaffery) had a son, Luke (Callum Giblin), with her previous husband Sean Smith (Barry Sloane). Ruth and Sean had already split by the time they moved onto the Close. Ruth first appeared with a black eye after fighting with husband Sean after he had discovered her affair with ex-boyfriend Dan Morrisey. In sympathy, her parents Alan (John Burton) and Debbie (Annette Ekblom) allowed Ruth to stay, but were somewhat put out when Dan came to stay as well. ===Relationship with Luke=== Dan felt nothing bus resentment for his new step-son Luke. He resented him interrupting his time with Ruth, and resented having to look after him while Ruth worked. At the time, Ruth and Sean were engaged in a custody battle over Luke; Debbie became concerned about bruises appearing on Luke and wrongly assumed they must have come from Sean. After the Alan went missing and was found dead in Kingston upon Hull, Ruth and Dan started taking charge of the Gordon household, a role which Dan did not seem to eager to take on and one he would use to vent his frustrations on Luke. After a confrontation between Dan and Sean over Dan's treatment of Luke, Luke chased off after Sean as he was leaving in his van. Dan violently pulled him back, this however was seen by Sean who got out of his van and punched Dan to the ground. Later, as punishment for Luke, Dan made him stand behind the curtain and refused to allow him to use the lavatory. Physical abuse Dan became constantly frustrated with Luke not obeying his directions and became very forthright about punishing him. After Luke complained about the water in the shower being too cold, Dan deliberately scolded him and then blamed the incident on a faulty shower, something Ruth believed. Sean however was less than satisfied with this explanation and refused to believe it was an accident. Ali (Kris Mocherrie) was later shocked to see that Luke had wet himself behind the curtain and that Luke appeared frightened of Dan. Dan explained that the fight had made Luke wet himself but Ali wasn't convinced by this explanation. When Ruth arrived home, she argued with Dan over him disciplining her son. Dan continued to victimise Luke, openly blaming him for being stuck in Liverpool. The tension became too much for Luke and he knocked his food on the floor. Dan insisted he eat it from the floor like a dog, when Luke refused Dan locked him out in the rain. Ruth found out and was annoyed but after Dan threatened to leave she forgave him. Later, Luke stayed with Dan and accidentally knocked over a bottle of milk. Dan started shouting at Luke. Ali and Stuart (David Lyon) had come to see Luke and heard the shouting, confronting Dan about it. Later, when Luke told Ruth that Dan had hit him, it became the final straw and she realised she couldn't trust Dan with her son and she left him.http://www.brooksidesoapbox.co.uk/ Family in Focus - The Gordons ==References== Morrissey, Dan Morrissey, Dan ","title":"Dan Morrisey"},{"id":"7456734","text":"David Purdham (born June 3, 1951) is an American character actor who has appeared in approximately one hundred films, television series and theatre productions throughout his career. ==Career== Purdham was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas.

The original team played from 1915‚Äì1925. They evolved from being an amateur to a semi-pro team and are one of the earliest sports organizations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Yellow Jackets played primarily in the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA). After winning the USAHA Championship in 1924 and 1925, the Yellow Jackets were sold to attorney James Callahan and soon became the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Hockey League. However, after the demise of the Pirates in 1930, a second club (founded by the owner of the original club), debuted in the IHL as a professional entity, before reverting to an amateur club in 1934. The team would finish its run in the EAHL, before finally folding in 1937. ==Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets I== After a career in local politics, Roy Schooley, a former hockey referee in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, founded the Yellow Jackets as an amateur hockey team in 1915. As with all American teams of this era, the Yellow Jackets fell under the jurisdiction of the International Skating Union. For 6 years, the club played in independent competitions. In late October, 1920, the United States Amateur Hockey Association was formed, with Yellow Jackets officials Schooley and W.S. Haddock serving as co-founders and respectively acting as the league's secretary-treasurer and president. The Yellow Jackets played exhibition games against other USAHA clubs in its inaugural season before joining the league full-time in 1921. ===\\"Pittsburgh's Canadians\\"=== The Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets won the USAHA title in 1923‚Äì24 According to former sports reporter Paul Sullivan, who covered hockey for much of his life for the Pittsburgh Gazette-Times, the USAHA wasn't a completely amateur league. Sullivan noted that even though the USAHA was called an amateur league, \\"They didn't come down from Canada because they thought Pittsburgh was a nice place.\\" This leads one to believe that money was paid out to top players in the league. The eastern teams of USAHA soon imported Canadian players, to add to their rosters of local players. In 1923, Schooley had invited Lionel Conacher, a future Hall of Famer, to come to Pittsburgh and officiate games in February 1923, \\"to see if the crowd would take to him\\". Schooley then asked Conacher to play with the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets in a four-game series against his former team, the Toronto Aura Lee hockey team, and against the Hamilton Tigers. Conacher impressed the Pittsburgh fans by scoring 11 of the Yellow Jackets' 23 goals in the four games. Conachar then, under the guidance of Roy Schooley, transformed the Yellow Jackets line-up to an almost Canadian team. Schooley then used his connections in the Pittsburgh media to promote Conachar to the city's hockey fans. After seeing how well the fans took to Conacher, Schooley made him the team‚Äôs captain, and asked him to invite a number of his friends to play for the Yellow Jackets. These players included Harold Cotton, Hib Milks, Harold Darragh, Rodger Smith, Duke McCurry, \\"Tex\\" White and goalie Roy Worters. Dick Carroll, who had coached the Toronto Arenas to the Stanley Cup in 1918, was appointed the team's coach once Conacher and his teammates arrived in Pittsburgh for the 1923‚Äì24 season by Schooley. However the use of Canadian players drew criticism, with the Boston- based teams leading the charge. In one instance, the Boston Herald questioned why: \\"Boston hockey ‚Ä¶ [was] hooked up with Pittsburgh at all‚Ä¶ [After all] the best hockey in Boston is played by our own boys ‚Ä¶ [and Pittsburgh hockey] ‚Ä¶ is played mainly by a bunch of traveling mercenaries, who practically all are of Canadian birth and training.\\" Some circles also referred to the Yellow Jackets as \\"Pittsburgh‚Äôs Canadians\\". These imported players joined current Yellow Jackets players Rennison Manners, and Herb Drury, who had just won a silver medal as a member of the U.S. Olympic hockey team. ===Championship era: 1924 and 1925=== In the Yellow Jackets' opening game at the Duquesne Gardens, Conacher scored a hat trick. The Yellow Jackets posted a 15-5-0 record for the 1923-24 season, to earn first place in the league's Western group. Pittsburgh then defeated the critical Boston Athletic Association to win Fellowes Cup 4 games to 1 in playoffs. A Boston newspaper, the Boston Traveller, on January 29, 1924, termed the Yellow Jackets \\"a wonder team\\" and another account referred to Conacher as \\"Canada‚Äôs Wonder Athlete\\". The trio of Rodger Smith, Conachar and Roy Worters was part of Pittsburgh‚Äôs \\"stonewall defense.\\" The Yellow Jackets were so dominant by 1925 that they spun off another Pittsburgh team, named the Fort Pitt Hornets, who played in the Eastern Division. Rennison Manners, who was a player-coach and manager of the Yellow Jackets up until the 1922-23 season, when they were only a .500 club, still played for the team during the 1923-24 season, however the following season he joined crosstown the Fort Pitt Hornets. In their 1924-25 season, the Yellow Jackets finished their regular season with a 15-3-2 first season half record for first place in the Western Group, followed by a 10-8-2 second half record for second place in the west. The Yellow Jackets would go on to defeat their cross-town rivals, the Fort Pitt Hornets, at the Duquesne Gardens, and win their second Fellowes Cup, four games to none. ===The Pittsburgh Pirates and the NHL=== The Yellow Jackets stopped playing after the USAHA folded at the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season. When Schooley encountered financial problems he sold the team to James Callahan, a lawyer from Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville. Callahan was granted an NHL expansion team and simply transferred the Yellow Jackets into the NHL as his expansion club keeping the entire roster of the Yellow Jackets intact. Schooley wanted to keep the rights to the \\"Yellow Jackets\\" name per the sale of the club, so Callahan had to rename the team when it entered the NHL. He choose Pittsburgh Pirates, stealing the name from the baseball club, something the new NFL team would also do eight years later. Callahan kept the Yellow Jackets black and yellow uniforms. He simply modified the \\"P\\" logo on the front and had a word mark arched over the \\"P\\" that read \\"Pirates\\". Because of this, the NHL club wore a black and yellow color combination before the Major League Baseball team did who at the time were red, white, and blue. The Pirates made it to the Stanley Cup semifinals within a year. The Pirates were also barely nudged out of the playoffs. In 1926, the playoff series was just two games long, with total goals deciding the issue. The Pirates, who finished third in the seven-team NHL, lost to the Montreal Maroons, 3-1, in the opener in Pittsburgh and tied, 3-3, in Montreal. The Maroons' 6-4 edge in goals gave them the series and they went on to win the 1926 Stanley Cup. Among the Jackets-turned-Pirates were two Hockey Hall of Famers‚ÄîLionel Conacher and goalie Roy Worters. The Pirates would operate from 1925 until 1930. ===Season- by-season record=== Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes {  - !

Shortly afterwards, Schooley applied for an expansion franchise in the International Hockey League. He gave the team the name of \\"Yellow Jackets\\" which he still had to the rights to. The team competed in the IHL for only two seasons. The revived 1930-31 Pittsburgh Yellow JacketsIn 1932, the Yellow Jackets served as a farm team for the Chicago Black Hawks who often took several of their key players in mid-season.The Yellow Jackets relied on several unknown amateur players, Carl Lehto and Jack Tuten, when the team left the IHL for the 1934-35 season. Before a March 1932 game against the Buffalo Bisons, Pittsburgh's Doc Romnes was recalled to Chicago to aid the team in their NHL title chase. Yellow Jackets players Gus Giesebrecht, left, and Byron McDonald at the Duquesne Gardens in 1937. This left the Yellow Jackets' coach, Charlie Reid to constantly change his forward lines. Also in 1932, The Yellow Jackets were purchased by Pittsburgh theater chain owner, John Harris. However the Yellow Jackets were having financial problems, despite the support Pittsburgh fans gave them, leaving some doubt as to whether the team would operate in 1932-33. On August 22, 1932, it was reported that the defunct Pittsburgh Pirates would be returning to the NHL for the upcoming season. The news put the Yellow Jackets in limbo, since the Pirates still held territorial rights and could deny the team permission to operate. However the trust company that owned the Jackets had the right to deny the NHL team the right to play at Duquesne Gardens. However the optimism was short-lived and on October 1, 1932 the Pirates formally suspended operations. During all this, the Yellow Jackets remained dormant and did not play at all from 1932 through 1934. In 1934 they were reactivated, but as an independent playing various exhibition games against other clubs. The club would return to league play when, On October 29, 1935, the Montreal Gazette reported that the Yellow Jackets had joined the Eastern United States Amateur Hockey League, with the New York Rovers. During the team's final three seasons of play, Frank Brimsek served as the team's goaltender. Brimesk would go on to win 252 games in goal, which gave him the record for winningest American-born netminder. His record would stand until February 15, 1994, when Tom Barrasso and the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins, defeated the Winnipeg Jets, 5-3, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. The Yellow Jackets had a hand in providing Pittsburgh with another professional hockey team, the Pittsburgh Shamrocks. The idea for the Shamrocks team came about when Yellow Jackets' owner, John Harris, and Charles King, president of the International American Hockey League, met in Pittsburgh to discuss Pittsburgh‚Äôs possible entrance into the league in the fall. The meeting resulted in the establishment of the Shamrocks and established that the Gardens' ice time would be split by the new IHL team and the Yellow Jackets, who became the newest members of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. During his tenure as owner of the Yellow Jackets, John Harris made two notable decisions. First, on March 31, 1936, he hired, Sonja Henie, 24-year-old Norwegian figure skater to perform before a Yellow Jackets‚Äô game, leading to the creation of the Ice Capades. Then, on October 4, 1936, Harris purchased the Detroit Olympics and moved the team to Pittsburgh, where they were renamed the Pittsburgh Hornets. Some players from the Yellow Jackets and Shamrocks players then joined the Hornets. After the 1936/37 season, the club would fold. ===Season-by-season record=== Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes { cellpadding=5 - bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\" !

The Yellow Jackets wore yellow wool jerseys with a \\"P\\" on the front of their jerseys in 1924. The wool jerseys featured black felt lettering would become the Pirates first set of jerseys. The team used the Pittsburgh's city crest emblems on the uniform sleeves. John McMahon, a sports writer for the Pittsburgh Press once referred to the color of the home jerseys as a \\"dingy mustard yellow.\\" When the Yellow Jackets evolved into the City's first NHL team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, the color scheme followed. In fact when the City's second NHL team, the Pittsburgh Penguins wanted to change their uniform colors from blue and white to black and gold, a move protested by the Boston Bruins, the Pirates-Yellow Jackets jerseys were showcased as precedence for the move. ==Prominent players== The following Yellow Jackets players are enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame: *Frank Brimsek (1966) *Lionel Conacher (1994) *Gordie Drillon (1975) *Roy Worters (1969) ==See also== * List of Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets players * Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL) ==References== Category:Ice hockey teams in Pittsburgh Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1915 Category:Ice hockey clubs disestablished in 1937 Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Pennsylvania Yellow Jackets Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets Category:Eastern Hockey League teams Category:International Hockey League (1929‚Äì1936) teams Category:United States Amateur Hockey Association teams Category:1915 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1937 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets"},{"id":"7456741","text":"Mathews Tuya is a tuya in northcentral British Columbia.

Its territory includes all of Singapore. Its current archbishop is the Most Reverend Monsignor William Goh Seng Chye, DD, STL. Archbishop Goh took over the Archdiocese on 18 May 2013, after Pope Francis accepted the resignation of his predecessor Archbishop Nicholas Chia Yeck Joo. The Cathedral of the Good Shepherd is the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Singapore. As an exempt diocese, the archdiocese is not a part of an ecclesiastical province, but comes under the direct jurisdiction of the Holy See. The archdiocese is a member of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. ==History== The Roman Catholic Church in Singapore was initially under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Malacca,Diocese of Malacca  Original Catholic Encyclopedia which was established on 4 February 1558 as a suffragan (other being Diocese of Cochin) to the Archdiocese of Goa. The diocese of Malacca was transferred to the Vicariate Apostolic of Ava and Pegu in 1838 and then the Vicariate Apostolic of Siam in 1840. In 1841, the Church was placed under the jurisdiction of the Vicariate Apostolic of Western Siam that was erected from the Vicariate Apostolic of Siam. Initially called the Vicariate Apostolic of Western Siam, the name was changed to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Malay Peninsula and finally the Vicariate Apostolic of Malacca-Singapore. In 1888, the Church was once again placed under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Malacca when the Diocese was revived. The Diocese of Malacca was raised to the rank of an archdiocese in 1953. In 1955, the Archdiocese of Malacca was split and an ecclesiastical province was formed in its place comprising the Archdiocese of Malacca-Singapore as the metropolitan see and the Diocese of Kuala Lumpur and Diocese of Penang as suffragan dioceses. In 1972, the Archdiocese of Malacca-Singapore was split into the Diocese of Malacca-Johor and the Archdiocese of Singapore with the Archdiocese of Singapore coming under the direct jurisdiction of the Holy See. From 1838 to 1981, there was dual jurisdiction situation in Singapore, one tracing authority from the Vicariate Apostolate of Siam down to the present Archdiocese of Singapore and the other with the authority from the Portuguese Mission first from the Archdiocese of Goa and then the Diocese of Macau. This was a legacy of the padroado pronouncement in the 16th century. Dual jurisdiction was ended in 1981, when the Portuguese Mission handed over St Joseph's Church to the Archdiocese of Singapore and, thus, the whole island of Singapore was brought under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore. ==OrdinariesDiocese of Malacca=== * (1558‚Äì1576) Jorge de Santa Luzia, O.P. * (1579‚Äì1601) Jo√£o Ribeiro Gaio * (1604‚Äì1612) Cristov√£o da S√° e Lisboa, O.S.H. * (1613‚Äì1632) Gon√ßalvo (Gonzalo) da Silva * (1637‚Äì1638) Ant√≥nio do Ros√°rio, O.P. **Sede vacante (1637‚Äì1691) * (1691‚Äì1701) Antonio a Saint Theresia, O.F.M. * (1701‚Äì1738) Emmanuel a Santo Antonio, O.P. * (1738‚Äì1743) Antonio de Castro * (1746‚Äì1748) Miguel de Bulh√µes e Souza, O.P. * (1748‚Äì1760 Geraldo de S√£o Jos√©, O.P. **Sede vacante (1760‚Äì1782) * (1782‚Äì1785) Alexandre da Sagrada Familia Ferreira da Silva, O.F.M. **Sede vacante (1785‚Äì1804) * (1804‚Äì1815) Francisco de S√£o D√¢maso Abreu Vieira, O.F.M. ** Sede vacante (1815‚Äì1838) ** S√© suprimida (1838‚Äì1841) ===Vicariate Apostolic of Malacca-Singapore=== * (1841‚Äì1844) Bishop Jean-Paul-Hilaire-Michel Courvezy (Vicar Apostolic of Siam from 1834 to 1841) * (1845‚Äì1871) Bishop Jean-Baptiste Boucho * (1871‚Äì1877) Bishop Michel- Esther Le Turdu * (1878‚Äì1888) Bishop Edouard Gasnier ===Diocese of Malacca=== * (1888‚Äì1896) Bishop Edouard Gasnier * (1896‚Äì1904) Bishop Ren√©-Michel-Marie F√©e * (1904‚Äì1933) Bishop Marie-Luc-Alphonse-Emile Barillon * (1934‚Äì1945) Bishop Adrien Pierre Devals * (1947‚Äì1953) Bishop Michel Ol√ßomendy ===Archdiocese of Malacca=== * (1953‚Äì1955) Archbishop Michel Ol√ßomendy ===Archdiocese of Malacca-Singapore (Metropolitan See)=== * (1955‚Äì1972) Archbishop Michel Ol√ßomendy ===Archdiocese of Singapore=== * (1972‚Äì1976) Archbishop Michel Ol√ßomendy * (1977‚Äì2000) Archbishop Gregory Yong Sooi Ngean * (2001‚Äì2013) Archbishop Nicholas Chia Yeck Joo * (2013‚Äìpresent) Archbishop William Goh Seng Chye ==Statistics (2012)== *Roman Catholic population: 303,000 (including PRs, Expats and Immigrants) *Churches: 32 *Seminary: 1 *Diocesan Priests: 71 *Religious Priests: 71 *Religious Brothers: 36 *Religious Sisters: 166 *Candidates for the Priesthood: 12 *Baptisms: 3521 *Catechumens: 895 *Marriages: 977 *Charitable and Social Institutions: 18 *Educational Institutions: 54 Schools, 53,124 Students ==Key office holders== Following the appointment of Archbishop William Goh, a new group of key appointment holders were appointed to assist him.

The team currently plays in Primera B Nacional, the second level of the Argentine football league system. Due to a financial crisis, the club was named \\"Club Atl√©tico Campana\\" between 1993 and February 2000, after which it reassumed its original and current name. ==History== At the end of the 1950s the \\"D√°lmine SAFTA\\" factory, sited in the city of Campana, Buenos Aires Province, founded a social club with the purpose to allow its employees to practise sports. The club was named \\"Villa D√°lmine\\", establishing its first location on Chiclana street of that city. The color adopted for the club was violet, therefore the club and its fans have been familiarly called \\"El Viola\\" (an expression derived from the word \\"violeta\\" in Spanish) since then. In 1960 D√°lmine joins Liga Campanense de F√∫tbol with a team mostly formed by workers and administrative employees of the company. One year later Villa D√°lmine affiliated to Torneo de Aficionados (currently Primera D), becoming champion that same year and subsequently promoting to the upper division, Primera C. The team scored the most goals and received the fewest goals during that season. The 1963 team that won the Primera C title. That first champion was coached by Jos√© \\"Perico\\" Marante and the most frequent line-up was: Masuelli, Guti√©rrez, Coronel, Dopazo, Chiarle, Monteiro, Buri√°n, Men√©ndez, Montero, Ces√°reo, Torello and Moyano. Most of those players were professionals unlike Primera D players, who usually are amateur and they had other jobs to make a living. In 1963, two years after promoting to Primera C, Villa D√°lmine won another title, promoting to Primera B Metropolitana. Because two teams had finished the season sharing the first position with 52 points each, a playoff series had to be played in order to determine a champion. The rival was All Boys and D√°lmine won the series, after the first game ended 0‚Äì0 and the second was won by El Viola 1‚Äì0. Peruvian Jorge Ben√≠tez, a skilled player, was the most notable footballer of that team. He is also regarded by fans as the best D√°lmine player ever. The 1975 squad that won another Primera C championship, scoring 113 goals. That team was nicknamed \\"The Netherlands of the C\\" Despite of all those achievements, Villa D√°lmine would be relegated soon, although the team would win another Primera C title in 1975, returning to B Metropolitana (simply \\"Primera B\\" by then). The team made a great campaign that season, totaling 60 points in 36 matches played. Because of its bright play and high accuracy, it was nicknamed \\"The Netherlands of the C\\", making a comparison with the renowned 1974 Dutch football team led by Johan Cruyff, which was also known as \\"The Clockwork Orange\\" because of the extraordinary playing style they had showed on the field. In the 1980s D√°lmine was relegated to Primera C although the squad would promote to Primera B in 1984. During those times the club created a Football School, with the purpose of promoting the practise of football among the children from Campana. Some of them would take part of the first team in successive years. In 1985 the club was split into two institutions, so \\"Villa D√°lmine\\" became a club focused exclusively on football. On the other hand, \\"Club Siderca\\" was established to host the rest of social and recreation activities. During the 1990s the club changed its name to \\"Atl√©tico Campana\\", which was rejected by most of the fans, so the institution brought its name back in February 2000. In 2002 D√°lmine won another title, the Primera C Apertura, with a roster formed by players such as Pedro Troglio, Roberto Monserrat, Ra√∫l Cardozo, Mario Pobersnik and Jos√© Basualdo, nicknamed \\"Los Cinco Magn√≠ficos\\" (\\"The Magnificent Five\\"). In 2003 Basualdo retired as a player becoming team's coach. ==Honours== *Primera B (1): 1988‚Äì89 *Primera C (3): 1963, 1975, 1982, 1995‚Äì96, 2011‚Äì12 *Primera D (2): 1961 ==External links== *Web del Viola *Subcomisi√≥n del Hincha Category:Association football clubs established in 1957 Category:Football clubs in Buenos Aires Province Category:1957 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Villa D√°lmine"},{"id":"7456748","text":"Calcifying odotogenic cyst is a benign odontogenic tumor of cystic type most likely to affect the anterior areas of the jaws. It is most common in people in their second to third decades but can be seen at almost any age. On radiographs, the calcifying odontogenic cyst appears as a unilocular radiolucency (dark area). In one-third of cases, an impacted tooth is involved. Histologically, there are many cells that are described as \\"ghost cells\\", enlarged eosinophilic epithelial cells without nuclei. == Signs and symptoms == Relative incidence of odontogenic cysts. Calcifying odontogenic cyst is labeled at right. It is a rare type of cyst and can occur at any age, mostly between second and third decade of life. The diameter ranges from 2 to 4 cm and swelling pain may be present. Intrabony expansions may produce hard bony expansion and may perforate cortical bones. It can also extend to soft tissue. It can present asymptomatically. ==Pathogenesis== Epithelial lining has ability to induce formation of dental tissues in adjacent connective tissue wall. ==DiagnosisRadiographic features=== Unilocular, multilocular or mixed radiolucency can be seen. Irregular calcifications may be seen in some cases. === Histology === In general, the epithelium seen is of stratified squamous type and is 5‚Äì8 cells thick. Additionally, focal areas of stellate reticulum like cells are seen and near the basement membrane ameloblast-like cells may be seen. Each type of calcifying odontogenic cyst shows special features of which there are three types: 1)Type 1A. Ghost cells and dentinoid are seen. 2)Type 1B. Formation of calcified tissues in the lumen of the cyst wall showing dystrophic calcification. Proliferation of tissues is similar to an Ameloblastic Fibroma. 3)Type 1C. Ameloblast-like proliferation in the connective tissue and lumen of the cyst may be seen. ==Treatment== The standard treatment of calcifying odontogenic cyst is enucleation and curettage.

He then went back to Egypt and was ordained to the Coptic Catholic priesthood in 1960. After being pastor for a year at Fikryak, Minya, he returned to Rome and obtained a licentiate in Theology in 1962 and in Scripture in 1964. He was Professor of Sacred Scripture in the Maadi seminary from 1964. He worked with a group of Protestant and Orthodox specialists preparing an Arabic translation of the Bible. He became Bishop of Minya, Egypt in 1977, a post he held until he resigned in 2002. On 30 March 2006 he was elected Patriarch of Alexandria of the Copts, after Patriarch St√©phanos II Ghattas retired from the patriarchal office in March 2006, because of age. Patriarch Antonios Naguib received ecclesiastical communion from Pope Benedict XVI on 7 April 2006. In April 2010, Patriarch Antonios Naguib tendered his resignation to the Holy Synod upon reaching the legal age of 75. But the Holy Synod refused the resignation and asked him to continue his duties as head of the Coptic Catholic Church. Pope Benedict named him Relator General (recording secretary) of the October 2010 special assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the Middle East, held at the Vatican. Naguib was made a cardinal patriarch at the consistory of 20 November 2010, and until the creation of Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi as Cardinal on 24 November 2012 was the only incumbent Eastern Catholic Patriarch eligible to vote in a papal conclave. On 13 October 2011, after attacks by the military against peaceful protesters in Cairo and reported denials of Christian building permits, Cardinal Naguib urged fraternity among Egyptians of different faiths and expressed his confidence in the country's transitional government.Leader of Egypt's Catholics urges fraternity after attack In February 2012, and after the Patriarch's health deteriorated, the oldest in the ranks of bishops, Kyrillos William, the Bishop of Assiut, was assigned as assistant to the patriarch to run the church in case of incapacity of the Patriarch. Cardinal Naguib had suffered a stroke on 31 December 2011 suffering from a partial paralysis and has difficulty in pronunciation. Although his health improved slowly with the help of physiotherapy, he had to undergo further brain surgery. He resigned as Patriarch on 15 January 2013. Naguib was one of the cardinal electors at the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. During the procession and oath taking prior to the doors being shut, Patriarch Naguib was bareheaded and wore predominantly black vestments proper to the Coptic Catholic Church since he was one of the four cardinal-electors during that conclave who were from outside the Latin Church. The other three cardinal-electors from outside the Latin Church were Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, Syro-Malabar Major Archbishop George Alencherry, and Syro-Malankara Major Archbishop Baselios Cleemis and they too, wore distinct vestments proper to their respective churches.

Charnley won a bronze medal at the 1954 Commonwealth Games and went on to become undefeated British lightweight champion (1957‚Äì63), Commonwealth lightweight champion (1959‚Äì62) and European lightweight champion (1960‚Äì61).Dave Charnley. Telegraph (4 March 2012). Retrieved on 2017-09-11. ==World champion title fights== Charnley made two unsuccessful world title challenges against his arch-rival Joe 'Old Bones' Brown. He was stopped by Brown on a cut eye in Houston, Texas, in 1959 and was narrowly out-pointed in a controversial 15 round bout in London on 18 April 1961. Ring Magazine called this second bout \\"Fight of the Year.\\" Many say Charnley should have won.Joe Brown ‚Äì Undisputed lightweight champion 1956‚Äì62. secondsout.com The decision is still contested by Charnley and most British writers. He eventually defeated Brown in six rounds in a non-title fight in Manchester on 25 February 1963. ==Early life and career== Dave was born in Dartford, Kent, to Scottish parents from Craigneuk, Lanarkshire. His uncle was footballer Sam Charnley who had a spell at Dartford F.C. and secured jobs locally for family members who also moved to Kent. Before becoming a boxer, Charnley worked at Vickers Engineering Crayford as a boilermaker. He started competing in 1954 and turned professional the same year. He became British Lightweight Champion at 21 by outpointing Joe Lucy, another southpaw, on 9 April 1957, but in his first attempt later that year to win the Empire title on 9 July he was beaten on points by Willie Toweel. In 1958 he met future world champion, Puerto Rican Carlos Ortiz at Harringay Arena where he lost on a 10 round decision. In a return match against Willie Toweel on 12 May 1959, Dave Charnley punched with such authority that the championship changed hands in the 10th round, when Dave won by a knockout. Dave challenged for the World Title at Houston, Texas on 2 December 1959, against Joe Brown but was forced to retire in the fifth round with a badly damaged eye. He fought Brown again, this time in London on 18 April 1961, and lost a bitterly contested duel that many fans thought he had won. By way of consolation Dave knocked out Brown in six rounds in a third meeting, but only after the American had lost his World title. Before his second bout with Brown, Dave added the European Lightweight Title to his British and Empire Titles, when he met Mario Vecchiatto of Italy on 29 March 1960. He forced Vecchiatto to retire in the 10th round. On 20 November 1961 Dave Charnley met challenger David \\"Darkie\\" Hughes of Wales for his third title and stopped the Welshman in 40 seconds, including the count, a record win in the British Lightweight class. In 1962 Dave went to Jamaica, losing his Empire title on a close point verdict to Bunny Grant, but he won his Lonsdale Belt outright by defeating Maurice Cullen in Manchester on 20 May 1963. That year he also forfeited his European title. As there were no worthy challengers in the Lightweight division, to continue boxing, it was necessary for Dave to move up to the Welterweight division. He was then game enough to challenge the World Champion, Emile Griffith, but took a bad beating and the fight was stopped in round eight. Dave retired from the ring in 1964 as unbeaten British Lightweight Champion. ==Aggressive fighting style== Charnley had a powerful build and large forearms and was often compared to the \\"Toy Bulldog\\" Mickey Walker, but he also had good tools. He had double and triple hooks and was a true scrapper with plenty of bottle. His trademark was an aggressive attacking style. Quiet-spoken and an introvert outside the ropes, his self-effacing modesty was no public relations gimmick; Charnley was merciless once ring battle commenced. Inside the ring he was a furious brawler who gave and took brutal punishment. Only Joe Brown stopped him on cuts and until his last fight, only welterweight great Emile Griffiths stopped him from going the distance. Charnley ended his career fighting welterweights and was a really tough opponent for anyone. ==After the ring== Charnley estimated his ring earnings to have been in excess of ¬£400,000, a considerable sum at the time, and when he retired from boxing in 1964 he took a different direction in his life and opened and operated hair salons, which became quite profitable for him. He later moved into building and property refurbishments buying land and building estates in the Dartford area. He established the offices of his company in Regent Street, where the business expanded through restorations of hotels and other projects. His various business enterprises generated him a lot of money late in his life. Charnley's biographer, James Kirkwood, said: \\"It may be a clich√©, but it really was true of Dave that you never heard anybody say a bad word about him.\\" Charnley died of lung cancer on 3 March 2012, at the age of 76.John Rawling (4 March 2012).

His last posting before being sent to Vietnam was at Payne Field just south of Everett, Washington. ==Cushman's Death== On September 25, 1966, Cushman was the pilot of the #2 F-105D in a flight of three that was conducting an afternoon combat mission to bomb a railroad bridge located on the northeast railroad line approximately north-northeast of K√©p Air Base and northeast of Bac Giang, Lang Son Province, North Vietnam. Cushman's call sign was \\"Devil 2.\\" The flight arrived in the target area on schedule and immediately checked in with the airborne battlefield command and control center (ABCCC). Devil flight was directed to begin their bomb runs on the bridge. At 15:30 hours, Devil Lead made his pass on the target followed in order by the rest of his flight. After pulling off the target, Cushman radioed that he had been hit by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fire and he had a fire warning light. Devil 3 asked if he could steer, Cushman replied he had \\"lost his stability, augmentation and aircraft power.\\" Devil Lead observed 37 mm AAA fire bursting to the left and rear of Devil 2 (Cushman), and told Cushman to break right. Lead then saw his afterburner light and simultaneous torch of flames coming from the right aft section of Devil 2 (Cushman)'s aircraft. Devil Lead then observed Cushman's aircraft break into several burning parts. He also saw Cushman's ejection seat arcing up and to the front of the falling wreckage. They could not find his body anywhere. Because of the rough landscape it was nearly impossible for anyone to gain radio control. Cushman was immediately listed Missing in Action, this was later changed to presumptive finding of death. On November 6, 1975, Cushman was officially declared dead. Surviving family members were spouse Carolyn Cushman and son Colin Cushman. ==Memorials== Grand Forks Central High School and Red River High School named the football stadium they share after him, Cushman Field. Every fall, the football game between the two schools is called the Cushman Classic. His picture is displayed in GFC's gymnasium, and his name is mentioned in almost every Hall of Fame cabinet. His wife said after being informed of her husband's status: \\"Somewhere in Vietnam he's running the biggest race of his life. It's like watching a race in which Cliff is running - only you can't see the finish tape. He's in excellent physical condition. Cliff also has a very deep faith in God. What better combination could there be?\\" ==References== * *Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office -- Additional case details on CUSHMAN, CLIFTON EMMET from the US Government database on Personnel Missing in Southeast Asia -- Vietnam War * * Category:American male hurdlers Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1959 Pan American Games Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for the United States Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:1938 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Kansas Jayhawks men's track and field athletes Category:Sportspeople from Grand Forks, North Dakota Category:Track and field athletes from North Dakota Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Aerial disappearances of military personnel in action Category:American military personnel killed in the Vietnam War Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Medalists at the 1960 Summer Olympics ","title":"Clifton Cushman"},{"id":"7456840","text":"Relative incidence of odontogenic cysts.

After completing his tenth grade of school he focused on his dream of following in his father's footsteps by joining the military, participating in sharpshooting and sports before joining the in August 1937. After graduating from the 1st Chkalov Military Aviation School of Pilots in November 1940 he was posted to the 169th Reserve Aviation Regiment, based in Voronezh. Shortly before the German invasion of the Soviet Union he transferred to the 231st Long-Range Bomber Aviation Regiment in May 1941. == World War II == Shortly after entering combat in July 1941, Osipov transferred to the 81st Long Range Bomber Aviation Regiment in August 1941, which was honored with the guards designation and renamed to the 5th Guards Long Range Bomber Aviation Regiment one year later. He soon accomplished difficult missions, destroying a heavily- protected targets and difficult to find targets with direct hits, including; a crossing on the Dnieper river on 24 September 1941, a crossing through the Miusskaya estuary on 3 October 1941, and the headquarters of an enemy military unit on 23 October 1941. On 20 May 1942 we was nominated for the Order of Lenin for having flown 115 sorties on the Il-4, which included 90 night missions and five deep into enemy-controlled territory, totaling 304 flight hours and dropping nearly 150 tons of bombs on targets. However, the award nomination was changed by Alexander Golovanov to a nomination for the title Hero of the Soviet Union in addition to the Order of Lenin, resulting in Osipov receiving his first gold star on 20 June 1942. He continued to tally more sorties, and was promoted to the position of deputy squadron commander before being nominated for a second gold star on 30 November 1943. Upon receiving notice that his family died in the siege of Leningrad in 1944, he became enraged and flew with increased zeal. Shortly after Soviet Long-Range Aviation units were consolidated into the 18th Air Army in December 1944, Osipov transferred to the 26th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment, where he flew as a squadron commander, participating in the bombing of Konigsberg and Berlin. During one mission over Konigsberg, a 100-kilogram bomb from another aircraft fell through the wing of his B-25 bomber, leaving a large hole in the wing. Despite the damage to the wing, fuselage, and engine, Osipov carefully flew the plane to an airfield and made a successful emergency landing. By the end of the war he totaled 412 sorties, more than any other Soviet long-range aviation pilot. Of the 412 sorties flown on the Il-14 and B-25, 382 were at night.–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–ê–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è –∏ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–∏–∫–∞¬ª ‚Ññ 3 –æ—Ç 1972 –≥–æ–¥–∞ (—Å—Ç—Ä. 38-39) == Postwar == Until the reorganization of Soviet long-range aviation in April 1946, Osipov remained a squadron commander in the 26th Guards Bomber Regiment. He then transferred to the 199th Guards Bomber Regiment, where he was also squadron commander, but left in November 1948. Before returning to the regiment one year later he graduated from the Higher Officer Flight and Tactical School of Long-Range Aviation. In October 1950 he transferred to the 250th Guards Bomber Regiment, but less than two years later he transferred to be a deputy squadron commander in the 238th Guards Bomber Regiment, where he remained until leaving the military in April 1945 for health reasons. During his career he flew the B-25, Li-2, and Tu-4.

Butler is most famous for leading an irregular military unit known as Butler's Rangers on the northern frontier during the American Revolutionary War. The original barracks were constructed in 1778 on the banks of the Niagara River, and were torn down during the construction of Fort George in 1800. The building currently referred to as Butler's Barracks was constructed in 1818, and the site at one time was quite extensive, being first used by the Indian Department, and later by the British military. It is one of several military sites in the town along the Niagara River: * Fort George, Ontario * Navy Hall * Fort Mississauga The barracks was one of several buildings in the Commons area of the town: * Commissariat Officer's Quarters and Store (1839) - a -storey house home to the British Commissariat Department * Junior Commissariat Officer's Quarters (1817) - used as Headquarters Staff, a mess or dining facility for officers, and a residence * Commandant's Quarters * Indian Council House (1812?) - became Hospital in 1822 * fuel yard * storehouses * Gunshed (1821) The British passed control of the grounds to the Canadian Army in 1871 and they became the training grounds and home to the 2nd Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. From October 1917 to March 1919, the Polish Army trained at Niagara Camp in an area known as Camp Kosciuszko. These men would go on to fight alongside the French Forces in Haller's Army, also known as the Blue Army. After the war the barracks that were constructed at Camp Kosciuszko were used until the 1960s. It is now part of the Fort George National Historic Site. The Lincoln and Welland Regimental Museum is located in Butler's Barracks. Exhibits include displays and artifacts from the 18th through the present, and include uniforms, weapons, medals, photographs, regimental band instruments, and other memorabilia. ==See also== * Navy Hall * Fort Niagara * Fort George, Ontario * Fort Mississauga ==Bibliography== *P.Valasek, Haller's Polish Army in France Chicago 2006 ==References== * Butler's Barracks * Butler's Barracks at the Friends of Fort George Category:Military history of Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Niagara-on-the-Lake Category:National Historic Sites in Ontario Category:Tourist attractions in the Regional Municipality of Niagara Category:History of the Regional Municipality of Niagara ","title":"Butler's Barracks"},{"id":"7456881","text":"Agios Spyridonas (Greek meaning Saint Spyridon) may refer to the following places in Greece: *Agios Spyridonas, Boeotia, a village in Boeotia *Agios Spyridonas, Corfu, a beach and nature reserve in Corfu *Agios Spyridonas, Phocis, a village in Phocis *Agios Spyridonas, Pieria, a village in Pieria ","title":"Agios Spyridonas"},{"id":"7456882","text":"Volcanic Creek Cone is a small cinder cone northeast of Atlin in northwestern British Columbia.

Its headquarters are located in Caracas, Venezuela. According to the 1999 Constitution, its renovation is a national priority. The new infrastructure which has been added includes the first new above-ground train line constructed in Venezuela for more than 70 years, the Ezequiel Zamora Mass Transportation System. Named after the soldier Ezequiel Zamora, it was inaugurated on October 15, 2006, by President Hugo Ch√°vez. ==History== Historically, much of the original Venezuelan network was designed in the 19th century in the Federalist period and under the administration of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, in order to open up the country for trade and earn foreign revenues. However, the first licenses were signed and revoked nine times before the first stretch was operating. The first lines connected Caracas to its port of La Guaira and then the Great Venezuela Railway to Valencia in the 1870s‚Äì80s. Notable engineers associated with its original development include: John Grover and Robert Fairlie. Some of the later lines were designed by William A. Welch and Thomas Kavanagh (Caracas subway). Rail transport in Venezuela was neglected and went into a major decline from the 1950s, with bus and road transport taking its place, just Caracas maintaining its of subway system and local railway. In 1975 was devised by the \\"Instituto Ferrocarriles del Estado\\" (IFE) a National Plan Ferrocarrilero that began in Maracaibo and reached Barquisimeto-Puerto Cabello-Valencia-Caracas-Cua, following from Cua to Barcelona and Ciudad Bolivar-Ciudad Guayana. The company \\"Saprolate-Tranarg\\" made all aerial photographic surveys and the Plan was approved by the then President Luis Herrera Campins, but in the 1980s the Plan IFE was blocked for economic reasons after the devaluation of the Bolivar in 1983 and then was finally canceled with the Caracazo of 1989. Only the section Caracas-Cua was maintained as a budgeted project (and was made, being inaugurated in 2006 by President Hugo Chavez) . The 1999 constitution was a signal for a major reinvestment in the infrastructure of the state. Much of the renovation of the current Venezuelan railway network is still at the planning stage, with some already constructed and the rest to be built over a period of about 30 years. == Railway network == Map based on IFE mapshttp://www.ife.gob.ve/Sistema_ferroviario/#lineaope of lines operating (purple), lines being restored (blue) and lines under construction (green) as at 2017 The Venezuelan network includes of rail in standard gauge.Reference The network covers the populated and production areas in the country, and is managed by IFE under various Regional Development Plans. There are also connections between Colombia and Brazil that link to the other countries of South America, although traffic in the border areas are affected by foreign policy and defence strategy. IFE is the sole operator of trains in Venezuela, however, they have created various railway names assigned to different regions throughout the country. { class= ! Railway !! Branch !!

The fort today consists of a box-shaped brick tower and historic star- shaped earthworks. The all-brick fort was built from 1814-1816 during the War of 1812, to replace nearby Fort George. It was built on a foundation of brick and stone salvaged from rubble left after retreating United States forces burned the nearby town of Newark (as Niagara-on-the-Lake was known then) in December, 1813. It would help in the defence of Upper Canada the following year, as part of a regional network that included Fort George, Navy Hall, and Butler's Barracks. However, the fort wouldn't be completed until after the war. ==HistoryEarlier use=== Before the fort was built, the site was used by at least three Native American tribes: the Neutral (15th century); Seneca (late 17th century); and Mississauga (18th century). In 1804, a lighthouse was erected at the site, which had become known as Mississauga Point. This was the first lighthouse on the Great Lakes, but was dismantled in 1814 to make way for Fort Mississauga, which incorporated stone from the lighthouse. Mississauga Point Lighthouse was designated a National Historic Site in 1937, and is today commemorated within the walls of Fort Mississauga by a plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.Mississauga Point Lighthouse, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaMississauga Point Lighthouse, National Register of Historic Places ===Building the fort=== After the British captured Fort Niagara on 19 December 1813, Captain Runchey's Company of Coloured Men was attached to the Royal Engineers to help repair the fortifications at the mouth of the Niagara River.http://www.warof1812.ca/artificers.htm Whether race influenced the authorities' choice for this duty is not known, as one engineer later reported: \\"When I visited the Niagara Frontier ‚Ä¶ I found that a corps of Free Men of Colour had been raised ‚Ä¶ but had been turned over to that of the Engineers, any necessity for this I never could learn, but it seems to have been the fashion in Canada to heap all kinds of duties upon the latter.\\" Toward the spring of 1814 the company was ordered to construct a new fort on the Canadian shore, dubbed Fort Mississauga, materials for which were obtained from the ruins of the nearby town of Newark. With the American navy now controlling Lake Ontario, this work was crucial to the security of British forces in the Niagara Peninsula, one British officer later noting \\"Mississauga ‚Ä¶ is a pretty little Fort, and would prevent vessels coming up the river.\\" These duties consequently precluded the Coloured Corps' participation in the Niagara campaign that summer, even during the subsequent Siege of Fort Erie, where British forces desperately lacked trained engineer troops. ===Use of the fort=== Fort Mississauga in use, c. 1860s. The British Army was stationed at the fort from 1813 to 1855, followed by the Canadian Militia, which used it as summer training ground beginning in the 1870s, then during both World Wars and the Korean War. A golf course was laid out nearby in the late 1870s. Today, Niagara-on-the-Lake Golf Course surrounds the site, but public access is permitted via a walking path, with a warning to look out for golfers, who have the right of way. The path starts at the corner of Front and Simcoe streets. The block house is the only building of the original fort to survive with all other buildings destroyed or dismantled. The interior of the blockhouse is closed, but has wooden staircases leading to some upper windows.

The house is located in Kingston, Ontario. Bellevue House was constructed around 1840 for Charles Hales, a wealthy Kingston merchant who profited greatly from the prosperous decade of the 1830s. The house, which is located at 35 Centre St. between Union and King streets, is one of the first examples of Italian Villa architecture in Canada. Sir John A. Macdonald moved into the house with his wife Isabella Clark and their son John Alexander in 1848. ==Architecture and layout== Bellevue House is notable for the non-symmetrical Italian Villa style of its architecture. Features of Italianate architecture at Bellevue House include an L-shaped layout with two wings extending from a square central tower; different varieties and shapes of windows and roof gables; and multiple small balconies. The house has three main floors, but is further divided by seven levels. The first floor is notable for the very large drawing room, containing a parlour piano manufactured in London, England in about 1820 and two oil paintings whose subjects are unknown. The first floor of the house also contains the formal dining room and a room that is currently interpreted as Isabella's bedroom (though this would likely have been a morning room for other families living at Bellevue in the 19th Century). A kitchen is located in the cellar. The basement contains both a storage area (used for the storage of fruits, vegetables, and preserves) and a laundry room. On the top floor of the house, several rooms are interpreted. These include a guest room, maid's bedroom, nursery, study, dressing room and master bedroom. The observation floor of the central tower looks out upon Lake Ontario. ==HistoryOccupancy by John A. Macdonald, 1848‚Äì1849=== Much of what is known about the stay of Sir John A. Macdonald and his family at Bellevue has been gleaned from both general historical knowledge of the 19th century in Kingston and from five letters that Macdonald himself wrote while living at Bellevue. The Macdonalds rented Bellevue from Charles Hales in the hope that the fresh air of what were then the outer suburbs of Kingston would assist in Isabella's recovery. The experiment was a failure, and Isabella did not recover from her chronic malady. In addition to this burden, tragedy further struck the young family when their first-born son, John Alexander Jr., died in the house a month after his first birthday. As a lawyer and a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, Macdonald was often absent from Bellevue House, visiting his second law office in Toronto or attending parliamentary sessions in Montreal. Isabella's health continued to fluctuate during this time. Despite her frail condition, however, Macdonald reports in his letters that she kept a watchful eye on the servants and the day-to-day affairs of the house. While entertaining was expected of prominent lawyers and politicians like Macdonald in the 19th century, Isabella's frail condition prevented her from fulfilling this part of her responsibility as a politician's wife. For this reason, the drawing room and the back parlour would likely not have been used while the Macdonald family stayed at Bellevue House. The only guest that is known to have stayed at Bellevue House between 1848 and 1849 while the Macdonalds lived at the villa was Lt. Col. John Clark, an officer in the British military who was Isabella's brother and a trusted member of the family. Given the expenses associated with renting Bellevue and the fact that Isabella continued to suffer from chronic illness, the Macdonald family moved from Bellevue House in 1849 to another house in Kingston. At the time of the move, Isabella was pregnant with their second child, Hugh John Macdonald. ===Family home and restoration, 1849‚Äì1967=== Bellevue circa 1891 Bellevue House continued to be inhabited by middle-class Kingston families until it was purchased by Parks Canada in 1964 with the intention of commemorating Sir John A. Macdonald. Significant renovations had been performed in the intervening century, including the addition of electricity, indoor plumbing, and central heating, as well as changes to the floor plan. Parks Canada historians and archaeologists did significant research to determine how the home would have appeared in the late 1840s, and it was restored both indoors and outdoors to its original colours and wallpaper patterns. Furnishings from the 1820s‚Äì1840s were purchased from antique dealers in Kingston and surrounding areas to lend as much authenticity as possible to the site. The site also received a few items that would have belonged to Macdonald in the late 1840s, including a portion of his library. Bellevue House opened as a \\"national historic park\\" in 1967, to coincide with the centennial of Canadian Confederation.

It may be either truly neoplastic or merely hamartomatous (an odontoma). In neoplastic cases, it may be labeled an ameloblastic fibrosarcoma in accord with the terminological distinction that reserves the word fibroma for benign tumors and assigns the word fibrosarcoma to malignant ones. It is more common in the first and second decades of life, when odontogenesis is ongoing, than in later decades. In 50% of cases an unerupted tooth is involved. Histopathology alone is usually not enough to differentiate neoplastic cases from hamartomatous ones, because the histology is very similar. Other clinical and radiographic clues are used to narrow the diagnosis. == Classification == An ameloblastic fibroma is classified by The World Health Organisation as a benign mixed odontogenic tumour (1). It develops from the dental tissues that grow into teeth. During human development, embryonic cells of ectoderm and mesenchyme produce epithelial and ectomesenchyme tissues. These proliferate and mature into ameloblasts and fibrous connective tissue (3), and ultimately teeth. Ameloblastic fibromas contain both of these tissues, and its name is derived from them. It is a neoplasm, meaning it is a mass of abnormal growth of cells or tissue. If the mass contains hard dental tissues they are known as odontoma, which are not true neoplasm, but classified as hamartomatous lesions (4) Epidemiology and prevalence Odontogenic tumours are uncommon, with a prevalence of around 2% (5) and only 1-2% of these are ameloblastic fibromas (6). As they are rare, there is limited evidence available, mostly case studies. There is a slight male predilection, developing most commonly within the first two decades of life. They are often identified when tooth development is complete with the posterior mandible being the most common site. Although benign, ameloblastic fibromas that occur in later decades as well as a third of treated ameloblastic fibromas can recur and around 11% may undergo malignant transformation, though this figure is questioned (4, 7). Odontoma are the most prevalent of the odontogenic tumours in the early decades and ameloblastic fibromas diagnosis should be considered. == Histopathology == The histopathology of ameloblastic fibromas resembles the stages of normal tooth development (6). These mixed lesions consist of histologically distinct epithelial and mesenchymal tissues (7). The epithelial tissue resembles dental lamina and enamel organ tissues, while the mesenchyme resembles the dental papilla (9). The epithelial component features strands which branch and join together, or anastomose. This results in knots of differing mass, resembling islands in a loose stroma (9). Cells in the strands tend to be cuboidal, but where budding occurs from the strands the knots resemble tooth caps. The bud-cap stage of normal development shows ameloblasts forming palisades of columnar cells adjacent to a starry-like, loosely formed layer known as stellate reticulum (8). However, the pattern of budding strands is distinctive from normal development (9). The Ameloblastic Fibroma epithelial tissue could be confused with the most common odontogenic tumour, the Ameloblastoma. Therefore the mesenchymal component is histologically important in differential diagnosis (9). The mesenchymal stroma in normal development is a rich myxoid connective tissue. It gives rise to the dental follicle which encapsulates the developing tooth (8). In Ameloblastoma the stroma is mature, often fibrous. This is distinct from the mesenchymal element of Ameloblastic Fibroma which is devoid of collagen (1). The Ameloblastic Fibroma stroma remains primitive, undifferentiated, cell-rich and myxoid (9). Rarely, it may contain granular cells. However, it should be noted this may also be observed in a hyperplastic dental follicle, and therefore other histological and radiological diagnostic features should be observed (5). The malignant ameloblastic fibroma will have features of malignant transformation such as mitotic figures in either epithelial or mesenchymal tissue (8). There is a resemblance to fibrosarcoma. The malignant Ameloblastic Fibroma histologically shows transformation in the mesenchymal component with increased cellularity, accompanied by a progressive reduction in epithelial tissue (4) . == Clinical Features == Ameloblastic fibroma is a rare benign mixed epithelial and mesenchymal odontogenic tumour as it contributes to approximately 2% of all odontogenic tumours. It often occurs in the first or second decade of life. Ameloblastic fibroma usually appears as painless swelling of the jaw in the posterior region of the mandible. It can be associated with an impacted tooth and it might impede eruption of other teeth. The lesion can be asymptomatic when it is small and most are incidental findings of routine dental radiographic imaging, etc. == Radiographic Features == Radiographically, ameloblastic fibroma has a variable appearance. It can appear as a unilocular lesion with smooth, well-defined margin when smaller. However, it can be multilocular when it is enlarged. It can be mistaken as dentigerous cyst as the lesion is often associated with an impacted tooth. == Treatments == As ameloblastic fibromas are rare and the literature regarding treatment is limited there is controversy regarding treatment approach. A conservative treatment strategy, such as enucleation and curettage, is usually sufficient for small ameloblastic fibromas. However, extensive and aggressive lesions may require radical treatment such as in older patients who have likely high recurrence tendency. If the ameloblastic fibroma is small, ‚Äòreconstruction‚Äô will not be required. Conservative treatment usually involves enucleation and thorough curettage of the affected area alongside extraction of the affected teeth. Enucleation is the removal of an organ or tumor in such a way that it comes out clean and whole. Thorough enucleation is important as there are reports of a high recurrence rate (Trodahl reported a 36.4% recurrence rate). Immediate reconstruction is required post enucleation and curettage of the affected area. Some patients may require reconstruction which can include a full thickness bone graft. This treatment allows the patient to retain oral function and as much facial structure as possible. Occasionally, more radical treatment is required with excision of the tumour with a margin of healthy tissue. This kind of treatment also requires reconstruction of the affected area, with bone grafts often being the preferred choice for remodelling. This is done when the tumour is large or is deemed to have a high chance of malignant transformation. In some cases the fibroma may envelop a nerve and may have to be removed too. Implants in compromised areas filled with a bone graft can prove useful for functional and aesthetic stability. Implant retained prosthesis can be placed and can make a vital overall functional and masticatory difference. Close radiographic and clinical follow up is important to identify recurrence and malignant transformation. ==See also== * Ameloblastoma ==References== *Kahn, Michael A.

Part I was first broadcast in the United States on 7 March 1999 and then on the British television channel BBC2 on 25 March 1999. The second part was broadcast the same day as the first part in the US and on 1 April for the British broadcast. The first part was written by Doug Naylor and the second was written between Naylor and Paul Alexander. Both parts were directed by Ed Bye. The two parts (The second in particular) are often collectively cited as among the weakest examples of a Red Dwarf story in the show's history. http://www.ganymede.tv/2018/02/the-pearl-poll-results/ ==PlotPart One=== The story begins with Lister and Rimmer being escorted to Captain Hollister's office. Hollister is with Mr Ackerman on whom they played a prank. The prank in question concerned Ackerman and a truth serum; Hollister reports him \\"rushing onto the bridge this morning, apologising for being late, saying he had been having 'jiggy jiggy' with the science officer's wife and hadn't allowed enough time to change out of his Batman costume.\\" Their punishment pits a team of their choice against Ackerman and the prison guards in a game of Basketball. After the first half, the crew are losing badly. Lister's team consists of him, Rimmer, the Cat, Kryten, and Kochanski. Rimmer and Lister tell the others that their opponents' half-time drinks had been spiked with a sort of Viagra. This is noticed in the next half, with the crew winning against the guards, who are forced to bend over to cover their erections. The next day, Rimmer and Lister are back in Hollister's office, caught out after the captain also sampled the drink. They are given 'spud duty' for the next two weeks. Spud duty involves peeling a mountain of potatoes. That evening, Rimmer finds out that Lister has been using Bob the Skutter to get things Lister wanted, such as curry and lager. Rimmer asks Lister to get them a programmable virus which they can set to eat potato skins, meaning they won't have to do any work. Meanwhile, Kryten, Kochanski, and the Cat are taken to another ship on a Canaries mission to find an earlier team that went missing. They find a team with a strange 'time wand' which is found to download and digitize time. Kryten realises this could hold the key to getting out of prison, as they could use it to hit Red Dwarf with a two-year download so it would appear they've served their sentences. He wipes the memory of the previous Canaries team and sneaks the time wand back. On the first day of spud duty, Bob delivers the virus to Lister. Not only are the potatoes skinned; the duo's clothes and hair are also removed. They are taken to Hollister, stark naked. Hollister tells them that they'll sent to the hole if they do anything wrong again. In shaking their superior's hand the virus is passed on and Hollister quickly begins losing his hair and clothes. He sentences them to two months in the hole. Rimmer and Lister enter the hole (a small square cell) to find they're sharing it with a fellow prisoner called Birdman and his sparrow, Pete. However their stay in the hole isn't long as Bob the Skutter breaks them out. The three walk through Red Dwarf to find everyone frozen except Kryten, Kochanski, and the Cat who are waiting for them in the cargo bay (with Kryten using the time wand to restore Lister and Rimmer's hair). However it seems the excitement of escaping has killed Pete, and Birdman is upset to lose his friend. Kryten decides to use the time wand to restore Pete to life, however it goes badly wrong as Kryten accidentally reverses the sparrow's evolution and turns it into a massive Tyrannosaurus. Birdman is promptly eaten, before Pete starts to chase the Dwarfers. ===Part Two=== While running from the dinosaur he accidentally created Kryten throws the Time Wand to Bob the Skutter, who then gets eaten by Pete. After hiding in a room next to the cargo bay, Lister consults Holly who gives them the expert opinion of \\"You're finished\\". Meanwhile, in Pete's stomach, Bob presses buttons on the Time Wand which unfreezes everybody else on the ship. The Dwarfers then decide to make a cow curry with roughage in it. After Pete eats it, they find out it was too hot for him. All the yelling from Pete gets the others caught. Lister and Rimmer are, for the fourth time, seen returning to Hollister's office. They find out that all of Hollister's favourite foods have been eaten by Pete who then burped, farted, vomited, and had a diarrhoea attack on the people who were trying to capture him (with Bob being ejected this way, landing on the Captain's head). Hollister returns to them the Time Wand and tells them to turn Pete back into a bird. The Canaries are deployed to attempt to turn Pete the Dinosaur back into Pete the Sparrow. Then two inmates, Kill Crazy and Baxter, stop Lister and Rimmer and steal the Time Wand and accidentally put their bodies on a separate timeline than themselves. Kill Crazy and Baxter end up trying to beat Rimmer and Lister up but nothing happens to them. Meanwhile, Kochanski finds out Kryten made a penis to get out of being classified as a woman. But his penis, Archie, had run away. Eventually, they find out Archie had ended up in the Cat's pocket and woke up, trying to burst out of his Canary uniform. Rimmer and Lister are back in Hollister's office. He tells them to recover the Time Wand. But before they leave, the effects of being beaten up by Baxter and Kill Crazy catch up with them, and they are beaten out of the office. It turns out Kill Crazy and Baxter, unable to use the Time Wand, had turned themselves into gorillas. They recover the Time Wand and bring back Birdman and evolve Pete back into a sparrow. Rimmer tells Lister to destroy the Time Wand and he does. Walking back, they notice a dinosaur egg, leading Rimmer to tell Lister to repair the Time Wand. After they fail to that, two legs break out of the egg's shell. The egg runs into a lift up to a floor Hollister's in. When the lift returns, the egg is broken. Hollister, enjoying a massage, is licked by the dinosaur who then roars. For the sixth time, Rimmer and Lister are back in Hollister's office. He can only communicate with paper with writing on it. Rimmer and Lister appear to be given a year in the Hole, but as they leave, Hollister reveals that the isolation is for him. The episode ends with Hollister showing them a piece of paper with \\"See ya in twelve months\\" written on it. ==Production== Originally titled \\"Captain's Office\\", the episode was re-written as a two parter. Cut scenes from \\"Cassandra\\" were included in the episode. The Pete dinosaur was created using computer generated software similar to the ones in Jurassic Park. The CG Pete dinosaur was combined with interactive animatronic parts; a huge foot and head were produced for close up shots. Some scenes had to be cut from the final episode, which included a fight sequence between the Pete dinosaur and Kryten. Another scene cut was Rimmer's attempt to compose an ode to the Captain. Mac McDonald appeared as Captain Hollister, Graham McTavish played Governor Ackerman, Andrew Alston played Canary Mex, Holly Earl as Young Kochanski, Perri Michael as Young Cat, Ricky Grover played Baxter, Shend played Warden Knot, Ian Masters appeared as Birdman, and Jake Wood as Kill Crazy. ==Cultural references== *During the basketball game, the song Stomp! by The Brothers Johnson is played. *Bob The Skutter whistles the tune from The Great Escape. *Kryten's penis Archie wriggles up Cat's top and then bursts out, in a scene parodying Alien. ==ReferencesExternal links== * \\"Pete: Part 1\\", * \\"Pete: Part 1\\", * \\"Pete: Part 1\\", Category:Red Dwarf VIII episodes Category:1999 British television episodes Category:Dinosaurs in television Category:Television episodes about time travel ","title":"Pete (Red Dwarf)"},{"id":"7457016","text":"An odontoma, also known as an odontome, is a benign tumour linked to tooth development. Specifically, it is a dental hamartoma, meaning that it is composed of normal dental tissue that has grown in an irregular way. It includes both odontogenic hard and soft tissues. As with normal tooth development, odontomas stop growing once mature which makes them benign . The average age of people found with an odontoma is 14. The condition is frequently associated with one or more unerupted teeth and is often detected through failure of teeth to erupt at the expected time. Though most cases are found impacted within the jaw there are instances where odontomas have erupted into the oral cavity. ==Types== There are two main types: compound and complex. * A compound odontoma consists of the four separate dental tissues (enamel, dentine, cementum and pulp) embedded in fibrous connective tissue and surrounded by a fibrous capsule. It may present a lobulated appearance where there is no definitive demarcation of separate tissues between the individual \\"toothlets\\" (or denticles). Compound odontomas are usually found in the anterior maxilla and are less than 20mm in diameter. * The complex type is unrecognizable as dental hard and soft tissues, usually presenting as a radioopaque area with varying densities indicating presence of enamel. It generally appears in the posterior mandible and can grow to be several centimetres in size. In addition to the above forms, the dilated odontoma is an infrequent developmental alteration that appears in any area of the dental arches and can affect deciduous, permanent and supernumerary teeth. Dens invaginatus is a developmental anomaly resulting from invagination of a portion of crown forming within the enamel organ during odontogenesis. The most extreme form of dens invaginatus is known as a dilated odontoma. There are two types of lesions which are regarded as complex odontomas with a prominent soft tissue component resembling ameloblastic fibroma. With similar presentation and treatment outcomes to complex odontomas. These lesions were poorly defined previously and were removed as separate entities from the WHO Classification of Head and Neck Tumors (2017). They are now regarded as developing odontomas as histologically there are no differences. * Ameloblastic fibrodentinoma with only dentine present * Ameloblastic fibro- odontoma with both enamel and dentine present == Histopathology == Odontomas are from mixed epithelial and mesenchymal components which are required for tooth development, producing enamel, dentine, cementum and pulp tissue. == Presentation == Odontomas usually asymptomatic and present as chance radiographic finding, often during childhood and adolescence when teeth do not erupt within the expected timeframe. Occasionally odontomas can erupt into the mouth and this can lead to acute infections resembling a dental abscess. During the early stage of odontoma development; radiolucent flecks develop. At a later stage of development a dense radioopaque mass becomes visible as enamel and dentine forms. == Aetiology == Overall aetiology is unknown. However, odontomas have been related to local trauma, inflammatory and/or infectious processes, hereditary anomalies such as Gardener's syndrome and Hermanns syndrome, odontoblastic hyperactivity, mature odontoblasts and dental lamina remnants (Cell Rests of Serres). === Gardner's syndrome === Gardner's syndrome is a subtype of Familial adenomatous polyposis. The clinical presentation of this syndrome includes multiple odontomas. This condition has a high risk of malignancy through adenocarcinoma of the bowel. == Treatment == Most common treatment is surgical enucleation due to well-encapsulated nature of odontomas allowing separation from surrounding bone. If left untreated can result in a dentigerous cyst. ==Epidemiology== Odontomas are thought to be the second most frequent type of odontogenic tumor worldwide (after ameloblastoma), accounting for about 20% of all cases within this relatively uncommon tumor category which shows large geographic variations in incidence. According to the same article discussion, statistics might appear misleading as most of the odontomas within high-occurrence ameloblastoma- areas, are well-likely left unreported due to hospital management problems and asymptomatic clinical picture of odontoma.

The abbot is either Innocent or Nicholas. Abbey as it is today. This taken from the reverse angle of the above sketch. Inchaffray Abbey was situated by the village of Madderty, midway between Perth and Crieff in Strathearn, Scotland. The only traces now visible are an earth mound and some walls on rising ground which once (before drainage) formed an island where the abbey once stood (the surrounding marshes known for eels). ==History== Folk etymology has the name Inchaffray taken from the Gaelic innis abh reidh (island of the smooth water), but the earliest attested form of the name is the Latin Insula missarum (island of the masses), mass in Gaelic being oifrend and Welsh offeren, thus island of the offerings. A charter of Jonathan, Bishop of Dunblane, refers to the place \\"qui uocatur lingua Scottica Inche Affren\\"Inchaff. Liber, no. 10. (=\\"which is called in the Gaelic language Inche Affren\\") and comparative usage shows that Insula Missarum was taken as a translation, e.g. \\"Sancti Johannis evangeliste de Inchefrren\\"Inchaff. Liber, no. 1. and \\"sancto Johanni apostolo de Insula Misserum\\".Inchaff. Liber, no. 2. seals from Inchaffray Abbey, late 13th century, now in the British Museum.British Museum Collection A priory was created on an existing Culdee site by Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn and his first known wife Maud d'Aubigny in around 1200. Dedicated to their memory of their first-born son Gilchrist, to the Virgin Mary, and to John the Evangelist, the abbey was granted to the Augustinians of Scone Abbey. The charter survives, and also names the churches of Saint Cathan of Abruthven, Saint Ethernan of Madderty, Saint Patrick of Strogeith, Saint Makkessog of Auchterarder, and Saint Bean of Kinkell.Ewart et al., p. 471 The details of the earlier establishments are not certain, but a church dedicated to John the Evangelist is attested in about 1190. Gille Brigte's new priory became an abbey in about 1220. Inchaffray was patronised both by the Earls of Strathearn and by the Scottish kings. In 1275 a tithe of real income was assessed on all religious houses to fund a crusade, at which time Inchaffray had an income of 246 pounds per annum, fourth among Augustinian houses, exceeded only by St Andrews, Scone and Holyrood. In time the abbey's lands and dependent churches stretched across Scotland, as far away as Uist in the west and Balfron in the south. The abbey ordered the digging of the Pow of Inchaffray, a nine-mile drainage ditch, to improve nearby marshland. Abbot Maurice of Inchaffray carried the relics of Saint Fillan to bless the Scots army before the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Abbot Laurence Oliphant, who came from a notable Strathearn family, was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1514. By 1561 Inchaffrey's fortunes had declined, its income being assessed at ¬£667, third lowest of the Augustinian abbeys in Scotland included in the levy. With the Scottish Reformation under way, Inchaffray had been turned into a secular lordship for a member of the Drummond family in 1556. James VI visited James Drummond at Inchaffray on 5 October 1601.John Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 879. The property later passed to the Earls of Kinnoull. Much of what remained of the abbey was destroyed in 1816 when a road was driven across the site. Today a single gable-end wall stands in private property, although it is visible from the road.

She was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2006.Vatican News Service ==Early life== Venerini was born in 1656 in Viterbo, Italy, then a part of the Papal States. Her father, Goffredo, originally from Castelleone di Suasa, Ancona, after having completed his medical studies at Rome, moved to Viterbo where he practiced at the major hospital of the city. He became noted for his work. From his marriage to Marzia Zampichetti, of an ancient family of the city, four children were born: Domenico, Maria Maddalena, Rosa and Orazio. According to her first biographer, Father Girolamo Andreucci, S.J., Venerini made a vow to consecrate her life to God at the age of seven. At age twenty, though, Rosa had questions about her own future and chose to accept an offer of marriage; her fianc√©, however, died shortly after this.Patron Saints Index \\"Rose Venerini\\" In the autumn of that year, on the advice of her father, Venerini entered the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine, where her aunt was a member of the monastery. She remained in the monastery for only a few months, however, because the sudden death of her father forced her to return to care for her mother.\\"St. Rose Venerini\\", FaithND Her brother, Domenico, then died at 27. A few months later, worn out by grief, her mother also died.\\"St. Rose Venerini\\", Saint of the Day, Franciscan Media In the meantime, Rose's sister Maria Maddalena married. There remained at home only Orazio and Rosa, by now 24 years old. Rosa began to gather girls and women of the area in her own home to recite the rosary. After Venerini's first contacts with the Dominican friars at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Oak Tree, near Viterbo, she chose to follow the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola under the direction of the Jesuits, especially Father Ignatius Martinelli, who became her spiritual director. Under his guidance, she saw the need to dedicate herself to the instruction and Christian formation of young On August 30, 1685, with the approval of the Bishop of Viterbo, Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, and the collaboration of two friends, Gerolama Coluzzelli and Porzia Bacci, Rosa left her father‚Äôs home to begin her first school. The first objective of this foundress was to give poor girls a complete Christian formation and to prepare them for life in society. Without great pretense, Rose opened the first public school for girls in Italy. == Expansion == The initial stages were not easy. The three teachers had to face the resistance of clergy who considered the teaching of the catechism as their private office. But the harshest suspicion came from conformists who were scandalized by the boldness of this woman of the upper middle class of Viterbo, who had taken to heart the education of ignorant girls. With her characteristic strength, Rosa continued on the path that she had undertaken. The same pastors recognized the moral improvement that the work of education generated among the girls and their mothers. The validity of this initiative was acknowledged and its fame went beyond the confines of the diocese. Cardinal Marcantonio Barbarigo, Bishop of Montefiascone, had the insight to understand the Viterbo project and he invited Venerini to come to his diocese to give advice on the administration of schools in the diocese and to help train teachers. From 1692 to 1694, she opened ten schools in Montefiascone and the villages surrounding Lake Bolsena. The cardinal provided the material means and Rosa made the families aware of the value of education for their daughters, trained the teachers, and organized the schools. When she had to return to Viterbo to attend to her first school, Venerini entrusted the Montefiascone schools and the teachers to the direction of a young woman, St. Lucia Filippini, in whom she had seen particular gifts of mind, heart and spirit and whom the cardinal had entrusted with the leadership of the project in his diocese. Filippini organized the teachers of that diocese as a separate religious congregation known as the Religious Teachers Filippini.Filippini Sisters \\"History\\" After the openings in Viterbo and Montefiascone, other schools were started throughout the region of Lazio. Venerini was invited to Rome in 1706 to establish a school, but the attempt was a failure, which caused her to wait six long years before regaining the trust of the authorities. On December 8, 1713, with the help of Abbot Degli Atti, a friend of the Venerini family, Rosa was able to open a school in the center of Rome, at the foot of the Campidoglio. On October 24, 1716, the Sisters received a visit by Pope Clement XI, accompanied by eight cardinals, who wanted to observe the lessons. At the end of the morning he addressed these words to Rose: ‚ÄúSignora Rosa, you are doing that which we cannot do. We thank you very much, because with these schools you will sanctify Rome ‚Äù. From that moment on, governors and cardinals asked for schools for their areas. The duties of the foundress became intense, consisting of travels and hard work, interwoven with joys and sacrifices for the formation of new communities. Wherever a new school sprang up, in a short time a moral improvement could be noted in the youth. ==Death and legacy== Rose Venerini died at the community at the Basilica of San Marco in Rome on the evening of May 7, 1728. By then, she had opened more than 40 schools. Her remains were entombed in the nearby Jesuit Church of the Ges√π, so loved by her. In 1952, on the occasion of her beatification, they were transferred to the chapel of the General Motherhouse in Rome. The Sisters went to the United States in 1909, primarily to help the Italian immigrants to that country, establishing the first day care centers in many cities of the Northeastern United States. They served in Switzerland from 1971 to 1985 and the congregation has since extended its apostolic activity to other lands: India, Brazil, Cameroon, Romania, Albania, Chile, Venezuela and Nigeria. Venerini was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2006. Her feast day is May 7.\\"St. Rosa Venerini\\", Catholic News Agency ==See also== * Saint Rose Venerini, patron saint archive ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1656 births Category:1728 deaths Category:People from Viterbo Category:Italian educators Category:Italian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Beatifications by Pope Pius XII Category:Christian female saints of the Early Modern era Category:Canonizations by Pope Benedict XVI Category:17th-century Christian saints Category:18th-century Christian saints Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints ","title":"Rose Venerini"},{"id":"7457065","text":"√Önden Som Gjorde Oppr√∏r (lit.

Philip., Lewis R. Eversole, and George P. Wysocki. Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. 2nd ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby, 2002. 152-53. As a myxoma, this tumor consists mainly of spindle shaped cells and scattered collagen fibers distributed through a loose, mucoid material.Cawson, R. A., and E. W. Odell. Cawson's Essentials of Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine. 8th ed. Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 2008. 145-46. ==Signs and symptoms== Odontogenic myxomas have been found in patients ranging in age between 2 and 50 years, however, they are most commonly diagnosed in young adults (specifically between 25 and 35 years of age).Wood, Norman K., Paul W. Goaz, and Norman K. Wood. Differential Diagnosis of Oral and Maxillofacial Lesions. 5th ed. St. Louis: Mosby, 1997. 342-43.McDonald, Ralph E., David R. Avery, and Jeffrey A. Dean. Dentistry for the Child and Adolescent. 8th ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby, 2004. 163-64. The mandible is more likely to be affected than the maxilla. The region between the molar and premolar is the site of the most common occurrence for multilocular lesions while the anterior portion of the mouth favors a smaller, unilocular variety. Patients afflicted with an odontogenic myxoma generally notice a painless, slowly enlarging expansion of the jaw with possible tooth loosening or displacement. As the tumor expands, it frequently infiltrates adjacent structures. Maxillary lesions frequently enter the sinuses while mandibular tumors often extend into the ramus. ==Diagnosis== Radiographically, odontogenic myxomas appear most commonly as multilocular radiolucencies with ill-defined borders, though unilocular cyst-like tumors can occur, especially when associated with impacted teeth or when discovered in childhood.White, Stuart C., and M. J. Pharoah. Oral Radiology: Principles and Interpretation. 6th ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby/Elsevier, 2009. 385-87. Ideally, the septa that cause the multilocular feature are thin and straight, producing a tennis racket or stepladder pattern. In reality, the majority of the septa visible in the tumor are curved and coarse, causing a \\"soap bubble\\" or \\"honeycomb\\" appearance, though locating one or two straight septa can aide in the diagnosis of this tumor. ==Treatment== Small unilocular lesions have been successfully treated with enucleation and curettage followed by chemical bone cautery. Multilocular tumors exhibit a 25% recurrence rate and, therefore, must be treated more aggressively. In the case of a multilocular myxoma, resection of the tumor with a generous portion of surrounding bone is required.

It was not formally recognised by the Soviets at that time, but the Georgian government eventually managed to obtain de facto recognition from the White leaders and the Allies. Following an abortive Bolshevik coup in Tbilisi and a failed attempt by the Red Army units to penetrate Georgia in early May 1920, Vladimir Lenin's government agreed to sign a treaty with Georgia and to recognise its independence de jure if the Mensheviks formally undertook not to grant shelter on Georgian territory to any force hostile to Soviet Russia. Many Georgian politicians, including Foreign Minister, Evgeni Gegechkori regarded that clause as an infringement of Georgia's sovereignty and supported the rejection of the Russian terms. However, Georgian Prime Minister Noe Zhordania was anxious above all to secure for Georgia international recognition and so agreed to then. The treaty was finally signed in Moscow by Grigol Uratadze for Georgia and Lev Karakhan for Russia on May 7, 1920. == Provisions == In the treaty's first two articles, Russia unconditionally recognized the independence of Georgia and renounced all interference in its internal affairs: > Article I: Proceeding from the right, proclaimed by the RSFSR, of all > peoples to free self-determination up to and including separation from the > State of which they constitute a part, Russia unreservedly recognizes the > independence and sovereignty of the Georgian State and voluntarily renounces > all the sovereign rights which had appertained to Russia with regard to the > People and Territory of Georgia. Article II: Proceeding from the principles > proclaimed in Article I above of the present Treaty, Russia undertakes to > refrain from any kind of interference in the affairs of Georgia.Beichman, A. > (1991). The Long Pretense: Soviet Treaty Diplomacy from Lenin to Gorbachev, > p. 165. Transaction Publishers. . Georgia, in turn, undertook to disarm and intern all armed units belonging to any organization that was purported to have constituted a threat to the Soviet government and to surrender such detachments or groups to Moscow. In a secret supplement, that was not made public ay the time, the Mensheviks made an even greater concession, allowing a local branch of the Russian Bolsheviks to function freely in Georgia: > Georgia pledges itself to recognize the right of free existence and activity > of the Communist party... and in particular its right to free meetings and > publications, including organs of the press.Lang, DM (1962). A Modern > History of Georgia, p. 226. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. == Aftermath 1920s=== In spite of brief Menshevik euphoria of the declared diplomatic success, public opinion in Georgia denounced the treaty as \\"veiled subjection of Georgia to Russia\\", as was reported by the British Chief Commissioner Sir Oliver Wardrop. The government was subjected to harsh criticism over the concessions made to Moscow from the parliamentary opposition, particularly from the National Democratic Party. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Moscow had a short-term benefit to Tbilisi by encouraging the reluctant Allied Supreme Council and other governments to recognise Georgia de jure on January 11, 1921. The treaty did not resolve the conflict between Russia and Georgia. Although Soviet Russia had recognised Georgia's independence, the eventual overthrow of the Menshevik government was both intended and planned,Erickson, J., editor (2001). The Soviet High Command: A Military-Political History, 1918-1941, p. 123. Routledge (UK). . and the treaty was merely a delaying tactic on the part of the Bolsheviks,Sicker, M. (2001). The Middle East in the Twentieth Century, p. 124. Martin Sicker. . who were then preoccupied with an uneasy war against Poland.Debo, R. (1992). Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918-1921, p. 182. McGill-Queen's Press. . According to the agreement, the Georgian government released most of the Bolsheviks from prison. They quickly established a nominally-autonomous Communist Party of Georgia, which, under the coordination of Caucasus Bureau of the Russian Communist Party, immediately activated their overt campaign against the Menshevik government and so were rearrested by energetic Interior Minister Noe Ramishvili. That caused protests from the newly-appointed Russian Ambassador Plenipotentiary Sergey Kirov, who exchanged fiery notes with Evgeni Gegechkori. The conflict, never finally resolved, was subsequently used in Soviet propaganda against the Menshevik government, which was accused by Moscow of harassing the communists, obstructing the passage of convoys passing through to Armenia and supporting an anti-Soviet rebellion in the North Caucasus. On the other hand, Georgia accused Russia of fomenting antigovernment riots in various regions of the country, especially among ethnic minorities such as Abkhazians and Ossetians, and of provoking border incidents along the frontier with Soviet Azerbaijan. After nine months of fragile peace, in February 1921, the Soviet Red Army launched a final offensive against Georgia, under the pretext of supporting the rebellion of peasants and workers in the country, put an end to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, and established Soviet Georgia, which would last for the next seven decades. ===1990s and 2000s=== As Georgia was moving towards independence from the Soviet Union, the Georgian government, led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia, addressed the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and stating that \\"the only legitimate framework for relations\\" between Russia and Georgia could be the 1920 treaty. Moscow refused, and Georgia declared Soviet troops in Georgia an occupation force. Parallels have been drawn in modern Georgia between the Georgian-Russian diplomacy in 1920 and the 2000s. In response to indications by several senior Russian diplomats that Moscow wanted to see Georgia \\"a sovereign, neutral and friendly country\\", rather than a member of military alliances such as NATO, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said on October 25, 2007 that neutrality was not an option for Georgia because \\"Georgia signed an agreement on its neutrality in 1920 with Bolshevik Russia and after six months Georgia was occupied\\".Saakashvili Rules Out Georgian Neutrality.

The club is currently playing in the Oman Professional League, top division of Oman Football Association. Their home ground is Al-Saada Stadium, but they also recognize the older Salalah Sports Complex as their home ground. Both stadiums are government owned, but Al-Nasr S.C.S.C. also own their own personal stadium and sports equipment, as well as their own training facilities. Also Al-Nasr is famous for producing some of the greatest and most successful Omani footballers, such as Ali Al-Habsi, Hashim Saleh and Fawzi Bashir. ==History== Al-Nasr S.C.S.C. started off playing in the Al-Haffa district of Salalah organizing specific meetings to play beach soccer. This eventually evolved into something very large. The club was founded on 20 May 1972,under sheikh/ Bakhit Said ALShanfari on the same day as fierce rivals Dhofar S.C.S.C. and was registered on 26 June 2002. As football was their main sport, Al-Nasr shifted to playing on grass fields in order to become a professional club. The club name literally translates from \\"The Victory\\" in the Arabic language. Such a name quite well suites a sports club in the Arab world. A club named \\"Al-Nasr\\" is commonly found in the Middle East. Some clubs with the same name can be found in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Kuwait and Bahrain. In 1972 Al-Nasr was merged with Al-Shate'a team to carry the name of Al-Nasr. With this merge, the club office moved from Al- Haffa region to Al-Jouf region, where the current headquarters of the club is located. In 1986, Al-Nasr competed in the Gulf Club Champions Cup and finished with third place.http://live.sportsgoal.com.om/club-details.aspx?id=16 ‚Äì Al- Nasr places 3rd in 1986 competition. Al-Nasr, along with the neighbors Dhofar have been generally labelled as the front runners of the Omani League, but as seen in the recent seasons, both the clubs performed horribly with Dhofar losing many games, and not going far in the Sultan Qaboos Cup, along with Al- Nasr who even got relegated in the 2010‚Äì11 season. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Al- Nasr settled to the 10th position in the league which was one of their worst performances ever in the Omani League. In the 2009‚Äì10 season also they could make it only to the 7th position in the league and were knocked out by Muscat FC in the Round-of-16 in the Sultan Qaboos Cup. In the 2010‚Äì11 season they again had to fight a relegation battle but this time they couldn't make it and got relegated for the first time to the Second Division league. Then in the 2011‚Äì12 season they secured the 2nd position in the 2nd Division League and got promoted back to the Omani League (First Division). In the 2012‚Äì13 season they bounced back and secured the 4th position in the Omani League. ==Being a multisport club== Although being mainly known for their football, Al-Nasr S.C.S.C. like many other clubs in Oman, have not only football in their list, but also hockey, volleyball, handball, basketball, badminton and squash. They also have various youth football teams competing in Oman Olympic League, Oman Youth League (U-19) and Oman Youth League (U-17). ==Crest and colours== Al- Nasr S.C.S.C. have been known since establishment to wear a full blue or white (Away) kit (usually a darker shade of blue), varying themselves from neighbors Al-Ittihad (Green), Dhofar S.C.S.C. (Red) and Salalah SC (Blue) kits. They have also had many different sponsors over the years. As of now, Kelme provides them with kits. Currently, Jeep and Al-Shanfari Marbles are featured on the team's shirt. ===Logo=== Al-Nasr's logo has been recreated a few number of times. The most recent logo (as shown on this page) was created during the late 1980s or early 1990s, giving the club a more attractive logo, opposed to the older, duller-looking one. Although bearing quite a difference, the influence of the older-logo is still seen when compared to the newer version. Also note that the only scripture of the logo is only written in Arabic, a sign of being an older sports club logo compared to other Omani clubs which usually feature English scripture. ==Honours and achievementsNational titles=== *Omani League (5): :*Winners: 1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81, 1988‚Äì89, 1997‚Äì98, 2003‚Äì04. :*Runners-up: 1982‚Äì83, 1984‚Äì85, 1989‚Äì90 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì00. *Sultan Qaboos Cup (5): :*Winners: 1995, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2017-18. :*Runners-up: 1981, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1999, 2001. *Oman Professional League Cup (1): :*Winners: 2015-16. :*Runners-up: *Oman Super Cup (1): :*Winners: 2018. :*Runners-up: 2002. *Oman First Division League (0): :*Runners-up 2011‚Äì12 ===Youth=== *Sultan Qaboos Cup (U-19) (2): :*Winners 2000, 2001 *Oman Youth League (U-19) (1): :*Winners 1997‚Äì98 *Oman Youth League (U-16) (3): :*Winners 1985‚Äì86, 1990‚Äì91, 1998‚Äì99 ===Honours and achievements (other sports)=== Hockey *Oman Hockey Premier League (1): :*Winners 2008 *Sultan Qaboos Cup (3): :*Winners 2006, 2007, 2014 *National Youth Championship (U-19) (0): :*Runners- up 2007 *Regional Youth Championship (U-19) (3): :*Winners 2000, 2001, 2007 :*Runners-up 2003 *Regional Youth Championship (U-16) (1): :*Winners 2007 :*Runners-up 2008 Table Tennis *National Championship (0): :*Runners-up 2007 *Regional Championship (5): :*Winners 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005 Basketball *National Championship (0): :*Runners-up 2003 *Regional Youth Championship (6): :*Winners 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Handball *Second Division League (1): :*Winners 2005 *National Youth Championship (U-19) (1): :*Winners 2005 *National Youth Championship (U-16) (0): :*Runners-up 2003, 2004 Cycling *Regional Championship (6): :*Winners 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 ==Club performance-International CompetitionsAFC competitions=== *Asian Club Championship : 1 appearance :*1990‚Äì91 : First Round *Asian Cup Winners' Cup : 1 appearance :*1996‚Äì97 : Quarter-Finals *AFC Cup : 4 appearances :*2006 : Quarter-Finals ===UAFA competitions=== *Gulf Club Champions Cup: 2 appearances :*2006 : Group Stage :*2007 : Semi-Finals ==PlayersFirst team squad=== ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- bgcolor=\\"#DFEDFD\\" ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- bgcolor=\\"#DFEDFD\\" ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- bgcolor=\\"#DFEDFD\\" ==PersonnelTechnical staff=== {  - !Position !Name - Head Coach - Goalkeeping Coach  Gaber Al-Bilasy - Team Manager  Hussain Mustahil - Club Doctor  Imad Ahmed - Physiotherapist  Imad Mujahid - } ==ReferencesExternal links== *Al- Nasr S.C.S.C. ‚Äì SOCCERWAY.com *Al-Nasr S.C.S.C. ‚Äì GOALZZ.com Category:Football clubs in Oman Category:Oman Professional League Category:Salalah Category:Association football clubs established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Oman ","title":"Al-Nasr SC (Salalah)"},{"id":"7457195","text":"Ira Nelson Davenport (October 13, 1887 ‚Äì July 17, 1941) was an American track athlete, football and baseball player, and coach.

It was previously described as an adenoid adamantoblastoma, unusual ameloblastoma and a cystic odontoma. Like other odontogenic neoplasms, it is thought to arise from the epithelial element of the enamel origin. It is a typically benign and slow growing, but invasive neoplasm. ==Types== Intraosseous tumors (tumors within the bone) are more common (94%) than extraosseus tumors (6%). It is more common in the posterior mandible of adults, typically in the fourth to fifth decades. There may be a painless swelling, and it is often concurrent with an impacted tooth. On radiographs, it appears as a radiolucency (dark area) and is known for sometimes having small radiopacities (white areas) within it. In those instances, it is described as having a \\"driven-snow\\" appearance. Microscopically, there are deposits of amyloid-like material. The underlying nature of the amyloid-like material is still unresolved. ==Clinical features== Clinically it has two types, the central and the peripheral. The central type of the CEOT occurs in individuals ranging in age from 20 to 60 years. Two- thirds of the lesions are in jaws, more commonly in the molar area with a tendency to occur in the pre-molar areas. It appears clinically to be a slowly enlarging painless mass. In the maxilla it can cause proptosis, epistaxis and nasal airway obstruction. The peripheral type is commonly found in the anterior region of the maxilla and occurs as a soft tissue swelling. ==Histology== Histopathology will reveal prominent intercellular bridges and nuclear changes such as pleomorphism, hyperchromatism and prominent nucleoli. The mitotic figures are rare. Spread throughout the epithelium and connective tissue are spherical amorphous calcifications. Variants include the clear cell CCEOT; whose cells have clear cytoplasms. The incidence is low, with 15 cases of CCEOT reported. However, another study has indicated that approximately 8% of CEOTs contain clear cells. There is one case reported in the literature of a 15-year-old white male with a true cystic variant of CEOT. ==Recurrence== The recurrence rate is 10-15%. Franklin and Pindborg reported a recurrence rate of 14%. It is considered to have a recurrence rate much lower than that of ameloblastoma. Malignant metastasis has been reported. ==See also== *ODAM (gene) *Proteopathy *Tooth development ==References== *Zahid, Arsalan from Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology *Kahn, Michael A.

The traditional snow baby is made of unglazed biscuit porcelain (or bisque) and shows a child dressed in a snowsuit; the suit itself is covered in small pieces of crushed bisque, giving the appearance of fallen snowflakes. Figurines of other characters were also made, including Santa Claus, elves and animals such as penguins and polar bears. The oldest Snow Babies were manufactured in Germany in the 1890s, and were typically either all white with a painted face, or painted in pastel colors. With the onset of World War I, production stopped; when it resumed after the war ended, the snow babies were less finely detailed in their porcelain and finish. In the 1920s, Japanese manufacturers began to produce Snow Baby replicas, though they were generally of a lesser quality than those made in Germany. In the late 1980s an American company called Department 56 began producing a new line of Snow Babies in Taiwan. ==History== Snow Babies were created as reusable cake toppers in the 1890s by Johann Moll, a German confectioner, based on early nineteenth century sugar dolls used as Christmas decorations. They were originally manufactured by Hertwig and Company, but other porcelain factories in Germany began creating the figurines soon after. The release of the Snow Baby figurines coincided with the birth of Admiral Robert Peary's daughter in Greenland while he was on an expedition to the North Pole in 1893. She was the first non-indigenous baby to be born that far north (13 degrees south of the poleRear Admiral Robert E. Peary, US Navy), earning her the nickname \\"snow baby\\" from the Inuit. The public's fascination with Marie and the discovery of the North Pole in 1909 helped popularize the figurines. Snow Babies were initially only sold in Germany, but in the 1900s German manufacturers began exporting them to England and the United States. Between 1900 and 1930, Snow Babies grew in popularity in England where they were used as cake decorations, and the United States where they were featured in women's magazines for use as Christmas decorations. Production of the figurines in Germany was halted during World War I so that the factories could contribute to the war effort, and resumed when the war was over. In the 1920s, Japanese manufacturers began producing reproductions of Snow Babies. Although the Japanese figurines had less detail than the German Snow Babies, they were able to grow a market because of the post-war anti-German sentiment. German manufacturing of Snow Babies stopped again at the start of World War II, and American demand for the product dropped. For a short time after the war was over, Snow Babies were manufactured in the United States and England. However, the figurines were low quality, and the run was unsuccessful. Snow Babies had a resurgence in popularity in 1987, when the American company Department 56 began to manufacture replicas of the original Snow Baby designs. ==Design== Snow Babies are small figurines made from slipcast porcelain depicting a child dressed in a one-piece snowsuit. The hardened porcelain is coated with slip containing grog to imitate the texture of snow, which is then was fired and painted. ===Pre-World War I=== Before World War I, Snow Babies ranged from 5 to 7 inches in size and depicted children participating in winter activities like skiing, ice skating, and sledding. The figurines had highly detailed faces, and the paint was fired onto the porcelain so that the color would be longer lasting. Figurines were made with different pastel colors of grout, and some were left all white except for face painting. Porcelain Snow Baby dolls and jointed figurines were also manufactured, as were Snow Babies attached as decoration on planters, boxes, and candles. ===Post-World War I=== When Snow Baby production resumed after the war, the figurines made were smaller, usually ranging from 1 to 3 inches in size. Although the new paint used came in vibrant primary colors, Snow Babies had less facial detail than previous models; the paint was also less durable and prone to flaking off. Models in more varied poses were made, including children singing Christmas carols, riding polar bears, and building snowmen. New characters were also designed, and included Santa Claus, elves, penguins, and dogs. ==ReferencesSee also== * Christmas ornament Category:Christmas decorations Category:Winter traditions Category:Figurines ","title":"Snow baby"},{"id":"7457225","text":"Turki I bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (, ') (1900‚Äì1919) was the eldest son of Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. He accompanied his father during the conquest of the Arabian Peninsula at a young age, and witnessed battles in Kuwait and al-Hasa. He died in 1919 in the 1918-1920 flu pandemic, which also killed many others in the region, including his half-brother Saad (I), who was the younger full-brother of King Faisal and his younger full-brother Prince Fahd (I). ==Early life== Turki al Awwal was the eldest son of Ibn Saud. His mother was Wadhah bint Muhammad bin 'Aqab, who belonged to the Bani Khalid tribe. She was the daughter of the chief of the Bani Khalid tribe, who ruled al-Hasa and was Ibn Saud's second wife. They married in 1896. Turki's birthplace is Kuwait City. He was born in 1900 when his family was in exile there. Turki was full-brother of King Saud. His full sisters include Munira and Noura. ==Activities and succession== Prince Turki was the deputy of his father as commander-in-chief of the army. He was Crown Prince beginning by his father's conquest of Riyadh on 15 January 1902 up to his own early death in 1919. When British government invited Ibn Saud to visit London, he assigned Prince Turki as his envoy. However, he could not attend the visit due to his death in 1919, and Prince Faisal was named the envoy of his father for this official visit. ==Personal life== Turki I's first wife gave birth to his son Faisal bin Turki. Years later, Faisal bin Turki became minister of interior in the government of King Saud from 1961 to 1962. Faisal bin Turki died in 1968 in Riyadh, and had a daughter named Sara who married the former governor of Najran province, Mishaal bin Saud. Turki also had a daughter with his other wife Tarfa Al Mhanna, Hes'sa bint Turki, who was the wife of Abdulaziz bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz, and they had two sons, Faisal and Turki. Princess Hes'sa died in Riyadh at the age of 91 on 19 August 2007 and was buried in Al Oud cemetery. Two grandsons of Turki I, the children of his son Faisal, have served on the Allegiance Council: Turki bin Faisal, (until his death on 28 February 2009) and Abdullah bin Faisal (until his death in February 2019). ==Death== Turki al Awwal died in Riyadh during the flu pandemic that killed his mother and many others in the region in 1919. His father was said to be deeply saddened by his death. After the death of Turki, his wife, Noweir bint Obaid Al Rasheed, married his younger brother Saud, and they had a daughter, named Al Anoud bint Saud. ==AncestryReferences== Turki I Category:1900 births Category:1919 deaths Turki I Turki Turki Turki I ","title":"Turki I bin Abdulaziz"},{"id":"7457228","text":"The Free Anti Revolutionary Party (in Dutch: Vrij-Antirevolutionaire Partij, VAR) was a Dutch conservative Reformed political party, which existed from 1898 to 1903. The VAR is historically linked to the Christian Democratic Appeal which is currently one of the major parties of the Netherlands. ==Party history== The VAR was founded as one of several parties that were founded in the 1890s, which all turned against the leadership and ideology of Abraham Kuyper, the leader of the Protestant Anti Revolutionary Party. Kuyper had initiated a new political course for Protestantism in the Netherlands, which included cooperation with the Catholics, in the coalition, strategical support for extension of suffrage a rejection of theocracy in favour of a specific conception of state neutrality, sphere sovereignty and a strong party organization and party discipline. The opposition against Kuyper was led by Alexander de Savorin Lohman. The elections of 1894 proved decisive. An important issue in the election was the extension of suffrage proposed by the Minister of the Interior Johannes Tak van Poortvliet. After the election two anti-revolutionary parliamentary parties were formed one, led by Kuyper favoured the suffrage which was backed by the ARP, while the other led by De Savorin Lohman rejected it. With De Savorin Lohman many aristocrats and noblemen left the ARP, as did adherents of the Dutch Reformed Church, as opposed to the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, which was founded by Kuyper himself. The group around De Savorin Lohman sought to found a new party. In 1896 they set up a commission to found a new party. In September 1898 the Free Anti Revolutionary Party was founded. In the 1901 elections the party won nine seats, four more than the five the free Anti Revolutionaries had won as individual candidates in 1897. The religious parties won a majority in this election, a cabinet was formed by ARP leader Kuyper, which the VAR supported without providing any ministers. In 1903 the VAR merged with the Christian Historical Voters' League to form the Christian Historical Party ==Name== The term anti-revolutionary was used to denote supporters of the main Protestant party, the Anti Revolutionary Party, which denounced the French Revolution. The dissenters against the organizational and political course of the ARP called themselves free antirevolutionaries, implying that they upheld the Anti Revolutionary beliefs without being a member of the strong party organisation. ==Ideology and issues== The VAR was a conservative Protestant party. It saw government as a God-given institution, which should act according to Biblical norms. Society should furthermore follow its historical course. Power should not be based on the opinion of the majority but on authority. The VAR was formed as a result of dissent within the main Protestant party the Anti Revolutionary Party. Unlike that party the VAR did not recognize Catholicism as a legitimate religion. The party was strongly anti-papist. According to the VAR the Netherlands was a Protestant nation. As such it was hostile to the Roman Catholic segment of society. It renounced the coalition between the Protestant Anti Revolutionary Party and the Catholic General League and more generally it rejected the antithesis between religious and non-religious parties. Catholic influences within society should be limited. The VAR advocated limited government. It supported only limited government interference in the economy and instead advocated charity to help the poor. Furthermore the party opposed general suffrage. ==Representation== This table shows the VAR's results in elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter. It also possible that the party leader is member of cabinet, if the VAR was part of the governing coalition, the \\"highest ranking\\" minister is listed. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !

It won and kept seats in several districts with large reformed populations, Goes in Zeeland, Apeldoorn in Gelderland, Dokkum in Friesland and Katwijk and Schiedam in South Holland. ==International comparison== As a party for Protestant dissenters of a Catholic-Protestant alliance the VAR is a unique phenomenon in international perspective. Its political course, which included support of limited government, rejection of universal suffrage and hostility against Roman Catholicism, is comparable to the course of the British Conservative Party in the late 1800s and to some extent American Party of the United States. ==References== Category:Protestant political parties Category:Defunct political parties in the Netherlands Category:Confessional parties in the Netherlands Category:Political parties established in 1898 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1903 Category:Defunct Christian political parties Category:Conservative parties in the Netherlands Category:1898 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"Free Anti Revolutionary Party"},{"id":"7457229","text":"The Continental is an American television series that aired on CBS in 1952. It starred Renzo Cesana in the title role. The 15-minute program was shown on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:15pm, at the end of the night's prime time schedule. ==Synopsis== The series used a subjective camera, as Cesana spoke directly to women in the viewing audience in a suave manner, with each episode a different romantic rendezvous, accompanied by lounge music played by Eddie Baxter on an electronic organ. Occasionally, Cesana would recite the lyrics to a song. In an era when advertisers and advertising agencies played major roles in program creation and sponsorship, the show began as a syndicated 15-minute radio show created, written and produced by agency owner Cesana on Los Angeles station KHJ in February 1951.\\"Pitching Woo for Shampoo\\", Billboard, February 10, 1951, p. 4.\\"The Continental\\" (review), Billboard, March 24, 1951, p. 8. It directly followed The Lonesome Gal, a nationally syndicated radio show in which host Jean King played records and spoke in a soothing monologue to male listeners. The Continental failed to attract an audience and was soon cancelled. Cesana convinced television station KNBH to air a video version, which went on the air twice weekly beginning in June 1951. The show was picked up briefly by the CBS network, where it debuted on January 22, 1952, and ended on April 17, 1952.

Tom Ferrier (born 14 November 1981) is a British racing driver. He had a long running karting career, a milestone was winning the 1998 British Championship. He also won the Star Cup of the Formula Renault Championship the following year, before switching to more entertaining and less competitive saloon cars. Ferrier captured two wins in the Renault Clio Winter series. In 2000 he was a competitor at the national Saloon Championship as well as some Class B BTCC races (the two series have closely related car classes) in an Alfa Romeo 156 prepared by Gary Ayles' team. For 2001 he was linked to Vauxhall for the main class, but chose to race in both the European Super Production Championship and the BTCC. In Europe ranked 12th of the field. Ferrier achieved number two ranking in the Under 25 Cup. In Britain he ranked 10th overall driving a JSM Alfa Romeo 147. At Donington Park Ferrier led the field, but succumbed to an engine failure in second place. For the 2002 season Ferrier focused on the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC), driving a DART Racing Alfa Romeo 156. His pit-support crew was from Alfa Romeo UK. In 2005 Ferrier was a frontrunner at SEAT Cupra Championship.http://www.seatsportuk.co.uk/sccNet/?Page=Reports&Year;=2005 Ferrier was nominated for a place in the 2004 BTCC by Carly Motors alongside countryman and driver James Hanson, but this was not to be. Ferrier participated in some Caterham races in 2004. Ferrier returned to the BTCC just two weeks before the final round of 2006, driving a SEAT Toledo bought by Motorbase Performance. Despite almost no time in the car before the weekend, he had two points finishes. Ferrier also made the British GT Championship races in 2006. Beginning 2007 Ferrier drove in the British GT Championship, for Tech 9 sharing with Phil Quaife. Midseason he rejoined Motorbase for the BTCC. Heavy rain at that debut counted against him but he scored points at Snetterton. Involvement in the huge pile-up in race 1 at Brands Hatch eliminated him from the rest of that meeting, and the team opted to skip the next meeting at Knockhill to concentrate on the season finale at Thruxton. It was ultimately Paul O'Neill who was at the helm in that final competition of the season. In 2009 he competed in rounds of the Time Attack series in a Subaru Impreza at the Time attack series hosted by Zen Performance. Starting in 2011 Ferrier and former BTCC driver Danny Buxton formed Scuderia Vittoria. They entered teams in both the AirAsia Renault Clio Cup (4x Renault Clio Cup Cars) and the British GT (1x Ginetta G50, 1x Ferrari 458 Italia GT). At the conclusion of 2011, their debut season, Ferrier and Buxton had achieved 14 wins overall in both classes, ==Racing recordComplete British Touring Car Championship results=== (key) Races in bold indicate pole position (1 point awarded 2000‚Äì2001 all races, 2006‚Äì2007 just for first race, 2000‚Äì2001 in class) Races in italics indicate fastest lap (1 point awarded 2001, 2006‚Äì2007 all races, 2000‚Äì2001 in class) * signifies that driver lead race for at least one lap (1 point awarded ‚Äì 2001 just for feature race, 2006‚Äì2007 all races) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\\" !

It is caused by a mutations in certain genes coding for keratin, which causes a defect in the normal process of keratinization of the mucosa. This results in lesions which are thick, white and velvety on the inside of the cheeks within the mouth. Usually, these lesions are present from birth or develop during childhood. The condition is entirely harmless, and no treatment is required. ==Signs and symptoms== It presents itself in the mouth, most frequently as a thick, bilateral, symmetrical white plaques with a spongy, corrugated or velvety texture. Most usually, the lesions are on the buccal mucosa, but sometimes on the labial mucosa, alveolar ridge, floor of the mouth, ventral surface of the tongue or soft palate. The gingival margin and dorsum of the tongue are almost never affected. Less commonly, sites outside the mouth are affected, including the nasal, esophageal, laryngeal, anal and genital mucosae. It usually is present from birth, or develops during childhood. Rarely, the lesions may develop during adolescence. Apart from the appearance of the affected areas, there are usually no other signs or symptoms. ==Pathophysiology== WSN is caused by a mutation of the keratin 4 or keratin 13 genes, located respectively at human chromosomes 12q13 and 17q21-q22. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome (chromosomes 12 and 17 are autosomes), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder. ==DiagnosisDifferential diagnosis=== It is often mistaken for leukoplakia. ===Classification=== The ICD-10 lists WSN under \\"other congenital malformations of mouth\\". It could be classified as a skin condition, or more precisely as a genodermatosis (a genetically determined skin disorder). ==Treatment== There is no treatment, but because this is a benign condition with no serious clinical complications, prognosis is excellent. == See also == * Oral melanosis * List of cutaneous conditions caused by mutations in keratins * Hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis == References  External links == * Category:Conditions of the mucous membranes Category:Oral neoplasia Category:Autosomal dominant disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Cytoskeletal defects ","title":"White sponge nevus"},{"id":"7457272","text":"Jean-Luc Aotret (born 8 November 1956, Bourges, Cher) is a French poet who has poetry in the French poetry journal La feuille du temps which is published by the An Amzer Poetry Association.Accueil ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bourges Category:20th-century French poets Category:French male poets Category:20th-century French male writers ","title":"Jean-Luc Aotret"},{"id":"7457274","text":"Deborah Solomon (born August 9, 1957 in New York City) is an American art critic, journalist and biographer. Her weekly column, \\"Questions For\\" ran in The New York Times Magazine from 2003 to 2011. She is currently the art critic for WNYC Public Radio, the New York City affiliate of NPR. ==Early life and education== Solomon was born in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. Her parents, Jerry and Sally Solomon, owned an art gallery. In an interview with Francis Ford Coppola, Solomon disclosed that her father was born in Romania and fled as a child in 1938. She was educated at Cornell University, where she majored in art history and served as the associate editor of The Cornell Daily Sun. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1979. The following year, she received a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Solomon was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2001 in the category of biography. ==CareerJournalism=== Solomon began her career writing about art for various publications, including The New Criterion. For most of the 1990s, she served as the chief art critic of The Wall Street Journal. She has written extensively about American painting and is a frequent interviewer on art subjects. She has also written three biographies of American artists. In 2003 The New York Times Magazine hired her to do a regular weekly column in which she interviewed various people. She became \\"an expert at forcing her subjects... to say something\\" and developed a reputation as a \\"bulldog\\" interviewer, \\"one of the toughest interviewers around.\\" According to Kat Stoeffel in an opinion piece for The New York Observer, Solomon's weekly \\"Questions For\\" column \\"has been a slow- burning controversy since Ms. Solomon‚Äôs debut in 2003. Ms. Solomon‚Äôs editing practices (despite the weekly disclaimer) led some of her subjects‚Äìincluding Tim Russert, Ira Glass, and Amy Dickinson‚Äìto cry foul. But then some weeks‚Äô interviews‚ÄìDas Racist comes to mind‚Äìseemed to redeem the whole practice.\\" On November 29, 2010, at the 92nd Street Y in New York, Solomon interviewed actor Steve Martin regarding his new novel, An Object of Beauty, which is based in the New York art world. The interview became \\"a debacle\\" when, midway through the conversation, a Y representative handed Solomon a note asking her to talk more about Martin‚Äôs movie career. The next day, the Y issued an apology and refund offer to the audience. In an op-ed in The New York Times, Martin, a serious art collector, praised Solomon as an \\"art scholar\\" and said he would have rather \\"died onstage with art talk\\" than discuss movie trivia as the Y apparently preferred. On February 4, 2011, Solomon stepped down from writing her weekly column to write in house and continue her biography of Norman Rockwell. She was \\"encouraged by the paper‚Äôs top brass to continue writing for the paper\\" and has stated she will continue \\"asking as many impertinent questions as possible.‚Äù In 2010, Solomon was ranked by the Daily Beast as one of \\"The Left's Top 25 Journalists.\\" ===Books=== Solomon has written three biographies of American artists: Jackson Pollock: A Biography (Simon & Schuster, 1987, ); Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1997, ); and American Mirror: The Life and Art of Norman Rockwell (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2013, ). Utopia Parkway was described in Slate as a \\"fascinating account of Cornell's life\\" which \\"narrowed the distance between the life and the art, chronicling everything with a sympathy and even a generosity one would hardly have dreamt possible in our cynical and deconstructive age.\\" The Norman Rockwell biography, American Mirror, received the most attention. It was \\"controversial\\" but garnered \\"generally positive reviews\\". The book was described as an \\"engaging and ultimately sad\\" portrait of Rockwell which \\"fully justifies a fresh look at his life\\";, as a \\"sympathetic and probing new biography\\"; and as a \\"brilliantly insightful chronicle of the life of illustrator Norman Rockwell\\". Controversy arose because in the book she suggests that Rockwell may have been a closeted homosexual. In a review for The New York Times, Garrison Keillor noted sarcastically (\\"Oh, come on!\\") that she \\"does seem awfully eager to find homoeroticism\\" in Rockwell's work. She also \\"detected a pattern of pedophilia\\" in his selection and portrayal of child models. Rockwell's family angrily denied the implications. The artist's son Thomas Rockwell told The Boston Globe, \\"The biography is so poor and so inflammatory, we just had to respond... It‚Äôs being presented as the definitive biography and it‚Äôs so wrong, we just felt we had to correct the record.\\" Rockwell's granddaughter Abigail has written several articles denouncing Solomon's book as a \\"disaster\\" and a \\"fraud\\".Deborah Solomon's Disaster (and How She Duped So Many) by Abigail Rockwell [the artist's granddaughter], Huffington Post 7-30-2014Autopsy of a Fraud (Update on Deborah Solomon's Disastrous Norman Rockwell Bio) by Abigail Rockwell, Huffington Post 2-23-2015 ==Personal life== Solomon is married to Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious-disease specialist and the Deputy Physician-in- Chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and frequent contributor to various publications.

Most of these conflicts are between asteroids and natural satellites of planets, which are named according to different but partially overlapping schemes. Most satellites are named after people and divinities in Greek and Roman mythology; this is rarely true of asteroids currently, with the exception of centaurs and Jupiter trojans, but formerly many asteroids had mythological names, which consequently came into conflict with the names of natural satellites. ==Bodies with identical names and referents== Some of these bodies have exactly the same name, referring to the same mythological character. The earliest such conflicts possibly arose through not considering certain mythological names as \\"official\\"; for instance, the names Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto for the Galilean satellites of Jupiter were not used in astronomical literature of a certain era, their place being taken by Jupiter I, Jupiter II, Jupiter III, Jupiter IV (cf. Naming of moons). ===Moon named first=== In the earliest of these conflicts, the natural satellite was named first, and the conflict arose with the naming of an asteroid. These conflicts span the period 1858‚Äì1906. *Europa, a moon of Jupiter, named 1614 and 52 Europa, discovered 1858 *Io, a moon of Jupiter, named 1614 and 85 Io, discovered 1865 *Dione, a moon of Saturn, named 1847 and 106 Dione, discovered 1868 *Rhea, a moon of Saturn, named 1847 and 577 Rhea, discovered 1905 *Titania, a moon of Uranus, named 1852 and 593 Titania, discovered 1906 ===Asteroid named first=== Later conflicts arose in relatively recent times from giving newly discovered satellites the same names as those of asteroids. By this time, it was possibly felt that the true name of an asteroid such as \\"38 Leda\\" included its minor planet number, and so re-using the name for a satellite did not really create a conflict. These conflicts span the period 1975‚Äì2001, though some conflicts of this type had arisen earlier with some names used unofficially. *9 Metis, discovered 1848 and Metis, a moon of Jupiter, named 1983. *24 Themis, discovered 1853 and Themis, named 1905. The latter Themis was a supposed moon of Saturn that turned out not to exist. *38 Leda, discovered 1856 and Leda, a moon of Jupiter, named 1975. *55 Pandora, discovered 1858 and Pandora, a moon of Saturn, named 1985. *74 Galatea, discovered 1862 and Galatea, a moon of Neptune, discovered 1989. *113 Amalthea, discovered 1871 and Amalthea, a moon of Jupiter, discovered 1892; the name was suggested by Camille Flammarion shortly after its discovery, but it was not officially named until 1975. *171 Ophelia, discovered 1877 and Ophelia, a moon of Uranus, discovered 1986. *239 Adrastea, discovered 1884 and Adrastea, a moon of Jupiter, named in 1983. Adrastea was also an unofficial name for Jupiter's moon Ananke (1955‚Äì1975). *666 Desdemona, discovered 1908 and Desdemona, a moon of Uranus, discovered 1986. *1810 Epimetheus, discovered 1960 and Epimetheus a moon of Saturn, named 1983. *1809 Prometheus, discovered 1960 and Prometheus, a moon of Saturn, named 1985. *2758 Cordelia, discovered 1978 and Cordelia, a moon of Uranus, discovered 1986. *4450 Pan, discovered 1987 and Pan, a moon of Saturn, discovered 1990. Pan was also an unofficial name for Jupiter's moon Carme (1955‚Äì1975). *10386 Romulus, discovered 1996 and Romulus, a moon of Sylvia, discovered 2001. ==Bodies with identical names and different referents== Some bodies have names of identical form, but were actually named for different persons or things. *218 Bianca discovered 1880, was named after opera singer Bianca Bianchi and Bianca, a moon of Uranus, discovered 1986, was named after a Shakespeare character. *1162 Larissa, discovered 1930, was named for the Thessalian town Larissa and Larissa, a moon of Neptune, discovered 1981, was named after the nymph Larissa. ==Bodies with similar names and the same referent== Some objects have names that refer to the same mythological character, but slight variations in spelling prevent there from being a technical conflict. ===Moon named first=== * Callisto, a moon of Jupiter, named 1614 and 204 Kallisto, discovered 1879, both variant transliterations of the name of the nymph Callisto. * Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter, named 1614 and 1036 Ganymed, discovered 1924, both named for Zeus' cupbearer. The name in Latin is Ganymedes, of which Ganymede is an English form and Ganymed a German one. The names are therefore in full conflict in German. ===Asteroid named first=== * 53 Kalypso, discovered 1858 and Calypso, a moon of Saturn, named 1983, both named for the Atlantid nymph Calypso. * 548 Kressida, discovered 1904 and Cressida, a moon of Uranus, discovered 1986, both named after Cressida, a heroine in English-language versions of the Troy legend. * 101 Helena, discovered 1868 and Helene, a moon of Saturn, named 1988, both named after Helen of Troy. * 899 Jokaste, discovered 1918 and Iocaste, a moon of Jupiter, named 2002, both named for Queen Jocasta of Thebes. * 763 Cupido, discovered 1913 and Cupid, a moon of Uranus, discovered 2003, after the Roman god Cupid. Cupido is the Latin form, Cupid a modification of the same used in English. The name of the moon Cupid specifically refers to Cupid appearing as a character in the play Timon of Athens. * 3908 Nyx, discovered 1980 and Nix, a moon of Pluto, named 2006, both named for Nyx, goddess of night. * 1865 Cerberus, discovered 1971 and Kerberos, a moon of Pluto, named 2013, both named for Cerberus, canine guardian of the underworld. ===Both moons=== * Herse, a moon of Jupiter discovered 2003, and Ersa, a moon of Jupiter discovered 2018, both named after the goddess Ersa (the Greek goddess of dew). ===Both asteroids=== * 26 Proserpina, discovered 1853 and 399 Persephone, discovered 1895, both named for Persephone, goddess of the underworld. * 68 Leto, discovered 1861 and 639 Latona, discovered 1907.

This is usually true when one name is Latin and another Greek, and causes especial confusion in Greek, where the Greek forms of all mythological names are used in preference to the Latin names. ===Conflicts with non-minor or Solar System bodies=== Some of the conflicts, surprisingly enough, are with planets and satellites, or other astronomical objects with long-established names. * The Sun and Helium, discovered 1868, and 895 Helio, discovered 1918. * The Moon and Phoebe, discovered 1898, and 580 Selene, discovered 1905. * Earth and 1184 Gaea, discovered 1926. * Venus and 1388 Aphrodite, discovered 1935, and 7088 Ishtar, discovered 1992. * Mercury and 69230 Hermes, named 1937 (but not numbered until 2003). * Neptune, discovered 1846 and 4341 Poseidon, discovered 1987. Poseidon was also an unofficial name for Jupiter's moon Pasiphae 1955‚Äì1975. * Jupiter and 5731 Zeus, discovered 1988. * Uranushttps://sites.uni.edu/morgans/astro/course/Notes/section4/new21.html and 30 Urania, discovered 1854. Uranus, however, is mostly named after the Greek god personifying the sky. * Maia (20 Tauri) and 66 Maja, discovered 1861. * Merope (23 Tauri) and 1051 Merope, discovered 1925. * There was a potential conflict between Saturn and Cronus, a suggested name for Pluto, discovered 1930. \\"Kronos\\" is also a nickname for the star HD 240430. * 10 Hygiea, discovered 1849, and Valetudo, a moon of Jupiter discovered 2018. Named for Hygieia (Valetudo in Roman mythology), the goddess of personal healing. * There was also a potential conflict between Hades, an unofficial name for Sinope, a moon of Jupiter between 1955 and 1975, and Pluto. * Vulcan, a hypothetical planet once proposed to exist in an orbit between Mercury and the Sun, and 2212 Hephaistos, discovered 1978. * Theia, a planet supposed to have collided with the early Earth, producing the Moon as a result, and 106 Dione, discovered 1868, and 405 Thia, discovered 1895. The equivalence between Dione and Thia is less certain. * Tyche, a hypothetical planet residing in the Oort cloud whose existence was ruled out in 2014, and 19 Fortuna, discovered 1852, and 258 Tyche, discovered 1886. ===Conflicts among asteroids=== Other conflicts occurred between asteroids discovered earlier and those discovered later. * 4 Vesta, discovered 1807 and 46 Hestia, discovered 1857.

Named for goddesses of Justice. * 2 Pallas, named 1802, 93 Minerva, discovered 1867, and 881 Athene, discovered 1917. It might be argued that \\"Pallas\\" here does not actually refer to the goddess Athene, but rather her mythological companion Pallas; however, in the 19th century \\"Pallas\\" was commonly used as shorthand for \\"Pallas Athene\\", and in the company of Ceres, Juno, and Vesta, it seems more likely that Athene was intended. * 3 Juno, discovered 1804 and 103 Hera, discovered 1868. Hera was also an unofficial name for Jupiter's moon Elara 1955‚Äì1975. Named for the goddess Hera. * 78 Diana, discovered 1863 and 105 Artemis, discovered 1868 and 395 Delia and 15992 Cynthia.

He worked as a reporter for the New York Press, the Queens Tribune and the New York Sun. In February 2011, Paybarah returned to The New York Observer he had left only months earlier, where he wrote for the daily blog, The Politicker. In September 2011 he joined the online news publication Capital as senior writer. Paybarah also hosts a political blog on the website of the local NPR station, WNYC. Paybarah attended the University at Albany, and spent the next few years in the state capital working on campaigns prior to moving back to New York City. He is a proponent of a pro-active approach to journalism. At times he will inform political colleagues or rivals of a controversial statement another politician has made to provoke a reaction. An example of this was when he informed others of congressional candidate David Weprin's statements in an interview for Vosizneias, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish websites in the United States, regarding the marriage equality law which allows gay and lesbian marriages in New York State. In May 2009, Paybarah made headlines for being called ‚Äúa disgrace‚Äù by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg for asking about the mayor's rationale for running for a third term. Though later in his campaign, Bloomberg described Paybarah as ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù, according to The New York Times.

It is the second single from their rap album Blowin' Up and is the first track on the album. ==Origins== The song derives from an American children's playground song, \\"circle circle, dot dot\\", that supposedly serves to immunize a child from the affliction of cooties. The words are as follows: :Circle, circle. :Dot, dot. :Now you got your cootie shot. The words circle and dot are accompanied by the corresponding shape meaning in the shape of two circles with dots in the middle being traced (or, in some cases, drawn with a pen or marker) on the recipient's hand or arm. If the cootie shot was self- administered, \\"you\\" and \\"your\\" may be substituted with \\"I\\" and \\"my\\". In some areas a self-administered shot is not considered effective (the \\"shot\\" is considered to have been already infected with cooties). There are also several variations: :Circle circle, :knife knife. :Now you got your shot for life. :Circle, circle. :Square, square. :Now you have it everywhere. (Or \\"Now it will stay there.\\") :Circle, circle. :Line, line. :Now you have it all the time. (Or \\"Now I'm protected all the time.\\") ==Video== Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone have a Circle Circle Dot Dot video on YouTube and on Jamie Kennedy's Myspace. They also produced a YouTube production of the film. Australian YouTuber Blunty3000 (Nate Burr) won the music video contest held by Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone which asked users to submit their own homemade music videos. His LEGO stop motion (also called brickfilm) version of the video was on the front page. An official video was commissioned by Jamie and Stu's parent record label Warner Bros. Records in Fall of 2006. The video was a parody of the classic 1980s Wham! video for Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.

He lived in Sofia from 1892 to 1915. Bourchier was an honourable member of the Sofia Journalists' Society. He acted as an intermediary between the Balkan states at the conclusion of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913. ==Life== Memorial plaque on the building in the centre of Sofia, where J. Bourchier lived between 1892 and 1915 () Bourchier's birthplace, Baggotstown House Bourchier was born in Limerick and studied at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen and Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a scholar in classics in 1871. Deeply engaged in the processes that were taking place on the Balkan peninsula at that time, Bourchier supported the idea that the island of Crete be annexed by Greece.ROAD SCHOLARS - Features news at www.sofiaecho.com In his writings he criticised certain clauses of the Bucharest Peace Treaty of 1913, which he deemed unfair to Bulgaria. As a result of the treaty Bulgaria lost the southern part of Dobrudja (which was annexed by Romania), and part of Macedonia. Bourchier also expressed his strong support for Bulgaria during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919-1920. The conference produced five treaties, including the Treaty of Neuilly (the peace agreement between the Allies and Bulgaria). Under the terms of the treaty, Bulgaria had to cede part of Western Thrace to Greece and several border areas to Yugoslavia. Southern Dobrudja was confirmed in Romanian possession, reparations were required, and the Bulgarian Army was limited to 20,000 men. With his numerous publications in the British press, and in his private and social correspondence, Bourchier repeatedly voiced his sympathy towards Bulgaria and its people. After his death in December 1920, James Bourchier was buried near the Rila Monastery in southwestern Bulgaria. He remains the only foreigner ever allowed to be buried at the one of the greatest monasteries in Bulgaria, on behalf of a grateful Bulgarian nation. ==Honours== Bourchier Peak on Rila Mountain, James Bourchier Boulevard and James Bourchier Metro Station in Sofia, and Bourchier Cove on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are named after James David Bourchier.Bourchier Cove SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica In 1990 the recently established Bulgarian Society for British Studies devoted its first national conference to the 140th anniversary of Bourchier‚Äôs birth, in Limerick, Ireland, and 70th anniversary of his death. Today James Bourchier Boulevard is a busy street in Sofia with numerous administrative and office buildings on it. Its most notable landmark is probably the Hotel Marinela Sofia. The Faculty of Physics, the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, and the Faculty of Chemistry of Sofia University are also located there, as is the office of the Union of Physicists in Bulgaria and the headquarters of the Bulgarian Red Cross.

The operation of the line came under the jurisdiction of the station master at Kilnhurst Central.

The platform was known as \\"Thrybergh Tins\\", but it never had a name board to that effect. The first train to use the platform ran on 17 June 1959 taking over 1300 people from Silverwood Miners' Welfare Club to Bridlington. The platform was used on 3 or 4 occasions each year.

Units raised in the western counties prior to the creation of the state of West Virginia were often known as \\"loyal Virginians\\" who formed the Restored government of Virginia in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1861, selecting Francis H. Pierpont as the new governor. The state produced the most highly-decorated cavalry regiment of the Union Army (tied with the 47th Ohio as the most highly-decorated single regiment) and was credited with 32,000 Union soldiers, including 10 Brigadier and Major Generals. The recent soldier count by the George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War estimates West Virginia's soldiers to be around 20,000, the remaining soldiers consisting of large numbers of Pennsylvania and Ohio volunteers, and with re-enlistments credited as new soldiers.Snell, Mark A., West Virginia and the Civil War, History Press, 2011, pg. 28 Most regiments were recruited from the Northern, central and southwestern counties. Elements of two state cavalry regiments, one infantry regiment and an artillery company, almost 760 men, played a key role against Pickett's Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg, less than two weeks after the official admission of the territory into the Union as the 35th state.West Virginia Monuments, Gettysburg The 1st, 2nd and 3rd West Virginia Cavalry also played a large role in directly cutting off the Confederate retreat at Appomattox Station on April 8, 1865, and was present during General Robert E.

They possess power on a universal, multiversal or even omniversal level, far beyond those of humans or conventional superheroes, and frequently serve some natural function in the universe. They are part of Marvel's cosmic setting.Marvel's cosmic universe is the future of comic book movies - Polygon. ==Overview== The fictional Marvel Universe contains a number of beings in this category that are a part of the universe, with their existence necessary to provide a certain function. Much like organs provide specific functions for the human body, these entities provide functions for the universe itself. There is no official (known) name for these beings, but they are often referred to as cosmic entities, cosmic beings or abstract entities. Many of them embody some concept or fulfill some essential need, but there are others who are considered within this reference frame simply due to their scale of power, such as the Infinites, Beyonders, Cosmic Cubes, or Watchers. Death is also considered to be a cosmic entity. Each cosmic being is unique, but they often have the following characteristics in common: * Power greater than that of virtually any mortal being, with extremely rare exceptions. Note, however, that their level of power greatly varies, with some being able to affect the entire space-time multiversal reality. The Living Tribunal, Eternity, Master Order, and Lord Chaos were once referred to as meeting in 16-dimensional space. *No physical form. To visit the material universe they may use 'M-bodies', life-forms created for them by an entity called Anthropomorpho in the 'dimension of manifestations.' The power bestowed upon a manifestation body is said to be directly dependent on how well any given creation is able to 'synchronize' with their assigned entity. Such bodies can also be employed by uniquely prominent physical entities, such as the Stranger or Galactus.Quasar #38 *A completely amoral nature, uncaring about anything but their purpose of existence, and frequently to safeguard their Universe (i.e. themselves) from destruction, although some have recurrently displayed personal, or even human-like sentiments, and sometimes are not above remorse. A notable example of this is Galactus; despite his consumption of living planets, he occasionally displays disgust at his mission. In fact, he states that he feels an intense kind of guilt for all the civilizations that he has destroyed, and cannot close his eyes without recalling the ghosts of the beings that have died as a result of his feeding. In the fourth Eternals limited series, by writers Charles and Daniel Knauf, the Dreaming Celestial states that \\"Every component in the physical Universe is a model/example/function of balance... Every particle/being/concept/action exists in this state of sublime equilibrium to serve [a being known as] the Fulcrum. And when asked by the Eternal Makkari whether 'every cosmic being in this Universe is a total tool', replies 'Yes. We are all tools of the Fulcrum.'\\"Eternals vol.4, #2 (2008) The Marvel Universe versions of the gods of the Earthly religions, are not cosmic in the traditional sense, although the strongest of them, such as Atum and Odin, can rival or exceed the power of certain cosmic beings, as can the most powerful demons or independent mystic entities such as Zom, Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath, Mephisto, Chthon, or the Vishanti, and, per extension, the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange, at times when he channels their full power, but their existence is not necessary for the universe to function. Others pretend to embody existential concepts, but lack the power of the true entities, such as the demon D'Spayre who has claimed to embody despair, but in rare cases, such as Nightmare or Amatsu- Mikaboshi it depends from story to story whether or not they are considered embodiments. Exactly how many true cosmic entities exist is unknown, and more keep being revealed as time passes. Certain mutants and superhumans have reached universe, or multiverse affecting status. A non-exhaustive list includes regular Marvel characters such as; The Molecule Man, Jean Grey, Franklin Richards, The Scarlet Witch and Rachel Summers. Heralds of Galactus are granted a small fraction of his power, proven enough to shatter planets, and the Elders of the Universe possess comparative, or, in rare cases, superior power, as do certain other elite Marvel superheroes or supervillains, such as Quasar, Thanos, Thor, and Gladiator. ==See also== * List of cosmic entities in Marvel Comics * List of deities in Marvel Comics ==References External links == * Marvel Comics cosmic entities fi:Marvel-universumin kosmiset olennot ","title":"Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)"},{"id":"7457514","text":"Mathematische Zeitschrift (German for Mathematical Journal) is a mathematical journal for pure and applied mathematics published by Springer Verlag.

Each episode, 7 contestants who felt they were a triple threat when it comes to singing, acting and dancing, competed against each other until 2 were chosen to go head to head in the \\"Triple Threat\\" round. After the final round a winner is selected and crowned the most talented performer of the episode and receive a five hundred dollar cash prize and a statuette. == Judges == The hosts included Bryan Dattilo, Laurie Ann Gibson, and Kimberley Locke. Each contestant received feedback from a panel of celebrity judges, each one specializing in one of the categories. Gibson served as the dancing judge. She is a former \\"Fly Girl\\" and choreographer, having worked on the Making the Band series. Locke was most often the \\"singing judge\\". She was herself a finalist in the second season of American Idol and is a recording artist for Curb Records. Anthony Fedorov and Constantine Maroulis, both from American Idol's fourth season, occasionally sat in as singing judges. The show had alternated acting judges from episode to episode. These judges were Bryan Dattilo (Lucas Roberts on Days of Our Lives), Matt Cedeno (Brandon Walker on Days of Our Lives), Sean Kanan (Alan Quartermaine Jr. on General Hospital.) and Amy Davidson (Kerry Hennessy in 8 Simple Rules). ==Episodes/airdates== Each episode set a particular acting theme for the contestants. *Back From War (October 5, 2006) *Superhero Formula (October 4, 2006) *Paranoia (October 3, 2006) *Maniac Slasher (October 2, 2006) *Possession (September 28, 2006) *Jailbreak (September 27, 2006) *Amnesia (September 26, 2006) *Snitch (September 25, 2006) *Hostile Witness (September 21, 2006) *Fountain of Youth (September 20, 2006) *U Robot (September 19, 2006) *I'm Dyin' Bryan (September 18, 2006) *MTV's Little Talent Show (September 18, 2006) ==Contestants== Contestants included Yara Camarena, singer Aria Johnson, comedian Garrett Gilchrist, Chavon James, Jesse Lewis, Sheila Tejada, Mickey Mello, Ismael Moreno, actor Kamahni Huck (winner), comedian Jesse Maddox, comedian Erik Anderson. Actor Byron Vasquez Jr. Adam Ryan and Merrin Mae Fuentebella were cut from pilot episode \\"I'm Dyin, Bryan.\\" ==Reception== The show was panned by Hartford Courant critic Roger Catlin who wrote on his official blog TV Eye - What's on Television that MTV was tardy in coming forward with a musical competition show, and expressed disdain that none of the competitors seemed to have talent. ==Editing and controversy== The pilot episode \\"I'm Dyin, Bryan\\" was shot under the (false) title \\"Triple Threat.\\" Most of the contestants were professional singers, actors, comedians or dancers of some kind, and were told that this was a serious (if small scale) talent competition rather than a spoof. Misleading editing was used to try to show the performers in the worst possible light. For example, professional singer Aria Johnson appears in the pilot but we don't hear her much of her singing in the final edit. Two contestants (Adam and Merrin) were edited out of the final pilot entirely, having performed well in all three segments. In the final shows, we are told that contestants consider themselves good singers, dancers and actors - a \\"Triple Threat.\\" Onset, most of the performers considered themselves singers, dancers or actors, not all three. If a performer was a talented dancer, he would be left out of the dancing segment, and so on. The very different singing styles used by the contestants are edited into a single piece, making even a fairly good singer sound awkward in a disjointed edit. The scripts to the acting competitions were written to be as ridiculous as possible and impossible to perform seriously (full of comically overlong words, or showing the actor regressing in age from an old man to a baby), so most of the cast performed them in a purposely comedic fashion (affecting silly accents, or doing impersonations of celebrities). Sadly this doesn't come across in the edit, as intentional comedy would have detracted from the show's idea of showing the contestants as untalented. There are some extremely odd edits in all the episodes, and it has been said by the show's unwitting cast members that overall, the final shows are much less funny or interesting than what was actually seen onset. The judges were mostly shot separately from the contestants and seem to use the same script in each episode. This extends even to their comments to the contestants - for example, Kimberley Locke says \\"It's distracting when you take your top off\\" in two different episodes (once to a man, once to a woman). Extensive backstage material and a second singing competition (\\"Photograph\\") were also filmed for the pilot but not used. Contestants were urged to perform scripted material where they would bicker and infight with each other. Few of the contestants were interested in doing this, but similar scenes supposedly showing the contestants fighting amongst each other were shot for each episode with a similar script. Contestants were also urged to shout out single scripted lines, like \\"I am the Triple Threat!\\" Although the contestants appearing on the show were not working from a script, and could be themselves onset, very few unscripted moments were used in the final edit, suggesting that the shows were written ahead of time, and then edited to that script without paying attention to what actually occurred onset. In the shows as aired, the contestants are competing for a tiny $500 prize money. Onset there was no talk of prize money - everyone was given a $200 paycheck for a weekend's work, and the chance to be on MTV. Inevitably due to the format of the program, the contestants were disappointed and embarrassed when they saw the final product. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Little Talent Show at the Internet Movie Database *MTV's Little Talent Show website Category:MTV original programming Category:2006 American television series debuts Category:2006 American television series endings ","title":"Little Talent Show"},{"id":"7457526","text":"This is a list of administrative counties and county boroughs of England by population as at the 1971 census.

They do not interfere as much in reality as their Marvel Comics counterparts. They also change in power and were rare in the Golden Age of comics where superheroes in the future and past were vastly more powerful (\\"planet-moving\\" superheroes were superior to man and depicted as gods). The magical realm usually consists of beings from other dimensions and the spiritual realm consists of ghostly beings, legends and deities, usually of the past, of whom are already dead. There are also stronger Heaven- and Hell-related beings from the religious virtues of the DC Universe, most common in the Vertigo imprint, which have god-like or demigod-like powers and are directly connected with Greek mythology. Wonder Woman also follows a similar character base. In Books of Magic it is particularly noted that the cosmic entities like Phantom Stranger and Spectre both appear in the DC Universe and the Vertigo Universe. The spatial realm consists of highly advanced alien races and entities of extreme power who evolved within the cosmos. Because the DC Universe is more centralized, supernatural beings usually take any shape size or form on Earth. Other entities can be considered as powerful and similar to Marvel cosmic beings, such as Kismet, Imperiex and beings from Jack Kirby's Fourth World series. ==Notable entities by realm== DC cosmic entities are divided into the spiritual, spatial and the magical realms. This differs them from Marvel entities, who regularly take on both spatial and magical roles (e.g. Marvel's Death is a member of the Cosmic Compass, but also grants temporary immortality to Earth's Sorcerer Supreme). ===Spatial realm=== *Agamemno * Anti-Monitor *Auctioneer *Black Racer *The Controllers *Darkseid *Dominus *Guardians of the Universe *Highfather *Imperiex *Krona *Mageddon *Metron *Onimar Synn *Overmaster *Rao *Raven *Solaris *Starbreaker *Starro *Takion *Triarch *Trigon *Vext *Zamarons Timestream *Destiny *Time Trapper Emotional Manifestations *Ion, representing will power *Parallax, representing fear *Predator, representing love Dreamtime *Betty Clawman ===Magical realm=== *Black Alice *Blaze and Satanus *Cain and Abel *Circe *Dream of the Endless *Enchantress *Kid Eternity *Neron *Phantom Stranger *Queen of Fables *Rama *Shazam *Uncle Sam *Wotan Fifth Dimension and similar realms *Bat-Mite (not actually from the Fifth Dimension) *Thunderbolt *Mister Mxyzptlk *Qwsp ===Spiritual Realm=== *Eclipso *The Endless *H'ronmeer *Isis *Lords of Chaos and Order *Nekron *The Presence *Shango *The Source *Spectre *Titans of Myth Elementals *Corona (fire) *Firestorm (fire) *Hyathis (plant) *Naiad (water) *Red Tornado (air) *Swamp Thing (plant, earth) *Tef√© Holland (plant, earth) Parliaments *Parliament of Trees ===Unknown Realms=== *Ion ==See also== *Gods (DC Comics) *List of DC Comics cosmic entities Category:DC Comics deities Category:Fictional doomsday devices ","title":"Cosmic entity (DC Comics)"},{"id":"7457589","text":"Foxboro Post Office and church Foxboro is a community located in southern Ontario, north of the centre of Belleville.

The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother (the singer's \\"sworn enemy\\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer. == Track listing == The 7\\" single sold in the UK was mispressed, with \\"Culling of the Fold\\" as the B-side despite the artwork and record label listing \\"After the Bombs\\" as the B-side. == Music videos == For the \\"O Valencia!\\" music video, The Decemberists filmed themselves in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete it by digitally adding in background images or footage. Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, having recently asked fans to do the same with a video of him with a light saber in front of a green screen, brought up The Decemberists on his segment \\"Look Who's Riding on My Coattails Now\\" and accused the band of stealing the idea. The Decemberists' response was to challenge Stephen Colbert to a guitar solo showdown on December 20, 2006, on The Colbert Report. On January 19, 2007, The Decemberists premiered an alternate music video of \\"O Valencia!\\", directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, on MTV2. The video follows a character named Patrick, played by Meloy, as he and his love Francesca (Lisa Molinaro), daughter of \\"the Boss\\", plan an escape to an unknown location. At a cafe, a man in a suit, portrayed by the band member Chris Funk, tells him to hide in the \\"Valencia\\" hotel (the Super Value Inn on North Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon) while he gets them the necessary documentation to escape. Above the name of the hotel, there is a neon sign that reads \\"Office\\". The letters have all burnt out except for the \\"O\\", creating the title of the song. The video then introduces other characters - various assassination teams - who sit in different rooms of the hotel waiting for the chance to catch the two lovers. Most are portrayed by other members of the band (along with Meloy's wife, Carson Ellis). They kill off any potential witnesses to their plan. Patrick manages to take down one member from each team, before they gang up on him. The Boss arrives, along the man, who reveals that he snitched on Patrick and Francesca. They execute Francesca, while forcing Patrick to watch. After they leave, Patrick finds a note by Francesca, which reveals that she never fell in love with him, and only wanted protection. 2 months later, Patrick and the man, who has lost an eye from a previous assassination attempt, have a sit-down at the same cafe. The man reveals that he snitched on Patrick just to take over the town. Patrick reveals that he poisoned a drink the man was having, but before he could get away, the man stabs Patrick in the neck with a fork before dying, followed by Patrick. The video is somewhat influenced by the distinct style and themes of director Wes Anderson, with bold fonts being used to introduce characters and groups on the bottom of the screen (much like in the film The Royal Tenenbaums). The band had previously (and more explicitly) drawn influence from Anderson's Rushmore in their video for \\"Sixteen Military Wives\\". The layout of the hotel is also similar to the one used in Bottle Rocket. Kurt Nishimura was chosen as the winner by mtvU for his video that depicted a love affair between a woman and her television, with the TV containing the green- screened Decemberists video footage. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:The Decemberists songs Category:2006 songs ","title":"O Valencia!"},{"id":"7457615","text":"Liers in Wait were a Gothenburg, Sweden-based death metal band active between 1990 and 1995. The group was formed by Kristian W√•hlin after the dissolution of Grotesque, a precursor to At the Gates, and for a very brief time featured the band's core members (Tomas Lindberg, Anders Bj√∂rler and Alf Svensson). By the time songwriting materialized for the EP Spiritually Uncontrolled Art in 1992, the line-up consisted of Wahlin and Johan √ñsterberg (guitars), Mattias Gustavsson (bass guitar) and Hans Nilsson (drums). Christofer Johnsson from symphonic death metal band Therion would lend his vocals for the studio recording. The band played two shows in Poland and produced a Slayer cover for a record company compilation, but due to instability of the line-up, the group ultimately dissolved in 1995. Daniel Erlandsson would play drums for In Flames, Eucharist, and Armageddon before settling with popular melodic death metal band Arch Enemy; and Wahlin, Osterburg and Nilsson would go on to form Diabolique.

He belongs also to the four \\"prelati di fiocchetto\\", so called because they have the right to ornament the harness of their horses with violet and peacock-coloured feathers. The four prelates di fiocchetto are the Governor of Rome in his quality of Vice-Chamberlain, the Auditor and the Treasurer of the Apostolic chamber, and the Majordomo. ==History== In the \\"Introitus et Exitus Camer√¶ Apostolic√¶\\" of the Vatican Archives, which begins with the year 1295, the officials of the Apostolic Household were given in regular order according to their stipends. Although even at this date there undoubtedly existed a supreme steward of the papal palace, the name and duties attached to the office of a majordomo were not strictly defined until later. The alterations in the domestic administration of the papal household, necessitated under Clement V and John XXII by the transition from the \\"natural economy\\" to the \\"economy of money\\", were of a far-reaching nature; but it was only after the return of Martin V from Avignon to Rome in 1418 that the modern offices were gradually evolved, to attain subsequently during the Renaissance a full development. In the sixteenth century a maestro DI casa 'master of the house(hold)' stood at the head of the whole administration of the papal household. Towards the end of the 16th century, the same official was accorded the title of prefetto del Sacro Palazzo Apostolico, and under Urban VIII (1623‚Äì44) he was first granted the title of Maggiordomo Pontificio 'pontifical majordomo'. It was then his duty, on the accession of a new pope, to form the papal famiglia, that is, to suggest candidates for the various household offices and then to direct the whole household. In so far as this duty necessitated expenditure, the Treasurer of the Holy Roman Church, the minister of finance for the time being, exercised sharply defined control over the majordomo and his assistants. This circumstance did not, however, constitute the treasurer a household official, or the Pr√¶fectus Sacri Palatii and administrative official; the Majordomo has always been exclusively a household official. A complete list of the occupants of the office from 1534 is preserved. The general rule recognised by the Roman Curia at the close of the Middle Ages, that the head of any important, department should have jurisdiction over all his assistants, extended to the Majordomo. Not merely in civil matters but likewise in criminal charges, sedebat pro tribunali‚Äîhe pronounced judgment on all officials of the papal palace. In the course of time his duties as majordomo were sharply distinguished from those he performed as Prefect of the Palace, so that the majordomo was said to be simultaneously Prefect of the Palace. To the prefecture belonged the management of the museums and of all establishments of a special kind existing in the palaces‚Äîprovided they were not autonomous. The keeping of the palace accounts also fell to the prefect. After 1870, following the loss of the Papal states to reunited Italy, there was a great change in these conditions. The important office of the prefect was separated from that of the majordomo, and entrusted to the commission of cardinals appointed to administer the business affairs of the Holy See. The arrangement of Leo XIII was so far altered by Pius X, that the Cardinal Secretary of State was made Prefect of the Apostolic Palaces. Subordinate to him were the subprefect, the forriere maggiore, the cavallerizzo maggiore, the segreteria della prefettiora, the computisteria, the architetto and the juristic counsellors, forming in their corporate capacity, the divisional boards of direction of the palace administration. The museums and galleries were also entrusted to this body. The above-mentioned alteration by Leo XIII took place on 29 December 1891, after the prefecture had been separated by a Motu proprio of 7 December. The rights of the Majordomo became as follows: He retained his old privilege of accompanying the Pope, and remained Governor of the Conclave. In this capacity he has the general control of the personnel of the palaces, and responsibility for the quiet and good order therein during the Conclave. In the Congresso Palatino (Palatine Commission), should it be hereafter convened, he got a seat and a vote. He conducted the Congregation of the Apostolic Hospice and was director of the Sistine Chapel Choir, the musical direction of which was in 1910 entrusted to Maestro Perosi. All ordinary and extraordinary religious functions in which the pope and papal court participate came under his arrangement and direction. The appointments of papal chamberlains were forwarded by him at the pope's order, and he distributed the annual medals to the members of the papal household. His earlier duty of issuing cards of admission to the galleries and museums for purposes of study and copying was withdrawn from him. The Majordomo as the chief Prelate of the Household has a distinctive dress and a free official residence in the papal palace. ==References== * * Category:Catholic ecclesiastical titles Category:Honorary titles of the Holy See Category:Papal household ","title":"Papal majordomo"},{"id":"7457621","text":"Edward Chester \\"Ed\\" Glover (March 1, 1885 ‚Äì October 31, 1940) was an American athlete who competed mainly in the pole vault.

They connect MN 95 in Franconia Township, Minnesota with WIS 35 in Osceola, Wisconsin. The two highways meet at the state line on a bridge across St. Croix River. The combined highway is in length, in Minnesota and in Wisconsin. The two highways were designated in 1949. The bridge across the St. Croix River dates to 1953. ==Route description== Highway 243 serves as a short route between Franconia Township and the village of Osceola. The highway starts at MN 95 on Osceola Road and runs southeasterly for a short distance before it turns northeasterly and parallel to the St. Croix River. Then it turns back to the southeast near some ponds along the riverbank to the bridge across the river. The highway crosses the state line into Wisconsin continuing to the southeast. Before the highway ends, it turns to the east to intersect WIS 35 in Osceola. ==History== Trunk Highway 243 was authorized in 1949 in Minnesota, at the same time State Trunk Highway 243 was designated in Wisconsin. Dr. L.O. Simenstad was responsible for both highways being designated as part of their state highway systems. In 1952, the state of Minnesota reconstructed part of the roadway after a section of it washed out. This project lengthened the highway by at the time. The current bridge was built in 1953 and rebuilt in 1980 by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). The bridge went through a month-long structural rehabilitation between late April and late May 2010. This project was being undertaken by Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) because the bridge is of similar design to the Interstate 35W Bridge over the Mississippi River that collapsed on August 1, 2007. At the same time as the closure, MnDOT repaved their stretch of Highway 243. WisDOT also repaved their segment of the roadway, and they removed some rock from a bluff near the highway overlooking the river. The project was completed on May 28, 2010, when the bridge reopened to cars and passenger trucks. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==FootnotesReferencesExternal links== *Highway 243 Bridge, Osceola, WI *Highway 243 at the Unofficial Minnesota Highways Page *Highway 243 at Wisconsin Highways 243 243 Category:Transportation in Chisago County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Polk County, Wisconsin ","title":"State Highway 243 (Minnesota‚ÄìWisconsin)"},{"id":"7457654","text":"Canossa (Reggiano: ) is a comune and castle town in the Province of Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. It is the site where Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV did penance in 1077, standing three days bare-headed in the snow, in order to reverse his excommunication by Pope Gregory VII. The Walk to Canossa is sometimes used as a symbol of the changing relationship between the medieval Church and State. , Canossa has a population of 3,778, and borders the comuni of Casina, Castelnovo ne' Monti, Neviano degli Arduini (PR), San Polo d'Enza, Traversetolo (PR), Vetto, and Vezzano sul Crostolo. The town was formerly known as Ciano d'Enza, while Canossa was the name of only the castle, now in ruins, once belonging to Matilda of Tuscany, and nearby hamlet, which lie some 8 km east of the town. The new name was decided in 1992. ==Main sights== Matilda with Hugo of Cluny and Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV. Canossa Castle was built before the middle of the 10th century by Adalbert Atto, son of Sigifred of Lucca. Adelaide of Italy, in the 10th century the daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow in turn of three kings, was hard pressed by a local nobleman, Berengar of Ivrea, who declared himself king of Italy, abducted Adelaide, and tried to legitimize his reign by forcing Adelaide to marry his son Adalbert; but she escaped to Canossa. From the rocca of Canossa she called for German intervention. Canossa was inherited by Matilda of Tuscany, the principal Italian supporter of Pope Gregory VII, in 1052. Matilda invited Pope Gregory VII to take refuge in Canossa Castle in 1076/77 during the dispute with Henry IV, the Holy Roman Emperor. In the end their joint fears proved groundless when Henry appeared in the guise of a penitent and begged for forgiveness and reinstatement in the church. After three days of waiting at the castle gates, Henry was admitted and forgiven.This event is described in greater detail in the article Walk to Canossa. Matilda died in 1115 in Mantuan territory. The fortress was destroyed by invaders from Reggio Emilia in 1256. The church of San Apollonio, within the castle walls and contemporary with the castle, was also destroyed. Only the christening font remains, preserved in the Naborre Campanini national museum next to the remains of the wall. Perched on top of the white cliffs of the Apennines, the castle is a ruin today. More than 30,000 tourists come here each year, especially from Germany. The nearby Tempietto del Petrarca, Canossa celebrates the refuge of Petrarch offered here by a local warlord. ==Other== Saint Magdalen of Canossa is an Italian saint of the early 19th century, who founded the Institute of the Daughters of Charity and in whose name Canossian schools have been established in many countries.

It is a sequel to the 1968 novel The Iron Man. ==Story== \\"The Iron Woman has come to take revenge on mankind for its thoughtless polluting of the seas, lakes and rivers\\" says the introduction to the novel. It references sexism, in that the iron woman exacts her revenge on a seemingly ignorant/uncaring male community (in the waste disposal plant) for polluting the area in which she lives; however, the book is more of an attack on society for the oblivious ways in which for many decades, a vast amount of habitats have been destroyed or on the brink of annihilation. Ted Hughes' novel is an attempt at getting people to be made aware of and respond to this. The main character, Lucy, finds the Iron Woman in a state of despair and covered in chemicals. After being cleaned (by Lucy), the Iron Woman takes her to see the environment in which she lives. Lucy sympathises with the Iron Woman, watching the animals' painful deaths as more toxic material is poured into the marsh from the local waste-disposal factory. She is angry and wants to save them, but her dad is one of the factory workers. Lucy contacts Hogarth, the friend of the Iron Man, asking for his help. The Iron Woman is so enraged that she turns all the men in the factory into the swamp creatures, so that they can feel what the animals of the marsh were enduring. They all burp black bubbles of cloud, which the next day form the Cloud Spider: \\"I am the Spider-god of wealth. Wealth. Wealth. The Spider-god of more and more and more and more money.

He played chamber music. He also composed some pieces for the cello with piano accompaniment and wrote a M√©thode compl√®te et pratique de cioloncelle.

The family was stripped of its lands and titles by Henry VIII. In the following years, Mary battled to have the properties restored on behalf of her children, and on her ascension in 1558 Elizabeth restored the title of Baron Dacre to Mary's second son Gregory, her eldest son Thomas having died of the plague at age 15. By her first husband, Lady Dacre was the mother of: * Thomas Fiennes (1538‚Äì1553) * Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre (1539‚Äì1594) * Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre (1540‚Äì1611) Lady Dacre married twice after her first husband's death and had several other children about whom little is known. Mary Fiennes second marriage was to John Wooton/Wotton of North Tuddenham, Norfolk, of the Wottons of St. Clere's manor in North Tuddenham, Norfolk, a relative of the Le Strange family of Hunstanton, whom she wed sometime before 18 May 1546\\\\. After his death, date unknown, she married Francis Thursby of Congham in Norfolk the son of Thomas Thursby (d.1543) of Ashwicken, and the grandson of Thomas Thursby (d.1510), thrice Mayor of King's Lynn, and had six additional children. ==Portraits== Lady Dacre is the sitter in two significant portraits by Hans Eworth. Susan E. James writes of the first of these portraits: > This work is powerful in its message, striking in its design and quite > possibly the first protest painting to be executed in England. The rich > background and clear colors used in the draperies and furniture set off the > somber mood and mourning gown of the sitter. Dressed as an icon of virtuous > widowhood despite her ongoing marriage to Francis Thursby, Mary sits sober > and erect in a chair of estate, posed in front of gathered green draperies > and a busy tapestry featuring vines of roses, the flower of virtue and, > parenthetically, the emblem of the Tudors. Of the 1559 portrait by Hans Eworth, with her son Gregory, Susan E. James writes: > In order to commemorate Gregory's majority in 1559 and in anticipation of > the return of his inheritance by the crown, Mary commissioned Has Eworth to > paint another portrait. Like Lady Anne Clifford's Great Picture, this work > is a memorial to one woman's legal success in the securing of the family > estates. The painting Mary Neville commissioned is the unusual double > portrait of herself and her son, Gregory, now on loan to the National > Portrait Gallery, which has been called 'one of the finest works to be > painted in Britain in the mid-sixteenth century'. The Wrest Part Portrait ‚Äì Recently identified as Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre Recently, the Wrest Park Portrait, long said to be of Lady Jane Grey, has been identified as Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre, by Dr. John Stephan Edwards. Dr. John Stephan Edwards dates the Wrest Park Portrait to 1545‚Äì1549, the early years of her widowhood after the death of her husband. He describes it thusly: > Together the NPG and Ottawa portraits depict the second and third acts of a > life-drama involving the execution of Lady Dacre‚Äôs first husband and her > severely reduced circumstances as a young widow, her long and determined > struggle to regain lost wealth, lands, titles and status, and the ultimate > success of her quest. Missing from the visual record, however, is the first > act of Mary Fiennes‚Äôs story: her relative impoverishment as a new widow with > three children to support. The portrait of Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre and her son Gregory was misidentified as Lady Jane Grey's mother Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk, and her second husband, Adrian Stokes for centuries. It is Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre who is the representative of Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk in Parliament. She is among the Tudor-era figures portrayed on the walls of the Prince‚Äôs Chamber in the Palace of Westminster, commonly called The Houses of Parliament. ==Anne of Cleves and Mary I== Both Lord and Lady Dacre were among the party appointed to meet Anne of Cleves and welcome her to England. In 1558, Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre, assisted at the funeral of Mary I. ==Dedications== Mary Neville Fiennes, Lady Dacre as the Marchioness of Dorset in the Houses of Parliament In 1578, her brother-in-law, Henry Wotton (not to be confused with Henry Wotton), the brother of her late second husband, published A Courtlie Controversie of Cupids Cantils containing five Tragicall Historyes by three Gentlemen and two Gentlewomen, a translation he had made from the French of a collection of Italian romance stories. He dedicated this work to Lady Dacre. ==AncestryNotesReferences== *Honig, Elizabeth: \\"In Memory: Lady Dacre and Pairing by Hans Eworth\\" in Renaissance Bodies: The Human Figure in English Culture c. 1540-1660 edited by Lucy Gent and Nigel Llewellyn, Reaktion Books, 1990, ==External links== * Mary Neville Baroness Dacre at TudorPlace.com Dacre Dacre Category:16th-century English women Category:16th-century English nobility Category:English baronesses Mary Mary ","title":"Mary Fiennes, Baroness Dacre"},{"id":"7457724","text":"OpenDDS may refer to: * ICL VME * OpenDDS, an open-source implementation of Data Distribution Service ","title":"OpenDDS"},{"id":"7457733","text":"Sykia or Sykea (Greek meaning fig tree) may refer to a number of places in Greece: *Sykia, Chalkidiki, a village in the municipal unit Toroni, Chalkidiki *Sykia, Corinthia, a village in the municipal unit Xylokastro, Corinthia *Sykia, Imathia, a village in the municipal unit Vergina, Imathia *Sykia, Laconia, a village in Laconia *Sykia, Larissa, a village in the Larissa regional unit *Sykia, Phocis, a village in the municipal unit Lidoriki, Phocis *Sykia, Voula, a small doline near Voula in Athens ==See also== *Sykias or Pelekita Cave, a cave near Zakros beach, Crete, in Greece *Sykies ","title":"Sykia"},{"id":"7457745","text":"Norwalk Community College (NCC), formerly known as Norwalk State Technical College and Norwalk Community-Technical College, is a public community college in Norwalk, Connecticut.

The station's original antenna was built in a garage for $300. He cleared brush with a tractor on land that he rented from the U.S. Forest Service for $350 a year. Initially, KKGO was a classical station and the first broadcast was a selection from Franz Leh√°r's Land of Smiles. But the station was unable to compete for advertising. As a result, it changed to an all-jazz format and remained jazz until 1989 when it switched back to classical as a result of KFAC going off the air. In 1963, Levine donated a transmitter and antenna to KEDC, the student-operated radio station of San Fernando Valley State College.Los Angeles Times (Dec. 9., 1963) In 1974, Levine participated in Los Angeles Jazz Week which was proclaimed by then-mayor Tom Bradley.Los Angeles Times (Nov. 21, 1974) \\"Dec 6-12 Declared Jazz Week\\" In 1984, Levine founded the now-defunct all-news station KKAR (550 AM) in Hesperia, California.Los Angeles Times (Jan. 22, 1984) \\"L.A.

Although the station is now worth at least $100 million, Levine has refused to sell the business, saying that his wife doesn't want him sitting around the house all day.

Played at Komazawa University before turning professional where he won a variety of different national titles, including the Gold Medal for Japan at the 1995 Summer Universiade. He turned professional in 1997, playing for Verdy Kawasaki (later Tokyo Verdy) in the then-fledgling J1 League. He played as right side-back and midfielder. Yamada stayed with Verdy for the next eight years, clocking up almost 300 appearances for the club. He was one of the iconic players of J1 League's early years, known for his physical and charismatic strength on the field. The supporters' group honored him with the name of \\"Mr. Verdy\\" when he served as Verdy's captain for three years. He was also nicknamed \\"The Terminator\\", due to his combative style. He moved to Cerezo Osaka for the 2006 season, but never fully settled with the club. In December 2006, Yamada surprised the Australian football community by arriving unannounced for a trial with Adelaide United. However, in January, 2007, Adelaide United signed with a Brazilian attacking midfielder Diego Walsh from Miami FC who had a more advanced VISA status meaning Walsh was likely to be available sooner to play for Adelaide United. From Australia, Yamada flew to the United States for an invitational tryout with several Major League Soccer clubs, including New England Revolution, but was not offered a contract. After returning to Japan, Yokohama FC of the J.League immediately announced its interest towards Yamada and signed him on 3 June 2007. Yamada served as captain for the 2008 season. For the 2009 season, Yamada transferred to Sagan Tosu due to the head coach Yasuyuki Kishino's strong recruitment. On January 1, 2010 Yamada signed with FC Tampa Bay (later Tampa Bay Rowdies) for their 2010 inaugural team roster. He became the first Japanese player to serve as co-captain in USSF Division 2.

Paul David Gustav du Bois-Reymond. Paul David Gustav du Bois-Reymond (2 December 1831 - 7 April 1889) was a German mathematician who was born in Berlin and died in Freiburg. He was the brother of Emil du Bois-Reymond. His thesis was concerned with the mechanical equilibrium of fluids. He worked on the theory of functions and in mathematical physics. His interests included Sturm‚ÄìLiouville theory, integral equations, variational calculus, and Fourier series. In this latter field, he was able in 1873 to construct a continuous function whose Fourier series is not convergent. His lemma defines a sufficient condition to guarantee that a function vanishes almost everywhere. Du Bois-Reymond also established that a trigonometric series that converges to a continuous function at every point is the Fourier series of this function. He is also associated with the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations of which he proved a refined version based on that of Lagrange. ==Theory of infinitesimals== Paul du Bois- Reymond developed a theory of infinitesimals: ==Writings== * Th√©orie g√©n√©rale des fonctions (Nice : Impr. ni√ßoise, 1887) (translated in French from the original German by G.

It is a desirable place to live for many local and immigrant families which is reflected by real-estate prices that keep climbing and have doubled in the last 15 years. ==Transportation== A typical North Burnaby streetscape A number of major arteries run through this neighbourhood, primarily the high-traffic Hastings Street connecting North Burnaby with Downtown Vancouver and Port Moody, Willingdon Avenue linking it to Kingsway and Metrotown, and Kensington Ave going south to Canada Way and New Westminster. The neighbourhood is served by several bus routes, including the R5 RapidBus, which runs along Hastings Street and provides connections to downtown Vancouver and Simon Fraser University.

Pierre Veber is the father of journalist and author Pierre-Gilles Veber, and of screenwriter Serge Veber. He is also the grandfather of screenwriter and film director Francis Veber, and the great-grandfather of author Sophie Audouin-Mamikonian. Little is known about his youth. He himself explained: ‚ÄúMy studies were quite limited, of which I am not proud.‚Äù By 1889, his work had already been published in the literary periodical Gil Blas, as Andr√© Antoine says in his journal entry from : ‚ÄúThis evening, Rue Blanche, we are being visited by two newcomers, Tristan Bernard and Pierre Veber, two young journalists of great intellect who, each week, write for Gil Blas, a news magazine illustrated by Jean Veber.‚Äù In 1892, Pierre Veber contributed to the magazine Le Chasseur de Chevelures (The Hunter of Locks), under the guidance of Tristan Bernard. This humorous newspaper had only two issues, in 1892 and 1893, and in the latter year Pierre Veber was credited as co-author in the statement: ‚ÄúTristan Bernard: honest editor; Pierre Veber: corrupt editor.‚ÄùLe Chasseur de chevelures, edition of January 1893 Pierre Veber was a prolific writer, who, with a forty-year long career, produced around one hundred slapstick comedies, vaudevilles, opera libretti; and nearly fifty novels and collections of short stories, along with tales both humorous and ironic. Nearly half of his plays were written in collaboration with one or two other authors, to whom he brought his great elegance and ease of writing, which he admitted with humour in the preface to his Th√©√¢tre Incomplet: ‚ÄúThe theatre is, for a writer, a delightful distraction which allows a break to be taken from writing. We listen to domesticated fools who ramble on; we note down their remarks; we imagine their gestures. And that makes the play.‚Äù His frequent playwriting collaboration with Maurice Hennequin, in particular, was in competition with the playwright duo of Robert de Flers and Gaston Arman de Caillavet, a partnership that was very popular at the time. Veber lent a hand to other writers from time to time, such as Alfred Capus, Georges Courteline et L√©on Xanrof. His work as a playwright continued almost until the Second World War, when he was nearing the age of seventy. He also wrote novels in collaboration; a pursuit less common than collaborating in theatre. It was Veber himself who, in 1895, had the idea for X‚Ä¶ Roman Impromptu: a novel ‚Äúwithout preconceived plan and without a definite subject‚Äù.Gil Blas 2 April 1895 It was written by five authors: Georges Courteline, Jules Renard, George Auriol, Tristan Bernard, and Pierre Veber himself. In an order determined by chance, each author wrote a chapter following on from the last one. This meant that the plot changed each chapter, following the whims and imagination of whoever happened to be writing. The only constraint was that the protagonist not die and that no character must change sex. The novel first appeared in serialised form in the literary periodical Gil Blas, from 4 April to 21 May 1895. This ‚Äòsteeplechase novel‚Äô or ‚Äòchoral novel‚Äô, renamed ‚Äòimpromptu novel‚Äô, was repeatedly published by Flammarion. Veber also wrote some short stories in collaboration with French writer Henry Gauthier-Villars (Willy). Some of his plays experienced great success, such as Le Monsieur de cinq heures, which was performed 568 times ‚Äì a considerable number at the time. Some were even later adapted for cinema, while others were translated into English and performed in London and New York City.

The stone castle was built at the western end of the village by John, Lord Neville in the late fourteenth century. In 1377, John Nevill obtained a charter for a market on Monday and an annual fair on the eve of the exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14). A licence to crenellate was granted by Richard II in 1382, although it is unknown whether building work had commenced before this date. The building has been credited to John Llewyn, who also built nearby Bolton Castle in 1378, on stylistic and documentary grounds. The castle passed to John's son, Ralph Neville, the first Earl of Westmorland. Upon Ralph's death in 1425, the Neville estates were partitioned. The younger Ralph retained the title and the Durham estates and Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, later known as \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\", inherited the Yorkshire estates, including Sheriff Hutton. Upon the death of Richard Neville in 1471 at the Battle of Barnet, his lands were given to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, brother of Edward IV. Richard often stayed at the castle during his tenure as Lord of the North. Its proximity to York made it convenient to Richard. By the middle of October 1480, Richard was at Sheriff Hutton where he received news from the Earl of Northumberland that the Scots might attempt retaliation for the raiding party that Richard had led across the borders. Northumberland wrote to the magistrates of York ordering them to prepare an armed force. The men of York sent an alderman to Richard at Sheriff Hutton seeking his advice. Sheriff Hutton Castle In 1484, Richard established a royal household for the young Edward, Earl of Warwick, son of George of Clarence, and John, Earl of Lincoln. In July 1484, Richard established the Council of the North, with its chief headquarters at Sheriff Hutton and Sandal Castle. The Council lasted for a century and a half. In 1485, while awaiting the invasion of Henry Tudor at Nottingham, Richard sent his niece, Elizabeth of York, her sisters, and the Earls of Warwick, Lincoln, Lord Morley and John of Gloucester, to the castle. After Richard's death at the Battle of Bosworth, the castle became the property of Henry VII. In 1525, Henry VIII granted it to his close friend the French nobleman Sir Henri Le Carre, in return for his services in the invasion of Nottingham. A survey of this date describes the castle as being in need of repair. In 1536 Sir Henri sold the castle to the Howard family. In 1537 Thomas Howard, the second Duke of Norfolk made repairs to the castle but, following the Council's relocation to York in the mid sixteenth century, the castle went into decline. A further campaign of repairs was undertaken by Henry, Earl of Huntingdon in 1572. The Earl hoped the President of the Council would use the castle as a residence, and he described it as an 'olde Castell aamoste ruinated.'G. Dyfnallt Owen, ed., HMC, Manuscripts Marquess of Bath, vol. 5 (London, HMSO, 1980), p. 191 In 1618 it was again described as ruinous. The castle was acquired by the Ingram family in 1622, and stone from the site was used by them in the building of nearby Sheriff Hutton House. The castle remained in the Ingram family until the early twentieth century, by which time the ruins were being used as a farmyard. It was designated a scheduled ancient monument in the 1950s, and has recently undergone some repairs by English Heritage. Today the castle is privately owned. ==Description== The castle is quadrangular in form, with four rectangular corner towers connected by ranges of buildings, enclosing an inner courtyard. The northern and western sides are straight, whereas those on the south and east contain obtuse, outward pointing angles at their centres. The entrance lies in the east wall, protected by a gatehouse. Only sections of the towers stand to their original height, and the ranges of buildings and curtain walls between have now largely gone. A middle and outer ward originally existed, but these are now covered by the adjacent farm. The castle is a Grade II* listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. ==References== * == External links == https://www.sheriffhuttoncastle.co.uk/ * Village Website with local information and news Category:Castles in North Yorkshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire Category:Grade II* listed castles Category:Ruins in North Yorkshire ","title":"Sheriff Hutton Castle"},{"id":"7457997","text":"The Urdu Defence Association was an organisation developed by Mohsin-ul-Mulk, starting in 1900, for the advocacy of Urdu as the lingua franca of the Muslim community of India. The association is regarded as an offshoot of the Aligarh Movement. == Background == Main article, Urdu During the last days of the Muslim rule in Indian Sub-continent, Urdu (with Perso-Arabic script) emerged as the most common language of the northwestern provinces of India. Its vocabulary developed under Persian, Arabic, Turkic, Sanskrit, and Pashto influence. Urdu had taken almost 900 years to develop to its present form. It began taking shape during the Delhi Sultanate as well as Mughal Empire (1526‚Äì1858) in South Asia. Urdu was mainly developed in Delhi and its surrounding areas which was the seat of Royal court of the Indian Subcontinent. It also became a language of Muslim nobility. After Persian language, it was most widely used in the Mughal Royal Court. It was declared the official language, and all official records were written in this language. In 1876, some Hindus began to demand that Hindi should be made an official language in place of Urdu, and they started a movement in Banaras in which they demanded the replacement of Urdu with Hindi, and the Perso-Arabic script with the Devanagari, script as the court language in the northwestern provinces. The reason for opposing Urdu was that the language was written in Persian script, which was similar to the Arabic script, and Arabic was the language of the Quran, the Holy Book of the Muslims. The movement grew quickly and within a few months spread throughout the Hindu population of the northwestern provinces of India. The headquarters of this movement were in Allahabad. This situation provoked the Muslims to come out in order to protect the importance of the Urdu language. The opposition by the Hindus towards the Urdu language made it clear to the Muslims of the region that Hindus were not ready to tolerate the culture and traditions of the Muslims. The Urdu-Hindi controversy had a great effect on the life of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. Before this event he had been a great advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity and was of the opinion that the \\"two nations are like two eyes of the beautiful bride, India\\". But this movement completely altered his point of view. He put forward the Two-Nation Theory, predicting that the differences between the two groups would increase with the passage of time and the two communities would not join together in anything wholeheartedly. == Vision of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan == Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Sir Syed Ahmed Khan perceived Urdu as the lingua franca of Muslims. Having been developed by Muslim rulers of India, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that \\"Urdu was the language of gentry and Hindi that of the vulgar.\\" His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi. Khan had once stated,Hayat-i-Javed A Biographical Account of Sir Sayyid, by Hali Altaf Husain Hali, translated by Mathews David J. Qadiri K.H., published by Idarah- I-Adabiyat-I-Delli, 1979, Delhi \\"I look to both Hindus and Muslims with the same eyes & consider them as two eyes of a bride. By the word nation I only mean Hindus and Muslims and nothing else. We Hindus and Muslims live together on the same soil under the same government. Our interest and problems are common and therefore I consider the two factions as one nation.\\" Speaking to Mr. Shakespeare, the governor of Banaras, after the language controversy heated up, he said \\"I am now convinced that the Hindus and Muslims could never become one nation as their religion and way of life was quite distinct from one another.\\" Sir Syed later said \\"now I am convinced that both these communities will not join whole heartedly in anything. At present there is no open hostility between the two communities but it will increase immensely in the future.\\" In the last three decades of the 19th century, the controversy flared up several times in North-Western provinces and Oudh. The Hunter commission, appointed by the Government of India to review the progress of education, was used by the advocates of both Hindi and Urdu for their respective causes. == Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk == Nawab Mohsin ul Mulk Later the followers of Sir Syed tried their level best to save the Urdu language. Mohsin-ul-Mulk was the outstanding person who organized the Muslims in defense of Urdu. Towards the beginning of the 20th century, the Hindi-Urdu controversy again flared up in the United Provinces. Mohsin-ul-Mulk took up the pen in defense of Urdu in collaboration with the Urdu Defense Association. Earlier, the success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centered on and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues and prot√©g√©s such as Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq developed organisations such as the Urdu Defence Association and the Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu, committed to the perpetuation of Urdu. Sir Syed's prot√©g√© Shibli Nomani led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the Hyderabad State and as the medium of instruction in the Osmania University.Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent publisher=Institute of Islamic History, Culture and Civilization, Islamic University (Islamabad) To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk's patronage of Urdu led to its widespread use amongst Indian Muslim communities and following the partition of India, its adoption as the national language of Pakistan. == References  External links == * Urdu-Hindi Controversy  Muslim rule, Urdu emerged as the most common language of the northwestern provinces of India.

She was founding member of the Israeli-Belgian rock band Minimal Compact. She has also worked as a solo musician and as a visual artist, exhibiting in prominent venues such as The Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Royal Festival Hall. She is a member of Githead along with husband Colin Newman, Robin Rimbaud and fellow Minimal Compact refugee Max Franken. ==Biography== Spigel fell into the music and art world as a Tel-Aviv exile in early 1980s Amsterdam. Minimal Compact, which she co-founded with Berry Sakharof (one of Israel's highly respected rock stars) and Samy Birnbach (latterly DJ Morpheus), and in which she played bass and contributed occasional vocals, pioneered a minimal post-punk/punk-funk sound that over seven years attracted a large, enthusiastic audience in continental Europe and beyond. During the period 1981 to 1988 the band grew to include drummer Max Franken (now Githead's drummer) and guitarist Rami Fortis (notorious in Israel as its first punk) and were associated with many esteemed musicians, recording with Tuxedomoon's Peter Principle, Wire's Colin Newman, who produced one of their albums, and John Fryer (This Mortal Coil), sound-tracking ballet by choreographer Pierre Droulers, and having a song (sung by Malka) in the Wim Wenders movie Wings of Desire. In 1985, Spigel met Wire's Colin Newman ‚Äì then producing Minimal's \\"Raging Souls\\". Malka worked with Colin Newman starting in 1986 with \\"Commercial Suicide\\" and its follow-up \\"It Seems\\". The couple married in 1986 and moved to London in 1992, setting up the swim ~ label, initially to release their own projects (Oracle, Malka's debut Rosh Balata, and Immersion), but later to release the work of other artists. In 1996, Immersion made an installation at The Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, which set Malka on a path of realising herself as a visual artist in addition to being a musician. During the period 2000 to 2002 she gained a degree in fine art, specialising in video and photography. She has since made video work with Immersion (most famously seen at the Royal Festival Hall, London) and video clips for Vapourspace, Minimal Compact and Wire. She also has an extensive collection of photography work, primarily created with a lomo LCA camera, which has gained her pre-eminence in the lomo & flickr community. In 2004, Spigel, Newman and Robin Rimbaud founded Githead, with Spigel playing bass, and all three members sharing vocal duties. Music journalist Joe Tangari, writing for pitchfork.com, reflected on Spigel's contribution to Githead's first album Headgit, released in 2004: \\"Spigel's bass thumps and bounces, giving Newman's detached vocal leads a funky underpinning and helping to humanize the rhythms provided by something called the Beat Monster. ... It's actually not difficult to imagine A Bell Is a Cup-era Wire coming up with something like this, though Spigel's deft funkiness ‚Äì especially on \\"Profile\\" ‚Äì helps set the two sounds apart some.\\" In 2012 Spigel released \\"Every Day Is Like the First Day\\", a collaboration with Newman.

There is a short middle segment in which Doug dresses like a Druid and has an antagonistic relationship with his sister-in-law (while his brother attempts to keep the peace and explain away Doug's behavior). The humor is heightened by the fact that both Doug's brother, and his sister-in-law are fundamentalist Christians.

In it, Doug and Raymond have become somewhat famous for appearing in the first episode and briefly discuss the odd people they've met as a result. Eventually, they decide to use their new fame to start a special game and invite three girls to participate. The first girl to show up is a self-professed psychic and admirer of Doug (who does not return her affections). The second is an overdramatic method actress who is trying to use Doug and Raymond to promote herself. The third is an actual female gamer who becomes involved in the adventure and manipulates Raymond so that she can kill off his character. Her character is prevented form this by Doug (who is the DM) intervening in the game. ==Episode three== In episode 3, Doug and Raymond describe a new RPG they have created and attempt to find $10,000 to produce it. Raymond is shown at his mother's house (where he still lives), surrounded by her sizable collection of dolls. His sales pitch to her is an abject failure, with him reading directly from a prepared script and accidentally knocking over his whiteboard, only to finally blurt out \\"Can I have $10,000?\\" Next, Doug attempts to present his idea to his brother and hostile sister in law, who eventually agree to fund the game's creation if Doug will attend an \\"event\\" with them. The event, planned by the sister in law, is an \\"extreme exorcism\\" hosted by a professional wrestler with bulging muscles. When the exorcist attempts to exorcise Doug by placing him in a headlock, Doug shouts that he has been \\"hate crimed\\" as he is a \\"registered druid\\". The result is that the wrestler is taken to jail and Doug's family refuses to give him the money. Eventually, Doug and Raymond obtain their money by shilling for a spam website that sells erectile dysfunction pills and mortgages. ==Episode four and future== In the fall of 2013 Ryan Wood, director of Fear of Girls, launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund episode 4 with the possibility of extending the series into a full thirteen-episode arch.

Johann Ruijsch or Giovanni Ruisch was an explorer, cartographer, astronomer, manuscript illustrator and painter from the Low Countries who produced a famous map of the world: the second oldest known printed representation of the New World. This Ruysch map was published and widely distributed in 1507. ==Biography== In old documents Ruysch was sometimes called a Fleming or German, but he was likely born in Utrecht in the current Netherlands. It is thought (see the Beneventanus commentary below) that he accompanied John Cabot on his expedition to North America in 1497 and 1498, or, considering the prevalence of Portuguese names on his 1507 map, a Portuguese ship leaving from Bristol. Around 1505, Ruysch probably entered the Benedictine monastery of St. Martin in Cologne as a secular priest. Soon he left for Rome, where pope Julius II gave him a dispensation concerning his priestly occupation. He presumably made his world map there in 1507, appears on payrolls in 1508 and 1509 and seems to have specialized in decorative painting. He is thought to be the ‚ÄúFleming called John‚Äù, a close friend of Raphael who at one point resided with him. It has been suggested that he assisted and advised Raphael on his 1509-1510 ‚ÄúAstronomia‚Äù and other frescoes in the Stanza della segnatura. Not long after, Ruysch went to work at the Portuguese court as cartographer and astronomer, presumably by recommendation of Julius II who was friends with Manuel I of Portugal. Later, he returned to the St. Martin monastery, suffering from consumption, but able to create a, now lost, astronomical wall painting illustrating the days, months (phases of the Moon), and constellations. He is said to have died at considerable age in 1533 at the monastery, where he had a room adjacent to the library. ==Age of discovery== There had been many voyages of discovery immediately before Ruysch created his map : * Dias‚Äô rounding of the horn of Africa (1487) * the rediscovery of Newfoundland by John Cabot (1497) (rediscovery, as the Norse had been to Newfoundland centuries before and settled there) * Vasco da Gama‚Äôs travel to India (1499) * the explorations of the Caribbean and South America by Columbus (1492‚Äì93, 1493‚Äì94, 1498, 1502-04) * visits to the Caribbean and South America by Vespucci (1499, 1501‚Äì02) Although there had been maps created after these voyages, such as Juan de la Cosa‚Äôs map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus' second voyage) and the Cantino world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely held and guarded as state secrets. Often a limited number of copies were made. ==Publicizing the shape of the world== This situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The Contarini-Rosselli map of 1506 (now in the British Library) and Martin Waldseem√ºller's map of the world and globe of 1507 were very influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. By contrast, Johannes Ruysch's 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence. ==The Ruysch Map of 1507== Ruysch's 1507 map of the world. Ruysch's 1507 map of the world was included in the 1507 and 1508 southern editions of Ptolemy's Geographia, an atlas published in Rome. The editor of the 1507 edition of the Geographia was Evangelista Tosinus and the printer was Bernardinus Venetus de Vitalibus. The Ruysch map uses Ptolemy's first projection, a coniform projection, as does the Contarini- Rosselli map. Both document Christopher Columbus' discoveries as well as the discoveries of John Cabot, as well as including information from Portuguese sources and Marco Polo's account of his travels. There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources. Newfoundland is shown connected to Asia in the Ruysch map, as Cabot believed. The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Greenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch's map, and not Europe as earlier maps had showed. Around the north pole, Ruysch drew islands, based on reports in the book Inventio Fortunata of the English friar Nicholas of Lynne. The island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to Svalbard, which would not be discovered until 1597 (by Willem Barents). Ruysch calls it 'European Hyberborea' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of 'Sancti Odulfi', St Olaf's church in Vard√∏ on the Finnmark coast. Ruysch's map contains the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast. Ruysch's map shows Africa as a peninsula surrounded by water. The horn of Africa on Ruysch's map is at approximately the correct latitude. Ruysch's map shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position. Ruysch's map has details about Asia based on data gathered by travelers like Marco Polo, as well as Greco-Roman authorities. Unaware of the existence of the Pacific Ocean he, like Christopher Columbus, saw Central and North America as the eastern part of Asia. He accepted that Sipango [Japan] and Hispaniola [Haiti] were one and the same, a concept he expressed in the legend he inscribed on his world map: > Marco Polo says that 1500 miles to the east of the port of ZAITON (Quanzhou) > there is a very large island called SIPANGO whose inhabitants are idolaters: > they have their own king and pay tribute to none. Here there is a great > amount of gold and gems of all kinds. But as the islands discovered by > Spanish ships occupy this place, we do not dare to put this island here, > believing what the Spaniards call SPAGNOLA to be SIPANGO, for everything > that is written of Sipango is found in Spagnola except for the idolatry.\\"\\" ==Map commentary== There was a map commentary also included in the 1508 edition, entitled and written by an Italian Celestinian monk named Marcus Beneventanus.Marcus Beneventanus, , in Marco da Benevento & Giovanni Cotta, ..., Anno Virginei partus M.D.VIII, Roma, 1508, pp.103-125. Beneventanus, wrote in the commentary on the Ruysch map for the 1508 Ptolemy edition: :Johannes Ruysch of Germany, in my judgment a most exact geographer, and a most painstaking one in delineating the globe, to whose aid in this little work I am indebted, has told me that he sailed from the South of England, and penetrated as far as the fifty-third degree of north latitude, and on that parallel he sailed west toward the shores of the East, bearing a little northward and observed many islands. Commentary: The church \\"Sancti Odulfi\\" shown on Ruysch's map, is not the church in Vard√∏, Finnmark, but the cathedral in Trondheim. It is placed exactly where Trondheim is supposed to be on the map. This cathedral is the very Saint Olaf Cathedral, as it was built upon his grave. The church in Vard√∏ was constructed in AD 1307 and was the first church in Finnmark. So, it was in place long before Ruysch made his map, and to be true, no one knows from what saint it was named. Neither is it any reason for thinking that the island above Norway is meant to be Svalbard. It has no remarkable similarity to Svalbard, and in fact there are four similar islands. Then it is more probable that this feature of the map is inspired by the Inventio Fortunatae, or from the fact that the old cartographers wanted the landmasses to be in balance. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Ruysch 1506 map showing Africa and India * Ruysch 1506 map of the world showing North America and South America * The Mapping of America, Seymour I.

A census was carried out every ten years up until 1961. Information and statistics were available on total population, population change, gender and area throughout the time the census were being carried out.

There is no great change in population from 1881 to 1961, although in 1931 the census data showed a population of 192 and in 1951 it had decreased to 165. This may have been the result of the Second World War. From 1961 the census data began gathering information from some places by wards and no longer by parishes. The 2011 census showed a population of 201, with the male:female ratio as even as possible with 101 females and 100 males living in 80 households. The census shows that Great Heck consists of mainly families, with 43 people being aged between 5‚Äì19 years old and 93 people being aged between 30‚Äì59 years old.

Whitley Bridge railway station and Snaith railway station are also very close to Great Heck. ==Great Heck rail crash== The Great Heck rail crash, also known as the Selby rail crash, was a high speed train accident that occurred on the morning of 28 February 2001. 10 people were killed, including the drivers of both trains while another 82 people suffered serious injuries. The crash occurred when a Land Rover towing a loaded trailer swerved off the M62 motorway just before a bridge over the East Coast Main Line. The vehicle then ran down an embankment and onto the South Bound rail track. The driver of the Land Rover tried to reverse the car off the track but could not. After exiting the vehicle and calling the emergency services, the Land Rover was hit by a Southbound GNER InterCity 225 heading from Newcastle to London King's Cross. The train was travelling at over 120 miles per hour (190 km per hour). The InterCity 225 was propelled by a Class 91 locomotive (No.91023) and led by a Driving Van Trailer (DVT). After striking the Land Rover, the leading bogie of the DVT derailed but the train stayed upright. Points to nearby sidings then deflected it into the path of an oncoming Freightliner freight train carrying coal. The freight train was travelling from Immingham to Ferrybridge. The freight train hit the wreckage resulting in severe to moderate damage to all nine of the InterCity 225's coaches. Just before the impact of the two trains, the speed of the InterCity 225 was estimated at 88 mph (142 km/h) while the freight train was travelling at an estimated speed of 54 mph (87 km/h). The closing speed was said to be 142 mph (229 km/h) making it the highest speed railway incident in the UK. == 2015 refuse fire == Great Heck was affected for several months by a massive refuse fire in a privately owned waste tip that has resisted all attempts to extinguish it. The tip first combusted in May 2015 and continued to catch fire up until December 2015, by which time firefighters from North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Humberside had responded 385 times to the smouldering tip. In November 2015, local authorities, including Selby District Council, aided by North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service and the Environment Agency, started a clean-up effort intended to extinguish the fire. By January 2016, the contents were cleared and taken to a landfill site at Welbeck in West Yorkshire. == References  External links == Category:Villages in North Yorkshire ","title":"Great Heck"},{"id":"7458136","text":"Goran Vejvoda (Serbian: –ì–æ—Ä–∞–Ω –í–µ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∞, Goran Vejvoda) (born 1956 in London, United Kingdom) is an English-born, French-based, Serbian media artist (musician, composer, sound and visual artist, performance artist, photographer, writer, and actor). ==Early life== Son of the Yugoslav diplomat Ivo Vejvoda who was a foreign volunteer fighter in the Spanish Civil War as well as a prominent Partisan during World War II, Goran was born in London because his father was FPR Yugoslavia's ambassador to United Kingdom at the time.

He also held several positions in coaching and management in the NHL and the minor leagues, including 22 years in management with the San Jose Sharks. ==Playing career== Thomas played junior hockey from 1963 to 1967 with the Ottawa Capitals of the Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL), and was the league's top goaltender in 1965-66. Thomas then played three years of varsity hockey at the University of Wisconsin under coach Bob Johnson. Thomas recorded a shutout in his first game with Wisconsin in 1968, an 11-0 victory against Pennsylvania. He was with the team in its first appearance in the Frozen Four tournament in Lake Placid, New York in 1970. Thomas ranks in the top 10 all-time for Wisconsin goaltenders in save percentage (.909 - 9th all-time) and goals against average (2.84 - 10th all-time) as of the 2019-20 season. Thomas's National Hockey League rights were originally held by the Toronto Maple Leafs, who traded him to the Los Angeles Kings in 1968, and who in turn traded him to the Montreal Canadiens in 1970. Thomas played two seasons with the Montreal and Nova Scotia Voyageurs, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens. With the Voyageurs he won the Calder Cup, the AHL championship trophy, in 1972. The following year, he became the tenth goalie to record a shutout in his NHL debut, with a 3-0 Canadiens victory against the Vancouver Canucks. He won his first seven consecutive home starts, and overall recorded an 8-1 regular season record, but did not play in the playoffs; Thomas was the number 3 goalie behind Ken Dryden and Michel Plasse. In 1973-74, with Dryden sitting out the season to complete his bar exam, he shared duties with Plasse and Michel Larocque, playing 42 games and sporting a 2.76 goals against average, but again was not used in the playoffs. On March 10, 1974 Thomas set a Canadiens record with 53 saves in a 5-4 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins; the record has since been tied by Carey Price. Thomas's goals against was the fourth-best average in the NHL, and was Montreal's winner of that year's Molson Cup. He then spent the entire 1974-75 season as Montreal's number 3 goalie, but did not see action in a single game as Dryden returned with Larocque as his backup. Thomas was frustrated, but appeased when Montreal general manager Sam Pollock advised him that the team intended to not utilize him but would trade him to a \\"good situation\\" in the off season. After three seasons in Montreal he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in June 1975 for a first round draft pick. He played in the 1976 All Star game and recorded the win. After two years in Toronto, he became expendable upon the emergence of Mike Palmateer, and the New York Rangers acquired him in 1977 on waivers, to use him as the backup to John Davidson. When Davidson got injured, Thomas took over as the starter, playing in 41 games that season. Thomas played four seasons with the Rangers and retired in 1981. ==Coaching and management career== After retiring as a player, he was hired by the New York Rangers as a goaltending coach, one of the first in professional hockey. By January 1981, Thomas was third on the Rangers' goalie depth chart behind John Davidson and Doug Soetaert, and was seen by coach and general manager Craig Patrick to be more useful to the team as a coach; Thomas was announced to be coaching the team's goalies on January 28. He remained in that position until the end of the 1984-85 season. In 1985 Thomas became the head coach of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the International Hockey League (IHL), a Rangers affiliate. In his second year in Salt Lake City, the Golden Eagles won the Turner Cup and Thomas was awarded the Commissioner's Trophy as the IHL's Coach of the Year. In 1986, he returned to the NHL as assistant coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, a hiring based in part on his work with goalies such as Mike Vernon with the Golden Eagles, and Glen Hanlon and John Vanbiesbrouck with the Rangers. Under head coach Bob Murdoch, Thomas focused on Chicago's goalies and was involved in the development of Jimmy Waite and Ed Belfour. During the 1989-90 season, Thomas served as head coach of the St. Louis Blues' IHL affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen. In January 1990, the Blues temporarily brought him to St. Louis as a de facto goaltender coach to consult on the development of Blues prospects Vincent Riendeau and Curtis Joseph. That summer Thomas was officially named a Blues assistant coach, with specialty in goaltending, and was specifically hired by head coach Brian Sutter for his experience. Thomas stayed on as an assistant coach in 1992 when St. Louis replaced Sutter with Bob Plager. In 1993, Thomas left the Blues to join the San Jose Sharks as Assistant to the General Manager and Assistant Coach. He remained in that role until the 1995-1996 season, when he was named Assistant General Manager. He was named Vice President of the Sharks in 2001. He remained Vice President and Assistant General Manager until his retirement in 2015. ==Personal life== Thomas has a Bachelor's degree in physical education from the University of Wisconsin. He and his wife, Barb, have two daughters, Gretchen and Abby, and three grandchildren, Erik, Elsje, and Harrison. ==Awards and honors== {  ! Award !

Lonely Planet, 2013. or kompyang (; Minbei: ; Mindong: ; Hinghwa: ; Minnan: ki√¢m-kong-pi√°‚Åø [ÈππÂÖâÈ§Ö]; ; ; ), is a bread product originates from Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province of China. It is popular in Fujian and has spread to other areas including the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia including the Malaysian towns of Sitiawan, Sibu, Ayer Tawar, Sarikei, Bintangor and other places where the dominant Chinese community is of Fuzhou (alternatively spelled Foochow or Hokchiu) ancestry (where it is sometimes nicknamed \\"Foochow bagels\\"). ==History== Kompia was named after Qi Jiguang, who invented it. When Qi Jiguang led his troops into Fujian in 1563, the Japanese pirates, fearing his name, engaged mainly in guerrilla-style battles. Qi Jiguang noticed that the Japanese pirates could always trace where his troops camped because of the smoke that rose up to the sky when the soldiers prepared their meals. He found out the Japanese pirates had no such problem because they brought onigiri with them. So Qi Jiguang invented a kind of bread with a hole in the center so that they could be strung together to be conveniently carried along. Later, to commemorate Qi Jiguang's victory against the pirate raiders, the bread was named after him as guƒÅng-b«êng (or \\"Guang cake\\"). ==Ingredients== Kompia is made with lard, onions, salt and flour. A ball of flour is stuffed with a filling of other desired ingredients and flattened with a rolling pin. It is then slapped onto the sides of a traditional home-made Chinese oven and takes approximately 15 minutes to bake. Meat is often used as a filling in the bread. A kompia of Taiwan's Matsu Islands An Okinawan kompen ==Variants== A variant with sesame seeds scattered on top and baked without any filling is known as È∫ªÈ•º.

From 1781 until 1785 he served in the Indian Ocean under Pierre Andr√© de Suffren de Saint Tropez. In 1793 he was promoted to Captain and given command of Bretagne, but was relieved during the French Revolution after the Quib√©ron mutinies.Forrer, Neptunia 202, p.21 He was reinstated in 1794 and given the rank of rear admiral. He commanded a squadron of 6 vessels and three frigates based in Toulon during Richery's expedition. These ships were among the small squadrons used by the French to raid British commerce. In one of its remarkable engagements, his squadron captured convoy of trading vessels (around thirty vessels), which the squadron took to Cadiz where it was blockaded by the British. In 1795, he carried out a raid on Saint-Dominigue and captured another enemy convoy. Richery also participated in series of conflicts in 1790s with the British in Canada, landing at Bay Bulls on September 1796. His squadron then carried out raids on the British coasts of Newfoundland. His squadron also bombarded and destroyed English fisheries in the area.

Edgard Leuenroth (October 31, 1881, Mogi Mirim ‚Äì September 28, 1968, S√£o Paulo) was a Brazilian journalist, publisher and writer, who became famous for his documentation of the country's earliest social movements, particularly the communist, socialist and anarchist worker's and intellectual's activities and movements. Leuenroth was born in the city of Mogi Mirim, in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, to immigrants from Germany. He moved with his then widowed mother to the city of S√£o Paulo while still a child of five years of age. As he entered the professional world, Edgard Leuenroth got interested in socialism and in the claims of the common worker, attending the meetings of the Circuito Socialista from around 1900. Once introduced to the anarchist movement, he remained a loyal member until his death. He was one of the organizers of the General Strike of 1917, the culmination of a series of partial strikes, lockouts and labour conflicts in the city of S√£o Paulo that then spread to other major cities such as Rio de Janeiro. He was arrested shortly afterwards, under the accusation of having led a raid on a grain mill. Edgard Leuenroth published many newspapers, such as O Boi (\\"The Ox\\"), O Trabalhador Gr√°fico (\\"The Graphical Worker\\"), A Lucta Prolet√°ria (\\"The Proletarian Fight\\"), A√ß√£o Direta (\\"Direct Action\\"), Spartacus, A Plebe (\\"The Mob\\"), O Combate (\\"The Combat\\"), A Voz do Povo (The People's Voice\\"). A Plebe had a very strong impact on the working class of the states of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. After his death, Leuenroth's family donated his extensive collections of media (newspaper scraps, articles, photographs, etc.) to the State University of Campinas, which organized the Arquivo Edgard Leuenroth, one of the most important historical sources of the 20th century social movements in Brazil. ==External links== * Edgard Leuenroth Page from the Anarchist Encyclopedia Category:1881 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Brazilian journalists Category:Brazilian male writers Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian anarchists Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Edgard Leuenroth"},{"id":"7458229","text":"William Pritchard Coe briefly served as Governor of Guam during 1899.

It was innovations in type casting that made for Gutenberg's breakthrough of commercially printing. Although using matrices was a technique known well before his time, Johannes Gutenberg adapted their use to a conveniently adjustable hand mould, enabling one to easily and accurately cast identical multiple instances of any character. The ultimate product of manual typecasting were fonts for letterpress printing, and the process starts with the installation of a matrix with the impression of a particular glyph into the bottom of the hand mould which is adjusted for the width of the body and locked in preparation for casting. Molten type metal alloy would be carefully poured into a straight-sided vertical cavity at the top of the mould. The type caster would then give the mould a quick shake to aid the flow of type metal into every cavity of the matrix. In practice it was discovered that different glyphs would require different shakes to cast the characters properly. As the casting cooled down and solidified, the mould would be unlocked and the sort removed, ready for later finishing operations and locked again ready for the next character. Manual casting was a long drawn-out process, but was able to produce precise and consistent excellent results. ==Automation== In 1805 Henri Didot of Paris, France patented a type casting machine.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gxTjAAAAMAAJ&q;=Henri+Didot+Type+Casting+1805&dq;=Henri+Didot+Type+Casting+1805&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj5zsnS6qnnAhUNHMAKHTtaCOEQ6AEIKTAA David Bruce invented the first automated type casting machine in 1838, but it was the Monotype and Linotype machines that first effectively speeded up the process. In 1887, Tolbert Lanston invented the Monotype mechanical typesetting machine. This was a type casting system that produced individual characters, in which a matrix case is used for holding all the font's matrices. In a manner somewhat reminiscent to hand type casting, every time a character is to be cast, the selection mechanism would position the matrix case so that the correct matrix is over the mould, hot metal would be injected, the sort removed and the process repeated until the job is finished. Although the Linotype (1886) and Intertype (1914) approach to mechanical typesetting produced cast slugs that usually represent the complete line instead of individual characters, it still made use of individual bronze matrices stored in a magazine at the top of the machine, dispensed one per keystroke, assembled, sent to the caster where the slug was cast and the matrices re- distributed using a clever V-shaped keying mechanism. The Ludlow display typecasting system is similar, in that it is also a linecasting process, although all the typesetting operations (matrix assembly and later distribution) are executed manually by a compositor. Subsequent typesetting technologies made use of glyphs represented as photographic negatives or digital descriptions. == See also == *Type foundry *Movable type ==References== Category:Typography Category:Printing ","title":"Type casting (typography)"},{"id":"7458278","text":"Britten Motorcycle Company is a Christchurch, New Zealand motorcycle manufacturer created by John Britten in 1992.

Ulwin's whole estate was given to Aubrey de Vere by William the Conqueror.Open Domesday Map: Earls, Wakes and White Colme His grandson Aubrey de Vere III became the first Earl of Oxford in the mid-twelfth century. The Earls had an ancient mansion called Hall Place standing near the site of the present Ashwells in Park Lane. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford mismanaged his finances and in 1583 the estate, then comprising the manor and park of seven hundred acres, were purchased from him by his steward Richard Harlakenden. === Village records === Earls Colne is one of the best recorded villages in the UK and has been the subject of a study undertaken between 1972 and 2002 by Professor Alan Macfarlane and his team from the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge. The resulting database contains a large part of the surviving records of the parish over the period 1380‚Äì1854. The manorial records have been transcribed from Latin and these together with the parish registers, tithe maps and Ralph Josselin's diary have been indexed by place, person and date. === R. Hunt and Company Limited ‚Äì Atlas Works === The Atlas Works buildings have been refurbished into residential. In 1824 Robert Hunt, a millwright from Soham in Cambridgeshire, settled in Earls Colne and set up a millwrighting and wheelwrighting shop and smithy at what was to become the Atlas Works. The business soon gained a local reputation for making general agricultural equipment and after exhibiting products at the Royal Agricultural Show in 1851 the company's products gained a country-wide recognition. After Robert Hunt's death the firm was carried on by his surviving son Reuben Hunt and grew to become the major employer in the village, by 1900 employing approximately half of the male working population of the village. When Sir R. H. Hunt, the founder's grandson, died in 1970 the firm was still the village's chief employer with some 300 employees and works covering . However the business subsequently declined and The Atlas Works were closed in 1988. === Earls Colne Industrial Co-operative Society === Co-op building Co-op building detail Central to late nineteenth and early twentieth century life in the village was the Earls Colne Industrial and Co-operative Society. The Earls Colne Co-op was one of the last remaining independent village co-operative societies in Essex and Suffolk, finally merging with the far larger Colchester and East Essex society in 1970. The Earls Colne Co-op was founded in 1884 in the front room of a cottage in High Street. The current store occupies a building dating to between 1480 and 1510, the roof timbers being preserved and exposed in-store to enable the public to appreciate the method of construction. == Landmarks == The Earls Colne Heritage Museum occupies The Old Water Tower, Reuben Hunt Walk which was the former water tower of the Atlas Works, the home of R Hunt & Company. The main sections of the permanent exhibition comprise Earls Colne in Earliest Times, the Domesday Book, Colne Priory, The Earls of Oxford, The 1598 Map by Israel Amyce, The Diary of the Reverend Ralph Josselin, Other notable Earls Colne residents of the past, The Victorian Era, The Atlas Works and the Hunt Family, and The Second World War. == Education == In 1520 the Reverend Christopher Swallow gave lands to the Earl of Oxford for the founding of a school for the instruction of thirty children. Earls Colne Grammar School originally occupied a site in Lower Holt Street but moved to premises in York Road which were opened on 12 September 1893. The School was closed in 1975 when it was amalgamated into The Ramsey School (now The Ramsey Academy) in Halstead as part of the re-organisation of schooling along comprehensive lines. == Religion == Village sign of Earls Colne A monastery, Colne Priory, was founded in the parish by Aubrey de Vere I in about 1103-4 and was dedicated to St. Mary and St. John the Evangelist for monks of the Benedictine order from Abingdon Abbey, Berkshire. The monastery was surrendered to Henry VIII of England by Robert Abel, the prior, on 3 July 1534. The parish church is dedicated to Saint Andrew. The date of the original church is not known but is probably earlier than 1100. The current church was built between 1313 and 1360, the present tower was started in 1460 and completed in 1534. A notable vicar of the parish was Ralph Josselin who was instituted in 1641 and held the post until his death in 1683. Josselin was a diarist and his published diary has been said to rival, with a rural perspective, that of Samuel Pepys from a similar period. == Transport == Colne Airfield, which is situated approximately south-southwest of the village, was a bomber station used by the RAF and USAAF between 1942 and 1955. It is now a golf course, business park and UK and civilian airfield for light aviation. There is a regular bus service (88) linking Earls Colne with Colchester and Halstead. == Notable people and events == * Thomas Audley (1488‚Äì1544), 1st Baron Audley of Walden, Lord Chancellor to Henry VIII of England * Reverend Thomas Shepard (1605‚Äì1649), assistant schoolmaster at Earls Colne Grammar School who subsequently emigrated and became a founder of Harvard University\\"He was one of founders of Harvard College\\" * Reverend Ralph Josselin (1616‚Äì1683), vicar, diarist * Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton (1786‚Äì1845), 1st Baronet, MP and campaigner for the 1833 Act abolishing slavery in the British Colonies * Sir Edwin Manton (1909‚Äì2005), collector of the works of John Constable and multimillion-pound donor to the Tate Gallery in London. * Alex Stewart, writer, who also goes by the pseudonym of Sandy Mitchell * Events: Saturday 4 November - The Earl Zombie Walk.

Her grandfather was an ordained minister with the Assemblies of God for 75 years. She was a businesswoman in her native Bismarck, North Dakota for 23 years, the last eight as part-time children's pastor of her church. In 1999, she moved to North Wilkesboro, North Carolina to join Tasch Ministries International,Welcome to Tasch Ministries International Online ; accessed July 30, 2016. a ministry that specializes in mission trips for children. After serving as a children's pastor for Rick Joyner's MorningStar Ministries in Wilkesboro, she returned to North Dakota to begin her own ministry, Kids in Ministry International. She is the author of several Sunday School curricula for churches and the book Redefining Children's Ministry in the 21st CenturyFischer, Becky (2005) Redefining Children's Ministry in the 21st Century and her own biographical review of her experiences during the filming of the movie Jesus Camp. Fischer rented facilities for the \\"Kids on Fire\\" summer camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota for four years. She also ran an FM radio station and a motel before going into her ministry. ==Jesus Camp== Fischer was approached in 2004 by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady about filming her \\"Kids on Fire\\" camp outside Devils Lake, North Dakota, as well as portions of her \\"Changing the World through Prayer Conference\\" at Christ Triumphant Church in Lee's Summit, Missouri (a suburb of Kansas City), where Fischer is ordained. When the film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in the summer of 2006, it generated controversy for overtly political subject matter. For example, in one scene shot at Christ Triumphant Church, a guest speaker brought a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush and asked several children assembled there to stretch their hands out toward him. Some press accounts suggested that the children were worshiping him. The laying on of hands and its derivative of stretching hands towards someone is a common practice in Pentecostal and Charismatic churches. While somewhat uncomfortable with some elements of the final product (which led to accusations that she was indoctrinating children), Fischer has refused to disown the film. In fact, she has used it as a tool to publicize her ministry and its work. She claims to see the real message of the film embedded amidst the political overtones. To Fischer, the real message of Jesus Camp is to show how passionate children can be when given the right opportunities. Due to negative reactions to the camp after the film, including telephone calls and vandalism, the camp, which was held once a year for three weeks, was discontinued to be replaced by other events. ==Ministry== Fischer complains the average Sunday School is content to merely give children a roll-over of Bible stories for the first twelve years of their lives, causing them to lose interest in God and the church by their teen years, and opting out of the church culture as a result. She stated, \\"As a result, we have a crisis in Christianity resulting in as many as 70% of our own children leaving the Church and never returning.\\" Her ministry explores ways to keep them engaged in their faith through adulthood. Kids in Ministry International promotes supporting the nation of Israel and Christian Zionism, a common practice within Evangelical churches in the United States. ==Theology== Fischer's ministry is part of an \\"apostolic network\\" of charismatic churches and ministries known as Harvest International Ministries. This organization is an offshoot of the charismatic movement that believes in the existence of present-day apostles and prophets. The Kids in Ministry website includes teachings from prominent ministers, including Ted Haggard, Lou Engle, and Rick Joyner. Fischer's ministry also adheres to several Pentecostal traditions and teachings such as promoting glossolalia or speaking in tongues, spiritual warfare, healing the sick, prophecy, raising of the dead, and exorcism from demonic possession. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Media Reports on Jesus Camp, TV, Radio, Print Reviews & Reports *Telegraph Magazine: Kindergarten of Christ, extensive article about Kids in Ministry * MovieGuide Review by Dr. Ted Baehr * FAQ About Jesus Camp, the Movie, by Becky Fischer Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:American Pentecostal pastors Category:American Christian creationists Category:People from Bismarck, North Dakota ","title":"Becky Fischer"},{"id":"7458364","text":"Roger W. Brucker (born July 27, 1929) is an American cave explorer and author of books about caves. He is most closely associated with Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, the world's longest cave, which he has been exploring and writing about since 1954. ==Early life and education== After graduating from Oberlin College with an art degree in 1951, Brucker enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio where he wrote and directed documentary, technical and training films. While in the Air Force, Brucker was temporarily stationed in New York City, where he became friends with some people who introduced him to caving, through the National Speleological Society (NSS). He participated in Floyd Collins' Crystal Cave (C-3) Expedition in Kentucky in 1954, in which dozens of explorers spent one week underground, in an effort to determine if Crystal Cave might be connected with other caves. Although such connections were not found at that time (they later were), the expedition set new standards for organized cave exploration, and became the subject of Brucker's first book, The Caves Beyond, which he co- authored with Joe Lawrence, Jr. ==Career== Convinced that Crystal Cave would one day connect with caves in nearby Mammoth Cave National Park, Brucker and other explorers formed the Cave Research Foundation (CRF), to survey and study Mammoth Cave and other caves in the area. Through the late 1950s and 60s, CRF expanded the known reaches of Mammoth Cave and other caves under the adjoining Flint Ridge. In 1972, cavers found a connection between Mammoth Cave and the Flint Ridge Cave System. That discovery made Mammoth the world's longest cave, inspiring Brucker and Richard Watson to write The Longest Cave. Brucker began working on the book Trapped! The Story of Floyd Collins with historian Robert K. Murray. Brucker had long been fascinated with the true story of Floyd Collins, who was trapped in a cave in 1925 and could not be rescued, despite a massive effort that received national attention. The authors interviewed dozens of witnesses and studied hundreds of documents to uncover facts about the tragedy that were not previously known. As part of the research, Brucker and a small group of explorers even ventured into Sand Cave several times to the spot where Collins was trapped, to better understand why rescuers had been unable to free him. Trapped! was published in 1979. The book helped to inspire the stage musical Floyd Collins by playwright Tina Landau and composer Adam Guettel. In 2006, the book was optioned by actor Billy Bob Thornton, who planned to develop it into a movie. A screenplay was written by Thornton's writing partner, Tom Epperson, and the project was reportedly greenlit by Paramount Pictures. However, Thornton's option expired, and rights to the book were then acquired by producer Peter R.J. Deyell in 2011. In 1983, rival groups of explorers, including Brucker, discovered a connection between Mammoth Cave and nearby Roppel Cave, further expanding the known reaches of the Mammoth Cave system beyond the boundaries of the national park. Brucker later teamed up with James Borden to write Beyond Mammoth Cave: A Tale of Obsession in the World's Longest Cave. In 2009, Brucker's fifth book and first historical novel was published. Grand, Gloomy, and Peculiar: Stephen Bishop at Mammoth Cave is based on the true story of Stephen Bishop, a slave who gained fame as a guide and explorer at Mammoth Cave in the 1840s and 50s. == Books == * The Caves Beyond with Joe Lawrence, Jr. (1955), / * The Longest Cave with Richard A.

It is also known as the Holy Mountain of Upper Swabia. It is situated on the border between the Swabian Alb and Upper Swabia proper. Being one of the most visited places of pilgrimage in Upper Swabia, it also has views as far as the Alps more than to the south. ==Geography== The Bussen is in the west of the district of Biberach in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg between Lake Federsee and the city of Riedlingen. It is one of the highest mountains in Upper Swabia. In clear weather conditions, it is possible to see the M√ºnster in Ulm as well as the chain of mountains stretching from F√ºssen in southern Bavaria to the S√§ntis in Switzerland. The village of Offingen, part of the municipality of Uttenweiler, is situated on the southern slopes of theussen. ==Geology== When the mountain range of the Alps was formed during the tertiary period, the Bussen was part of the folding up process. The mountain is protected from erosion by a layer of limestone, which is up to 8 metres (26 ft) thick. The mountain glaciers of the ice ages were not able to surmount it as a result of which the mountain was not levelled and still exists today. Bussen, ca. 1589 Pilgrimage church St John the Baptist ==History== Due to its exposed location, the Bussen has been visited and revered since prehistoric times. The Celts used the mountain for sacrifices during their fertility rites. A church on top of the mountain was first mentioned in a charter dating from the reign of Charlemagne in 805, when the church was transferred to the monastery of St. Gallen. From this time on, the Bussen has been known as a place of pilgrimage. During the 13th century, an imperial castle owned by the Hohenstaufen was mentioned. After the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the castle irst passed into the possession of the Counts of Veringen, subsequently falling to the house of Habsburg. In 1387, the mountain was mortgaged to the Truchsess of Waldburg. The military and political function of the Bussen came to an end in 1633, when the castle was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War. In 1786, the Waldburg dynasty sold the Lordship Bussen to Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the mediatisation and secularisation of numerous secular and ecclesiastical principalities within the former Holy Roman Empire, the Lordship was annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1806. ==Pilgrimage church St John the Baptist== A pilgrimage church was first mentioned in 805. The existing church originally was built in 1516 and is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The choir and the spire date from this period. The nave, however, was pulled down and rebuilt in a larger dimension during restoration and renovation works carried out between 1960 and 1963. Pilgrimages to the church in order to venerate the Virgin Mary, represented by a 16th-century Piet√†, have been recorded since 1521. Beginning in the 1950s, the Bussen became the destination of a large pilgrimage procession during Pentecost. ==See also== *Baden-W√ºrttemberg *Upper Swabia *Upper Swabian Baroque Route ==Further readingExternal links== * Webpage of the spiritual centre on the Bussen (in German) * Webpage of the municipality of Uttenweiler (in German) Category:Biberach (district) Category:W√ºrttemberg Category:Mountains and hills of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Christian pilgrimages Category:Upper Swabia Category:Iller-Lech Plateau ","title":"Bussen"},{"id":"7458370","text":"Cacha√ßo is a village on the island of Brava, Cape Verde.

Several modern Arabic dialects are used in everyday life, most notably Levantine in the west and Mesopotamian in the northeast. According to The Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, in addition to Arabic, the following languages are spoken in the country, in order of the number of speakers: Kurdish, Turkish, Neo-Aramaic (four dialects), Circassian, Chechen, Armenian, and finally Greek. None of these languages has official status. Historically, Aramaic was the lingua franca of the region before the advent of Arabic and is still spoken among Assyrians, and Classical Syriac is still used as the liturgical language of various Syriac Christian denominations. Most remarkably, Western Neo-Aramaic is still spoken in the village of Ma‚Äòloula as well as two neighboring villages, northeast of Damascus. Syrian Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf community. ==Arabic== David speaking Syrian Arabic, recorded for Wikitongues. Modern Standard Arabic is the language of education and writing. At home, most Syrians speak various dialects of Levantine Arabic with Damascus Arabic being the prestigious dialect in the media. Dialects of the cities of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Tartous are more similar to each other than to that of the northern region of Aleppo. Allied dialects are spoken in the coastal mountains. Lebanese Arabic together with Syrian are classified as North Levantine Arabic (ISO 639-3 language code \`apc\`). Lebanese is similar especially to the southern Syrian dialects, though it has more influence from Palestinian Arabic. Due to Syria‚Äôs long history of multiculturalism and foreign imperialism, Syrian Arabic exhibits a vocabulary stratum that includes word borrowings from Turkish, Kurdish, Armenian, Syriac, English, French and Persian. There is no standardized spelling, but usually it is written in Arabic alphabet from right to left. Other forms of Arabic natively spoken in Syria include: *the dialect spoken in the Jabal al-Druze (Jabal Al-Arab) mountains; *the eastern dialect group (Al-Hasakah, Al-Raqqah, and Deir ez- Zor), part of Mesopotamian Arabic (rarely called \\"North Syrian Arabic\\"); *Bedawi Arabic, spoken by the Bedouin (nomads). Non-indigenous dialects of Arabic, most notably those of Iraq and Palestine, are frequently used within their respective refugee diasporas, especially in Damascus. ==Kurdish== Kurdish (specifically Kurmanji) is the second most spoken language in Syria. It is spoken particularly in the northeast and northwest of the country within the Kurdish minority. ==Turkish== Turkish is the third most widely used language in Syria. Various Turkish dialects are spoken by the Turkmen/Turkoman minority mostly in villages east of the Euphrates and along the Syrian-Turkish border. In addition, there are Turkish language islands in the Qalamun area and the Homs area. Moreover, Syrian Arabic dialects have borrowed many loanwords from Turkish, particularly during Ottoman rule. ==Aramaic== Four dialects of Neo-Aramaic are spoken in Syria. Neo-West Aramaic is spoken in three villages near Damascus (including Maaloula). Turoyo speakers from Tur Abdin have settled in the province of Al-Hasakah. There is also a relatively large linguistic island formed by the Assyrians along the Khabur River. Moreover, Chaldean speakers are found in the northeast of Syria. ==Circassian== Circassian languages are spoken in some villages south of Aleppo, as well as in the Homs area and on the Golan Heights. In particular, Kabardian is spoken by the Circassian minority. ==Chechen== The Chechen language is spoken by the Chechen minority in two villages on the Khabur River. ==Armenian== The Armenian language is spoken within the Armenian community in Aleppo and other major cities, such as Damascus and in one small town exclusively in Kessab. Although Syria does not recognise any minority languages, the Armenians are the only community allowed to teach in their own language, in addition to Arabic. ==Greek== There is also a small number of Greek speakers in Syria. The Greek language is spoken in Al-Hamidiyah by Cretan Muslims. Their demand to be allowed to teach Greek in their schools has been rejected by the State with the argument that they are Muslims. ==Foreign languages== English and French are also understood by Syrian citizens, mostly in urban centers and among the educated. ==References== Category:North Levantine Arabic ","title":"Languages of Syria"},{"id":"7458405","text":"Ines Gei√üler (later Kaulfuss, born 16 February 1963 in Marienberg, Saxony), commonly spelled Ines Geissler in English, is a former butterfly swimmer from East Germany, who won the gold medal in the 200 m butterfly at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. ==References== * * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from Marienberg, Saxony Category:Olympic swimmers of East Germany Category:Female butterfly swimmers Category:Swimmers at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for East Germany Category:World record setters in swimming Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:European Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in swimming Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit in gold ","title":"Ines Geissler"},{"id":"7458408","text":"Necromancer Games was an American publisher of role-playing games. With offices in Seattle, Washington and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the company specialized in material for the d20 System. Most of its products were released under the Open Game License of Wizards of the Coast. The company's slogan, \\"Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel,\\" alluded to the fact that while its products used the third edition of the Dungeons & Dragons rules system, they strove to mimic the flavor and style found in game's first edition (1977-1989). The company was on hiatus by 2010, the two founders having started two separate new game companies, Frog God Games and Legendary Games. In June 2012, Necromancer Games was acquired by Frog God Games. The Necromancer Games logo features a depiction of Orcus. ==History== Necromancer Games was founded in 2000 by Clark Peterson and Bill Webb, the same year Wizards of the Coast released the third edition of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. The company partnered with several other gaming companies to release various products, including Judges Guild, Kenzer & Company, Malhavoc Press, Reaper Miniatures, Troll Lord Games, and White Wolf Publishing. In August 2000, Necromancer Games released the first ever OGL/d20 product: The Wizard's Amulet. The adventure won an ENnie in 2001 for Best Free Product. In March 2007, it was announced that Paizo would be publishing Necromancer Games products, following the cessation of the deal with White Wolf Publishing. Following the announcement of the impending fourth edition of Dungeons & Dragons in August 2007, Necromancer announced plans to support that edition with a variety of new products. However, none of these ever appeared, with company co-founder Clark Peterson declaring the GSL for fourth edition D&D; \\"a total unmitigated failure\\". A 2010 statement by Peterson announced the company as \\"dormant for some time\\" and unlikely to revive. Bill Webb went on to co- found Frog God Games, focusing on adventures designed for both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords & Wizardry lines. Clark Peterson has since co- created Legendary Games focusing on plug-in material for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure paths and sourcebooks. In June 2012, Necromancer Games was acquired by Frog God Games, which now offers older Necromancer products on its website. In July 2014 a Kickstarter was launched by Frog God to fund a series of products for the then-upcoming 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, under the Necromancer Games label. ==About the First Edition Feel== Here is an excerpt from an interview done by Role-Play News in 2000 with Clark Peterson and Bill Webb about their view on what is the First Edition Feel: > Clark Peterson : \\"First Edition is the cover of the old DMG (Dungeon Masters > Guide) with the City of Brass; it is Judges Guild; it is Type IV demons not > Tanaari and Baatezu; it is the Vault of the Drow not Drizzt Do'urden; it is > the Tomb of Horrors not the Ruins of Myth Drannor; it is orcs not ogrillons; > it is mind flayers not Ilithids (or however they spell it); it is Tolkien, > Moorcock, Howard and Leiber, not Eddings, Hickman, Jordan and Salvatore; it > is definitely Orcus and the demon-princes and not the Blood War; it is > Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound not Elminster's Evasion; and it is Artifacts > and Relics from the old DMG (with all the cool descriptions).\\" \\"I always say > we want to be the VW Bug of roleplaying companies, meaning that we want to > have a modern style and appeal but an obvious link to the past.

Newfoundland was a British colony, but Britain had other priorities when negotiating fishing rights, and did little to protect the Newfoundland fishery. In 1857 Britain signed an agreement allowing the French jurisdiction over an area of the shoreline where the fish were cured, and giving them the right to run off any vessels that were impeding their fishing activities.George A. Rose. Cod: The Ecological History of the North Atlantic Fisheries. Breakwater Books; 2007. . p. 279‚Äì. To minimize this interference in their own fishery, the Newfoundland Assembly introduced the first Bait Act in 1886, making it illegal to sell bait to French fishermen, but Britain refused to give its required agreement until this act was modified in 1887.Canada.

The Labour Party campaign centre and headquarters building in Northumberland Heath is named \\"Norman Dodds House\\" in honour of the former MP. He was Member of Parliament from 1945 until his death in 1965, and is best remembered for having been Margaret Thatcher's successful opponent when she first stood for Parliament, in the 1950 and 1951 general elections.John Campbell The Grocer's Daughter ==Early life== Dodds was born in Dunston-on-Tyne, near to Gateshead,\\"Mr Norman Dodds, Labour MP\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 23 August 1965, p. 2. the son of Ambrose Dodds. He attended Dunston-on-Tyne Council School,\\"Dodds, Norman Noel\\" in \\"Who Was Who\\" vol VI. an elementary school, as his only education.Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees (editors), \\"Who's Who of British Members of Parliament\\", vol IV, Harvester Humanities, Brighton, 1981, p. 94. From 1918 he was employed by the Co-operative Wholesale Society in Newcastle upon Tyne,\\"British Political Yearbook 1947\\", ed. by Frank Illingworth, British Yearbooks, 1947, p. 73. and in 1925 Dodds joined the Labour Party.\\"Mr. Norman Dodds\\" (obituary), The Times, 23 August 1965, p. 10. He moved to London in 1929, where he was employed by the Co-operative Wholesale Society as manager of the London branch of the CWS publicity department. Dodds joined the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and the National Co-operative Managers Association. His main occupation was organising trade exhibitions for the CWS around England. In 1931 Dodds married Eva Pratt, from Catford, who also became involved in the Co-operative movement. Eva Dodds later became the second woman to join the CWS board. Norman and Eva Dodds had two sons together. During the Second World War, Dodds joined the Home Guard where he had commissioned rank and served in the East End of London during The Blitz.\\"The Times House of Commons 1950\\", Times Office, 1950, p. 102. In 1942 he joined the Royal Air Force in which he served until 1945. In 1945 he became a Director of the People's Entertainment Society. ==Election to Parliament== As the war came to an end, the Government invited the Boundary Commission to divide the abnormally large constituencies; one of them was the Dartford division of Kent, which had a 1939 electorate of 134,935. The Commission recommended that two new boroughs, Bexley and Dartford be created out of the division.\\"Report of the Boundary Commission for England 1944 in regard to certain abnormally large Constituencies\\", Cmd. 6634, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1945, p. 24. The sitting MP for Dartford was Jennie Adamson, who had won a by-election for Labour in 1938; she decided to fight in the new Bexley constituency. Dodds, who was living in Dartford, was selected as Labour candidate for the new Dartford borough constituency. When the election came he had a straight fight with the Conservative Party candidate, Captain Ralph Grubb, who had served on the staff of Field-Marshal Montgomery.\\"The Times House of Commons 1945\\", Times Office, 1945, p. 49. Dodds had a well-funded campaign, outspending his opponent by ¬£1,071 to ¬£954, and won the seat with a majority of 19,714.\\"Return of the Expenses of each Candidate at the General Election of July, 1945\\", HCP 128, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1946, p. 23. ==Parliament== Dodds made his maiden speech on 26 October 1945, reporting on a recent visit he had made to occupied Berlin. He said that the children in Berlin were living in refugee camps and were starving, and urged the Government to provide more food for them.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 414 cols 2417-2422. A year later, he was one of the three MPs to visit Greece as a delegation organised by the League for Democracy in Greece, a pressure group based in London. Apart from Dodds, the MPs Leslie Solley and Stanley Tiffany were also members of the delegation. The delegation received the invitation to Greece from General Othoneos, who was then the president of the Greek Union of Democratic Associations, to come as guests of his organisation. The Foreign Office did not sponsor the delegates' visas on the grounds that their visit was private and not official, but the Greek Embassy in London authorised the visas nonetheless. The delegates split up into pairs, with Dodds and the delegation's secretary Diana Pym going to Northern Greece, speaking at the 1946 May Day demonstration in Thessaloniki, and visiting the Women's Prison and surrounding villages. On their return, the delegates wrote a pamphlet called Tragedy in Greece relaying their experiences in the country and their worries about Greece's political future. Tragedy in Greece was circulated with over 40,000 copies sold in the years after it was published. Shortly after his return from Greece, Dodds' views on Greece were vigorously criticised in Parliament by Foreign Office Minister Hector McNeil;Hansard, HC 5ser vol 423 cols 2114-6. Dodds, complaining that he had not been able to speak in the debate and had not been told he was to be mentioned,Hansard, HC 5ser vol 423 cols 2307-8. later spoke in detail about his views on Greece in an adjournment debate on 29 October 1946. McNeil gave a partial apology but maintained his view of the delegation.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 30 October 1946; p. 4. While usually loyal to the Labour Party whip, Dodds broke it on two occasions during the Parliament. The first was in May 1946 when he joined 31 other Labour MPs in voting to delete a clause in the National Insurance Bill which limited unemployment benefit to 180 days;Philip Norton, \\"Dissension in the House of Commons 1945-74\\", Macmillan, 1974, p. 8-9. the second was in May 1947 when he supported an amendment to end National Service on 1 January 1951, along with 29 other Labour MPs.Philip Norton, \\"Dissension in the House of Commons 1945-74\\", Macmillan, 1974, p. 26-27. ==1950 election== In February 1949, Dartford Conservative Association selected Margaret Roberts, then a 23-year-old research chemist at BX Plastics of Manningtree,\\"To Tilt a Lance for Conservatism\\", Grantham Journal, 11 February 1949. as their candidate for the forthcoming general election.\\"Candidate aged 23\\", The Times, 2 March 1949, p. 2. Dodds engaged in a prolonged exchange of letters through the columns of the Dartford Chronicle through the autumn of 1949 over the Government's Control of Engagement Order, which allowed the Government to specify jobs for the unemployed in which they were required to work. Dodds pointed to the relatively small number of people who were directed, and invited Roberts to a public meeting at which he would tell her what had happened on Tyneside and Wearside between the wars (she declined due to prior engagements).\\"Labour Direction Order\\", Dartford Chronicle, 26 August - 30 September 1949. They also clashed on family allowances.\\"Family Allowances\\", Dartford Chronicle, 2 September - 7 October 1949. At the end of November 1949, Dodds and Roberts met in a public debate in which he concluded by pointing to rising employment figures and suggesting that Roberts would soon join the Labour Party: \\"May I ask her a favour? When she wants to join, will she let me have the pleasure of enrolling her?\\".\\"Challenge to Debate\\", Erith Observer, 2 December 1949. When the election was called for 23 February 1950, Dodds campaigned strongly, even using a helicopter to advertise, and played on his local standing as he was President of Dartford Football Club.Bob Muller, \\"Conservative or Labour?\\", Heute, February 1950. He again outspent his opponents, both Roberts and Liberal candidate Harry Giles,\\"Return of the Expenses of each Candidate at the General Election of February, 1950\\", HCP 146, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1950, p. 21. and won re-election with a reduced majority of 13,638. Afterwards he paid tribute to the clean fight in the constituency.\\"Mr. Dodds goes to Westminster\\", Dartford Chronicle, 24 February 1950. A few weeks later Dodds invited Roberts to lunch at the House of Commons. ==First question== Dodds had the distinction of submitting the first question in the new Parliament; he asked the Prime Minister to call a conference to find ways of outlawing the hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons.\\"The First Question\\", The Times, 25 February 1950, p. 23. Dodds was appointed a member of the Central Advisory Committee to the Minister of Pensions,\\"Minister Of Pensions Committee\\", The Times, 29 March 1950, p. 8. and in May 1951 was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alfred Robens, the Minister of Labour. As the Government had a small majority, MPs were pressed to attend at all times; on 19 March 1951 Dodds attracted some attention when he came to Parliament with pyjamas, a pillow and a car rug, allowing him to catch some sleep during all-night sittings.\\"Politician's Nightwear\\", Manchester Guardian, 20 March 1951, p 5. ==1951 election== Speaking at a summer fete in his constituency on 18 August 1951, Dodds disclosed that the Cabinet was split on the issue of whether to hold a general election that October or whether to wait until June 1952. He stated his prediction that the election would in fact be held on 25 October 1951.\\"Election on Oct. 25 ‚Äì Labour M.P.\\", Manchester Guardian, 19 August 1951, p. 1. The fact that Ministers were divided about when to call an election was an open secret but Dodds' speech allowed it to be reported and his prediction was taken seriously.\\"M.P.'s Forecast of Election in October\\", Manchester Guardian, 20 August 1951, p. 5. His prediction proved accurate. Dodds had a straight fight in Dartford against Margaret Roberts who was readopted as the Conservative Party candidate. She succeeded in reducing his majority by 1,304 to 12,334; in his victory speech Dodds congratulated Roberts on her engagement to Denis Thatcher and wished them good fortune. For her part Roberts said that she and Dodds had been good friends as political opponents.\\"Mr. Dodds returned\\", unknown newspaper cutting preserved in the Margaret Thatcher archive. Writing in 1995, Margaret Thatcher described Dodds as \\"a genuine and extremely chivalrous socialist of the old school\\" whom she was lucky to have as an opponent.Margaret Thatcher, \\"The Path to Power\\", HarperCollins, 1995, pp. 71-2. Some eight years later, Roberts, now Margaret Thatcher, joined him in the House of Commons as the member for Finchley in 1959. He was Member of Parliament for Dartford from 1945 to 1955, and then for Erith and Crayford from 1955 until his death in 1965, aged 61. ==References== * == External links == * Category:1903 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Labour Co-operative MPs for English constituencies Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:UK MPs 1945‚Äì1950 Category:UK MPs 1950‚Äì1951 Category:UK MPs 1951‚Äì1955 Category:UK MPs 1955‚Äì1959 Category:UK MPs 1959‚Äì1964 Category:UK MPs 1964‚Äì1966 Category:People from the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead Category:Parliamentary Private Secretaries to the Department for Work and Pensions ","title":"Norman Dodds"},{"id":"7458493","text":"The Microdot is a concept design by William Towns for a small, economical town car.

The Microdot prototype, built by William Towns on a cut-down Austin Mini chassis, was given opening doors and a longer nose, to accommodate the aluminium Reliant car engine, one of the smallest and lightest UK car engines then available, instead of the original hybrid proposal. Mallalieu Engineering was best known for making Bentley Specials, the Barchetta and Oxford, based on the Mark 6 Bentley. The engineers had a target of 100 miles per Imperial gallon. Under the prototype label of \\"Matrix\\" a business plan, it was proposed by Mallalieu's managing director Noel Hodson, to sell several hundred \\"Chelsea\\" Microdots a year to POSSFUND, the venture-capital arm of the Post Office pension fund, then one of the largest funds in the world, managed by Ralph Quartano. The recession of the early 1980s, and the growth in small economical cars such as the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta, stopped the hybrid-drive project. Mallalieu Microdot (company number 01504509) was dissolved on 23 June 1987 and Mallalieu Engineering (company number 01215691) was dissolved in 1989, and the project disappeared. ==Design== Designers from film special- effects studios in London, who had created the original Star Wars spaceship interiors, created \\"alive\\" interior cockpit designs and motor industry experts from Lucas and Ever Ready advised on batteries, power-trains and instruments. Relying on 8-track stereo tape recordings by celebrities, it was planned that a Microdot would \\"talk\\" to its owner.

It was written by Billy Ward and Rose Marks and was one of the first R&B; hit records to cross over to become a hit on the pop charts. It is regarded as one of the most important of the recordings that helped generate and shape rock and roll. ==Background== The Dominoes were a black vocal group consisting of Clyde McPhatter (1932‚Äì1972), who later left the group to form the Drifters; Bill Brown (1926-1956); Charlie White (1930-2005); and Joe Lamont (d. 1998), led by their pianist, manager and songwriter, Billy Ward (1921‚Äì2002). Ward was a black, classically trained vocal coach who had formed a business partnership with a white New York talent agent, Rose Marks. The pair decided to put together a smooth vocal group to rival The Ink Spots, the Orioles, and similar groups who were beginning to win acceptance with white audiences. In 1950, the Dominoes were signed to Federal Records and held a series of recording sessions at the National Studios in New York in November and December of that year. Their initial release, \\"Do Something For Me\\", was the first record on which McPhatter sang lead. The song was musically a gospel song with gospel-style melismas but was lyrically secular. A success, the song entered the R&B; charts at the beginning of February 1951. Less successful was its follow-up, the pop standard \\"Harbor Lights\\", recorded on December 30, 1950. The record company then turned to the other sharply contrasting, straight R&B; song which the group had recorded on the same day, \\"Sixty Minute Man\\". It was issued in May 1951 (on Federal 12022), and by the end of the month had reached #1 on the R&B; charts, a position it held for an almost unprecedented 14 weeks. The single also made it to number 17, on the pop singles chart and was voted \\"Song of the year\\" for 1951. The recording featured Ren√© Hall on guitar, and used Bill Brown's bass voice, rather than McPhatter's tenor, as the lead. It featured the singer's boasts of his sexual prowess, of being able to satisfy his girls with fifteen minutes each of kissing, teasing, and squeezing, before his climactic fifteen minutes of \\"blowing [his] top\\". The chorus was specific: ::There'll be fifteen minutes of kissin' ::Then you'll holler \\"Please don't stop\\" (Don't stop!) ::There'll be fifteen minutes of teasin' ::Fifteen minutes of squeezin' ::And fifteen minutes of blowin' my top Lyrics of this type already had a long history. The reference to \\"Dan\\" (alternatively, \\"Jim Dandy\\") dates back at least to minstrel shows in the nineteenth century, and double-entendre had been used in blues lyrics for decades before the song was written. A common reference was to \\"Dan, the Back Door Man\\"‚Äîthe lover of a married woman who would leave her house by the back door‚Äîas in a song of that title recorded by Georgia White in 1937. Among the many precedents, but with a different perspective, is \\"One Hour Mama\\" by Ida Cox. \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was banned by many radio stations and was seen as a novelty record at the time. However, in hindsight it was an important record in several respects: it crossed the boundaries between gospel singing and blues, its lyrics pushed the limits of what was deemed acceptable, and it appealed to many white as well as black listeners, peaking at #17 on the pop charts. Cover versions were made by several white artists including Hardrock Gunter. Bill Haley & His Comets sang the song in the mid-1950s during their live shows. In later years, the Dominoes' record became a contender for the title of \\"the first rock and roll record\\". The Dominoes went on to become one of the most popular vocal groups of the 1950s. However, Bill Brown, lead singer of \\"Sixty Minute Man\\", left in 1952 to form a new group, The Checkers, and died in 1956. Clyde McPhatter was replaced by Jackie Wilson in 1953. In 1955 with a new lineup, the Dominoes recorded their own answer song with the same melody, \\"Can't Do Sixty No More\\" (with the flip side \\"If I Never Get to Heaven\\"), which included the line, \\"Please excuse this blown-out fuse, but I can't do sixty no more.\\" Coincidentally, Prentice Moreland recorded with the group in this lineup as well as with The Du-Droppers who had recorded an earlier version of \\"Can't Do Sixty No More\\" in 1952. Though they share the same title, the earlier version was written by The Du Droppers' lead tenor, J. C. Ginyard. ==Legacy== Ultimately \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" remained a novelty song, and did not contribute significantly to the merging of pop music and R&B;, more in the tradition of Open the Door, Richard in which black performers winked and rolled their eyes, rather than the soulful renditions that would follow. Although McPhatter's tenor singing and falsetto whoops were in the background on this recording, the following year, McPhatter was the lead singer in another song by The Dominoes, \\"Have Mercy Baby\\", a hit R&B; song which had a stronger gospel influence. It was considered the definitive fast \\"rhythm and gospel record\\" and was Number One on the R&B; Charts for 10 weeks. ==Other recordings== In 1951 \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was recorded as a duet by Hardrock Gunter and Roberta Lee, and also by the York Brothers. The Lee/Gunter recording is cited as an early example of rockabilly. Jerry Lee Lewis recorded the song in 1957 and in 1973. Dick Curless, a country singer from Maine, recorded an arrangement (titled \\"Lovin' Dan - 60 Minute Man\\") on 1966's \\"The Soul of Dick Curless\\" released on Tower Records, and on 1973's \\"Live at the Wheeling Truck Driver's Jamboree.\\" A group called \\"The Untouchables\\" released a version of the song in 1960. A version was recorded in the early 1970s by Australian band Daddy Cool. The Trammps released a version of the song in 1972. James Booker recorded the song in 1976. It was recorded in 1977 by the a cappella group The Persuasions on their record Chirpin'. An instrumental version was recorded as the title song to Charles Tyler's solo saxophone album in 1979. Huey Lewis frequently covers the song in concert. Country group Restless Heart performed the song on their \\"Fast Movin' Train\\" tour in the late 1980s. Rockapella also recorded a cover of the song, featuring Barry Carl as the lead vocalist. A live version by Nancy Sinatra was included on her DVD Nancy Sinatra Live in Edinburgh, Scotland. Clarence Carter recorded \\"Sixty-Minute Man\\" with FAME in 1973. ==Contemporary usage== * \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was featured in the 1988 movie Bull Durham, starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins. * \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was featured in the 1989 movie Shag, starring Phoebe Cates and Bridget Fonda. * \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was featured in the 1989 movie Gross Anatomy, starring Matthew Modine * Ed Bradley, African American reporter for 60 Minutes, the television newsmagazine, performed the song at musical promotions he was involved in although he did not otherwise represent himself as a singer.

On 19 November 1926, a private owner wagon disintegrated, derailing the train that it was part of. A signal post was partially brought down, obstructing an adjacent line. An express passenger train had the sides of its carriages ripped open by the signal post. Eleven people were killed.

Although information about the camp is scarce, two defectors have alleged the forcible suppression of a large riot in May 1987 at the camp. According to the testimony of Ahn Myong-chol, a guard at a similar camp, and Mun Hyon-il, a nearby resident, the riot started when one political prisoner at the camp killed a guard in protest of the guard's treatment of another prisoner; he was then joined by 200 others at the scene who overcame another guard. At the height of the riot, some 5,000 prisoners were openly in revolt. Reinforced from a second camp, guards proceeded to open fire on the rioters with machine guns, the defectors have stated. Reports on the number of dead vary; the defectors claim all rioters were executed, while a third defector previously involved with the North Korean security services describes being told of the execution of only a third. The camp was closed in 1989, a decision thought to be because of its proximity to the border with China.

It is spread over of land and has been upgraded at a cost of Rs. 42 crore. The upgraded airport was inaugurated on 7 June 2015 by Indian Civil Aviation Minister, Ashok Gajapathi Raju. The terminal building has a capacity to handle 100 peak hour passengers at a time and the apron can accommodate two ATR-72 type of aircraft. ==History== The airport was constructed in 1953, and initially had a runway. In the 1980s, Vayudoot operated services to Kadapa from Hyderabad. The State Government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) entered into a memorandum of understanding in March 2007 for developing the existing airports at Kadapa and Warangal to handle ATR-42 and ATR-72 type of aircraft. In 2009, a new runway was completed under the Build, Operate and Transfer basis at a cost of Rs. 21 crore. In addition, an 11-km long compound wall was constructed with an outlay of Rs. 24 crore. In the second phase, an air traffic control building, passenger terminal, parking bays and internal roads were built at a cost of Rs. 13 crore. Other facilities were developed at an estimated cost of Rs 8 crore. Scheduled commercial flights to the airport resumed on 7 June 2015 when Air Pegasus launched thrice weekly ATR 72 service to Bangalore. However, flights were soon cancelled due to poor passenger loads. In April 2016, TruJet introduced flights to Hyderabad, which were cancelled after a few months. Kadapa Airport was one of the 70 airports selected under UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) to increase regional air connectivity.

It was produced by Cardinal Games in 1998 and included a Billy the Answer Head board that was coated to allow for writing and erasing with crayon, two sets of game cards, and a timer. ==Players== This game was designed to be played with 2 to 6 players with a recommended minimum age of 7. ==Objective== A round was won by figuring out the contestant's secret. ==Components== The game consisted of the following components: *A Billy the Answer Head game board *46 prepared Answer cards (Each card contained 2 verbal clues, a charade clue, a secret slime action, and a consequence for the secret slime action) *4 blank Answer cards (For customization) *3 Prize decks (First Round, Second Round, and Grand Prizes.) *A Figure It Out timer *A crayon ==Game PlaySetup=== Separate the game cards into 4 separate decks for Answer cards, First Round Prize cards, Second Round Prize cards, and Grand Prize cards. Place the brace on the bottom of Billy the Answer Head so it is freestanding. ===First Round=== One player is designated as the contestant. The other player(s) are designated as the panel. The contestant picks an Answer card without revealing it to the panel. The number of words in the answer is revealed to the panel. Any words in parenthesis are written on Billy the Answer Head before the time begins. The timer is turned completely counterclockwise and started. During the timed interval, panel members ask 'yes' or 'no' questions. The same panelist continues asking questions until a question is answered 'no', at which point the next panelist begins asking questions. If a panelist says a word that is part of the answer, the timer is stopped, the word is written on Billy the Answer Head, and then the timer (and questions) resume. If, at the end of the round, the complete answer has not been discovered, the contestant selects a card from the First Round Prize deck. ===Second Round=== At the beginning of the second round, the contestant reads the first verbal clue. The timer is turned completely counterclockwise and started. The timed interval continues the same as during the first round. If, at the end of the round, the complete answer has not been discovered, the contestant selects a card from the Second Round Prize deck. ===Third Round=== At the beginning of the third round, the contestant reads the second verbal clue. The timer is turned completely counterclockwise and started. The timed interval continues the same as during the first two rounds. If, at the end of the round, the complete answer has not been discovered, the game enters the charade round. ===Charade Round=== During the charade round the timer is turned completely counterclockwise and started. During the timed interval the contestant acts out the Charade Clue (marked with an asterisk (*) on the Answer card.) During this time the panel uses this clue to try to guess answer. If the answer has not been guessed by the end of this round, the contestant wins and draws a card from the Grand Prize deck. The roll of contestant then moves on to the next player. ===Secret Slime Action=== Answer cards list a secret slime action and a corresponding consequence. During the rounds of play the contestant watches for the panel to perform the secret slime action. If someone does perform this action, the contestant announces Slime Action, the timer is stopped, and the slime action consequence is revealed to the panelist being penalized. This consequence must then be performed by the panelist. The timer is then restarted and play resumes as normal. ==Blank Answer Cards== 2 blank doublesided answer cards are included with the game, allowing for game owners to fill in up to 4 custom answers with appropriate clues and slime actions with consequences. ==See also== *Figure It Out *List of board games ==External links== *Cardinal Games Category:Board games introduced in 1998 Category:Children's board games Category:Licensed board games ","title":"Figure It Out (board game)"},{"id":"7458620","text":"Brentwood Elementary may refer to: * Brentwood Elementary School, Spokane, Washington * Wake County Public School System, Raleigh, North Carolina * Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary School, Los Angeles, California * Brentwood Elementary School (Sarasota, FL) Sarasota, FL ","title":"Brentwood Elementary"},{"id":"7458629","text":"Balance is the debut album of the Dutch singer Kim-Lian.

Gregory discovered alluvial gold in Clear Creek, near Golden, Colorado. The gold was concentrated in the north branch of Clear Creek, in what is now called Gregory Gulch above Blackhawk.Ferrell (1970) p.9 News of the discovery spread, and by September, 900 prospectors had arrived, living in log shanties and tents. By the summer of 1860, sixty ore mills and thirty arrastras were in operation and the population had risen to 15,000. Mining camps, including Black Hawk, Central City, Nevadaville, Russell Gulch and Apex were formed. But by the mid-1860s, the easily-accessible alluvial gold deposit had been exhausted. A smelter was set up in Black Hawk in 1865, to allow gold to be extracted from hard rock ore. In 1870, the narrow gauge Colorado Central Railroad was formed to provide transportation to this remote region. Construction of the railroad started in September 1871, and the first train arrived at Black Hawk on December 15, 1873. In 1878, a four-mile long switchback extension was built from Black Hawk to Central City, with the first train arriving on May 21, 1878.Ferrell (1970) pp.11-19 ==Gilpin Tramway Company== The problem still remained on how to economically get the gold bearing quartz ore down to the mills of Central City and Black Hawk. It was a dangerous, slow and expensive process to bring the ore down in horse-drawn wagons. In Summer 1886 five mining men met to solve the problem. The solution was the Gilpin Tramway Company, formed on July 29 in Central City by Henry C. Bolsinger, Bradford H. Locke, Robert A. Campbell, Andrew W. Rogers and Henry J. Hawley. The purpose of the company was to build a narrow gauge railroad to transport ore from the mines above Black Hawk to the mills.Ferrell (1970) p.19 ===Construction of the tramway=== Grading was started in May 1887. A frame barn was purchased above Black Hawk as an engine house. The first rails were laid on July 1, 1887. Shay locomotive #1 arrived on August 26, with its first run on September 1. Trackage worked its way back down Clear Creek climbing the side of the hill and climbing up into Gregory Gulch. The maximum grade was six percent with several curves having a radius. The trackage continued on above Central City (there was an excursion train for Central City residents from where the tram crossed Eureka Gulch to Black Hawk on September 29, 1887). From there the trackage continued up to Nevadaville, Quartz Hill and Russel Gulch.Ferrell (1970) p.21 Much of the altitude gained by the Gilpin was done by the use of switchbacks. The Tram had more switchbacks than any other American railroad. At one point, seven switchbacks were used to reach a single mine. ===Opposition=== The railroad was not without its opponents. The Gilpin was in direct competition to the various teamster outfits. An agreement had been made with the Colorado Central to lay a third rail through Black Hawk (creating a dual gauge track) to allow the Gilpin to reach its various mills and smelters. Mayor William Fick, associated with many of the teamsters, fought to stop the Gilpin from coming through 'his' town. The third rail was laid after various legal actions starting in December 1887. But that was not the end of it, in April 1888, the Mayor accompanied by the marshal ordered laborers to stop laying the third rail and to start removing trackage that had already been laid. Fick declared that the tram would throw teamsters out of work, a great calamity for the city. But with a payment from the Gilpin of $450 to the city, the Mayor was advised to quit his losing fight, and none of the trackage was removed.Ferrell (1970) pp.22-25 ===Tourism=== Ore and supplies were not the only cargo carried on the Gilpin. On May 23, 1888, the tram received six new excursion passenger cars. As with many other railroads in the west, tourist traffic created a good supplement to the railroads income. Excursions occurred throughout each summer. A round trip from Black Hawk with lunch was 75 cents. A combined trip on the Colorado Central from Denver was $2.40.Ferrell (1970) pp.25-28 ===Extensions=== Throughout 1888, track was extended to mines and mills leading to of track by winter of that year. Once winter arrived, a new and interesting problem arrived as well. Ore comes from wet ground, and in the winter, it has a tendency to freeze solid in the cars before delivery to the mills. The tram solved this problem with a unique solution. A warming house was built near the engine house with tracks running its entire length. Steam pipes and stoves warmed the building to a high of , thus keeping the ore warm and dry.Ferrell (1970) p.29 ===Sale to the Colorado and Southern=== Traffic continued to grow throughout the 1890s, with three Shays taking up the load. Accidents did happen on occasion with engines jumping the track and rolling over. By 1900, new shays were replacing the old ones. In January 1899, the Colorado Central (then owned by the bankrupt Union Pacific Railroad) was taken over by the Colorado and Southern (C&S;). The Gilpin had been showing a nice profit in the early 1900s so by 1905, the C&S; was looking at the Gilpin as a likely acquisition. On June 27, 1906, the Gilpin was sold to the Colorado and Southern.Ferrell (1970) pp.59-64 ===Closure of the tramway=== 1910 saw the Gilpin at its greatest length of including spurs and sidings. But unfortunately, the C&S; bought the Gilpin at the height of its profitability. The profit margins on mining gold was dropping both due to increased cost to extract the gold, and fixed prices in the gold market due to government. As such, traffic was dropping. Soon the Gilpin was running in the red. The last train ran on January 17, 1917. The railroad was sold for scrap in June 1917.Ferrell (1970) pp.64-65 == Locomotives == { !Number !Builder !Type !Date !Works number !Notes - 1 Lima Locomotive Works 10-ton Shay August 1887 181Koch (1971) p.388 sold Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad #1 1905Ericson (2007) pp.24-25 - 2 Lima Locomotive Works 12-ton Shay February 1888 199 sold Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad #2 1905 - 3 Lima Locomotive Works 15-ton Shay December 1889 264Koch (1971) p.390 scrapped 1938 - 4 Lima Locomotive Works 17-ton Shay January 1900 594Koch (1971) p.401 scrapped 1938 - 5 Lima Locomotive Works 18-ton Shay April 1902 696Koch (1971) p.407 scrapped 1938 } == Cars == { !Number !Builder !Type !Date !Length !NotesFerrell (1970) p.100 - 1-5  flatcars 1888  #3 rebuilt to coal car #14 - 6-13  coal cars 1888 17 ft  - 14-17  coal cars  17 ft  - 18-37 Lima Locomotive Works ore cars 1887  originally capacity rebuilt to capacity - 38-87 Lima Locomotive Works ore cars 1888 17 ft 7 in  capacity - 88-155 Lima Locomotive Works ore cars 1889 17 ft 7 in  capacity - 300 Gilpin water car    capacity - 1st #400 Gilpin caboose 1904  destroyed 1912 - 2nd #400 Colorado and Southern Railway caboose 1912   - 401 Colorado and Southern Railway caboose 1913 14 ft 2 in  - 500-505  excursion cars 1888  one rebuilt to flatcar 2nd #4; one rebuilt to rail & boiler car #01 in 1906; one used as parts for caboose #401 in 1913; last one (#500) renumbered #1 in 1915 } ==References== * * * ==NotesExternal links== * The Gilpin Tramway Category:Defunct Colorado railroads Category:2 ft gauge railways in the United States Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Colorado Category:Railway companies established in 1886 Category:Railway lines opened in 1887 Category:Railway lines closed in 1917 ","title":"Gilpin Railroad"},{"id":"7458646","text":"Eisack Valley ( ; ) is a district (; ) in South Tyrol, Italy.

During its period of service, the regiment was known as the 1st Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but often referred to with, \\"Union,\\" \\"Loyal\\" or \\"West\\" in front to distinguish it from Virginia regiments. It was the first regiment mustered into service on southern soil after Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops. It was formed three days before the Wheeling Convention, which was assembled to decide western Virginia's response if Virginia seceded from the Union. ==Service== The first incarnation of the 1st West Virginia Infantry Regiment (known as the 1st Virginia at the time) was organized at Wheeling, Virginia, in May, 1861 from volunteer companies from Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, and Marshall counties (the Northern Panhandle of the state). These companies had been formed by pro-Union citizens of these counties in April 1861, after the Commonwealth of Virginia voted to secede from the Union, in order to resist Confederate incursions from the eastern portions of the state. The Regiment was mustered into United States service by companies for a period of three months (the first company, Company A, was mustered into service on May 10, while the final company, Company K, was mustered on May 23). Company A (from the Fourth Ward of Wheeling) had actually been organized, as the Rough and Ready Guards, on April 18, 1861, the day after the state convention voted for secession.Rawling (1887), chap. II. Under the command of Colonel Benjamin Franklin Kelley and the 1st Virginia traveled from Wheeling by train on May 27 to near Mannington to secure a bridge on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which had been destroyed by the rebels. After remaining there two days, the regiment advanced again, seizing the important railroad junction of Grafton on May 30 from a body of Virginia state militia under command of Confederate Col. George A. Porterfield. On June 1, Isaac Duval took command as Major of the regiment. Porterfield's troops retreated to Philippi where, on June 3, they were defeated by a Union force which included the 1st Virginia Infantry. The Battle of Philippi was the first land battle of the Civil War. During the battle, Col. Kelley was seriously wounded. The Regiment remained on duty at Rowlesburg, Grafton, and Philippi until July. During the remainder of their three months service, the regiment was separated. A detachment of five companies served with Major General George B. McClellan in the Rich Mountain campaign. Another detachment was with Col. Erastus B. Tyler in a campaign against Confederate Brigadier General Henry A. Wise, who at that time had attempted an invasion of western Virginia. The remainder of the regiment guarded the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. On August 19, they returned to Wheeling where the 3-months regiment was mustered out of Federal service on August 27, 1861. ==Casualties== The 1st West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment suffered no fatalities in battle during its enlistment. However, a member of Company G was killed in camp on May 29, 1861, from the accidental discharge of a gun.Rawling (1887), chap. IV. ==Officers== * Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley * Lt. Col. Henry B.

Of the 22 weekday Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains operating in San Diego, 18 of them stop at the Old Town Transit Center, though the Surfliner trains operating at Old Town do not offer checked luggage service, and stop at Old Town to board passengers (northbound trains) or detrain passengers (southbound trains) only, respectively. Amtrak ridership at Old Town Transit Center has exploded over the last two years. In Fiscal Year 2011, there were just 22,867 boardings and detrainings at Old Town (which was a 5.79% increase over Fiscal Year 2010). In Fiscal Year 2012, boardings and detrainings at Old Town rose to 61,118, a 167% increase over FY2011. As of Fiscal Year 2013, the Amtrak ridership figure has continued to rise, to 135,749 boardings and detrainings, a further 122% increase over FY2012. (There has been a corresponding decrease in Amtrak boardings at the Santa Fe Depot in Downtown San Diego over this same period, possibly indicating that some Amtrak boardings have been relocating from Santa Fe Depot to Old Town over the past two years.) Of the 74 California stations served by Amtrak, the Old Town Transit Center was the 25th-busiest in Fiscal Year 2013, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 372 passengers daily. ===San Diego Trolley=== Old Town Transit Center is also a light rail station on the San Diego Trolley's Green Line. This station originally served as that line's terminus, until a system realignment on September 2012 extended the Green Line though Old Town to Downtown San Diego. Once the Trolley's Mid-Coast extension is completed, the Blue Line will be re-extended through this station to serve the University City area, and so the Blue Line will once again serve Old Town by approximately 2021. In July 2015, a 30-year naming rights agreement between MTS and UC San Diego Health was announced; as a result of this agreement, the Blue Line will be renamed \\"UC San Diego Blue Line\\" and the Old Town Transit Center will become \\"Old Town UC San Diego Health South\\". ===Bus service=== Old Town also operates as a bus transit center for San Diego Metropolitan Transit System's routes 8, 9, 10, 28, 30, 35, 44, 88, 105, and 150. There is an underground pedestrian tunnel linking bus terminals on both sides of the station with the trolley/train areas. Old Town is also served by university shuttles for University of California, San Diego and University of San Diego.University of California, San DiegoUniversity of San Diego ==Station layout== There are four tracks; two tracks are designated for the San Diego Trolley services, while the other two tracks are used for COASTER, Amtrak, and BNSF freight service. {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the right - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=100Track 1 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=550‚Üê ' toward () ‚Üê ' (future service) toward () - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform, doors will open on the left - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=100Track 2 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=550 ' (future service) toward () ‚Üí ' toward () ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform, doors will open on the right - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Track 3 style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=550‚Üê COASTER' toward () ‚Üê ' toward () - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=100Track 4 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" width=550 ' (Terminus) ‚Üí COASTER toward (Terminus) ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the right } ==See also== * List of San Diego Trolley stations ==References External links == *COASTER Stations *Old Town Transit Center (SDMTS) *Old Town San Diego Amtrak Station(USA RailGuide ‚Äì TrainWeb) *Old Town San Diego State Historic Park (California State Parks) *San Diego-Old Town (OLT)--Great American Stations (Amtrak) Category:Amtrak stations in San Diego County, California Category:North County Transit District stations Category:San Diego Trolley stations in San Diego Category:Transit centers in the United States Category:Bus stations in San Diego County, California Category:Railway stations in San Diego Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in California ","title":"Old Town Transit Center"},{"id":"7458744","text":"Louis √âvely (1910-1985) was a Christian writer from Belgium. A Roman Catholic priest, he published several books about the spiritual life. Despite leaving the priesthood in 1967, and his subsequent marriage, he remained active as a spiritual leader. √âvely was a pedagogue of the spiritual life and at the same time a publishing success. Several of his works sold in the hundreds of thousands and were translated into 25 languages. In the 1960s one of his sermons was reproduced in its entirety in a film directed by √âric Rohmer. One of his conferences on prayer held in Spain started a riot, as some conservative Catholics were shocked by his outspokenness. Most of √âvely's work, rather than the fruit of academic research, stems from preaching at conferences and retreats. Many of his listeners transcribed the text of talks to disseminate among their churches, often in carbon typescript or photocopies, long before the texts reached editors and printers. == Life == Louis √âvely was born in Brussels on 5 November 1910. Deemed a bright student, he was also a mystical teenager who discovered, thanks to Scouting, a sense of solidarity toward others and of the practical. Having completed his university education and obtaining two doctorates, one in law and the other in philosophy, he entered the major seminary at Malines-Brussels (Dutch: Mechelen-Brussel) at the age of 23. Ordained at 27, he was assigned to assist at a very poor rural school rather than, as he envisaged, as a professor at the University of Louvain. The school was at the edge of the battlefield of Waterloo. Through his experience catechizing children, Evely learned how to present the message of the gospel with simplicity. A similar experience occurred to him as a chaplain of the World War II anti-Nazi resistance in the Ardennes. He was suddenly confronted with the task of addressing agnostics or anticlerical Maquis. After the war he became the director of his school while also working as a teacher and chaplain for various nearby Christian groups. Drawn by the spirituality of Charles de Foucauld, he started in Belgium some non-ordained fraternities inspired by de Foucauld's ideas. At that time, the reputation of √âvely as a preacher led him to become a popular spiritual retreat director, speaker at religious conferences and to preach publicly to the fraternities, a movement of assistance to the Third World known as Ad Lucem (Latin, \\"to the light\\") and eventually a series of Lenten radio addresses. It was from these speeches that his first books developed. √âvely began to acquire a reputation for speaking with humor and a certain audacity that later seemed to have anticipated the assertions of the Second Vatican Council, but that at the time irritated his superiors. In 1957 his archbishop, Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens, who had been a classmate, asked him not to publish any more books. Shortly afterward, he resigned as school director. Between the professional affronts and his active life, √âvely's health seriously deteriorated and he was directed to take a rest cure in the mountains in France, lasting several months. Upon completing his rest, instead of returning to Belgium, he became an oblate at the Cistercian Aiguebelle Abbey in Provence, France. Without taking monastic vows, he took on the life of a monk: from chanting and praying, taking part in the manual work of the abbey as well as times of study and prayer. This contemplative life fully satisfied his mystical aspirations but, with the assistance of the abbot, he became aware that his true vocation was that of an evangelist. Thus he became an itinerant preacher in southwest France, helping the spiritual revival of parishes and directing retreats. The way of speaking about faith introduced at Vatican II in the early 1960s by Pope John XXIII seemed to coincide with the style of preaching and writing that was by then √âvely's trademark, but what he called the \\"Spring of the Church\\" proved disappointing. √âvely's bishop refused him the imprimatur, a then-essential declaration for the publication of a book written by a priest. Translations of his works obtained the approval of bishops worldwide. After inner struggles he applied to be laicized (dismissed from the clerical state), which church authorities granted in the summer of 1967. This began a period in which he produced and refined some his most highly regarded works, particularly those touching on the prayer of modern men and women. Three years later, at the age of 60, √âvely married a longtime friend, Mary, with whom he set up a home in Pi√©gros-la-Clastre, a small village in Provence. There, he regained his preaching public, often including Protestants, in Alsace and Switzerland. In response to repeated requests, the √âvely couple started a house of prayer, known as \\"L'Aube\\" (The Dawn) where a community runs spiritual exercises and training courses. In the 1980s Evely felt his strength declining as his health waned, probably affected by a tropical disease contracted during a lecture tour in Africa. He died on 30 August 1985, at the age of 75. == Books == *That Man is You (1964) *We Dare To Say Our Father (1966) *The Word of God: Homilies (1967) *The Prayer of a Modern Man (1968) *A Religion for Our Time (1969) *Love your Neighbor (1969) *The Gospels Without Myth: a Dramatic New Interpretation of the Gospels and Christian Dogma (1971) *Suffering (1974) *Teach Us How to Pray.

Instead of the normative roots of much of the field of finance, it uses a positivist framework including exemplars from statistical physics with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets. The starting point for this approach to understanding financial markets are the empirically observed stylized facts. ==Stylized facts == # Stock markets are characterised by bursts of price volatility. # Price changes are less volatile in bull markets and more volatile in bear markets. # Price change correlations are stronger with higher volatility, and their auto-correlations die out quickly. # Almost all real data have more extreme events than suspected. # Volatility correlations decay slowly. # Trading volumes have memory the same way that volatilities do. # Past price changes are negatively correlated with future volatilities. == Research objectives == Statistical finance is focused on three areas: # Empirical studies focused on the discovery of interesting statistical features of financial time-series data aimed at extending and consolidating the known stylized facts. # The use of these discoveries to build and implement models that better price derivatives and anticipate stock price movement with an emphasis on non-Gaussian methods and models. # The study of collective and emergent behaviour in simulated and real markets to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the observed stylized facts with an emphasis on agent-based models. Financial econometrics also has a focus on the first two of these three areas. However, there is almost no overlap or interaction between the community of statistical finance researchers (who typically publish in physics journals) and the community of financial econometrics researchers (who typically publish in economics journals). == Behavioral finance and statistical finance == Behavioural finance attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the biased behaviour of individuals, mostly concerned with the agents themselves and to a lesser degree aggregation of agent behaviour. Statistical finance is concerned with emergent properties arising from systems with many interacting agents and as such attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the collective behaviour. Emergent properties are largely independent of the uniqueness of individual agents because they are dependent on the nature of the interactions of the agents rather than the agents themselves. This approach has drawn strongly on ideas arising from complex systems, phase transitions, criticality, self-organized criticality, non-extensivity (see Tsallis entropy), q-Gaussian models, and agents based models (see agent based model); as these are known to be able to recover some of phenomenology of financial market data, the stylized facts, in particular the long-range memory and scaling due to long-range interactions. == Criticism == Within the subject the description of financial markets blindly in terms of models of statistical physics has been argued as flawed because it has transpired these do not fully correspond to what we now know about real finance markets. First, traders create largely noise, not long range correlations among themselves, except when they all buy or all sell, such as during a popular IPO or during a crash. A market is not at an equilibrium critical point, the resulting non-equilibrium market must reflect details of traders' interactions (universality applies only to a limited very class of bifurcations, and the market does not sit at a bifurcation). Even if the notion of a thermodynamics equilibrium is considered not at the level of the agents but in terms of collections of instruments stable configurations are not observed. The market does not 'self-organize' into a stable statistical equilibrium, rather, markets are unstable. Although markets could be 'self-organizing' in the sense used by finite-time singularity models these models are difficult to falsify. Although Complex systems have never been defined in a broad sense financial markets do satisfy reasonable criterion of being considered complex adaptive systems.Financial Market Complexity, Johnson, Jefferies and Hui, Oxford 2003 The Tallis doctrine has been put into question as it is apparently a special case of markov dynamics so questioning the very notion of a \\"non-linear Fokker-Plank equation\\". In addition, the standard 'stylized facts' of financial markets, fat tails, scaling, and universality are not observed in real FX markets even if they are observed in equity markets. From outside the subject the approach has been considered by many as a dangerous view of finance which has drawn criticism from some heterodox economists because of: # \\"A lack of awareness of work which has been done within economics itself.\\" # \\"Resistance to more rigorous and robust statistical methodology.\\" # \\"The belief that universal empirical regularities can be found in many areas of economic activity.\\" # \\"The theoretical models which are being used to explain empirical phenomena.\\" In response to these criticism there are claims of a general maturing of these non-traditional empirical approaches to Finance. This defense of the subject does not flatter the use of physics metaphors but does defend the alternative empirical approach of \\"econophysics\\" itself. Some of the key data claims have been questioned in terms of methods of data analysis. Some of the ideas arising from nonlinear sciences and statistical physics have been helpful in shifting our understanding financial markets, and may yet be found useful, but the particular requirements of stochastic analysis to the specific models useful in finance is apparently unique to finance as a subject. There is much lacking in this approach to finance yet it would appear that the canonical approach to finance based optimization of individual behaviour given information and preferences with assumptions to allow aggregation in equilibrium are even more problematic. It has been suggested that what is required is a change in mindset within finance and economics that moves the field towards methods of natural science. Perhaps finance needs to be thought of more as an observational science where markets are observed in the same way as the observable universe in cosmology, or the observable ecosystems in the environmental sciences. Here local principles can be uncovered by local experiments but meaningful global experiments are difficult to envision as feasible without reproducing the system being observed. The required science becomes that based largely on pluralism (see scientific pluralism the view that some phenomena observed in science require multiple explanations to account for their nature), as in most sciences that deal with complexity, rather than a singled unified mathematical framework that is to be verified by experiment. == See also == * Mathematical finance * Econophysics * Financial econometrics * Complexity * Statistical physics * Modeling and analysis of financial markets * Time series analysis == References  Bibliography == See Econophysics bibliography and text books *Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Marc Potters, Theory of Financial Risk and Derivative Pricing, Cambridge University Press (2003) * Rosario N.

It was built close to the Rotherham borough boundary with access from Rawmarsh Road, Rotherham and served two rows of stone build terraced houses, \\"Parkgate Row\\", closest to the station and \\"Stone Row\\", actually on Rotherham Road, Parkgate. The station, opened in September 1871, was built in the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway's (MS&LR;) \\"Double Pavilion\\" style with the main building on the Doncaster bound platform, approach being from Rotherham Road. This station was provided with a private waiting room reserved for the use of Earl Fitzwilliam and his parties. This facility also included a toilet with the Earl's crest featured on the w.c. In particular this involved regular travel to Doncaster for the St. Leger race meeting when an all first class train was run from Sheffield to Doncaster calling only at Rotherham Road. The station was closed on 5 January 1953. The stationmaster had, under his control, the small yard and interchange sidings on the Rotherham side of the station. This handled some of the traffic to and from South Yorkshire Coke and Chemicals works and, from 1873 via Earl Fitzwilliam's private railway, his colliery interests. At the buffer stops end of the yard there was a wagon repair facility which closed many years ago. The access to the yard was controlled by Rotherham Road signal box until 10 May 1987 when Sheffield power box took over control of the line between Holmes Junction and Aldwarke Junction. The box was demolished over the weekend of 30-31 January 1988. Immediately on the Parkgate side of the station was a small swing bridge carrying the line over the Greasbrough Canal which necessitated a speed limit, which has been raised since the span was fixed. This was controlled by an early MS&LR; hipped roof signal box named \\"Parkgate\\" built on the Parkgate side of the canal by the line. This early signal box was removed in the early years of the 20th century, a few years after the opening of Rotherham Road signal box. At the nationalisation of the canals, this canal was not included and it belongs to Earl Fitzwilliam's Estates. ==References== *'The South Yorkshire Railway', D.L.Franks.

All characters are from the original manga unless otherwise noted. ==Hokuto Shinken== Hokuto Shinken (ÂåóÊñóÁ•ûÊã≥, \\"Big Dipper Divine Fist\\") is an ancient martial art rooted in different fighting styles dating back 1,800 years ago from China. Its founder was Kenshiro's and Hyoh's ancestor Shuken of the ancient \\"Hokuto S≈çke\\" ruling line, who combined Seito Gekken's (Ë•øÊñóÊúàÊã≥, West Dipper Lunar Fist) Keiraku Hik≈ç with his Hokuto S≈çke no Ken (ÂåóÊñóÂÆóÂÆ∂„ÅÆÊã≥, North Dipper Head Family Fist, North Dipper Originator Fist). This martial art makes use of the opponents' 708 Keiraku Hik≈ç (ÁµåÁµ°ÁßòÂ≠î Meridian Channel Hidden Points, also known as simply Hik≈ç, tsubo or pressure points). These pressure points destroy the enemy from within. The Hik≈ç can also be used to heal and even to revive the dead. While a normal fighter uses 30% of his natural abilities, a Hokuto Shin Ken successor knows how to utilize his remaining 70% using Tenry≈´ Koky≈´ H≈ç (Ëª¢ÈæçÂëºÂê∏Ê≥ï Art of Dragon's Breathing). A Hokuto Shinken successor can also resist attacks on the pressure points with the Hik≈ç F≈´ji (ÁßòÂ≠îÂ∞Å„Åò, Pressure Point Sealing), copy techniques after witnessing them only once with Suieishin (Ê∞¥Êò†ÂøÉ, Water Reflection Spirit), move with superhuman speed using Raib≈ç Shin Kyaku (Èõ∑Êö¥Á•ûËÑö, Thunder Violent God Leg) a leaping technique which leaves indentations on the ground and use T≈çki (ÈóòÊ∞ó Fighting Spirit), an expert user can often radiate T≈çki from his own body as an aura (T≈çki no Aura, or Fighting Spirit Aura) whilst focusing it for attacks. It can be used to launch ki-based attacks that can be used to strike targets, even tiny ones, like the Keiraku Hiko with Tenha Kassatsu (Â§©Á†¥Ê¥ªÊÆ∫, Heaven Breaking Impalement) at long range, or, to defend the user from attack. Use Shichisei Tenshin (‰∏ÉÊòüÁÇπÂøÉ, Seven Star Point Spirit) a secret technique of Hokuto Shinken that allows the user to move in a pattern resembling the Hokuto Shichi Sei (Big Dipper). This technique allows the user to attack their opponent from seven blind spots inherent in a human's field of vision, with each blind spot corresponding to a star in the Big Dipper constellation of seven stars. Hokuto Shin Ken follows the Isshi S≈çden(‰∏ÄÂ≠êÁõ∏‰ºù) tradition: it can only be passed down from one father to one son, and there can only be one successor at a time. Sons that do not succeed in becoming successor must never practice the art again, or risk having their memories erased or fists destroyed. The ultimate Hokuto Shin Ken technique is the Mus≈ç Tensei (ÁÑ°ÊÉ≥Ëª¢Áîü, Nil-Thought Rebirth), which can only be performed by one who completely understands sadness. \\"Hokuto Shin Ken\\" is named after the asterism Hokuto Shichi Sei, which is the Japanese name as the Big Dipper. ===Kenshiro === The protagonist of the series, Kenshiro is the youngest of the four Hokuto brothers and the chosen successor of Hokuto Shinken (ÂåóÊñóÁ•ûÊã≥ Big Dipper God Fist). === Raoh === The eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, Raoh is a conqueror who takes the mantle of Ken-Oh or 'The King of Fists'. Believed to be the strongest and obvious choice to become the sole user of Hokuto Shinken, Raoh is a towering and intimidating man standing at least 7 feet tall (in some fights he is depicted being substantially larger i.e. 10‚Äì12 feet). After learning of Kenshiro's chosen succession as the single user of Hokuto Shinken, Raoh abandons his loyalty to his brothers and his master to wander the wastelands and become the ruler of all including conquering Heaven itself. Before leaving however, his master Ryuken begs him to give up his ambitions of conquest by never practicing his martial art or to \\"seal his hands\\" (achieved by destroying/removing his hands or his mind or by committing suicide). Raoh of course refuses and kills his master in a duel as Ryuken's fading health stops him from defending himself. Before dying Ryuken tells Raoh that because of his prideful ambitions he will never be able to achieve true mastery of their martial art, which infuriated him and planted seeds of doubt into his mind. Raoh would go on to become one the most powerful warlords of the wastelands and eventually lead armed forces larger than the Southern Cross 6, the likes of Shin or even its leader Souther (Thouser). Raoh is a true power house of destructive force, as his technique is the \\"Hard Fist\\" style of Hokuto Shinken. This style focuses on crushing blows and straightforward assaults along with energy waves that destroy most anything they are directed at. Raoh's most notable character trait both in and out of combat is his overwhelming need to always press further and never retreat, not even one step or else his pride and claim of being the greatest will be in question. === Toki === is the second of the four Hokuto brothers. He is a pacifist who seeks to use Hokuto Shinken as a healing art. Toki's self-made technique, , is an art that is capable of healing or destroying that which it is used on. When fatally wounded with this style, the victim experiences feelings of euphoria and compassion, instead of horrific pain. Toki is from the Land of Shura, and along with Raoh, was orphaned and adopted by Ryuken, who is seeking a student to train. Although he originally doesn't train Toki, Toki showed incredible potential, and promises that he will stop Raoh if he falls down the wrong path. Toki and Kenshiro soon became friends, with Toki personally training Kenshiro in some techniques of Hokuto Shinken, sustaining a distinctive scar on his back from when he protected a young Kenshiro from a falling tree. He sustained severe Radiation sickness while protecting Kenshiro, Yuria and a large group of children. His illness precluded him from becoming the Hokuto Shinken successor and remained with him for the rest of his life. Toki was voiced by Takaya Hashi in the TV series, Hideyuki Tanaka in Shin Hokuto no Ken, Keny≈´ Horiuchi in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu movies, and by Hiroki Touchi in the Ten no Ha≈ç anime series. Kirk Thornton voiced Toki in English dub of the TV series. === Jagi === is the third of the four Hokuto brothers. Deceptive and evil, Jagi stops at nothing to win and frequently cheats during battle. He never really mastered Hokuto Shinken, relying on his sawed-off shotgun to finish off most of his opponents. After a botched attempt at killing Kenshiro, he is left with a hideously disfigured head as a reminder of his failure. Consequently, he hides his head by wearing an iron helmet and a section of plating over the disfigured portion of his face to control the constant pain it produces. Harboring a severe hatred for Kenshiro, Jagi was the one who manipulated Shin into betraying Kenshiro. Afterwards, he engraves seven scars on his chest in the same Big Dipper-like pattern as the ones on Ken's chest and began terrorizing numerous villagers with his gang, while claiming to be the true Kenshiro himself. Kenshiro tracks him down and easily defeats him, despite Jagi having somehow learned basic Nanto Seiken as well as Hokuto Shinken. His face finally starts exploding but as he dies he reveals that Toki and Raoh are still alive and gleefully declares his hopes that Kenshiro would be destroyed in the battles to come. Jagi was voiced by K≈çji Totani in the TV series, Chikao ≈åtsuka in the 1986 movie and David It≈ç 2007 OVA Yulia Den. In English dubs, he was voiced by Dan Woren in the 1986 movie and Peter Lurie in the TV series. Chris Penn portrayed Jagi (renamed \\"Jackal\\" in this adaptation, unrelated to the other character with the same name) in the 1995 live-action movie. === Ryuken === The previous successor to the Hokuto Shinken style. was the sifu who adopted and trained Raoh, Toki, Jagi, and Kenshiro in the Hokuto Shinken style. After he chose Kenshiro as his successor, he was slain by Raoh, a feat made possible by chance; he suffered a stroke at the moment he was about to seal Raoh's fist. Kenshiro did not know the real cause of Ryuken's death, having been told that Ryuken died from illness, until Toki revealed the shameful secret during their first battle. Both Kenshiro and Raoh reflect on Ryuken's teachings during difficult situations. In Fist of the Blue Sky, his real name is revealed to be Ramon Kasumi, younger half-brother of Yan Wang, Kenshiro Kasumi. In the original TV series, Ryuken was originally voiced by Junji Chiba, later replaced by Ry≈´ji Saikachi in the later episodes and 1986 movie, with K≈çji Totani as the younger version of him. He was also played by Chikao ≈åtsuka in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu series, by Mugihito and Takashi Kondo (as a young boy) in the Fist of the Blue Sky anime series, and by Atsushi Ono in the Ten no Haoh anime series. Malcolm McDowell played Ryuken in the 1995 live-action movie. === Koryu === is a former rival of Ryuken who competed against him for the succession of the Hokuto Shinken. During the duel, both Koryu and Ryuken realize that their strength and skills are equal, and that both of them could be killed in the fight. Acknowledging that, Koryu decided to give up the successorship to Ryuken, and to begin living an ascetic peaceful life in the mountains. Raoh, after healing himself of the wound given to him by Kenshiro, challenges Koryu to test his body and defeats him. Raoh, however, spares the lives of Koryu's two sons, Zeus and Aus. ==Nanto Seiken== is an assassination art that is characterized as the polar opposite to the Hokuto Shinken style. Whereas Hokuto Shinken destroys enemies from within through the use of the keiraku hik≈ç vital points, Nanto Seiken teaches its practitioners to kill with sheer force through the use of stabbing and slicing techniques. The Nanto Seiken school has branched out to 108 sects, with the six top masters of these sects being known as the , whose fates are intertwined to a star within the Nanto constellation. With the exception of the Last General of Nanto, who uses no martial art, each Nanto master is trained in a style of Nanto Seiken named after a bird. === Shin === is Kenshiro's first major adversary in the series. Shin represents the and is the successor of the style. Shin was Kenshiro's friend and rival, who secretly desired Kenshiro's fianc√©e Yuria from afar, but knew Yuria's heart was for Kenshiro and gave up pursuing her. However, his mind was eventually corrupted by Jagi. Shin challenged Kenshiro, after destroying Ryuken's grave stone, and defeated him, engraving the seven scars on his chest afterwards and subsequently taking off with Yuria by force. He then forms the King organization and builds Yulia the city of Southern Cross. However, he is unable to win Yuria's love and after her suicide attempt, Shin entrusts her to the Nanto Goshasei for her protection. Sometime afterwards, he is challenged by Kenshiro in his lair and is defeated. Mortally wounded, he claimed that Yuria had died from the fall, then he jumped off the roof of his own palace so that the fatal impact would kill him, instead of Kenshiro's attack. Shin was voiced by Toshio Furukawa in the TV series and 1986 movie and by Takuya Kirimoto in the 2007 OVA Yulia Den. In English dubs, he was voiced by Michael McConnohie in the 1986 movie and by Steven Blum in the TV series. Costas Mandylor played Lord Shin in the 1995 live-action movie. === Rei === is the successor of , which is said to be the most elegant of the Nanto Seiken styles, and represents the . While away on training, his home village was attacked by a \\"Man with Seven Scars\\" (who was actually Jagi posing as his brother Kenshiro), who killed Rei's parents and kidnapped his sister Airi. While searching for his sister's kidnapper, he met the real Kenshiro and Mamiya while working as a spy for the Fang Clan. Rei ends up betraying the Fang Clan and in retaliation, they track down and kidnap Airi. After his sister is rescued by Ken, Rei decides to repay him in any way possible by accompanying him in his journey. Rei decides to repay his debt to Kenshiro by challenging Raoh on Kenshiro's behalf, but is defeated. However, Raoh does not kill him immediately, but instead strikes a pressure point that will drain all the blood out of his body in a matter of three days. Rei decides to spend his last few days of his life by challenging rival Yuda, who once tormented Mamiya in the past. At peace with himself after having defeated Yuda, Rei passes away shortly afterwards. Rei was voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa in the TV series and 1986 movie, Isshin Chiba in the 2005 fighting game and Shinichiro Miki 2007 OVA Yulia Den. In English dubs, he was voiced by Gregory Snegoff in the movie and Daran Norris in the TV series. === Yuda === is the successor of , a style specializing in long range attacks. Representing the , also known as the , Yuda declares himself to be the strongest and most beautiful of fighters, and is willing to betray his own subordinates for his own gain. Yuda trained alongside Rei while they were still learning Nanto Seiken and became envious that Reis elegant fighting style was given more recognition than his own among his peers. Seeking to avenge Mamiya's honor (she was once part of Yuda's harem of female slaves), Rei challenges Yuda to a match. After being defeated by Rei, Yuda concedes that Rei is the more beautiful of the two and admits that he secretly admired Rei before dying. Judas was voiced by Bin Shimada in the original TV series and by Kisho Taniyama in the Ten no Haoh anime series. Blake Shepard voices in the English dub of Legends of the Dark King. === Shu === is the successor of the style, which specializes in kicks. He represents the , as well as a friend of Rei. Shew was once Souther's second-in-command and close friend. Some time before the events of the series, Shew met a young Kenshiro who was participating in a kumite against ten Nanto Seiken practitioners. Kenshiro had defeated all 9 prior opponents, leaving Shu as his final opponent, while Souther watched and mused about Kenshiro's strength. Shu quickly defeated Kenshiro, but chose to spare the young warrior in exchange for his eyesight. Through this self-mutilation, Shu gained the ability to see opponents using his heart, a skill which he would soon find to be his strongest asset. After the Nuclear War, Shu leads a resistance movement against Souther and his empire and is reunited with the now grown Kenshiro. Shu eventually fights Souther to save his villagers, but is defeated after Souther severs the tendons in his legs, rendering Shu unable to perform his acrobatic techniques. Shu is forced to carry the apex that will complete Souther's Holy Cross Mausoleum. He climbs to the top of the pyramid, but then gets impaled by several arrows. Kenshiro arrives, and tries to save Shu, but Souther hurls a heavy spear through Shu's chest as a Coup de gr√¢ce, mortally wounding the warrior, much to Kenshiro's horror. Shu miraculously recovers his eyesight and is able to see Kenshiro for the last time before being crushed by the apex. Shew was voiced by Katsuji Mori in the TV series and H≈çch≈´ ≈åtsuka in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu movie series. === Souther === represents the Star of . The Star of Leadership rules over the Nanto constellation; therefore, none of the other Nanto successors can defeat him. He fights with the style; the ultimate form of Nanto Seiken. This freeform style typically has no stances and instead focuses on incredible speed and power. However, there is one stance which is only reserved for when facing a worthy opponent ‚Äî . Similar to Hokuto Shinken, this style is taught in the ways of Isshi S≈çden(), meaning there can be only one master and one successor. The student must kill his master in order to complete his training. Souther is immune to most Hokuto Shinken techniques thanks to his \\"Emperor's Armor\\" (his organs and pressure points are reversed). Souther was orphaned as an infant and was raised by the previous H≈ç-≈çken successor, Ogai, who trained him during childhood, sparring with Raoh at the time. During his final training lesson, Souther unwillingly killed his sensei, who intentionally allowed himself to be killed by Souther, as the final test. Traumatized by the event, Thouzer disavowed all feelings of love and compassion. After the Nuclear War, he takes on the title of and enslaves children with his army in order to construct the Holy Cross Mausoleum, a shrine to his deceased sensei. During the events of Ten no Ha≈ç, Souther battled Raoh before the two entered into a temporary ceasefire. Later, after his first fight with Souther, Kenshiro learns the secret of Souther's immunity and is able to defeat him. Souther uses his last breaths to reconcile with his emotions. Souther was voiced by Banj≈ç Ginga in the original TV series, Akio ≈åtsuka in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu movie series, and Toshihiko Seki in the Ten no Ha≈ç anime series. Illich Guardiola voices him in the English dub of Legends of the Dark King. === Yuria === is a descendant of the Rightful Nanto Bloodline and represents the . She is Kenshiro's fianc√©e, but is admired by other men as well, particularly Raoh, Toki, Shin, and Juza. After Kenshiro was defeated by Shin, Yuria agrees to follow Shin so that Kenshiro's life will be spared. However, she is unable to tolerate the subsequent atrocities Shin commits in her name and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of Shin's palace at Southern Cross. However, she is safely caught by the Nanto Goshasei, who are sworn to protect her. She becomes the Last Nanto General and orders the Goshasei to attack Raoh. Ken rushes to the Nanto Capital after learning that she is alive, but Raoh gets to her first and uses her as bait for his final battle with Kenshiro. Kenshiro defeats Raoh and is reunited with Yuria, only to learn that she is dying from the same radiation poisoning which killed Toki. After learning this, Raoh manipulates one of her pressure points and extends her lifespan to several years instead of the few months she originally had. She spends her remaining years living a secluded life with Ken. That is the end of it in the original series, but in the OVA Kenshiro Den, she is shown to be pregnant with his child. In Hokuto no Ken 2, she and Kenshiro live in the village belonging to Shouki, Gento's Red General, after Kenshiro saves the village. They would continue to live there for the remaining part of her life. Yuria was voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto in the original Hokuto no Ken TV series and 1986 movie and by Yuriko Ishida in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu movie series.

Afterwards, Juza began living a care-free life of promiscuity and wandered the land fighting opponents alone, indifferent to the cause of the other Goshasei until he learns the true identity of the Last Nanto General. Juza challenges Raoh to a fight and manages to stall him for a while by stealing his steed, Kokuoh, but is eventually defeated in one of Raoh's most grueling battles. Juza states during the fight that his body moves 'by will alone', and this is true; despite supposedly being killed by Raoh, his lifeless body pulls itself upright and manages to wound Raoh with a single punch before falling to a final blow.

However, a young Yuria stood up to Fudoh's rampage and taught him the value of life. Fudoh became a gentle giant, and later began raising several orphaned children as a foster father. Fudoh befriends Kenshiro and his companions in order to lead them to the Nanto Capital, and eventually reveals the Last General's true identity to Ken. Raoh later challenges Fudoh in order to overcome his fear against Ken. In order to cast off his fears, Raoh draws a line behind him, and insists that if he steps backwards over the line, his troops are to kill him for his cowardice. Despite heavy injuries during the fight, Fudoh manages to make Raoh step back, but Raoh's men impale Fudoh with several large lances and arrows, mortally wounding him. The injuries soon kill him. Enraged by the actions of his own men, Raoh turns and angrily states that it was he who should have been killed, not Fudoh. He then sends his entire army running in fear. Fudoh was voiced by Sh≈çz≈ç Iizuka in the TV series and Daisuke G≈çri in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu series. === Rihaku === is the leader and military strategist of the Goshasei, specializing in setting up boobytraps.

The anime establishes Shoki as a third Gento practitioners, and introduces two additional fighters (Taiga and Boltz). The five warriors are distinguished by the colors that their aura radiate. === Falco === is the successor of Gento K≈çken. Falco once confronted Raoh in the past when his army came to invade the Celestial Lord's village, but the two came to a truce when Falco amputated his right leg (later replaced by a prosthetic) as a peace offering. Falco is later blackmailed by Jakoh to do his evil bidding when he locks away Lui, the current Celestial Lord, and is forced to fight against Kenshiro. After Lui is rescued by Bat and Ein, Falco turns against Jakoh and kills him. He later sails to the Land of Shura to rescue Lin, only to be attacked by the Nameless Shura.

Shoki befriended Kenshiro in the past, who was traveling with an ill Yulia, and allowed the two to live in his village until Yulia's death. When they first met, he refused to reveal his real name to Kenshiro, fearing that they might face off as enemies one day. Years later, Shoki revolts against Jakoh and attempts to sneak out of the Imperial Capital with the help of Falco, only to be killed by Shieno (Boltz in the TV series). == Hokuto Ryuken == is a fighting style which branched off from the main Hokuto family along with Hokuto Shinken that was founded by Shuken's cousin Ry≈´≈ç.

The three that Kenshiro faces are all masters of this art. The ultimate Hokuto Ryuken technique is which warps space around the opponent and nullifies gravity, leaving the opponent completely disoriented. === Kaioh === is the . He proclaims himself to be the and the . Kaioh is the elder blood brother of Raoh and Toki, who remained in Shura after his brothers left the country when they were children. He bears a strong resemblance to Raoh, but a bit taller, darker complexion, and an X-shaped scar on his face. Kaioh is characterized as the strongest warrior of Shura and is the only other character alongside Shin and Souther to brutally defeat Kenshiro following their initial encounter. He wears a specially constructed armor which allows him to control his evil aura, but can easily burn it off when he unleashes all his Matoki. He hates the main Hokuto bloodline, from which Ken and Hyoh are descended from, due to the fact that he was forced to play a subordinate role to Hyoh by Jukei, despite being a more gifted warrior. His hatred was furthered after the death of his mother, who died saving Kenshiro and Hyoh. Kaioh is the last major villain in the manga (there are others after him) and the final opponent Kenshiro faces in the TV series. === Hyoh === is the . He is a descendant of the main Hokuto bloodline and Kenshiro's true older brother. After being separated from Ken as a child, his memories were sealed away by Jukei, the scar on his forehead being the result of this. Hyoh was favored by Jukei over Kaioh due to his bloodline, but plays a subordinate role to Kaioh in the present. Unlike Kaioh, Hyoh is initially portrayed as a more benevolent ruler until he goes insane and turns evil after Sayaka's death. He returns to his normal self after fighting Ken and regains his lost memories. He rescues Lin from the Warriors of Shura while Ken fights against Kaioh. After his memories were restored, he realizes what Jukei has done during his training, understanding Kaioh's pain, ultimately taking full responsibility for Kaioh's actions. Badly injured during the battle against Kaioh's forces, he manages to reach Kenshiro and Kaioh just in time to see their battle conclude before passing away in Kaioh's arms. === Han === is the and the first of the Hokuto Ry≈´ken masters Kenshiro faces in Shura. Han uses a personal fighting style called Mabo Koso (È≠îËàûÁ¥ÖËñ¨, Magical crimson dance) which allows him to move his fists so fast, they don't even cast a shadow. He reveals Kenshiro's origin at the land of Shura during their battle; implying he knew Kenshiro was Hyoh's brother and pleaded with him to leave Shura before ultimately dying from his wounds. After being killed, his body drifts from the blood-soiled lake into Hyoh's castle, who swears to avenge Han's death. === Shachi === is the son of Akashachi, the pirate. As a child, he met and began to admire Raoh while his father worked under his command. On one adventure, his father's crew was attacked by Shura Warriors (it is implied it was Kaioh's army); the result being left behind in Shura after Akashachi and his remaining men fled during an attack. There, he became romantically involved with Leia, a local girl. He soon became Jukei's fourth student and learned Hokuto Ry≈´ken to protect Leia. He began fighting against the Shuras, eventually earning a reputation as \\"Rakshasa.\\" At first, he only teams up with Ken to use him in his plot to destroy the three \\"Rash≈ç,\\" offering Lin to Han so that Ken would fight him. After he is reunited with Akashachi before his death, Shachi becomes a loyal ally to Ken, sacrificing his left eye to Hyoh so that Ken would not be captured. He helps Ken restore Hyoh's memories, but later dies after being mortally wounded while fighting against Kaioh himself. === Jukei === is the Hokuto Ry≈´ken master who trained the three Rash≈ç and Shachi. In the past, he went through a demonic possession as a result of his misuse of his style, killing his wife and child, but was rescued by Ryuken. He then trained Kaioh and Hyoh, sealing Hyoh's memories of Kenshiro and his knowledge of the original Hokuto style. The main reason for the training Kaioh, Hyoh, and Han the art because Shura needed defenders of the land and that the three were too \\"weak\\" to learn Hokuto Shinken; Kaioh was filled with hatred, while Hyoh was emotionally attached to his brother; despite knowing the risks involved, he taught Hokuto Ryuken in order to buy time so a Hokuto Shinken successor will return to Shura (expecting it would be Raoh). In the present, he forms part of Leia's resistance, after Hokuto Ryuken has corrupted his students, and attempts to undo the seal to prevent the two brothers of the Hokuto Soke from destroying each other, which would result in the absolute destruction of the Hokuto Soke bloodline. However, Hyoh's seal was compromised by Kaioh and any attempt to restore Hyoh's memory was lost. Realizing what Kaioh has done, Hyoh gives the mortal blow; dying, Jukei would regret his past deeds as his mistakes may doom all of Shura. In Souten no Ken, he appears as an orphaned child belonging to the Hokuto Ry≈´kaken. == Other main characters  Bat === is a young boy who accompanies Kenshiro in his journey. Bat left his home village to fend for himself so that his adoptive mother Toyo could take better care of her other orphans. He was eventually imprisoned in Lin's home village for trying to steal food and was locked in the same cell as Kenshiro, where the two met for the first time. After escaping, Bat decides to follow Kenshiro as his self-appointed sidekick, hoping to use Ken's strength to gain food for himself, but gradually matures as he witnesses the many tragic events, including the death of his adoptive mother. He grows up and forms the Hokuto Army with Lin to fight the Heavenly Emperor's Army, becoming a wanted fugitive. As a young adult, Bat has rudimentary martial art skills, along with limited knowledge of Hokuto Shinken. At the end of the manga, Bat gives up on his love for Lin so she and Kenshiro could get married and finally, live the happy life they deserve so much. He presses Lin's pressure points to make her forget about him and manages to reunite Lin with an also amnesiac Ken, but fate forces him to pose as Ken in order to fight against Bolge, a blind and dangerous thug with a grudge against Ken. Bat is captured and horribly tortured by Bolge, but does his best to leave a convincing impersonation of Ken, hoping that with his death, the real Ken gets declared officially dead and future thugs leave him alone. Just before Bat's death, the real Ken rescues him and defeats the entire thug gang, moved by Bat's ultimate sacrifice. Lin decides to stay behind and guard Bat's grave forever, only to discover that Ken managed to save Bat's life by manipulating his remaining pressure points.

In the past, Yuda slaughtered Mamiya's parents and kidnapped her with the intent to make her his concubine, branding her with the \\"UD\\" mark on her back. She eventually managed to escape, and in her humiliation, renounced her womanhood and became a warrior. Mamiya recruits Ken and Rei as guardians of her village and later accompanies the two for several arcs of the story. During the trio's time together, Mamiya, due to her similar attributes with Yuria, feelings for Kenshiro, though he does not acknowledge it; she also becomes the object of Rei's affections. However, burdened by the shame of her past, she is never able to express her love in return. In order that she would never forget him, Rei uses his final living days to challenge Yuda, whom he defeats and avenges the crimes that Judas committed against Mamiya in the past.

Director Peter Timm's film My Brother Is a Dog, features Lewis as the Antiquit√§tenh√§ndler in a film about a young girl wishing for a dog. Lewis ended the year with two films about the post 9/11 tension between the Western and Arab worlds. First was a supporting role in writer Simon Beaufoy's Yasmin, set in Northern England before and after the 9/11 attacks. Second was Sally Potter's fourth feature film Yes, which views the post-traumatic rift through the lens of two lovers caught in the divide. In 2005, Lewis starred in Christian Carion's international production of the film Joyeux No√´l. Set in WWI, the film explores the \\"Christmas Truce\\" of 1914 between the armies of three countries. In a departure from previous films, Lewis was next featured in director Danny Cannon's football film Goal! The Dream Begins, which focuses on a Mexican football player trying out for the Newcastle United Football Club. Clive Gordon's 2006 film Cargo, a psychological thriller, featured Lewis opposite Daniel Bruhl and Peter Mullan. As the skipper of a bankrupt Scottish fishing trawler in True North, Lewis and actor Martin Compston tackle the subject of migrant smuggling and the effects it has on those making the journey. At the end of 2005, Lewis starred as Hrothgar in 20th Century Fox's live action adaptation of Christopher Paolini's hit fantasy trilogy Eragon. The 2008 British black comedy Three and Out (released as A Deal Is A Deal in Australia), from director Johnathan Gershfield, saw Lewis in the supporting role of Callaghan. The film focuses on a train conductor who tries to use a little known three strikes rule of the London train service to force an early retirement and payout for himself. Screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival, Lewis' next film was director Robert Rae's debut film Trouble Sleeping, which tells the story of a Palestinian refugee's struggles in the UK. Psychological thriller Dorothy Mills, directed by Agnes Merlet, featured Lewis as the brainwashing pastor of a small community on a bleak Irish island. His last film of 2008 was Mark Aldridge's drama Blessed, alongside James Nesbitt and Lil Woods. Reprising the role of Mal Braithwaite, Lewis began 2009 with the third instalment of Andrew Morahan's football series entitled Goal! III: Taking On the World. Wasted, his next film from filmmakers Caroline Paterson and Stuart Davids, treated the subject of homelessness in Glasgow, Scotland. From there he was cast in the Danish film Valhalla Rising, alongside Mads Mikkelson, and director Christian Carion's Cold War thriller Farewell (L'Affaire Farewell). Lewis returned to short films in 2010 with director Tom Shrapnel's Eat Me, Tribeca Film Festival Judge's Award nominee The Terms, Robert James Armstrong's Little Green Bag, and Vocation opposite James Chalmers. He was also featured in Peter Mullan's gang drama Neds. 2011 showcased Lewis in two additional short films. The first, from director and writer Raisah Ahmed, titled Last Order, featured Lewis alongside Leann O'Kasi and David Elliot. The second was filmmaker Gregor Johnstone's comedy Rule of Thumb, which saw Lewis as the school janitor during a disastrous standoff. In 2012, Lewis appeared in two feature films. The Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich, which explored psychiatrist Wilhem Reich's career and subsequent investigation by the FDA and other government agencies. He played Dr. Donald Cameron, who was President of the American, Canadian and World Psychiatric Associations. When the Lights Went Out starred Lewis as Father Clifford, a local priest who performs an exorcism on a house plagued by a poltergeist. The film is based on the real-life experiences of director Pat Holden's mother and aunt in 1970s West Yorkshire. Lewis' next role was Andrew Griffin's short film The Gift (2012), which was screened at the New York International Independent Film Festival in 2013. Thirteen years after first working with May Thomas Miles in One Life Stand, Lewis reunited with the filmmaker in 2013 for the film version of her BAFTA winning interactive website The Devil's Plantation. Both the website and film are based on archaeologist Harry Bell's belief that Glasgow, Scotland was laid out based upon a secret, hidden design he called the Secret Geometry. Lewis starred as Bell, opposite Kate Dickie‚Äôs psychiatric patient Mary Ross, as their lives intertwine. He then appeared in Scottish romantic comedy Not Another Happy Ending as Benny Lockhart opposite Karen Gillan and fellow Outlander alumni Stanley Weber. Director Alberto Arvelo's The Liberator, the story of Venezuelan freedom fighter Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, featured Lewis as Colonel Rooke of the Irish Brigade while director John S. Baird's psychological police drama Filth, saw Lewis guest star as Gus. Later that year, Lewis featured in Luca Barbareschi's The Mercury Factor, which takes on the issue of adulterated food. Returning to independent films at the end of 2013, Lewis starred alongside Teresina Moscatiello in the German production Waiting and in Marcus McPeake's short film For Gracie. === 2014‚Äìpresent === First time British director Daniel Wolfe's thriller Catch Me Daddy (2014), which screened at the Director's Fortnight strand and focused on a teenager and her boyfriend who flee from her overbearing father, portrays Lewis as hired thug Tony, who is sent to retrieve the runaways. In 2015, Lewis appeared in short films, working twice with director Gordon Napier. The first film was the drama La Chasse, in which Lewis portrayed the protagonist's deceased father through a voice over. Second was the 25-minute short Tide, which saw Lewis star as lobster fisherman Alasdaire as he watches the life he knew erode into modern practices. Also in 2015, Lewis in featured in Joshua J. Krull's German language short film The Heavy Load. In 2018, Lewis returned to feature films with director Marcus H. Rosenm√ºller's football flick The Keeper. The film is a story of German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who helped Manchester City win the FA Cup final in 1956. He also featured opposite Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan in Kristoffer Nyholm's 1930s era thriller, The Vanishing. ==Television== Lewis (L) and 213x213px === 1993‚Äì2013 === Lewis' first professional role, in 1993, was in BBC's anthology series Screen One, in a feature-length episode entitled Down Among the Big Boys. The standalone film, also starring Douglas Henshall and Billy Connolly, focuses on the marriage of a policeman's son to a criminals daughter. His next project was a 1995 made- for-TV movie from writer/director David Kane. Ruffian Hearts is a romantic comedy set in a Glasgow tenement where Lewis' character resided.

In electronics, biasing is the setting of initial operating conditions (current and voltage) of an active device in an amplifier. Many electronic devices, such as diodes, transistors and vacuum tubes, whose function is processing time-varying (AC) signals, also require a steady (DC) current or voltage at their terminals to operate correctly. This current or voltage is a bias. The AC signal applied to them is superpositioned on this DC bias current or voltage. The operating point of a device, also known as bias point, quiescent point, or Q-point, is the DC voltage or current at a specified terminal of an active device (a transistor or vacuum tube) with no input signal applied. A bias circuit is a portion of the device's circuit which supplies this steady current or voltage. ==Overview== In electronics, bias usually refers to a fixed DC voltage or current applied to a terminal of an electronic component such as a diode, transistor or vacuum tube in a circuit in which AC signals are also present, in order to establish proper operating conditions for the component. For example, a bias voltage is applied to a transistor in an electronic amplifier to allow the transistor to operate in a particular region of its transconductance curve. For vacuum tubes, a grid bias voltage is often applied to the grid electrodes for the same reason. In magnetic tape recording, the term bias is also used for a high-frequency signal added to the audio signal and applied to the recording head, to improve the quality of the recording on the tape. This is called tape bias. ==Importance in linear circuits== Linear circuits involving transistors typically require specific DC voltages and currents for correct operation, which can be achieved using a biasing circuit. As an example of the need for careful biasing, consider a transistor amplifier. In linear amplifiers, a small input signal gives larger output signal without any change in shape (low distortion): the input signal causes the output signal to vary up and down about the Q-point in a manner strictly proportional to the input. However, because the relationship between input and output for a transistor is not linear across its full operating range, the transistor amplifier only approximates linear operation. For low distortion, the transistor must be biased so the output signal swing does not drive the transistor into a region of extremely nonlinear operation. For a bipolar junction transistor amplifier, this requirement means that the transistor must stay in the active mode, and avoid cut-off or saturation. The same requirement applies to a MOSFET amplifier, although the terminology differs a little: the MOSFET must stay in the active mode, and avoid cutoff or ohmic operation. ==Bipolar junction transistors== For bipolar junction transistors the bias point is chosen to keep the transistor operating in the active mode, using a variety of circuit techniques, establishing the Q-point DC voltage and current. A small signal is then applied on top of the bias. The Q-point is typically near the middle of the DC load line, so as to obtain the maximum available peak-to-peak signal amplitude without distortion due to clipping as the transistor reaches saturation or cut-off. The process of obtaining an appropriate DC collector current at a certain DC collector voltage by setting up the operating point is called biasing. == Vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) == Grid bias is the DC voltage provided at the control grid of a vacuum tube relative to the cathode for the purpose of establishing the zero input signal or steady state operating condition of the tube.Landee, Davis, Albrecht, Electronic Designers' Handbook, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1957, p. 2-27. * In a typical Class A voltage amplifier, and class A and AB1 power stages of audio power amplifiers, the DC bias voltage is negative relative to the cathode potential. The instantaneous grid voltage (sum of DC bias and AC input signal) does not reach the point where grid current begins. * Class B amplifiers using general-purpose tubes are biased negatively to the projected plate current cutoff point. The bias voltage source must have low resistance and be able to supply the grid current.Landee et al., 1957, p. 4-19. When tubes designed for class B are employed, the bias can be as little as zero. * Class C amplifiers are biased negatively at a point well beyond plate current cutoff. Grid current occurs during significantly less than 180 degrees of the input frequency cycle. There are many methods of achieving grid bias. Combinations of bias methods may be used on the same tube. * Fixed bias: The DC grid potential is determined by connection of the grid to an appropriate impedance that will pass DC from an appropriate voltage source. * Cathode bias (self-bias, automatic bias) - The voltage drop across a resistor in series with the cathode is utilized. The grid circuit DC return is connected to the other end of the resistor, causing the DC grid voltage to be negative relative to the cathode. * Grid leak bias: When the grid is driven positive during part of the input frequency cycle, such as in class C operation, rectification in the grid circuit in conjunction with capacitive coupling of the input signal to the grid produces negative DC voltage at the grid. A resistor (the grid leak) permits discharge of the coupling capacitor and passes the DC grid current. The resultant bias voltage is equal to the product of the DC grid current and the grid leak resistance. * Bleeder bias: The voltage drop across a portion of a resistance across the plate voltage supply determines the grid bias. The cathode is connected to a tap on the resistance. The grid is connected to an appropriate impedance that provides a DC path either to the negative side of the plate voltage supply or to another tap on the same resistance. * Initial velocity bias (contact bias): Initial velocity grid current is passed through a grid-to-cathode resistor, usually in the range of 1 to 10 megohms, making the grid potential around one volt negative relative to the cathode.Landee et al., 1957, p. 2-28. Initial velocity bias is used only for small input signal voltages. ==Microphones== Electret microphone elements typically include a junction field-effect transistor as an impedance converter to drive other electronics within a few meters of the microphone. The operating current of this JFET is typically 0.1 to 0.5 mA and is often referred to as bias, which is different from the phantom power interface which supplies 48 volts to operate the backplate of a traditional condenser microphone. Electret microphone bias is sometimes supplied on a separate conductor. == See also == * Idling current * Small signal model ==References Further reading == * * * Category:Electronic engineering Category:Vacuum tubes ","title":"Biasing"},{"id":"7458904","text":"Lipov√© (, Hungarian pronunciation:), 1926-1950: Hod≈æovo () is a village and municipality in the Kom√°rno District in the Nitra Region of south-west Slovakia. ==Geography== The village lies at an altitude of 110 metres and covers an area of 10.578 km¬≤.

Academic facilities and departments centered on this campus are primarily those related to the natural sciences: physics, pharmacy, engineering, psychology, mathematics and statistics, chemistry, geology, and biology. The Rutgers Medical School was also built on this campus in 1970, but a year later was separated by the state, renamed the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and merge with the New Jersey Medical School and other health profession schools in Newark and New Brunswick to create the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Rutgers and the medical school continued to share the land and facilities on the campus in a slightly irregular arrangement. On July 1, 2013, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School was officially merged back into Rutgers University, along with most of the other schools of UMDNJ, with the exception of the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine. The campus is named after Charles L. Busch (1902‚Äì1971), of Edgewater, New Jersey, an eccentric millionaire, who unexpectedly donated $10 million to the University for biological research at his death in 1971. The campus was formerly known as \\"University Heights Campus\\". The land was donated by the state in the 1930s, and a stadium was constructed.

Downtown comprises the portion of the neighborhood Riverside south of the Spokane River. Its rough boundaries are I-90 to the south, Division Street to the east, Maple Street to the west, and the Spokane River to the north. ==Geography== Street layout of Spokane city center. The street grid breaks down in the South Hill due to the challenges of the terrain The topography of Downtown Spokane is mostly flat except for areas downstream of the Spokane Falls which are located in a canyon; the elevation is approximately above sea level. South of Downtown slopes up to the South Hill, quite steeply in some places such as Pioneer Park, where long cliffs oriented east-west provide great views of Downtown, the North Side and Spokane Valley to the east. Downtown Spokane straddles Sprague Avenue, which divides the city into North and South. On the eastern end of Downtown, Division Street splits the city into East and West. I-90 is elevated through almost all of downtown, often with parking lots underneath, but occasional blocks are solid cement, forming a barrier at the southern end of Downtown. Immediately south of the Interstate the high density area continues into a growing medical district with Spokane's two largest hospitals, Sacred Heart and Deaconess. To the west is one of Spokane's oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne's Addition. In the photo, Browne's addition is the treed area in the foreground on the right. The left side of the foreground is the valley cut by the Spokane river immediately downstream of the falls; this is the small and similar neighborhood of Peaceful Valley. Gonzaga University is located just upstream on the north side of the river from Downtown Spokane. Across the river from Gonzaga are the new University District home campuses of Eastern Washington University and Washington State University. Division Street separates Downtown from the University District. The Riverside neighborhood of downtown Spokane has a Walk Score of 90 out of 100, rating as a ‚ÄúWalkers Paradise‚Äù meaning daily errands do not require a car.https://www.walkscore.com/WA/Spokane/Riverside ==Buildings== The tallest building in Spokane is the Bank of America Financial Center at , completed in 1981. The nearby Wells Fargo Center is the second tallest at , and opened a year later. Until 2006, with the construction of the Davenport Tower & Residences (an expansion of The Davenport Hotel). Other significant buildings in downtown include the Spokane Convention Center, the First Interstate Center for the Arts, and the Spokane Arena. ===Rebirth and development=== Davenport Hotel lobby Dowtown Spokane had undergone a major rebirth in the years before the recession, after the completion of the River Park Square Mall. The historic Davenport Hotel underwent a major renovation in 2002 after being vacant for over 20 years. The project was funded by local entrepreneur Walt Worthy, who also added a Safari-themed 20 story tower to the hotel in 2007. Other major projects include the Holley Mason Building - seen as the catalyst to Downtown's rebirth, the building of the Big Easy concert house (now renamed the Knitting Factory), the remodeling of the historic Montvale Hotel and Fox Theater (now home to the Spokane Symphony), numerous new condo buildings, and renovations of historic, older brick buildings that will soon house both condos and business. Also, the Spokane Convention Center just finished a major expansion which helped host the 2007 US Figure Skating Championships. ==Districts and areasRiverfront Park=== The Great Northern clock tower and U.S. Pavilion in Riverfront Park Riverfront Park, created after Expo '74 and occupying the same site, is a park just north of Downtown Spokane. Also located in Riverside, he park is the site of some of Spokane's largest events. The park has views of the Spokane Falls, and holds a number of civic attractions, including a Skyride that is a rebuilt gondola that carries visitors across the falls from high above the river gorge, a 5-story IMAX theater, and a small amusement park (which is converted into an ice-skating rink during the winter months) with numerous rides and concessions. The park is host to a full schedule of family entertainment and events such as the Bloomsday Post-Race Celebration, Hoopfest, the IMAX Film Festival, Spokane Music Festival, Pig-Out in the Park, Restaurant Fair, Pow Wow, First Night Spokane, plus many outdoor concerts and other community activities. The Park also includes a hand-carved carousel created in 1909 by Charles I. D. Looff as a wedding present for his daughter. The carousel still operates in Riverfront Park, where riders can participate in an old-time ring toss. The carousel continues to offer a free ride to the rider who grabs the brass ring. Riverfront Park also includes ample views of the Spokane falls as well as other water features (some man-made) of the Spokane River. ===Downtown Core=== The Bank of America Financial Center (left) and the STA Plaza (right) linked by a skywalk The Downtown Core is the heart of Spokane and is generally considered to be the several block vicinity surrounding Spokane City Hall, River Park Square, the STA Plaza, and the Davenport Hotel. A majority of Spokane's high-rise buildings are located in this core area. Spokane's skywalk system also overlays the street grid and street life within the core, linking 14 blocks together. A number of downtown's retailers and restaurants are also located within the Downtown Core. ===Arts and Entertainment District=== Downtown Spokane's rich Entertainment District is home to some of the best restaurants, live entertainment venues, and hotels in Spokane. Located south and west of the Downtown Core, this area hosts many concerts, plays, galleries, and other shows. These events are hosted in a variety of venues including the Fox Theater, The Bing Crosby Theater, and The Knitting Factory. The Arts and Entertainment District has a number of large historic buildings. Many of these buildings are hotels that have been beautifully renovated, and capture the charm of turn of the century Spokane. More recently, this area has become a hub for breweries. There are multiple tasting rooms between Lincoln and Cedar Street along First and Second Avenue, making it a popular destination for brewery tours. ===Convention Center District=== The Centennial Trail runs through the Convention Center District between the Spokane River (pictured right) and the convention center (pictured left). The Convention Center District is situated to the east of the Downtown Core and is anchored by the Spokane Convention Center and First Interstate Center for the Arts. Its location is directly adjacent to Riverfront Park; an advantage that has been embraced through careful planning and architectural design of buildings in the district which allows the buildings to interface with the park, the river, and recreational trails (including the Centennial Trail) that run along it. The district was born out of Expo '74, which developed the original structure that ultimately became the IFirst Interstate Center for the Arts and the Spokane Convention Center. The convention center has been expanded several times since its original construction, stretching the bounds of the district farther east, where it ties into the University District. Much of the other development around the Convention Center District stems from the Spokane Convention Center and the First Interstate Center for the Arts, including restaurants, retail, and hotels. Spokane's largest and tallest hotels, including the DoubleTree, Davenport Grand, and Red Lion Hotel at the Park are located in or immediately adjacent to the convention center district. The business types located around the Convention Center District provide a common overlap with businesses supporting the adjacent University District as well, helping to alleviate some of the \\"urban dead zones\\" that are all too commonly created when the convention centers - particularly large ones in major cities much larger than Spokane - are not in use. ===Kendall Yards=== Kendall Yards is an urban infill development; its site is pictured in the lower-left hand corner. Located along the southern edge of the West Central neighborhood just across the Spokane River from Downtown Spokane is Kendall Yards, a new urbanist community. Though not officially within the boundaries of Downtown or Riverside, Kendall Yards plays a vital role in the culture and future of the downtown core by increasing the urban residential population in the immediate vicinity of it. The neighborhood is one of the largest urban infill development projects in the city's history and has reclaimed a brownfield formerly occupied by rail yards. The site of Kendall Yards used to be the main entry point of the railroad into Downtown Spokane before alterations to the downtown area in preparations for Expo '74 relocated the railroads south of the Spokane River. The site sat vacant from that point on for another three decades until 2005, when a brownfield cleanupSpokane does brownfields on a grand scale took place in preparations for the groundbreaking of the development. The cleanup, which won a US EPA award, took approximately one year and removed over 223,000 tons of contaminated soil from the site.Railroad cleanup gets EPA award The initial proposal for Kendall Yards called for 2,600 residences and 1 million square feet of commercial space, worth up to $1 billion. The development broke ground in 2007, however, the impending Great Recession bankrupted the project's developer before any buildings were constructed. The now cleaned-up site continued to sit vacant for another few years until a Spokane-based developer, Greenstone Corp., purchased the site in 2009 and began construction in 2010.Work begins on Kendall Yards housing In response to the economic conditions at the time, the original plans for the development were scaled back; the proposed density, residential unit count, and commercial square footage were all reduced to approximately one-half of the original scope. However, the scaled-back plans did have its advantages; the development was more likely to be successful, the more land would be available for open green space, and the reduced density would be more compatible with the existing fabric of the adjacent West Central neighborhood to the north. Construction of the development is phased and is expected to be ongoing through the mid-2020s. A view down Summit Parkway in the business district of Kendall Yards. It is worthwhile to note the wide sidewalks, landscaped streets, and mix of building types, all consistent with new urbanist principles. Designed on new urbanist principles, the plan and makeup of the neighborhood emphasizes mixed-use development, diversity of densities and housing types, open space, and walkability. Much of the neighborhood consists of multi-family structures of townhomes, condominiums, and apartments. There are also single-family detached homes, community gardens, free-standing commercial buildings, and mixed-use buildings (with ground-floor retail and apartment units above). Green and recreational space is also emphasized; the community includes parks, sidewalks, and plazas and also completed a long-awaited infill section of the Centennial Trail, extending it from Downtown through the entire site along the northern banks of the Spokane River Gorge. ===North Bank=== The North Bank area is located to the north of the Spokane River and Riverfront Park. It is home to a variety of uses including civic, residential, shopping, dining, and lodging. Destinations include the Spokane Arena, the central YMCA/YWCA, Spokane Civic Theater, and Flour Mill. A number of businesses based on the North Bank are in the health, banking, hotel, and real estate industries. ==CityscapeGallery== File:Chronicle Building, 926 Sprague, Spokane, Washington LCCN2017706367.tif The Chronicle Building File:Holley-Mason Building NRHP 83004262 Spokane County, WA.jpgthumbrightHolley-Mason Building ==See also== *Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington *National Register of Historic Places listings in Spokane County, Washington *List of tallest buildings in Spokane == References External links== *Images of downtown Spokane, at night Category:Geography of Spokane, Washington Category:Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington Spokane ","title":"Downtown Spokane"},{"id":"7458926","text":"Salten-Schlern ( , ) is a district (; ) in South Tyrol, Italy.

His cult is centered at Houthem near Valkenburg in the south of the province of Limburg. The Vita Beati Gerlaci Eremytae, written around 1227, describes his legend and life. Originally a licentious soldier and brigand, Gerlache became a pious Christian upon the death of his wife and went on pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem. At Rome, he nursed the sick for seven years. He also performed rites of penance for the sins of his youth. Upon returning to the Netherlands, he gave up all of his possessions to the poor and took up residence in a hollow oak on his former estate near Houthem. He ate bread mixed with ash and traveled by foot each day on pilgrimage to Maastricht, to the Basilica of Saint Servatius. Despite his extreme austerity, he was engaged in a dispute with local monks, who wanted him to enter their monastery. The common people in the area considered him a saint, but these monks appealed to the local bishop. They accused Gerlach of actually being incredibly rich, his oak actually being the location of a cache of treasure. The bishop commanded that Gerlach's oak be cut down. Gerlach, however, had by this time made powerful friends, including Hildegard of Bingen, and received protection. Nevertheless, his oak was cut down, but the bishop found no treasure and wanted to make up his mistake to the saint by having the oak cut up in planks and having a small hut constructed with those. Legend states that when Gerlach had done enough penance, water from the local well transformed itself into wine three times as a sign that his sins had been forgiven. He died shortly after, barely fifty and legend has it that the last rites were administered to him by the Saint Servatius himself. The Order of Premontre (Norbertines) claims his as one of theirs, due to his \\"rough white habit\\", and has him on its liturgical calendar as a \\"Blessed\\"https://www.norbertines.org/event/feast-of-bl-gerlac-of- valkenburg-o-praem-2017-01-05/ ==The name== Gerlach is a male forename of Germanic origin, variations of which exist in many Germanic and Romance languages. Like many other early Germanic names, it is dithematic, consisting of two meaningful constituents put together. In this case, those constituents are ger (meaning 'spear') and /la:k / (meaning 'motion'). The meaning of the name is thus 'spear thrower'. ==The church== The Sint-Gerlachus church in Houthem Sint-Gerlach is a well-known tourist site and the only religious building with frescos (paintings on marl) in the Netherlands.

She is best known for her detailed botanical illustrations, especially the two-volume Illustrations of the Natural Order of Plants, which was published between 1849 and 1855. She was an heiress of the Twinings family of tea merchants and was a philanthropist. ==Biography== Elizabeth Twining was born in 1805 into the Twinings tea-merchant family, she was one of the nine children of Richard Twining by his wife Elizabeth Mary Smythies. She was raised in London, where she learned art and drawing as part of her education, during which she was inspired by Curtis's The Botanical Magazine and the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Chiswick. Elizabeth began to draw plants and flowers, and practiced by making sketches from works in the Dulwich Picture Gallery. She was able to visit famous museums with her father's patronage. Elizabeth Twining wrote and illustrated a number of books on the subject of botany, most notably the two-volume Illustrations of the Natural Order of Plants (volume I published in 1849: volume II in 1855), which included 160 hand-coloured lithographs in royal-folio size, which were reportedly based on observations made at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, and at Lexden Park in Colchester. The subsequent 1868 quarto-size edition features cheaper colour-printed plates, as a consequence of the transition from expensive hand-colouring to a lower-quality alternative. Elizabeth Twining resided at the old family residence of Dial House, in Twickenham. She died in 1889, and, in her will, Dial House was given to the people of Twickenham for use as the vicarage. Most of her original artwork is now part of the collection of the British Museum. Elizabeth was an elder sister of the social reformer Louisa Twining. ==Other activities== Elizabeth Twining was a notable philanthropist. She established and managed a temperance hall in Portugal Street; renovated the parish almshouses near her home at Twickenham (a fact commemorated by a plaque on St Mary's Church, Twickenham); and, after a long association with King's College Hospital, established the St John's Hospital for the treatment of the poor.

The term \\"castles of steel\\" was coined by the British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill in reference to the large number of the Royal Navy's battleships he saw at Spithead in 1914. ==Summary== The book begins in the lead-up to the declaration of hostilities between Germany and Britain, whereas Massie's previous work Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the coming of the Great War ended with the beginning of the war. All the significant naval strategies and battles of World War I are covered, including the Battle of Coronel, where a German squadron led by Admiral Maximilian von Spee destroyed a weaker British cruiser squadron under the command of Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock; the ensuing Battle of the Falkland Islands where von Spee's force was annihilated by a superior British squadron; the Battle of Dogger Bank (1915); Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign; and a detailed multichapter narrative of the Battle of Jutland and its aftermath. Other chapters describe German submarine warfare and events triggering America's entry into the war. There are also chapters dedicated to central personalities such as British Admirals John Jellicoe and David Beatty and the German Admirals Franz von Hipper and Reinhard Scheer.

The shock was centered southwest of Puak≈ç and north of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, just offshore of the Kona Airport, at a depth of . It produced several aftershocks, including one that measured a magnitude of 6.1 seven minutes after the main shock. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center measured a nondestructive tsunami of on the coast of the Big Island. ==Tectonic setting== The island of Hawaii is effected by earthquakes related to three main causes. Some are associated with the movement of magma and tend to be shallow focus (less than 5 km depth). The largest earthquakes are those caused by overall gravitational spreading of the volcano, whether within the volcano's flanks or at the base of the volcanic pile. They tend to have focal depths in the range 5‚Äì13 km. The final group of earthquakes are those caused by flexure of the oceanic lithosphere underlying the island as a result of loading by the volcano. The type of stresses within the flexing lithosphere depends on depth relative to the neutral surface, with radial compression and associated tangential tension below about 22 km and radial tension and tangential compression above that level. Earthquakes of this type can have focal depths as deep as 60 km. ==Earthquake== The earthquake had a hypocentral depth of 38.2 km and a focal mechanism of normal faulting. The depth shows that it was in the mantle lithosphere, beneath the neutral surface with a mechanism consistent with tangential tension. The largest aftershock was significantly shallower at 18 km and had a focal mechanism of reverse faulting. The depth and mechanism are consistent with tangential compression above the neutral surface. Modified Mercalli Intensities were VII‚ÄìVIII (Very strong‚ÄìSevere) on the western side of the island of Hawaii, and VI (Strong) on the eastern side of Maui. Intensity V (Moderate) shaking was felt all the way to Oahu, where patches of moderate damage were reported. The earthquake caused property damage, injuries, landslides, power outages, and airport delays and closures. Governor Linda Lingle issued a disaster declaration for the entire state. ===Damage=== USGS ShakeMap for the event The most severe damage caused by the earthquake was focused on the north and western sides of the island of Hawaii. Damage was also quite heavy on the eastern side of Maui, and minor damage spread all the way out to western Oahu, away from the earthquake's epicenter. On the Big Island, many houses had large cracks and broken windows, and at least 61 buildings were destroyed and red-tagged by officials. Almost all houses in west Hawaii reported extensive internal damage but most avoided significant structural damage, the reason being that most of the buildings in the area around the epicenter of the earthquake have been built in the last few decades and are well constructed. Even so, over $200 million in damage occurred. The largest and most luxurious hotels on the Island of Hawaii also happened to be clustered within ten miles (16 km) of the earthquake's epicenter along the Kohala coast. The 1965 Mauna Kea Beach Hotel had its entire south end collapse, and the hotel's top floor was considered \\"destroyed.\\" The hotel closed December 1 after a month-long inspection revealed that the building was unsafe and in danger of collapse. After a $150 million renovation, the hotel had a soft reopening on December 20, 2008, and officially reopened in March 2009. The Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel was temporarily evacuated after the earthquake due to structural damage, broken glass and flooding caused by broken water pipes. The Surety Kohala Corporation assessed the structural integrity to their Kohala Ditch, which functioned as a tourist attraction for 10 years. Many roads and bridges collapsed or had deep cracks, and clean-up crews had to work for days to remove debris from the countless landslides. Many landmarks on the island were greatly affected. The Kalahikiola Congregational Church in Kohala was destroyed due to the collapse of the church's stone walls; the Hawi smoke stack, a relic of the old sugarcane trade, completely collapsed as well. The Hulihee Palace in Kailua Kona suffered extensive structural damage.Hawaiian Historic Site Damaged..., Associated Press, accessed November 3, 2006 Another popular tourist area, Kealakekua Bay, home of the white monument to Captain James Cook, was swept over by massive landslides that caused the entire bay and its surrounding areas to momentarily disappear in a thick cloud of brown dust.Continuing Landslides lead to closures and Kealakekua Bay, Associated Press, accessed November 3, 2006 Cliff falling in Waipio Valley during the earthquake ===Mauna Kea Observatory=== During the earthquake and aftershocks, a number of the telescopes at the Mauna Kea Observatories sustained minor damage, primarily Kecks 1 and 2 at the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope (CFHT). The CFHT was operational and back online as of October 19, but the Kecks were not restored to full operation until February 28, 2007. ===Blackouts=== Power plants on Maui and the Big Island automatically shut off power to prevent damage, and generators tripped on Oahu, causing overloads in the electrical grid. The Oahu power outages lasted 14 hours in some locations; only half of Hawaiian Electric Company's (HECO) Oahu customers had power restored before 9 pm, while outages generally lasted to about 5 pm on Maui and Hawaii. Power was restored to all HECO circuits by 1:55 am; however, there were isolated blackouts due to local problems, such as blown fuses. Power in Laie and Kahuku was not restored until 3 am. In Honolulu and Kahe, HECO generators shut down, and other generators tried to compensate, resulting in uneven loads on Oahu's electrical network and causing the system to shut down to prevent damage. ==Images== Image:CRW_9000_RT16.jpgKeokea Beach Park pavilion File:Hulihee Palace south wall.JPGHulihee Palace South wall, January 2007 Image:Huihee Palace after 2006 earthquake.jpgEarthquake damage at the Hulihee Palace in January 2007 ==See also== *Kiholo Bay *List of earthquakes in 2006 *List of earthquakes in Hawaii *List of earthquakes in the United States *Lists of 21st-century earthquakes ==ReferencesSources=== * ==External links== * Report on the declaration of a state of emergency ‚Äì NBC News * * Historic Palace Damaged, but Blessed ‚Äì NBC News * Lessons learned from the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquakes ‚Äì West Hawaii Today * Continued Rumblings of the 2006 Kiholo Bay Earthquake ‚Äì United States Geological Survey * Hawaii earthquake Hawaii earthquake Category:Earthquakes in Hawaii Category:2006 in Hawaii Category:October 2006 events in the United States ","title":"2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake"},{"id":"7459055","text":"Los Ramones is the name of a municipality and its corresponding seat of government and main population center in Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. ==Location== Los Ramones is located in the west central portion of the Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n.

He is currently an academy coach at Lewes and was Interim Manager at Crawley Town F.C. alongside Gary Alexander, following the sacking of manager Richie Barker. Hinshelwood was born in Reading, but grew up in Croydon, and in 1969, (along with his brother Paul) played in the final of the London FA Schools Cup, watched by then Crystal Palace manager Arthur Rowe. Rowe was impressed, and the brothers were invited for trials with the club. Both performed well, and were taken on as apprentices. Martin Hinshelwood played in the centre of midfield, and quickly fought his way into the team, while his brother initially languished in the lower echelons of the club. Hinshelwood was part of the team that reached the semi-final of the 1976 FA Cup, and played in the defeats of Leeds United, Chelsea, and Sunderland (all away from home). In the semi-final game, Third Division Palace were drawn against Second Division Southampton. Despite the Saints being a tier above the Eagles, Palace were cast as favourites. Martin missed the game through injury, and some see this as the reason that Southampton beat Palace by two goals to nil. That injury proved to dominate Hinshelwood's career, and it eventually led to his retiring from the game, in late 1977. He briefly played again as player/manager at Leatherhead F.C. in the Isthmian Premier in 1980/81 and 81/82 taking over from long serving Manager Billy Miller.http://www.non- leagueclubdirectory.co.uk/index.php/clubs/leatherhead He went into management in later years at Palace's arch-rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. He originally began as the youth coach, but when Micky Adams departed following promotion, he was appointed caretaker manager, along with Bob Booker. Ex-Palace teammate Peter Taylor succeeded Adams, and guided Albion to another successive promotion. He too then left the manager's post, and this time Hinshelwood stepped up to the position on a full-time basis. Brighton were then in Division One. However, after losing twelve games consecutively, he was moved to director of football, and Steve Coppell came in as manager. Albion were relegated, though Coppell nearly achieved the impossible in keeping the club up. With the departure of Albion manager Russell Slade in November 2009, Hinshelwood was again appointed caretaker manager. Hinshelwood's family also have a strong footballing background. His father Wally was a professional footballer in the 1950s, most notably at Reading and Bristol City. His brother Paul had a long career at Crystal Palace and also represented the England under-21 team. Martin's son Danny had a brief professional career, and his nephews (Paul's sons) Adam and Paul are professionals at Brighton and Torquay, respectively. == References == Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Reading, Berkshire Category:Association football midfielders Category:English footballers Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. managers Category:Lewes F.C. managers Category:Portsmouth F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Martin Hinshelwood"},{"id":"7459076","text":"Northern Maramuresh is a geographic-historical region comprising roughly the eastern half of the Zakarpattia Oblast in southwestern Ukraine, near the border with Romania. Until 1920, it was part of the Maramure»ô (historical region) of Transylvania, at which time the former M√°ramaros County was divided into a northern part (incorporated into Czechoslovakia, the part which is now in Ukraine), and a southern part (incorporated into the Kingdom of Romania). Alternative names for the regions are Northern M√°ramaros (from Hungarian √âszak M√°ramaros), Northern Maramure»ô (from Romanian Maramure»ôul de Nord), Northern Maramorshchyna (from Ukrainian –ü—ñ–≤–Ω—ñ—á–Ω–∞ –ú–∞—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ä—â–∏–Ω–∞), Northern Marmatia (from Latin Marmatia). From 1920 till 1939, the region belonged to Czechoslovakia, then until 1944 to Hungary, and then until 1991 to the Soviet Union. Since 1991, Northern Maramuresh has been part of Ukraine. Part of the boundary that separates Northern Maramuresh from Romania runs along the Tisza River. The majority of the population are Ukrainians (Rusyns, Boiko and Hutsuls - indigenous groups), while a Romanian community, totaling 32,100 according to the 2001 Ukraine census, National composition of population; Zakarpattia region lives compactly, mostly in some eighteen localities, in Rakhiv and Tiachiv raions (districts), close to the Romanian border. For most of the 20th century, communications between Southern and Northern Maramuresh were severed. After the collapse of Communism in Europe, and through cooperation between the Romanian and Ukrainian governments, the restoration of bridges across the Tisza has begun. ==Geography and populationGeographic description=== Maramure»ô is an almost completely enclosed mountain valley with an area slightly smaller than that of the U.S. state of Connecticut. The only way to enter the region, besides crossing mountain slopes of 1,000 meters to 2,500 meters high, is to follow the river Tisza upstream. To a significant extent, the geography of Maramure»ô has determined its history and distinctive traditions. Northern Maramuresh includes all of the right bank of the Tisza within the historical region, and small mountain portions on the left bank. Rivers that flow through the region include the Tisza, Rika (Rica), and Tereblia. Lake Sinevir is also located there. ===In present-day Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine=== Northern Maramuresh (gold) as part of the Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine, with district boundaries shown The territory of the Zakarpattia Region of Ukraine is 12,880 km2.

Between 1870 and 1918, M√°ramaros (north and south) was a county in the Transleitanian part of Austria-Hungary. It was divided into 10 rural districts (Hungarian: j√°r√°s, Romanian: plase) and 1 urban district (Hungarian: rendezett tan√°cs√∫ v√°ros, Romanian: plasƒÉ urbanƒÉ): {  ! Northern Maramuresh !

Dolha, Huszt, √ñk√∂rmez≈ë, Taracviz, T√©cs≈ë, and Tiszav√∂lgy districts each had a Ukrainian majority (with Tiszav√∂lgy having a specifically Hutsul majority). The rural Sziget district, along with Izav√∂lgy, Sugatag, and Vis√≥ districts each had a Romanian majority, while the urban Sziget district was mixed Hungarian/Romanian. There was a significant Ukrainian minority in Vis√≥, and significant Romanian minorities in Huszt, Taracviz, T√©cs≈ë, and Tiszav√∂lgy districts. Vis√≥ also contained a significant German minority (\\"Zipser\\") around the city of Fels≈ëvis√≥ (Romanian: Vi≈üeu de Sus; German: Oberwischau). The six districts in the left-hand column were apportioned to Czechoslovakia in 1920. In 1938, Hungary regained their southern portion by the terms of the First Vienna Award and then seized the rest in March 1939. In 1944 they went to the Soviet Union. Since 1991 they have been part of Ukraine. The four districts in the right-hand column were given to Romania, where they have remained ever since, except for 1940‚Äì1944, when they were again in Hungary by the terms of the Second Vienna Award. The rural Sziget (Sighet) district, despite being ethnically homogeneously Romanian, was divided: the part north of the Tisza river followed the same fate as the Ukrainian districts, while the part south of the Tisza, the same as the Romanian ones. More than half of the Romanian minority in the present Zakarpattia Oblast resides in what before 1920 was the rural Sziget district. The total area of Maramuresh county was 10,354.9 km2, of which 6,974 km2 became the northern part and 3,381 km2 became the southern part. The approximately 160 localities were divided as follows: slightly less than 100 joined the north, and slightly more than 60 joined the south. in 1920, the south had a population of approximately 155,000. A majority of the inhabitants were Romanian, with Jewish, Hungarian, Ukrainian and German minorities. The north at the same time had a population of about 220,000, including some 20,000 Romanians. According to the 1910 Austrian census, M√°ramaros County had a population which by language was: *Ruthenian, 159,489 *Romanian, 84,510 *German, 59,552 *Hungarian, 52,964. A substantial part of the German and Hungarian-speaking population were in fact Jews. ===In Carpathian Ruthenia=== Carpathian Ruthenia, i.e., the region inhabited by Rusyns (Ruthenians) in Austria-Hungary, spread over some two-thirds of the historic counties of Ung, Bereg, and Ugocsa (the remaining one third are respectively Slovak, Hungarian, and Romanian), and from the 16th century also gradually over a part (up to half) of Maramuresh county. Therefore, in texts dealing with the period after 1600, Northern Maramuresh is sometimes included in historic Carpathian Ruthenia, historic Ruszinszko, or Pidkarpadska Rus', as opposed to earlier texts, when it is not.Rusyns, who inhabited these regions from the 8th century, must not be confused historically and especially culturally with the Lemko, Boiko, and Hutsul peoples, who in the 16th century moved to the mountain-crest regions of Carpathian Ruthenia from Galicia, although they are confused in the Austria-Hungary censuses (and are identical linguistically). All these ethnic groups converged during the 19th century to form a new ethnicity, Ukrainians, although Rusyn emigrants (to the USA, the Americas, Yugoslavia, etc.) from before the establishment of the Ukrainian ethnicity generally retained the name Rusyns, or sometimes even Boiko, Lemko, and Hutsul.) ===Demographic data=== thumb300pxEthnic map of Zakarpattia Oblast in 2001. {  !Census year !Total population of Pidkarpadska Rus' / Zakarpattia !Total population of the 4 raions and Khust !Ukrainians !Romanians (official numbersRomanians have constantly argued that considerable portions of their ethnicity after 1939 are being recorded as Moldovans.) - align=\\"center\\" 1880 align=\\"right\\" 408,971   align=\\"right\\" 16,713 - align=\\"center\\" 1921 align=\\"right\\" 604,745 align=\\"right\\" 220,000 align=\\"right\\" 140,000 align=\\"right\\" 20,000 - align=\\"center\\" 1930 align=\\"right\\" 734,315    - align=\\"center\\" 1959 align=\\"right\\" 920,170   align=\\"right\\" 18,346 - align=\\"center\\" 1970 align=\\"right\\" 1,056,000   align=\\"right\\" 23,454 - align=\\"center\\" 1979 align=\\"right\\" 1,155,000   align=\\"right\\" 27,155 - align=\\"center\\" 1989 align=\\"right\\" 1,245,000   align=\\"right\\" 29,485 - align=\\"center\\" 2001 align=\\"right\\"  1,255,000   align=\\"right\\" 32,100 - } ===Romanian localities in Northern Maramuresh=== In Northern Maramuresh, there are anywhere between ca. 32,000 (according to official Ukrainian sources), ca. 40,000 (according to most Romanian sources), to over 50,000Zakarpattia Oblast, Zakarpattya, Transcarpathian Oblast Romanians living today in a compact area of about 300 km2, in 17 villages and one town, separated from Romania only by the river Tisza. This compactly Romanian-inhabited region, which itself separates the Hutsul areas (most of the Rakhiv raion/district) in the east from the rest of Zakarpattia, corresponds exactly to the north-Tisza part of the former rural district of Sighet in M√°ramaros County before 1920 (see map).

Note: There are also Romanians in the two major Zakarpattian cities, Uzhhorod and Mukachevo, as well as in the town of Korolevo (Romanian: Craia), in Vinogradovo raion, which are not in Maramuresh, but respectively in Ung, Bereg, and Ugocsa. There are also two other Romanian villages: *Poroskovo (Romanian: Poroscova, Hungarian: Porosk≈ë), Perechin raion, near Mun≈£ii PƒÉduro≈üi, 45 km NE of Ujgorod, 3000 inhabitants, and *Myrcha (Romanian: Mircea), Velykyi Berezin raion, 35 km N of Ujgorod, 1500 inhabitants. The two villages are 40 km one from the other, in the northwest of Zakarpattia, which is not part of Northern Maramuresh, but of the former Ung County. They are the last remnants of the Vlachs (Romanians) who inhabited present-day Hungary and Zakarpattia before the arrival of the Slavs (6th-8th centuries) and Hungarians (9th century), when they were isolated and afterwards assimilated. Their Ukrainian neighbors also call the inhabitants of these two villages volokhi or loshkarini, Slavic names for Romanians no longer in current use.https://web.archive.org/web/20050302114055/http://www.dacoromania1.go.ro/nr18/1_4_a_treia_etnie.htm ==HistoryMaramuresh/Maramure»ô before the split=== See History of Maramure»ô. In the Middle Ages, Maramure»ô had a Romanian population, organized into a voevodat with a voevod elected from among the village noblemen (Romanian: knezi). The majority of the peasants in the region were free and went by a regional term specific only to Maramure≈ü: nƒÉme≈üi (from neam, clan), and only a minority were serfs (first serfs mentioned in documents in 1405). In the more mountainous villages and hamlets, the main dwelling was raising sheep, which implied constant moving in search of new pastures to accommodate raising stocks. As a consequence, between 10th and 13th centuries, modern mountainous regions of eastern and central Slovakia saw a migration of Vlach (Romanian) shepherds from Maramure≈ü, eventually assimilated. Another similar migration occurred in the 14th century with destination the mountainous southeasternmost corner of modern Poland. The new migrants were given special rights known as Jus Valahicum, and a century later serious local feuds occurred when these rights were abolished and the Vlachs were assimilated. A significant portion of the heritage of Gorals comes from the assimilated Vlachs. Other migrants who advanced along the Carpathian range between the 14th and 17th centuries became known as Moravian Vlachs. On their way they gradually lost their original language with the exception of some Romanian words they use in their Czech and Slovak dialect, but they preserved much of their culture (especially folklore, songs and costumes) and economic base, namely sheep breeding. In 1644, during the Thirty Years War, they were crushed by Albrecht von Wallenstein. In the 14th century, several groups of Maramure»ô noblemen with their warriors (Romanian: viteji) established themselves in modern northern Moldavia, and were the driving force that led to the creation of that principality in 1345 (by Drago≈ü of Bedeu, former voevod of Maramure≈ü), and its independence in 1359 (up to 3,000 families in strength, led by Bogdan of Cuhea, the voevod of Maramure»ô who previously led a 20-year-old campaign to avoid the Voevodat of Maramure»ô being turned and organized as a County (Comitatus), as King Louis of Anjou of Hungary strove for and eventually succeeded). The Comitatus of M√°ramaros was formally established in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1303. In late 14th and early 15th century, count-voevod Drag of Bedeu, Drago≈ü' grandson, raise to eventually become one of the 10 peers of the Kingdom of Hungary that in 1386 enthroned Sigismund of Luxembourg as King, who in turn in not yet clear circumstances confiscated in 1404 all the estate of Drag and his family in Maramure»ô (over 50 villages), and forced them to resettle in a small estate in Szatmar. In 1391, Drag and his brother Balc were responsible for obtaining from the Patriarch of Constantinople raising of the New Rum Monastery of Saint Michael the Archangel of Peri (modern village of Grushevo in Northern Maramuresh on the bank of the Tisza) to the rank of Stauropegic Bishopric, this being the first Romanian (non-rural) bishopric, with jurisdiction over eight nearby counties. Since the 15th century, local nobility was largely assimilated within the Hungarian nobility, adopted Catholicism and Hungarian language. In 1526, after the collapse of the Kingdom of Hungary at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, M√°ramaros, along with the whole of modern Transcarpathia, was incorporated into the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania, which became a Habsburg domain in 1687, and at the in 1867 was included in the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary. The ethnic composition of Maramure»ô started to diversify already in the Middle Ages with the arrival of German colonists that founded or re-built five cities: Visc, Teceu, C√¢mpulung, Bocicoi, and Sighet. The adoption of Hungarian language and the Catholic faith in the 15th century (then a Protestant one in the 16th century) by the Transylvanian nobility created a linguistically and religiously distinct upper class which ruled the area. Since the 16th century, Ukrainian peasants moved from nearby Bereg and Ugocsa counties, and from Polish Galicia. The Ukrainization of some villages in Northern Maramuresh was strengthened by the long jurisdictional disputes in 18th century between the Greek Catholic Bishopric of Muncach (Ukrainian) and Orthodox Bishopric of Peri (Romanian), later also with participation of Romanian Greek Catholics. In the 19th century the region was also settled by numerous Jews who arrived from Galicia. The Ukrainian population of Northern Maramuresh is also diverse: Hutsuls in the east, Boiko in northwest, and Rusyn in the western part, in Tisza valley, the former two originating from Galicia, and the latter from Bereg and Ugocsa. After the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, the northern part of the comitatus (about 60% of the territory) became part of Carpathian Ruthenia within the newly formed Czechoslovakia. The southern part (40%, including the former capital Sighetu Marma≈£iei) became part of Romania. This division was confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920.Marian Nicolae Tomi, Maramure≈üul istoric √Æn date, Editura Grinta, Cluj-Napoca, 2005, ===Northern Maramuresh after the split=== Just before World War II, the region was part of the briefly independent Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939, but this republic, comprising the part of Carpathian Ruthenia not given to Hungary by the First Vienna Award a few months earlier, was almost immediately annexed by Horthyst Hungary, which in 1940 also annexed the Romanian part of Maramure»ô following the Second Vienna Award. After the war, in 1945 the formerly Czechoslovakian Maramuresh was transferred to the Soviet Union, and in 1946 it was included in the Zakarpattia Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR. The latter after the dissolution of the Soviet Union became the independent Ukraine. ==Historic monuments and heritage sites== The 1887 marker near Rakhiv claiming the location being the Geographical centre of Europe. ===Churches, monasteries and sites=== *St. Michael the Archangel Monastery, Peri (1215), became the first Romanian bishopric on 13 August 1391, by the efforts of voivodes Drag and Balcu, grandsons of the famous voivode Drago≈ü, in the village of Peri (Grushevo), Tyachev (Teceu) district (in the Romanian country) *Church of the Nativity (Steblivka) (1797) in the village of Steblivka, Khust district (in the Rusyn country) *St. Michael's Church (Crainicova) (1666‚Äì1668) in the village of Crainicova, Khust district (in the Rusyn country) *Church of the Holy Spirit (Colochava) (17th century) near the villages of Colochava and Horb, Mizhhirsky district (in the Rusyn country) *Church (1776) in the village of Ap≈üa de Jos (Dibrova), Tyachev (Teceu) district (in the Romanian country) *St. Nicholas Church (Seredny Vodany) (1428) in the village of Apsa de Mijloc (Seredny Vodany), Rahiv (Rahau) district (in the Romanian country) *Strukivska Church (1824) in the village of Yasinia, Rahiv district (in the Hutsul country) *Horian Rotunda, 12th-14th centuries (don't know where) *1887 marker near Rakhiv claiming the location being the geographical centre of Europe ===Feudal nobility=== A considerable part of Maramuresh's history was associated in past centuries with well-known feudal families of Europe. From the 14th to the 19th century: *Rozhoni (owners of the village of Dovhe/Dolha), *Pereni (owners of Sevljus and 117 villages in the nearby county of Ugocea/Ugocsa), *Dovhay (owners of Dovhe/Dolha, Soymy/≈ûoimi, Kyshnytsya/Cu≈üni≈£a, Volove, Siltse, Irshava, in all 20 villages in the nearby county of Bereg), *Drago≈ü (Drahush) (Ocna Slatina/Solotvyno), and 5 villages in later centuries, while in the time of the brothers Balcu (Balka) and Drag (Draha) they owned Korolevo/Craia (this town is in Ugocea), Khust/Hust, Tyachiv/Teceu, Iza, and 32 villages along the Tisza/Tysa/Tisa and Tereblya/Tereblea rivers (all these in Maramuresh), *Urmezeyi (27 villages in Maramuresh), *Bilkey-Iloshvay (24 villages in Maramuresh), *Pohani (villages along the lower reaches of the rivers Tereblya/Tereblea and Teresva/Taras in Maramuresh), *Hunyadi (Corvin) (32 villages and two towns in the nearby counties of Ugocea/Ugocsa and Bereg). Other prominent feudal families of 16th-19th centuries were Karoli, Teleki, Toldi, Kornish, Stoyko, Fisher, Reyti, and Soplontsay. ===People and traditions=== The people of Maramuresh are generally tougher and swifter, the sense of justice and honor is very keen for them. They have, and perhaps for good reasons, great pride in their specificity, and even in their toughness, since in few other places are ancient Romanian traditions preserved to such an extent. Their wooden churches are quite beautiful.

They are best known their work on the independent circuit mainly within the United Kingdom. ==Professional wrestling career== Frazier, and Samuels, The East End Mauler, both hail from east London and would begin training at the Dropkixx academy sometime at the beginning of the 21st century; training with various teachers under the watchful eye of Dino Scarlo. Frazier, at the age of 14 and using the name Scott Frazier, faced Matt Stevens in his first professional match while Samuels faced Kristian Linnell around the same time. It wasn't long before both men were brought together to become the (often heel) tag team known as The Kartel. The self professed \\"Winners\\" gained a measure of success, winning titles in various smaller promotions while also competing in more high profile UK independents; including SAS Wrestling, and International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. The Kartel would also tour Italy with the Italian Championship Wrestling promotion. In 2003, at the age of 16, Frazier was considered one of the youngest UK pro wrestlers yet he still managed to gain the opportunity to go to Atlanta, Georgia in the United States to train with William Regal, Chris Benoit and Dave Taylor of WWE fame. While Samuels improved on his stiff style of wrestling, the smaller built Frazier began using sport supplements to gain muscle mass so that he could become more eligible for tours Stateside and in Japan. In 2007 both Samuels and Frazier embarked on a training excursion to South East Asia to both gain knowledge of eastern training methods, and to improve upon fitness and strength. The Kartel became IPW:UK Tag Team Champions for the first time when they defeated $wiss Money Holding on 23 September 2007 in Orpington, Kent. Later, they unified IPW:UK Tag Team titles with RQW British Tag Team Championships to become Unified British Tag Team champions. In February 2008, the Kartel competed Chikara's King of Trios tournament in Philadelphia, United States, teaming with Martin Stone as Team IPW:UK, but were defeated in the second round of the tournament by the Golden Trio (Delirious, Hallowicked and Helios). The Kartel stopped working as an active tag team in IPW:UK during the summer of 2010 after Samuels turned on Frazier during an in-ring angle at the \\"Sittingbourne Spectacular\\".

On April 30, 1947, FM 306 and FM 177 were redesignated to form the segment of SH 349 from Midland to near Lamesa. The section from Sheffield to Rankin was added on October 24, 1956 by redesignating part of SH 51. alt=Image of FM 1217 highway shield. The square shield has a white symbol in the shape of Texas as the state appears on maps on a black background. Inside this symbol is the number 1217. The black background contains the words FARM in the upper right corner and ROAD in the lower left corner, both in white capital lettering. The part of SH 349 south of Sheffield was Farm to Market Road 1217, which was designated on July 14, 1949 from Dryden northward . FM 1217 was extended to the northeast on May 23, 1951, on December 18, 1951, on December 17, 1952, and on April 24, 1954. The designation was extended on September 29, 1954 to the end of FM 1749, which was cancelled and combined with FM 1217, adding and bringing its southern terminus to Sheffield. On December 13, 1956, FM 1217 was signed, but not designated, as part of SH 349\\\\. In 1990, FM 1217 was officially designated as SH 349, and FM 1217 was cancelled. On July 31, 2003, SH 349 was rerouted around Midland. In December 2014, the Texas Transportation Commission approved an extension of the SH 349 designation south of Lamesa, from the current northern terminus at SH 137 eastward to US 87. , this segment has not been constructed. Construction of the extension started in May 2017 and was completed just over two years later in mid-2019. ==Route description== The south end of SH 349's concurrency with SH 290 in Sheffield. SH 349 runs generally northward from its originating junction with U.S. Highway 90 at the tiny town of Dryden (population 13) near the Rio Grande, the southern border of the state. The road passes west of the Fort Lancaster State Historical Park to Sheffield and a junction with Interstate 10. SH 349 then runs along the Pecos River to Iraan, where it is co-routed for a few miles with U.S. Highway 190. The road then proceeds northward to a junction and brief co-routing with U.S. Highway 67 at Rankin. SH 349 continues northward to the relatively heavily populated area of Midland. SH 349 formerly bisected Midland directly through the city center. However, the highway has been redesignated to loop around Midland to the west, by co-routing it with portions of Interstate 20 (and State Highway 158) and Farm to Market Road 1788. A new section of highway, a so-called \\"reliever route\\", was opened on December 10, 2009, and was named the Nadine and Tom Craddick Highway after State Rep. Tom Craddick and his wife, who played a large role in creating the highway.https://twitter.com/TxDOTOdessa/statuses/6542677029 (This new section of SH 349 is part of the \\"La Entrada al Pacifico Corridor\\" trade route from west Texas to Mexico). The portion of SH 349 that ran directly through Midland was redesignated as Business State Highway 349-C (BS 349-C) in 2003. North of Midland, SH 349 proceeds generally northward to its final junction with State Highway 137, just south of Lamesa. Counties traversed by the highway include Terrell, Pecos, Crockett, Upton, Midland, Martin and Dawson. With the exception of the metropolitan area of Midland, most of the terrain covered by the highway is sparsely populated ranch country. ==Business routes== SH 349 has one business route. Business State Highway 349-C is a business loop that runs on the former routing of SH 349 through Midland. The route was designated in 2003 when SH 349 was re-routed around the city. ;Junction list ==Junction listSee also== * * == References External links== *Texas official travel map at the Texas Department of Transportation (enlargement required for legibility) *Construction notice for new portion of SH 349 to complete loop to the western side of Midland 349 Category:Transportation in Dawson County, Texas Category:Transportation in Martin County, Texas Category:Transportation in Midland County, Texas Category:Transportation in Upton County, Texas Category:Transportation in Crockett County, Texas Category:Transportation in Pecos County, Texas Category:Transportation in Terrell County, Texas ","title":"Texas State Highway 349"},{"id":"7459105","text":"√úberetsch-Unterland ( ; ) is a district (; ) in the southern part of the Italian province of South Tyrol.

It is also a specialist Arts College. The academy was formed in 2017 from Castle High School as part of the Dudley Academies Trust, in association with Dudley College. The new name was officially adopted in September 2018. ==History== The St James Academy is situated on St James's Road, near Dudley town centre, mostly within the buildings of the former Dudley Grammar School (which date back to 1897; the school was originally established in 1562). The grammar school was merged with Dudley Girls High School in 1975 to become the Dudley School, a mixed-sex comprehensive, which in turn merged with The Blue Coat School to become Castle High in 1989. The Castle High name was chosen in a poll by pupils, who also chose the design of the new school's logo. After a year, the school opened to 11 year-olds following the local authority's decision to reduce the primary school leaving age; at the same time, its sixth form centre was closed and the leaving age for pupils fell to 16. The former sixth form facilities were used as classrooms to accommodate the new younger pupils. September 1990 also saw the school take in approximately 50% of pupils from Mons Hill School, which closed due to falling pupil numbers. Several teachers from this school were also recruited. For the first year of its existence as Castle High School, the school incorporated the former Blue Coat School buildings on Kates Hill, where the final two academic year groups of that school's pupils remained. The Sir Gilbert Claughton School, however, remained a separate school as its final year of pupils completed their education, while younger pupils were transferred to Castle High and the Holly Hall School. A new three-storey classroom block was opened in the 1991 summer term, the first in several phases of expansion which were completed in 1995. The expansion also saw the demolition of the school swimming pool, which had been on the Dudley School site. Mobile classrooms were on the site until the permanent buildings were opened. The expanded school was officially opened on 20 October 1995 by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury. The former Girls High School buildings were demolished at the beginning of the following year. Plans were unveiled in June 2008 for the school to receive academy status, sponsored by the Oasis Community Learning Trust, though these plans failed to materialize and were scrapped in March 2009. In February 2017 academization plans were revived, with Castle High School set to join a new multi-academy trust sponsored by Dudley College, alongside Holly Hall School, Hillcrest School, and High Arcal School. The academy was launched later that year, with the school changing its name in September 2018. ==History time line== * December 1985 - Dudley MBC announces plans for a merger of The Dudley School and at least one smaller secondary school to form a new secondary school by the end of the decade. Blue Coat and Gilbert Claughton Schools are believed to be part of the plan for a new school. * October 1988 - Following three years of speculation, it is confirmed that the town's main Dudley School will merge with The Blue Coat School with effect from September next year. The plans are part of a major reorganisation of schools in the borough which are also expected to see two secondary school closures within the next two years, along with the secondary transfer age being reduced from 12 to 11. The reorganisation of the school will also see the end of its sixth form largely due to its falling popularity; there will be no intake of new sixth formers for the 1989/90 academic year, although the current lower sixth will be able to complete their A-level studies at the school. * April 1989 - It is confirmed that the new school will be called Castle High, a name chosen by the Dudley School and Blue Coat School pupils. * September 1989 - Castle High School opens on a merger of The Dudley School and The Blue Coat School, making use of the Dudley School buildings but with the oldest two year groups of Blue Coat pupils remaining at the Blue Coat site for a year. Some of the former Sir Gilbert Claughton School pupils also join the school. * July 1990 - Castle High's sixth form centre closes. * September 1990 - the school's starting age is reduced from 12 to 11 in accordance with a borough-wide reduction in the transition age between primary and secondary school. Also starting the school are some former pupils of the closed Mons Hill School, which also supplies Castle High with some of its former staff. Construction of a new classroom block is incomplete, meaning that pupils will be taught in mobile classrooms for some lessons in the meantime. Castle High is now a single-site school within the old Dudley School buildings following the closure of the Blue Coat annex. * June 1991 - a new classroom block is completed at Castle High School. * September 1995 - another new building is completed, meaning that the old Girls High School buildings are now redundant. * October 1995 - the expanded Castle High School is officially opened. * January 1996 - the former Dudley Girls High School buildings, which until recently were part of Castle High, are demolished and the site re-used as a public car park. * February 2001 - 12-year-old pupil Scott Holloway died after being knocked down by a van near his home on the Priory Estate. Staff and pupils at Castle High set up a fund in Scott's memory and a total of almost ¬£1,100 was raised, some from bidding for a signed Aston Villa football. A local van driver later received a fine and a driving ban for careless driving in connection to Scott's death.. * June 2008 - Plans are unveiled for Castle High School to become an academy sponsored by the Oasis Community Learning Trust. * March 2009 - Plans for the academy to be developed are scrapped. * February 2017 - New academization plans are unveiled, with sponsorship from Dudley College. *July 2018 - the school featured in news headlines nationally after banning a 14-year-old male pupil from appearing in drag at the school talent show.

That one was sold to a photographer named Arthur Herbert, in 1889, with permission to use Pirou's name. In 1898, Herbert sold the studio to the brothers Georges and Oscar Mascr√© (1865-1943), who continued to use Pirou's name without his permission. Pirou lost a complicated lawsuit against the brothers, who compounded the fraud by referring to the studio as \\"Otto-Pirou\\", in reference to Otto Wegener, a Swedish-born photographer who was also not associated with them.Camille Blot-Wellens, \\"Eug√®ne Pirou, portraitiste de la Belle √âpoque\\", in Revue de la Biblioth√®que nationale de France #50, 24 September 2015, . During the Exposition of 1889, he saw a presentation of chronophotography, given by its inventor, √âtienne-Jules Marey. Not long after, he decided to pursue the new art of cinematography. He bought the necessary equipment in the summer of 1896 and, together with his employee, Albert Kirchner, who would later become a noted filmmaker in his own right, he filmed scenes of assorted events in Paris and showed them at the \\"Cin√©matographe Eug√®ne Pirou\\" in the basement of the Caf√© de la Paix at the Place de l'Op√©ra, with a projector designed by Henri Joly. He and Kirchner later produced one of the first known erotic films, Le Coucher de la Mari√©e (generally called Bedtime for the Bride in English), starring an actress who went by the name Louise Willy. It was mostly a striptease. He also produced a short film about the Parisian visit of Tsar Nicolas II in 1896. He was married twice.

D6 Adventure is published as a stand-alone rulebook (not dependent upon or requiring any other D6 System rulebooks) and is supported by its own line of supplements. ==Setting== Being a generic system, D6 Adventure contains no setting information, and provides rules material for playing in a wide variety of modern or near-modern cinematic settings, including action adventure, pulp, espionage, western, and low-powered superhero games. West End Games has released one world book for D6 Adventures, a reworking of the Masterbook title Bloodshadows. ==System== D6 Adventure uses the D6 Classic System for resolution, and is compatible with most games that use that system. As with all D6 System games, there are differences from other related games. D6 Adventure uses the attributes of Reflexes, Coordination, Physique, Knowledge, Perception and Presence. Two optional attributes, Psionics and Magic, are also possible. Psionics is a presented as a new rigidly defined power system. Although in part derived from the special effects system from Masterbook, this skill based system is unique to D6 Adventure. A magic system is also presented, which is identical to the one found in D6 Fantasy. Modern and pulp- era equipment is presented in D6 Adventure, and firearms are covered in more specific detail than in D6 Space. Statistics for generic modern non-player characters are also provided. ==History== Eric J. Gibson turned the D6 System into a more generic system, as the third iteration of West End Games published three core genre books as hardcovers: D6 Adventure (2004), D6 Fantasy (2004) and D6 Space (2004), and a number of supplements detailing creatures and locations for these genres followed in 2004 and 2005. D6 Adventure was originally released in 2003 as a PDF format ebook of the same name by Humanoids Publishing. It was sold as a core rulebook for their line of PDF re- releases. This was greatly expanded and revised by author Nikola Vrtis into the current D6 Adventure Rulebook (), released in 2004 by Purgatory Publishing imprint West End Games. At present, D6 Adventure is supported by three source books. *Bloodshadows redesigned by Nikola Vrtis, based on the works of various authors () *D6 Adventure Locations by various authors () *D6 Adventure Creatures by various authors () Bloodshadows is a setting that crosses film noir with fantasy and horror elements, and is set on the alternate world of Marl.

It features hints of classic rock, pop and new wave. The album had three hit singles, with the title track \\"Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me)\\" (US Billboard No. 20, US Cash Box No. 15; Canada No. 2), \\"Young Turks\\" (US No. 5), and \\"How Long\\" (US No. 49). ==Album information== Tonight I'm Yours saw Rod Stewart further adopting current musical trends, after some disco-influenced songs on Blondes Have More Fun and Foolish Behaviour, by adding elements of synth-pop and new wave to a couple of songs (the title track, and \\"Young Turks\\"), while mostly keeping to his rock traditions elsewhere. The album included three covers: \\"Tear It Up\\", \\"How Long\\", and \\"Just Like a Woman\\". The song \\"Never Give Up on a Dream\\" was dedicated to Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who ran 3,339 miles with one prosthetic leg in the Marathon of Hope to raise money for cancer research. Fox succumbed to cancer in 1981, the year the album was released. The music video for \\"Tonight I'm Yours\\" was shot by Australian film director, Russell Mulcahy. ==Critical reception== The album was mostly well received, being given four out of five stars in both Rolling Stone's contemporary review and in a retrospective from AllMusic. On AllMusic, Stewart has not yet surpassed the 4-star rating that the album received with any of his subsequent releases. The album has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. ==Commercial performance== The album reached No. 11 on the \\"Pop Album Charts\\" in the US, eventually going Platinum. The song \\"Young Turks\\" was the biggest hit from the album, reaching No. 5 on the \\"Pop Singles\\" chart. \\"Young Turks\\", and four further singles, \\"How Long?\\", \\"Jealous\\", \\"Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me)\\", and \\"Tora, Tora, Tora (Out With The Boys)\\", all peaked within the Top 50 of the \\"Pop Singles\\" and \\"Mainstream Rock\\" charts. ==Track listingPersonnel== Adapted from Discogs.Rod Stewart- Tonight I'm Yours @Discogs.com Retrieved 4-14-2013. *Rod Stewart ‚Äì vocals *Jim Cregan ‚Äì guitar (all tracks), background vocals *Robin LeMesurier ‚Äì guitar (all tracks except \\"Tonight I'm Yours,\\" \\"Jealous,\\" and \\"Young Turks\\") *Jeff Baxter ‚Äì guitar on \\"Tonight I'm Yours,\\" pedal steel guitar on \\"Just Like a Woman\\" *Mark Knopfler ‚Äì guitar on \\"Young Turks\\" *Danny Johnson ‚Äì guitar on \\"Jealous\\" *Byron Berline ‚Äì fiddle on \\"Only a Boy\\" *Jimmy Zavala ‚Äì harmonica, saxophone *Kevin Savigar ‚Äì keyboards *Duane Hitchings ‚Äì keyboards (\\"Tonight I'm Yours\\" and \\"Young Turks\\") *Jay Davis ‚Äì bass guitar *Carmine Appice ‚Äì drums (\\"Tonight I'm Yours\\" and \\"Young Turks\\"), background vocals *Tony Brock ‚Äì drums (all tracks except \\"Tonight I'm Yours\\" and \\"Young Turks,\\" on which he played percussion), tambourine on \\"Never Give Up on a Dream,\\" background vocals *Paulinho da Costa ‚Äì percussion *Tommy Vig ‚Äì tubular bells *Penny Jones ‚Äì soloist on \\"Never Give Up on a Dream\\" *Linda Lewis, The Penetcostal Community Choir ‚Äì background vocals *Karat Faye ‚Äì engineer ==Charting HistoryAlbum=== {  !

Some differences do exist between D6 Space and other related games. D6 Space uses Agility, Mechanical, Strength, Knowledge, Perception and Technical as its attributes. Apart from Agility replacing Dexterity, this is the same attribute set previously used by The Star Wars Roleplaying Game. A seventh optional attribute, Metaphysics, is also possible. The Metaphysics attribute is used by a new free-form power system. This is based on the Special Effects system from Masterbook (which was derived from the magic system from Torg). This replaces the system for using The Force from The Star Wars RPG, and the Psionics system used in the earlier D6 Space Opera PDF. Scaling (a method of determining how combat is handled between combatants and objects of starkly different sizes) uses a numeric modifier in D6 Space, and does not conform to the ship class names used in The Star Wars RPG. This new scaling system is also present in D6 Fantasy and D6 Adventure, though the benchmark names for the values listed differ between the three games. A disadvantages, advantages and special abilities system not present in The Star Wars RPG, is included, as is a system for using special abilities as Cybernetic implants.

Only 12% of the total land area is under cultivation (arable land, orchards and vineyards) but less than one-third of the cultivated area is irrigated; the rest is devoted to dryland farming. Some 92 percent of agricultural products depend on water. The western and northwestern portions of the country have the most fertile soils. Iran's food security index stands at around 96 percent. 3% of the total land area is used for grazing and small fodder production. Most of the grazing is done on mostly semi-dry rangeland in mountain areas and on areas surrounding the large deserts (\\"Dasht's\\") of Central Iran. The non- agricultural surface represents 53% of the total area of Iran, as follows: * Abb. 39% of the country is covered by deserts, salt flats (\\"kavirs\\") and bare- rock mountains, not suited for agricultural purposes. * An additional 7% of Iran's total surface is covered by woodlands. * And 7% is covered by cities, towns, villages, industrial areas and roads. At the end of the 20th century, agricultural activities accounted for about one-fifth of Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) and employed a comparable proportion of the workforce. Most farms are small, less than 25 acres (10 hectares), and are not economically viable, which has contributed to the wide-scale migration to cities. In addition to water scarcity and areas of poor soil, seed is of low quality and farming techniques are antiquated. All these factors have contributed to low crop yields and poverty in rural areas. Further, after the 1979 revolution many agricultural workers claimed ownership rights and forcibly occupied large, privately owned farms where they had been employed. The legal disputes that arose from this situation remained unresolved through the 1980s, and many owners put off making large capital investments that would have improved farm productivity, further deteriorating production. Progressive government efforts and incentives during the 1990s, however, improved agricultural productivity marginally, helping Iran toward its goal of reestablishing national self- sufficiency in food production. ==Production== In 2018: * It was the 13th largest world producer of wheat (14.5 million tons); * It produced 8.1 million tons of sugar cane, which is used to produce sugar and ethanol; * It was the 6th largest world producer of tomatoes (6.5 million tons); * It was the 13th largest world producer of potato (5.3 million tons); * It was the 13th largest world producer of sugar beet (4.9 million tons), which serves to produce sugar and ethanol; * It was the 2nd largest world producer of watermelon (4.1 million tons), second only to China; * It was the 16th largest world producer of barley (2.8 million tons); * It was the 5th largest world producer of apple (2.5 million tons); * It was the 5th largest world producer of onion (2.4 million tons); * It was the 2nd largest world producer of cucumber / pickles (2.2 million tons), second only to China; * It was the 10th largest world producer of grape (2 million tons); * It was the 10th largest world producer of orange (1.8 million tons); * It was the 3rd largest world producer of melon (1.7 million tons), second only to China and Turkey; * It was the 3rd largest world producer of date (1.2 million tons), second only to Egypt and Saudi Arabia; * It was the 5th largest world producer of eggplant (666 thousand tons); * It was the 7th largest world producer of peaches (645 thousand tons); * It was the largest world producer of pistachio (551 thousand tons); * It was the 3rd largest world producer of walnut (409 thousand tons), second only to China and the USA; * It was the 3rd largest world producer of apricot (342 thousand tons), second only to Turkey and Uzbekistan; * It was the 5th largest world producer of plum (313 thousand tons); * It was the 4th largest world producer of kiwi (266 thousand tons), losing to China, Italy and New Zealand; * It was the 3rd largest world producer of almonds (139 thousand tons), losing only to USA and Spain; * It was the 8th largest world producer of tea (109 thousand tons); * It was the 4th largest world producer of quince (76 thousand tons), losing to Uzbekistan, Turkey and China; * It produced 2 million tons of rice; * It produced 1.3 million tons of maize; * It produced 525 thousand tons of lettuce and chicory; * Produced 465 thousand tons of tangerine; * It produced 445 thousand tons of lemon; * It produced 337 thousand tons of carrot; * Produced 285 thousand tons of beans; * It produced 221 thousand tons of chickpeas; * It produced 210 thousand tons of soy; * Produced 154 thousand tons of pumpkin; * Produced 153 thousand tons of pear; * Produced 137 thousand tons of cherry; In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.Iran production in 2018, by FAO ==Land use and irrigation== Land use in Iran Average annual rainfall is 800 mm but in Iran the annual rainfall is only 220 mm. Overall, Iran's soil is not well suited for large scale agriculture. About 12 percent of the country's total land area of 1,636,000 km¬≤ is cultivated. Still, 63% of the cultivable lands have not been used, and 185,000 km¬≤ of the present farms are being used with 50 to 60% capacity. Both irrigated and rain-fed farming are used in Iran. In 2005, some 13.05 million hectares of land was under cultivation, of which 50.45% was allocated to irrigated farming and the remaining 49.55% to rain-fed system. As of 2013, The amount of cultivated land that is irrigated increased to 8 million hectares, while 10 million hectares remain rain-fed. {  - +Rainfall & Agricultural Production ! !! March 2001 !!

Rice paddy field in Amol The wide range of temperature fluctuation in different parts of the country and the multiplicity of climatic zones make it possible to cultivate a diverse variety of crops, including cereals (wheat, barley, rice, and maize (corn)), fruits (dates, figs, pomegranates, melons, and grapes), vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, sugarcane and pistachios (World's largest producer with 40% of the world's output in 2005), nuts, olives, spices e.g. saffron (World's largest producer with 81% of the world's total output), raisin(world's third largest producer & second largest exporter), tea, tobacco, Berberis(world's largest producer) and medicinal herbs.Iran Daily - Panorama - 01/18/07 More than 2,000 plant species are grown in Iran; only 100 of which are being used in pharmaceutical industries. The land covered by Iran's natural flora is four times that of Europe. Wheat, rice, and barley are the country's major crops. The Iranian grain sector is highly regulated. Producers receive subsidised access to input costs such as fertiliser and pesticides, as well as a guaranteed support price for their crops. Wheat: In 2007 Iran exported close to 600,000 tones of wheat (out of a production of 15 million tonnes).Iran Daily: Trade With PGCC To Improve Retrieved April 7, 2008 Approximately 6 million tons of wheat will be purchased from 15 countries in 2009 because of the drought in 2008, thus making Iran the largest wheat importer in the world. Wheat production reached 14 million tons in 2010. According to the FAO, Iran is the 12th leading producer of wheat in the world, with an average production of 14 million tons in 2011. Rice: Iran's total rice production stands at 2.2 million tons per annum whereas annual consumption is about three million tons (2008). Iran has imported about 630,000 tons of rice from UAE, Pakistan and Uruguay worth $271 million in 2008 and 1.4 million tons of rice, worth $800 million in 2009. Iran's rice imports drop by 40% in 2010. Iran's rice production in 2011 was 2.4 million tons, which increased from a total of 2.3 million tons in the previous year. Iran has 3,800 rice milling units (2009). The average per capita consumption of rice in Iran is 45.5 kg, which makes Iranians the 13th biggest rice consumers. Rice is mostly produced in northern Iran. Rice has been cultivated for many years in Mazandaran and Gilan Province of Iran. In Northern Province, many indica rice cultivars including Tarom, Gerdeh, Hashemi, Hasani, Neda and Gharib have been bred by farmers. Sugar: In 2008, Iran had a shortage of 400,000 tons to 600,000 tons of sugar nationwide. Sugar companies suffered from massive imports of cheap sugar over the past few years, which led to a 50% drop in the capacity of the sugar industry's production in 2008. The lack of import tariffs was the main reason for the domestic sugar industry suffering in this manner. Pistachio: Iran ranks as the world's largest pistachio producer and exporter followed by USA and Turkey. After oil and carpets, pistachios are Iran's biggest exports: about 200,000 tons for $840 million in 2008. More than 350,000 people earn a living from the nut, most of them in vast groves of the desert oases in southeast.Iran Daily: Pistachio Exports Up Retrieved November 10, 2008 Iran's share in the global pistachio market reached 50 percent in 2010. Saffron: Saffron is cultivated in many regions of the country, the provinces of North Khorasan, Khorasan Razavi and South Khorasan in the northeast have the highest production share. Iran's saffron is exported to the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Japan, Turkmenistan, France, Italy and the US. The northeastern Khorasan Razavi province exported 57 tons of saffron worth $156.5 million to 41 countries in 2010. The high production cost comes from the exhaustive process of extracting the stamens from the flower and the number of flowers necessary to produce small amounts of spice but the process is in the process of being automated now. Iran is the largest producer of saffron with 93.7% of the world's total production. Tea: Tea production rose to 190,000 tons in 2007 from 130,000 tons in 2004. 75,000 tons of tea is smuggled into Iran each year (2008). Horticulture: Close to 19 million tons of horticultural crops will be produced by the end of Fourth Plan (2005‚Äì10). Fruits: Iran exported more than 35,000 tons of citrus fruits valued at $20.8 million to 36 countries in 2008. Iran is among the largest producers of berries and stone fruits in the world, especially pomegranates, dates, figs and cherries. See also: Fruit in Iran. ==Livestock== Iranian shepherds moving their sheep. North-western Iran, winter 2008. Of the country's livestock, sheep are by far the most numerous, followed by goats, cattle, donkeys, horses, water buffalo, and mules. The raising of poultry for eggs and meat is prevalent. One area where production infrastructure has progressed rapidly is the poultry sector. The face of the industry has now been transformed dramatically so that the entire supply chain process can take place domestically. Iran has also a large dairy industry and imported close to two million tonnes of feed grain annually in 2006. The raising of pigs is forbidden in Iran due to Islamic law.Agriculture Canada: Agri-Food Country Profile Statistical Overview - Iran Production of livestock increased over the past three years to reach 11.3 million tons in 2008 from the 10.6 million tons in 2007, and 9.9 million tons in 2006. Meat processing capacity is at 400,000 tons and 140 production units (2009). In 2008, per capita meat consumption was 26 kg. Iran produced 950,000 tons of red meat and 1,600,000 tons of chicken in 2010. ==Fishing== Access to the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and many river basins provides Iran the potential to develop excellent fisheries. The government assumed control of commercial fishing in 1952. One government-owned enterprise, the Northern Sheelat Company, was established in 1952, and a second, the Southern Sheelat Company, was established in 1961. In recent years, illegal and off-season fishing, discharge of industrial and agricultural pollutants, overfishing by other Caspian littoral states, and other unfavorable conditions have endangered Caspian fish resources. Between 1990 and 2004, Iran's total annual Caspian Sea catch declined from 98,000 tons to 32,533 tons, including 463 tons of sturgeon, which yields high-quality caviar. Iran has 1,786 kilometers of coastline on the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. These southern waters are rich in fish and other marine resources. In 2004 the catch off the southern coast totaled 299,000 tons. This represented an average annual increase of 12.6 percent since 1976. The southern catch either is used directly by households and restaurants or processed and preserved by industry. Expansion of the fishery infrastructure would enable the country to harvest an estimated 700,000 tons of fish annually from the southern waters. However, increased pollution from the oil industry and other enterprises poses a serious threat to this area's fishing industry. Since the Revolution, increased attention has been focused on producing fish from inland waters. Between 1976 and 2004, the combined take from inland waters by the state and private sectors increased from 1,100 tons to 110,175 tons. Important fish include sturgeon (yielding its roe for caviar), bream, whitefish, salmon, mullet, carp, catfish, perch, and roach. More than 200 species of fish are found in the Persian Gulf, 150 of which are edible, including shrimps and prawns. Some 692,000 tons of aquatics will be produced across the country by the end of the 2008, of which 236,000 tons would be bred and the rest fished from the sea. Per capita consumption of seafood in Iran will reach 8.5 kg by March 2009 and 10 kg a year later. Caviar: Iranian caviar export is expected to reach $22 million by March 2009. Iran is the world's largest producer and exporter of caviar in the world, exporting more than 300 tonnes annually. ==Forestry== In 2005 Iran's forest area totaled about 11 million hectares, approximately 7 percent of the country's surface area. Adequate rainfall and a favorable climate have created 1.5 million hectares of dense forest in the Caspian region. The remainder is distributed among western forests (3.6 million hectares), southern forests (434,000 hectares), desert forests (620,000 hectares), and forests scattered in other locations. Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of timber products in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., where many of the forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and softwoods. Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, forest destruction by the private sector is routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran's forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran's Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year. The cutting of trees is rigidly controlled by the government, which also has a reforestation program. ==History== Colorized picture of farmers winnowing grain in Southern Iran, 1921. Agriculture has a long history and tradition in Iran. As early as 10,000 BCE, the earliest known domestication of the goat had taken place in the Iranian plateau. By 5000BCE, wine was being fermented in Iran, and by as early as 7th century CE, the windmill had been invented in Persia for the first time in history. Fruits such as the peach first found their way into Europe from Persia, as indicated by their Latin name, persica, from which (by way of the French) we have the English word \\"peach.\\" As did Tulips, which were also first cultivated in ancient Persia and spinach, the word Spinach itself derived from the Persian word ÿßÿ≥ŸÅŸÜÿßÿ¨ Esfenaj. The Chinese referred to it in 647CE as 'the herb of Persia'. In 400BCE, a form of ice cream was in use in Persia,KryssTal : Inventions: 1000 BC to 1 BC and the ancestor of the cookie is said to have come from Persia (from the Persian koolucheh) in the 7th century according to many sources. Fifth century BCE Persia was even the source for introduction of the domesticated chicken into Europe. The mid fifth century BCE poet Cratinus (according to the later Greek author \\"Athenaeus\\") for example calls the chicken \\"the Persian alarm\\". In Aristophanes's comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called \\"the Median bird\\", which points to its introduction from Persis. The Qanat, a subterranean aqueduct used for irrigation in agriculture, was one of the most significant and successful achievements of the Persian tradition. Qanats were in use millennia ago, and are still in use in contemporary Iran. A boom in the production and export of cotton made Iran the richest region of the Islamic caliphate in the ninth and tenth centuries. Yet in the eleventh century, because of colder temperatures, Iran's impressive agricultural economy entered a steep decline, bringing the country's primacy to an end. ===Modern era=== Modern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1820s, when Amir Kabir, the Chief Minister to Naser al-Din Shah and a symbol of reform and modernism in Iran, undertook a number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with other countries. The first agricultural school was founded about a hundred years ago and the Agriculture Bank was established in 1933. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently overseeing and implementing the government's policies in the agricultural sector. Of the 162.2 million hectares of land in Iran, approximately 19 million hectares is agricultural land. This constitutes 12% of the country's land area. The agricultural sector in Iran currently constitutes 13.9% of GDP and agricultural products form about 30% of Iran's non-oil exports. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Iran ranks amongst the top 7 countries in producing 22 important agricultural products: it ranks first in pistachio production, second in date production and fourth in apple production worldwide. It is also the twelfth largest producer of wheat and had the second highest production increase after Argentina in 2010. The value of agricultural production increased by 20% in the Iranian calendar year 1389 (ending March 2011) and agricultural exports rose by 30% in comparison to the previous year. The agricultural sector faces a number of challenges in Iran, the two most important being low rainfall and the impact of fluctuations in oil revenues. Unsurprisingly, agricultural production is directly correlated to the amount of rainfall. The relatively dry climate of most of Iran's regions makes water availability a vital factor in production. For instance, a drought in 2007 damaged agricultural output and drove it down to 9.3% of GDP. Another influential factor is oil revenues. Historically, in periods of high oil prices and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated in the past couple of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; the result is that agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices. The Iranian government supports the agricultural sector in a number of ways. Like many other countries, the agricultural sector is heavily subsidised by the Iranian government. Each year, the government guarantees the purchase of wheat from the farmers at a pre-specialized price to protect them from seasonality in the market prices. The government also pays a wide range of subsidies for improvements in production methods, the use of fertilisers and pesticides, and agricultural research. Nonetheless, there still exist considerable opportunities to improve efficiency in the agricultural sector. For instance, only 10% of farms are equipped with modern irrigation facilities and the rest are still farmed using legacy methods. The market mechanism for agricultural products is not particularly developed given the traditional nature of the agricultural sector and the numerous governmental interventions in the market prices. The market mainly consists of a large number of retail traders who purchase the crops from the farmers in small quantities and bring them to the major traders in the bazaar, which is the system that was the predecessor to the modern markets. In order to improve market efficiency and transparency, the Iranian government has allowed trading of agricultural products on the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) for the past seven years. More than 22 different agricultural products are currently traded on the IME and the trading volume for them is approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum. Nonetheless, given the direct impact of the prices of agricultural products on people's daily lives and welfare, the government actively intervenes in the market by setting prices, importing products in large amounts, subsidising certain products, and restricting exports in order to supply domestic demand. With the subsidies reform plan implemented, many experts are hopeful that not only will government intervention and price distortions in agricultural products be reduced, but also that a fundamental restructuring will take place in the agriculture sector. The government has recently quadrupled bread prices as part of the plan and is planning to liberalise the market completely. In addition, the pricing of a number of other products that was previously done by the government is now to be left to the market mechanism. More importantly, fuel, water and electricity prices have increased significantly. The government has still kept prices lowest for agriculture in comparison to household and industrial consumers. Nonetheless, the high level of inefficiency in the agricultural sector from irrigation to harvesting, is expected to be fundamentally reformed and replaced with more efficient and modern technologies. With an amazingly diverse climate, very high local and regional demand and an educated workforce of more than 100,000 in this field, Iran's agricultural sector is clearly underdeveloped and has immense potential for investment and growth. According to a former agriculture minister, deserts in Iran are spreading, South Alborz and East Zagros will be uninhabitable and people will have to migrate. Out of 75 million people in Iran, 45 million will have uncertain circumstances. ==Agribusiness== A Lahijan tea farm during harvest time, northern Iran. After nearly achieving agricultural self- sufficiency in the 1960s, Iran reached the point in 1979 where 65 percent of its food had to be imported. Declining productivity was blamed on the use of modern fertilizers, which had inadvertently scorched the thin Iranian soil. Unresolved land reform issues, a lack of economic incentives to raise surplus crops, and low profit ratios combined to drive increasingly large segments of the farm population into urban areas. Since 1979 commercial farming has replaced subsistence farming as the dominant mode of agricultural production. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while other areas require irrigation for successful crop production. The 1979 Revolution sought self-sufficiency in foodstuffs as part of its overall goal of decreased economic dependence on the West. Higher government subsidies for grain and other staples and expanded short-term credit and tax exemptions for farmers complying with government quotas were intended by the new regime to promote self-sufficiency. But by early 1987, Iran was actually more dependent on agricultural imports than in the 1970s. By 1997, the gross value of products in Iran's agricultural sector had reached $25 billion. In 2000, the Construction Jihad Organization and the Ministry of Agriculture were merged by national legislation, to form the new Ministry of Agricultural Jihad. The 1999-2000 drought reduced overall GDP by about 4.4%, and resulted in decreased non-oil exports, increased food imports, and a rise in inflation. In 2003, a quarter of Iran's non-oil exports were agricultural based. In 2004 an agricultural bourse started trading agricultural and related products in the country. Iran's agricultural sector contributed 11 percent of the GDP in 2004 and employed a third of the labor force. Benefiting from 123,580 square kilometers of land suitable for agriculture, the agricultural sector is one of the major contributors to Iran's economy. It accounts for almost 13% of Iran's GDP, 20% of the employed population, 23% of non-oil exports, 82% of domestically consumed foodstuffs and 90% of raw materials used in the food processing industry (2008). ===Focus areas=== Iranian fishermen by the Caspian Sea The focus areas for agriculture are: *Financing and low-interest loans for investment in agriculture and agro-industrial projects. *Ensuring self- sufficiency in the provision of national food requirements. *Budgets for agro- industrial projects in the food processing, packaging and irrigation sectors. *Provision of agricultural machinery and equipment with emphasis on local production by making transfer of technology a required clause in foreign contracts. Foreign loans and investments in the agro sector exceeded $500 million in 2008. *Allocation of government loans and financing for agro- industrial projects. ===Agro complexes=== In 2009 seven hundred agricultural complexes were under construction on 60,000 hectares of farmlands across the country. Chicken farms, animal husbandries, fish farming pools and greenhouses are built in these complexes. ===Mechanized agriculture=== Mechanized agricultural has had a slow but steady growth in Iran. Industrial facilities in Tabriz and Arak are Iran's largest producers of machinery and equipment for the agricultural sector. 12,000 combine harvesters and 300,000 tractors are currently used in the sector (2007).Iran Daily - Domestic Economy - 06/26/07 Tabriz Tractor Manufacturing Company, which was founded four decades ago, employs almost 10,000 people. It produces 30,000 tractors annually, a large part of which is exported. Iran declared self-sufficiency in irrigation and agricultural machinery in 2008. ==Production and consumption== There are 22,000 food industries units in the country (2009). The capacity of these units has increased to 60 million tons from 8 million tons in the pre-Islamic Revolution era. Agricultural production stood at 108 million tons in 2008, which indicates a 20 million ton increase from 2007. {  - !

But wastage in storing, processing, marketing and consumption of food products remained a concern (30% of production according to some sources).

Major agricultural exports include fresh and dried fruits, nuts, animal hides, processed foods, caviar and spices. Pistachio, raisins, dates and saffron are the first four export products, from the viewpoint of value. Close to 8 million tons of agricultural products are exported annually (2008). But according to the Central Bank of Iran, only 3.2 million tons of \\"agricultural products\\" were exported in 2008 with a total value of $3.2 billion \\"which showed a 6.1 percent increase over the previous year\\". Agricultural and food stuff exports in years 2012-13 ending 21 March stood at $5.2 billion.ÿ™ÿ¨ÿßÿ±ÿ™ €±€∏Ÿ´€¥ ŸÖ€åŸÑ€åÿßÿ±ÿØ ÿØŸÑÿßÿ±€å ÿ∫ÿ∞ÿß€å€å Ÿà ⁄©ÿ¥ÿßŸàÿ±ÿ≤€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ €π€≤ ÿ¥ÿ®⁄©Ÿá ÿÆÿ®ÿ±€å ÿµŸÜÿß€åÿπ ÿ∫ÿ∞ÿß€å€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ During years 2013-14 ending 21 March agricultural and food stuff exports increased by 27 percent, standing at $6.6 billion. ===Foodstuff=== A total of 12,198 entities are engaged in the Iranian food industry, or 12% of all entities in the industry sector. The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or 16.1% of the entire industry sector's workforce. Iran exported $736 million worth of foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000 tonnes) in 2010. Soft drinks, mineral water, biscuit, chocolate, confection, edible oil, dairies, conserved foods and fruits, jam and jelly, macaroni, fruit juice and yeast were among the main exports to Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and other Central Asian countries, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Syria, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Canada, Venezuela, Japan, South Korea and Turkey. ==Government policy== In theory, Iranian agricultural policy is intended to support farmers and encourage the production of strategically important crops. The policy is twofold: first, to purchase certain crops at guaranteed prices and second, to encourage the production of specific crops through farm subsidies. The policy of purchasing agricultural crops from farmers at guaranteed prices was put in place in the 1989 crop year. On average, the guaranteed prices increased at the rate of inflation over the past 15 years. Individual subsidy levels for major crops, however, vary annually.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf In the 1990s and early 2000s, government agricultural planning was only marginally successful. According to government figures, during the 1990s‚Äîcoincident with the first two Islamic Republic economic plans‚Äîonly 40.5 percent of the agricultural modernization projected by those plans was accomplished, and only 40.2 percent of government and private-sector financial commitments materialized. Because wheat is considered Iran's most strategically important crop, it received the largest subsidies, and its production grew at the fastest rate between 1990 and 2005. From FY 2003 to FY 2004, wheat subsidies increased by 17.2 percent, reaching a record of US$1.5 billion. Between 1981 and 2004, the area cultivated with wheat remained stable at 5 million hectares, but wheat production increased from 5.7 million to more than 11 million tons. Beginning in 1990, the government expanded its agricultural support programs to include a guaranteed purchase price for major agricultural crops, subsidies, favorable interest rates, government investment, and favorable foreign-trade policies. Primarily because of government support for domestic agriculture, between 1989 and 2003 the import volumes of wheat, sugar, and red meat declined by 77.7 percent, 39.6 percent, and 88.2 percent, respectively. Concurrently, the value of agricultural exports increased from US$461.5 million in 1989 to US$1.7 billion in 2004. However, over the same period total food and live animal imports increased from US$1.37 billion to US$2.65 billion. ===Imports=== In the past, the Iranian private sector handled the bulk of the country's imports of grain and oilseeds, but since 2012 the government has stepped up operations through its Government Trading Corporation (GTC). Other notable agencies are the Livestock Affairs Logistic Co (SLAL) and the Government Grain Trading Agency. During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency between 2005 and 2013 imports of agricultural products increased rapidly and reached $13.214 Billion by year 2012-13 ending 21 March whereas agricultural imports in 2004 stood at $3.5 billion. As of 2015, Iran is among the world's top four buyers of wheat, barley and rice and one of the 10 largest importers of raw sugar. It has been reported that some imported wheat has been resold into the Iranian government's farmer purchasing scheme at a profit because of lack of import duties for wheat and barley, thus artificially increasing imports at the expense of domestic production. Imports of agricultural products at year 2014-15 ending 21 March stood at 12 billion dollars, and for the following year ending 21 March 2016 stood at 9 billion dollars. ===Industry standards=== Iran is signatory to bi-lateral protocols that set the standards for many of its agricultural imports including meat and wheat. The protocols are usually negotiated on a country-by-country basis and it's commonplace for Iran to inspect produce prior to shipment. Iran Customs and the Iran Veterinary Organization are the policing bodies for imported food products, including dairy. Meat imports require written authorization from the Ministries of Commerce and Agricultural Jihad. The Iranian Government insists on the presence of Shiite clergymen and inspections by the Veterinary Organization during any livestock slaughter. The Codex Commission of Food Stuff, established in 2002 is in charge of setting and developing standards and quality and health regulations, related to the production of and trade in raw agricultural products and food stuffs, in accordance with the different global standards. ===Plant Protection Organization=== The Plant Protection Organization is in charge of issuing export and import licenses for all kinds of plants and parts thereof including bulbs, cuttings, roots, fruits, saplings, and seeds, as well as the issuance of licenses - which are solely of a technical nature - for importation, exportation, production, transformation and packaging of all kinds of pesticides, herbicides, and plant hormones. ===Research and development=== Attention to the food and nutrition status of Iranian people has been made since Institute of Nutrition and Food Science of Iran (INFSI) was established by Dr. Habibollah Hedayat in 1961. In 2005, Iran's first genetically modified (GM) rice was approved by national authorities and is being grown commercially for human consumption. In addition to GM rice, Iran has produced several GM plants in the laboratory, such as insect-resistant maize; cotton; potatoes and sugar beets; herbicide-resistant canola; salinity- and drought-tolerant wheat; and blight-resistant maize and wheat. Yet, despite the controversy surrounding GM food and government restrictions on the production of biotech products, Iran imports $5 billion of genetically modified crops a year because of laxed laws (2015). There are different ongoing research in agricultural fields in Iran which are mostly focused on local problems and requirements. Iran has also a very focused and intensive nanotechnology research program for agricultural applications. ==See also== *Cuisine of Iran *Habibollah Hedayat *International rankings of Iran *Iran Combine Manufacturing Company *Iranian Agriculture News Agency *Irrigation in Iran *List of reservoirs and dams in Iran *Water supply and sanitation in Iran Saffron cultivation in India & Benefits ==ReferencesExternal links== ;International organizations *World Bank report on Iran's agriculture (1994) *FAO - Agricultural Sector Statistics for Iran **Comparison of Iranian agricultural output with rest of the world at United Nation's FAO **Iran Fishery Statistics 2003 **Fertilizer use statistics in Iran on FAO website ;Government sites *Ministry of Agricultural Jihad Of Iran *Department of Land Cultivation and Management *Annual Reviews- Reports by the Central Bank of Iran, including statistics about agriculture in Iran and subsidized price lists. * ;Specialized reports *Iran Agriculture Brief (2008) *Iran Agribusiness Report (50-page, 2010-report) *Dried Processed Food in Iran (50-page, 2010-report) ;Articles *Graph of fishing in Iranian waters *Iran/Economy/fisheries/Iran fisheris1.shtm Iran's Fisheries ;General *Agriculture in Iran - Encyclop√¶dia Iranica *Exclusive economic zone of Iranian waters *Iran Forest Service *Soil Science Society of Iran *Biotechnology Study Center, Tehran *Iran Agricultural Scientific Information and Documentation Center ;Videos *Part I Iran's Fishing Industry (PressTV 2010) **Part II **Part III *Iranian food industry (PressTV 2011) * Category:Economy of Iran ","title":"Agriculture in Iran"},{"id":"7459178","text":" HMS Ottringham was one of 93 ships of the of inshore minesweepers.

The concept unifies very different types of such \\"rules\\" in mathematics: the different choices made for how time is measured and the special properties of the ambient space may give an idea of the vastness of the class of objects described by this concept. Time can be measured by integers, by real or complex numbers or can be a more general algebraic object, losing the memory of its physical origin, and the ambient space may be simply a set, without the need of a smooth space-time structure defined on it. ==Formal definition== There are two classes of definitions for a dynamical system: one is motivated by ordinary differential equations and is geometrical in flavor; and the other is motivated by ergodic theory and is measure theoretical in flavor. The measure theoretical definitions assume the existence of a measure-preserving transformation. This appears to exclude dissipative systems, as in a dissipative system a small region of phase space shrinks under time evolution. A simple construction (sometimes called the Krylov‚ÄìBogolyubov theorem) shows that it is always possible to construct a measure so as to make the evolution rule of the dynamical system a measure- preserving transformation. In the construction a given measure of the state space is summed for all future points of a trajectory, assuring the invariance. The difficulty in constructing the natural measure for a dynamical system makes it difficult to develop ergodic theory starting from differential equations, so it becomes convenient to have a dynamical systems-motivated definition within ergodic theory that side-steps the choice of measure. == General definition == In the most general sense,Giunti M. and Mazzola C.

(eds.), Methods, models, simulations and approaches towards a general theory of change, pp. 173-185, Singapore: World Scientific. Mazzola C. and Giunti M. (2012), \\"Reversible dynamics and the directionality of time\\". In Minati G., Abram M., Pessa E. (eds.), Methods, models, simulations and approaches towards a general theory of change, pp. 161-171, Singapore: World Scientific. . a dynamical system is a tuple (T, M, Œ¶) where T is a monoid, written additively, M is a non-empty set and Œ¶ is a function :\\\\Phi: U \\\\subseteq (T \\\\times M) \\\\to M with :\\\\mathrm{proj}_{2}(U) = M (where \\\\mathrm{proj}_{2} is the 2nd projection map) : I(x) = \\\\\\\\{ t \\\\in T : (t,x) \\\\in U \\\\\\\\} :\\\\Phi(0,x) = x :\\\\Phi(t_2,\\\\Phi(t_1,x)) = \\\\Phi(t_2 + t_1, x), for \\\\, t_1,\\\\, t_2 + t_1 \\\\in I(x) and \\\\ t_2 \\\\in I(\\\\Phi(t_1, x)) The function Œ¶(t,x) is called the evolution function of the dynamical system: it associates to every point in the set M a unique image, depending on the variable t, called the evolution parameter. M is called phase space or state space, while the variable x represents an initial state of the system. We often write :\\\\Phi_x(t) \\\\equiv \\\\Phi(t,x) :\\\\Phi^t(x) \\\\equiv \\\\Phi(t,x) if we take one of the variables as constant. :\\\\Phi_x:I(x) \\\\to M is called flow through x and its graph trajectory through x. The set :\\\\gamma_x \\\\equiv\\\\\\\\{\\\\Phi(t,x) : t \\\\in I(x)\\\\\\\\} is called orbit through x. Note that the orbit through x is the image of the flow through x. A subset S of the state space M is called Œ¶-invariant if for all x in S and all t in T :\\\\Phi(t,x) \\\\in S. Thus, in particular, if S is Œ¶-invariant, I(x) = T for all x in S. That is, the flow through x must be defined for all time for every element of S. == Geometrical cases == In the following cases, M is a manifold (or its extreme case a graph). Dynamical systems are defined as tuples of which one element is a manifold. === Real dynamical system === A real dynamical system, real-time dynamical system, continuous time dynamical system, or flow is a tuple (T, M, Œ¶) with T an open interval in the real numbers R, M a manifold locally diffeomorphic to a Banach space, and Œ¶ a continuous function. If T=R we call the system global, if T is restricted to the non-negative reals we call the system a semi-flow. If Œ¶ is continuously differentiable we say the system is a differentiable dynamical system. If the manifold M is locally diffeomorphic to Rn, the dynamical system is finite- dimensional; if not, the dynamical system is infinite-dimensional. Note that this does not assume a symplectic structure. === Discrete dynamical system === A discrete dynamical system, discrete-time dynamical system, map or cascade is a tuple (T, M, Œ¶) where T is the set of integers, M is a manifold locally diffeomorphic to a Banach space, and Œ¶ is a function. If T is restricted to the non-negative integers we call the system a semi-cascade. === Cellular automaton === A cellular automaton is a tuple (T, M, Œ¶), with T a lattice such as the integers or a higher-dimensional integer grid, M is a set of functions from an integer lattice (again, with one or more dimensions) to a finite set, and Œ¶ a (locally defined) evolution function. As such cellular automata are dynamical systems. The lattice in M represents the \\"space\\" lattice, while the one in T represents the \\"time\\" lattice. ==Measure theoretical definition== A dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a sigma-algebra, the triplet (T, (X, Œ£, Œº), Œ¶) Here, T is a monoid (usually the non-negative integers), X is a set, and (X, Œ£, Œº) is a probability space. A map Œ¶: X ‚Üí X is said to be Œ£-measurable if and only if, for every œÉ in Œ£, one has Œ¶‚àí1(œÉ) ‚àà Œ£. A map Œ¶ is said to preserve the measure if and only if, for every œÉ in Œ£, one has Œº(Œ¶‚àí1(œÉ)) = Œº(œÉ). Combining the above, a map Œ¶ is said to be a measure-preserving transformation of X , if it is a map from X to itself, it is Œ£-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The triplet (T, (X, Œ£, Œº), Œ¶), for such a Œ¶, is then defined to be a dynamical system. The map Œ¶ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the iterates \\\\scriptstyle\\\\phi^n=\\\\phi\\\\circ\\\\phi\\\\circ\\\\ldots\\\\circ\\\\phi for every integer n are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map Œ¶ is understood to be finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated. ===Relation to geometric definition=== Many different invariant measures can be associated to any one evolution rule. In ergodic theory the choice is assumed made, but if the dynamical system is given by a system of differential equations the appropriate measure must be determined. Some systems have a natural measure, such as the Liouville measure in Hamiltonian systems, chosen over other invariant measures, such as the measures supported on periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. For many dissipative chaotic systems the choice of invariant measure is technically more challenging. The measure needs to be supported on the attractor, but attractors have zero Lebesgue measure and the invariant measures must be singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. For hyperbolic dynamical systems, the Sinai‚ÄìRuelle‚ÄìBowen measures appear to be the natural choice. They are constructed on the geometrical structure of stable and unstable manifolds of the dynamical system; they behave physically under small perturbations; and they explain many of the observed statistics of hyperbolic systems. == Construction of dynamical systems == The concept of evolution in time is central to the theory of dynamical systems as seen in the previous sections: the basic reason for this fact is that the starting motivation of the theory was the study of time behavior of classical mechanical systems, that is the study of the initial value problems for their describing systems of ordinary differential equations. :\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{x}}=\\\\boldsymbol{v}(t,\\\\boldsymbol{x}) :\\\\boldsymbol{x}_=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0 where *\\\\scriptstyle{\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{x}}} represents the velocity of the material point x *v: T √ó M ‚Üí M is a vector field in Rn or Cn and represents the change of velocity induced by the known forces acting on the given material point. Depending on the properties of this vector field, the mechanical system is called **autonomous, when v(t, x) = v(x) **homogeneous when v(t, 0) = 0 for all t The solution is the evolution function already introduced in above :\\\\boldsymbol(t)=\\\\Phi(t,\\\\boldsymbol_0) Some formal manipulation of the system of differential equations shown above gives a more general form of equations a dynamical system must satisfy :\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{x}}-\\\\boldsymbol{v}(t,\\\\boldsymbol{x})=0 \\\\qquad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\qquad \\\\mathfrak\\\\left(t,\\\\Phi(t,\\\\boldsymbol_0)\\\\right)=0 where \\\\mathfrak{G}:{{(T\\\\times M)}^M}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{C} is a functional from the set of evolution functions to the field of the complex numbers. == Compactification of a dynamical system == Given a global dynamical system (R, X, Œ¶) on a locally compact and Hausdorff topological space X, it is often useful to study the continuous extension Œ¶* of Œ¶ to the one-point compactification X* of X. Although we lose the differential structure of the original system we can now use compactness arguments to analyze the new system (R, X*, Œ¶*). In compact dynamical systems the limit set of any orbit is non- empty, compact and simply connected. == References == * * online version of first edition on the EMIS site . * Dynamical systems it:Sistema dinamico ","title":"Dynamical system (definition)"},{"id":"7459219","text":"Calum \\"Baldy\\" MacKay (January 1, 1927 - August 21, 2001) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.

The school was also known as Dudley High School. The school traditionally served the 11-18 range, but from September 1972 it served pupils aged 12‚Äì18 due to a local reorganisation of education. Despite being a single sex school in its own right, the school co-hosted many dramatic and musical productions with the Boys Grammar School, and by the 1960s boys and girls from the two schools were taught together for some of the less popular subjects at sixth form level. Dudley Girls High School served Dudley and its surrounding area for 65 years, before it merged with the grammar school - as well as the Park Secondary Modern School - to form The Dudley School in September 1975, nine years after proposals to merge the two schools were first made. From this date onwards, boys and girls aged 12‚Äì18 years were taught in the buildings of both the former grammar school and the high school. The old Park School buildings were retained for two years as an annexe of The Dudley School. ===After the high school=== Following several years of speculation about further reorganisation, another merger came in September 1989, this time when the Dudley School merged with The Blue Coat School to form Castle High School - the new school also taking in some of the Sir Gilbert Claughton School pupils upon that school's phased closure, and the creation of the new school was completed in September 1990 with the arrival of some pupils from the closed Mons Hill School. The former grammar school buildings were expanded between 1990 and 1995, leaving the former high school buildings disused after July 1995, although a sports hall which had existed on the site since about 1960 was retained and is still in use now, with a new entrance being built from the old grammar school site to enable the old high school to be demolished. Dudley council had considered using the old high school as council offices, but these plans were scrapped in favour of demolition, which took place in early 1996. The site of the school was converted into public car park in 1997, with a campus of Dudley College of Technology being opened on the site in September 2012. . ===Headteachers=== Miss M. B.

It features the hit singles \\"Lost in You\\", \\"Forever Young\\", \\"My Heart Can't Tell You No\\", and \\"Crazy About Her\\". The album was produced by Stewart and members of The Power Station: guitarist Andy Taylor (also a former member of Duran Duran), and bassist Bernard Edwards (formerly of Chic). Chic drummer Tony Thompson also plays on the record.[] ==Critical reception== The album was considered by many critics a return to form after a series of less successful albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \\"well-constructed\\", and Rolling Stone magazine called it a \\"confident, well-written, high-voltage work\\". Robert Christgau, however, gave it a C, unfavorably comparing the album to the work of The Power Station. ==Commercial performance== The album reached #20 on the Billboard 200, eventually going 2x Platinum, which made it Stewart's best-selling album of the 1980s. Each single released from the album went to the Top 20 of either the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, or the Billboard Hot 100. Music videos were also produced and released for each. The most successful single was \\"My Heart Can't Tell You No\\", which reached the Top 5 of both the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Billboard Hot 100.[ AllMusic] The album had four charting hits in the U.S., the biggest being \\"My Heart Can't Tell You No\\" at #4. In January 1989, immediately following Super Bowl XXIII, NBC Sports used \\"Forever Young\\" as the soundtrack for a year-in-review segment showcasing highlights from the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 1988 World Series, the 1989 Fiesta Bowl, and Super Bowl XXIII. All four events had been broadcast by NBC. The structure of the lyrics to \\"Forever Young\\" are very similar to a Bob Dylan song of the same title. When this was realized, the song was then sent to Dylan, out of respect, asking whether he had a problem with it. Stewart and Dylan agreed to participate in the ownership of the song and share Stewart's royalties.

He is the son of Puerto Rican architect Gonzalo Fern√≥s-L√≥pez and of the educator Patricia Fern√≥s and is related to the first Puerto Rican cardiologist and its longest serving resident commissioner Antonio Fern√≥s-Isern. Fern√≥s was featured at age of 10 in the cooking section of El Nuevo D√≠a newspaper about being one of the youngest boys studying the confectionery arts in Puerto Rico. The article focused mostly on the fact he and his sister Talia Fern√≥s were being homeschooled by their mother. ===Career=== Fern√≥s left San Juan and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin at the age of 17 in 1989. There he studied performance art with Linda Montano. One of his class projects became a long running performance art experiment, SoftMen, a weekly improvised soap opera which involved fellow performers Chris Rinc√≥n and Andrew Johnson performing all the roles simultaneously, in the tradition of plays like The Mystery of Irma Vep. In 1992 he began organizing musically oriented variety shows. They were originally titled Big Wig Revue. While the name suggested traditional cabaret, the goal was to redefine the genre. In 1993 he started the performance art collective Performance Art Church, better known by its abbreviation Pe.A.Ch., with artists Kerthy Fix, Sheelah Murthy, Diana Garc√≠a, Scott Alton Dulaney and Carol Gilson. Most of their shows were short performances hosted by one of the performers tied around a central topic or theme. One show was a tribute to Lawrence Welk, while another was a discussion on the Superhero/Comic book genre. Fern√≥s started the Feast of Fools in Chicago in the spring of 1998 with the Chicago Radical Faeries as a fundraiser for the struggling Randolph Street Gallery.Obejas, Achy. \\"Feast of Fools\\" - A Celebration of Diversity.

On February 8, 2005 the first Feast of Fools podcast was posted on his LiveJournal blog, FaustoFun. Within several weeks of posting shows, the audience for the online show grew beyond the size of the local Chicago audience. In 2009, the name of the show was changed from Feast of Fools to Feast of Fun to better reflect changes in the program's design and functionality.

Seleucia Pieria quickly became a major Mediterranean port of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the port of Antioch. But it was subject to silting and an earthquake in 526 finally completed its demise as a port. Samandaƒü, then called St Symeon, became the port of Antioch, and played an important role in the capture of the city by the Crusaders in 1098, to be known as Soudin. The whole area was known as Svediye, where six villages of Armenians were located (Bityas, Kabousiye, Haji Habibly, Kheder Beg, Yoghoun Olouk and Vakif) until 1939, the so called \\"Referrendum\\", when all the Armenian villagers (over 6000) emigrated to Anjar, Lebanon. Only a small part of Vakif remained and are still in the village, now called Vakifly. == Geography == Samandaƒü itself is a small town of 35,000 people, close to the city of Antakya. The local economy depends on fishing and agriculture, especially citrus fruits, and Samandaƒü has the air of a country market town, with young men buzzing through the streets on mopeds. Around the midtown of √áevlik (derived from Seleucia), there is a long sandy coastline popular with daytrippers from Antakya, although the sea can be stormy. This is an important nesting area of the endangered sea turtle Caretta caretta. == Population == The vast majority of the population is composed of Arabic speakers who adhere to the Alawite sect of Shia Islam.

Measuring 40 by 45 centimeters the image is a fresco executed on a thin layer of plaster no thicker than an egg shell. Over the centuries, devotions to Our Lady of the Good Counsel grew among saints and Popes, to the extent that a reference to it was added to the Litany of Loreto and the devotion spread throughout the world. Her feast day is April 26. ==Background== In the 5th century, during the reign of Pope Sixtus III, the town of Genazzano, about south of Rome, had contributed a large portion of its revenue for the Roman basilica now known as Santa Maria Maggiore. In appreciation, a church, called Santa Maria, was built in Genazzano and was later entrusted to the Augustinian Order in 1356. The Genazzano church became a popular place of pilgrimage. Numerous cures were said took place there. The Augustinian friars were invited to minister to the spiritual needs of the pilgrims. They continue to serve there to this day. ==Legend== Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo, 19th century. According to tradition, the story is said to have begun in 1467 in a small church in Albania. In this church there was the old painting of Our Lady with the child Jesus and no one in the village knew where it had came from. Due to the Turks invading Albania, many villagers were fleeing. Two young men, Giorgio and De Scalvis, often visited the church to pray. They had had a particular devotion to Mary as depicted in the painting of Mary and regretted that it would be left behind. One night as they prayed in the church, they both fell asleep and dreamt that Mary had commanded them to leave the country. She also said that the painting would also depart to escape from the Turks and that they must follow the painting wherever it went. In the morning the painting had detached itself from the wall and hovered, wrapped white cloud. They followed after as the painting led them to the coast. Then they followed it out across the water until they reached the Italian coast. After a few days the cloud and the painting disappeared. Giorgio and De Scalvis began searching the city until they found the old Augustinian church of Santa Maria in Genazzano. In the year 1467, in the midst of the festivities for the Feast of Saint Mark, the townfolk suddenly heard \\"exquisite music.\\" A mysterious cloud was then said to have descended on the unfinished wall of the parish church. In front of the people, the cloud dissipated and a beautiful fresco, no thicker than a carte-de-visite and no more than eighteen inches square, of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child was revealed. It was widely believed that it had been miraculously transported from a church in Scutari, Albania. The picture of Our Lady was at first called \\"La Madonna del Paradiso\\" and now better known as \\"Madonna del Buon Consiglio\\" (Our Lady of Good Counsel).Middleton, Thomas. \\"Feast of Our Lady of Good Counsel.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 November 2017 Such was the holy image's reputation that Pope Urban VIII made a \\"glittering\\" pilgrimage there in 1630, invoking the protection of the Queen of Heaven, as did Pope Pius IX in 1864. On November 17, 1682, Pope Innocent XI had the picture solemnly crowned. Among her noted clients have been St Aloysius Gonzaga, St Alphonsus Liguori, St John Bosco, and Blessed Stephen Bellesini. Madonna di Buon Consiglio mosaic by Nunzio Monticelli, 20th century. ==History== Art experts consulted during a restoration conducted between 1957 and 1959 suggest that the image of the Madonna was once part of a larger fresco that covered the wall and was subsequently covered over with plaster. They believe the fresco is likely the work of the early fifteenth century artist Gentile da Fabriano, probably painted around the time of Pope Martin V (1417-1431). ==Veneration== The Augustinian Order contributed to the spread of this devotion internationally. In 1753, Pope Benedict XIV established the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel. Leo XIII, who was himself a member of the pious union, was deeply attached to this devotion.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 515 On April 22, 1903, Pope Leo XIII included the invocation \\"Mater boni consilii\\" in the Litany of Loreto. In 1939, Venerable Pope Pius XII placed his pontificate under the maternal care of Our Lady of Good Counsel and composed a prayer to her.Mauriello, Matthew R., \\"Our Lady of Good Counsel\\", International Marian Research Institute Home : University of Dayton, OhioThis Saint's for You by Thomas J. Craughwell 2007 page 172 Through the years, various institutions have been named in honor of Mary under the title of Our Lady of Good Counsel. These institutions include a college, high schools, and churches. Her Feast is celebrated on April 26 so as not to conflict with that of St. Mark. === The White Scapular=== The small Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel (the White Scapular) was presented by the Hermits of St Augustine to Pope Leo XIII, who, on December 19-21, 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences in a Decree of the Congregation of Rites. On the front panel of the sacramental (to be made of white wool) is the image of the fresco of Our Lady of Good Counsel, with the inscription, ‚ÄúMater boni consilii [ora pro nobis].‚Äù On the second segment is found the papal coat-of-arms, which includes the Triple Tiara and the Keys of Heaven, with the words of Leo XIII: ‚Äú‚Äù (Child, listen to her counsels). ===Patronage=== Our Lady of Good Counsel is the Patroness of the Missionary Sisters of Saint Peter Claver, the National Council of Catholic Women, and of the Catholic Women's League of Canada. The \\"Midwest Augustinians\\" headquartered in Chicago have also adopted Our Lady of Good Counsel as their patroness, having named their Augustinian jurisdiction as the \\"Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel.\\" The town Essen in the German Ruhr- Area is under the patronage of the Lady. The High church the M√ºnster of Essen as it is called was given to her after the Ruhrbistum was established. ==Legacy== Our Lady of Good Counsel in White Plains, New York is the site of the motherhouse of the Sisters of the Divine Compassion.

It runs from SH-54 in Kiowa County to Interstate 44 (I-44) near Lawton. Part of the highway runs through the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge; this portion of SH-49 carries no signage identifying it as such. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-49 was established in 1939. Originally it turned south in the refuge to serve Cache; its present-day routing was established in 1973. ==Route description== SH-49 begins in Kiowa County at SH-54 south of Cooperton and heads due east. The highway crosses into Comanche Co. about east of that point. The road continues east for about two miles more, where it makes a ninety-degree turn to the north. It continues north for around a half-mile (0.8 km), then angles northeast. It then enters the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. Through the refuge, SH-49 is unsigned, appearing only as a nameless road. Inside the refuge, the speed limit drops to , with a night speed limit of . Upon entering the refuge, the highway curves around to the southwest. SH-49 passes in between Big Four Mountain (elev. ) and Sunset Peak. The road then drops down to Antelope Flat, where it crosses the stream that feeds Caddo Lake, as well as passing near the lake itself. It serves as the northern terminus of Indiahoma Road, which heads south towards French Lake, the trailhead of the Dog Run Hollow hiking trail, and many of the peaks in the southwest part of the refuge, before eventually serving the town of Indiahoma south of the refuge. After the Indiahoma Road intersection, it crosses the stream that forms French Lake. At the Boulder Turnoff, it intersects the road leading to Lost Lake and Eagle Mountain. The road then curves northeast to bypass Quanah Parker Lake and its campsite. The road then curves due south towards the Cache Wye. At the Cache Wye, SH-49 intersects State Highway 115, which is also unsigned. Motorists on eastbound SH-49 that continue straight at the junction will be put on southbound SH-115; to continue east, a left turn must be made. SH-49 and SH-115 are effectively concurrent east of the Cache Wye, although signage is still not posted. The two highways turn northeast, then curve back around to the east. SH-115 then splits off to the north, while SH-49 continues a general eastbound heading. alt=A sign reading \\"END\\" above the SH-49 shield. The sign stands next to a road which sharply changes from a well-kept, striped highway to a lower-grade unstriped road at the same place as the sign. SH-49 continues through the eastern part of the refuge. It serves as the primary access to Mount Scott, with an access road connecting the highway to the mountain's summit. SH-49 then passes between Elmer Thomas Lake and Lake Lawtonka before exiting the refuge. At this entrance to the park, there is an \\"end SH-49\\" assembly posted on westbound SH-49. This is an error, as SH-49 exits the other side of the park, and ODOT does not list two different SH-49s. After leaving the refuge, SH-49 passes through the south side of Medicine Park. Running south of Mount Cummins, it meets the southern terminus of State Highway 58. Four miles (6.4 km) later, it ends at I-44 exit 45. ==History== SH-49 was added to the state highway system in 1939. At this time, SH-49 began at US-62 in Cache (now designated Old Cache Road; US-62 had not yet been shifted to the freeway north of town), and entered the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, following present-day SH-115 until the Cache Wye. SH-49 then emerged from the refuge near Medicine Park and followed the remainder of its present-day routing. The portion of highway between the Cache Wye and Cache itself was renumbered to become part of SH-115 in 1962. The same year, the portion of road leading west from the Cache Wye to SH-54 was added to the highway, bringing it to its present-day extent. At this time, the road between SH-54 and the Cache Wye was gravel. It was paved in 1973. ==Junction listReferences== 049 Category:Transportation in Kiowa County, Oklahoma Category:Transportation in Comanche County, Oklahoma ","title":"Oklahoma State Highway 49"},{"id":"7459311","text":"Camille D√°vila is an international songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer and performer. She is credited on Pop Levi's album The Return to Form Black Magick Party as a guest vocalist and, according to Allmusic, has three albums to her own name. == Biography == Born in Los Angeles, California, United States, Camille D√°vila spent most of her life in the West Coast and the last 6‚Äì7 years relocated in Europe, primarily England, Germany, and Norway.See Allmusic for second reference In 2000 she signed to Below Recordings to release her debut album Not for the Disco shortly before moving to Liverpool to study sound technology and continue her relationship with Below Recordings which re-located to Berlin, Germany. Two European tours followed, along with gobs of scattered European gigs and a second album \\"World of Gliding Monsters\\", produced in the UK, Norway and Germany. Camille is one of the few of her kind to take the reins on her projects, producing and arranging most of her tracks herself; in fact on some of her recordings she has even played every instrument. When choosing to collaborate, she played amongst some of Europe's finest musicians (including Stein Urheim of Steady Steele, Marius Simonsen of Pop Levi and Super Numeri and Pop Levi himself). Camille continued to play through a residency at Ladytron's famous Liverpool club \\"Korova\\" while popping up for \\"special appearance\\" gigs globally. Camille's surrounding company has always been of interest to die-hard fans, from playing with ex- Jeff Buckley drummer Eric Eidel, to working for an organization run by Stewart Brand, Brian Eno and others at The Long Now Foundation, to debuting her residency with her opening players the Zutons! In 2007, after a brief return to California to form a new band and play shows in America, Camille brought her band to London to record the album Hi-C.Updated information confirmed by Camille Davila's label Poly Records A music video for song \\"Wireless World\\" directed by Jacqueline Passmore (visual artist for bands such as Ladytron and Stereolab) was launched in October 2007 and toured several film festival circuits, including the BBC Norfolk Music Video Festival. After her third release, Davila was shortlisted by Channel4 for the 4Talent award in music in 2008. The album \\"Hi-C\\" was mastered in the Guillemots studio in London and released in 2008 on both CD and all digital retailers. In August 2009 Camille moved from London to Oslo, Norway to begin work on a top-secret project with Jeron Gundersen of Dibidim and \\"Bearfarm\\". This lead her to working with the famous Norwegian producer HP Gundersen (whose production credits include Sondre Lerche). This resulted in her newest release; \\"Divided Skies\\", released in 2013 by the Norwegian artist Heidi Goodbye on her label Goodbye Records. Her newest release has received accolades from the likes of Jeff Lynne (ELO), and Van Dyke Parks. .Updated information confirmed by Camille Davila's label Goodbye Records, and biography from Camille Davila's website is partially written by Van Dyke Parks On the making of Divided Skies, according to Goodbye Records: \\"HP Gundersen went to visit the band Bearfarm in Norway some time ago, where he heard recordings of Camille Davila and requested to meet her. Camille was living at the time in Oslo and went up to Bergen to say hello! He then helped her to start on this album by setting her up with a studio to record in, with a fabulous rhythm section (Mette Mathiesen and Daniel Birkeland) and a great experience jamming a bit with his project with Heidi Goodbye: The Last Hurrah!! After getting a solid rhythm section down, Camille took her recordings to Jonas Lie Theis and Jeron Gundersen in Oslo and the three of them began adding color and texture over beautiful Norwegian summer nights. Final touches where added after bringing those recordings to the famous Badminton Bay Studios (care of Jonas Raabe).\\" After a year spent back in California, Camille has relocated to Norfolk in the United Kingdom and continues to tour and promote her newest release. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Not for the Disco (2000, Below Recordings) * World of Gliding Monsters (2004, Below Recordings) * Hi-C (2008, Poly Records) * Divided Skies (2013, Goodbye Records)Allmusic ===Contributions=== * RCA Christmas EP Artist: Various Artists; Contributor (2002, RCA) * The Return to Form Black Magick Party Artist: Pop Levi Vocals on track \\"Flirting\\" (2007, Counter Records) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Camille Davila official site * Allmusic * Facebook music page * \\"One of Many\\" video by Linda Nguyen and Krystof Andres * \\"Wireless World\\" video by Jacqueline Passmore * Channel4 Talent Awards * BBC Norfolk Introducing Music Video Festival 2010 * Live at Old School Studios Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Liverpool Category:American women guitarists Category:American female singers Category:Female rock singers Category:American women in electronic music Category:21st-century women singers ","title":"Camille Davila"},{"id":"7459314","text":"Juli√°n Hern√°ndez Santill√°n (born 6 April 1963 in Nuevo Le√≥n) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the National Action Party (PAN).

His mother, who was a singer at the time with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra, intended to name him after her favorite actor, Cary Grant, but a clerical error led to his naming as \\"Gary\\". He received a set of drums as a gift for his 14th birthday in 1960. When he was 18, Lewis formed what would become Gary Lewis & the Playboys (then known as \\"Gary and the Playboys\\") with four other friends. Joking at the lateness of bandmates to practice, Lewis referred to them as \\"playboys\\", and the name stuck. Lewis was the drummer, but at that time singing duties were held by guitarist Dave Walker. As the band started, Gary's mother was quietly funding the purchases of equipment, as they believed Gary's father would not have supported the band. This could explain why, even though he lived down the street from the Lewis family, producer Snuff Garrett was not aware of Gary's band until a mutual friend, conductor Les Brown, informed him that the band was playing at Disneyland and that Garrett should give them a listen. Lewis was drafted into the United States army. During his two years of service, he spent two months at the Saigon Airport during the Vietnam War, and the remainder of the time in South Korea.Cromelin, Richard. \\"Lewis: He's Not in the Army Now\\", Los Angeles Times, 14 June 1985. Retrieved 28 July 2019. ==Gary Lewis & the Playboys== Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on the Lewis name, Garrett put Lewis' band into the studio to develop, still with the finances of Lewis' mother. Garrett pushed Lewis to improve his drumming skill, even getting Buddy Rich to tutor him, and, more importantly, made Lewis the singer, and therefore the focal point of the group. By Lewis' own admission, his natural singing voice was not one of his strengths, and this led Garrett to employ vocal overdubbing tricks in the studio, to enhance it. \\"This Diamond Ring\\" hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 20, 1965, making Lewis an instant star. Lewis was Cash Box magazine's 1965 \\"Male Vocalist of the Year\\". Besides The Lovin' Spoonful, the group was the only artist during the 1960s to have its first seven Hot 100 releases each reach that chart's top 10. In addition to \\"This Diamond Ring\\", his hits include \\"Count Me In\\" (the only non-British Commonwealth record in the Hot 100's top 10 on May 8, 1965, at number two), \\"Save Your Heart for Me\\" (number two), \\"Everybody Loves a Clown\\" (number four), \\"She's Just My Style\\" (number three), \\"Sure Gonna Miss Her\\" (number nine), and \\"Green Grass\\" (number eight). Of \\"Everybody Loves a Clown\\", Lewis says he composed the song as a gift for his father's birthday. He believed the song was too good, so instead of giving it as a gift, he recorded it. By 1966, Lewis had stopped drumming altogether and was exclusively singing, replaced at drums by, among others, Jim Keltner. His career was put on hold when he entered the U.S. Army as a draftee in January 1967, and he served during the Vietnam War era and was stationed overseas with the Eighth Army in Seoul, South Korea, to 1968. Lewis has expressed that he was reluctant to go to Vietnam, but he credits the Army with being the time when he \\"grew up\\". He returned to performing and recording, but did not recapture his earlier success and five releases by the band that year peaked from 13th to 39th. His musical career was later marketed as a \\"nostalgia act\\" with appearances on his father's Labor Day telethons for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, including the 2010 telethon which was his dad's final as host. In January 2012, Lewis released a new single, \\"You Can't Go Back\\". ==Film appearances== He appeared uncredited in his father's movie The Nutty Professor (1963). He also appeared in a credited role singing \\"The Land of La- la-la\\" with his dad in Rock-A-Bye Baby (1958), where he played Jerry Lewis as a boy. He also was seen in the movie The Family Jewels (1965). ==Later life== In 1971, Lewis took a break from performing, operating a music shop in the San Fernando Valley and giving drumming lessons. A brief attempt at starting a new band called Medecine, with Billy Cowsill of the Cowsills in 1974 did not go anywhere. Lewis began touring again in the 1980s, with various incarnations of the Playboys, generally featuring no original members. On the nationally syndicated program Inside Edition, Gary got to meet his half-sister Suzan Klienman, who had learned from DNA testing results that they are related siblings, the children of comedy star Jerry Lewis. Lewis and his family reside in Rush, New York. In the summer of 2013, Lewis, along with a group of 1960s musicians including Gary Puckett (Gary Puckett & The Union Gap), Chuck Negron (formerly of Three Dog Night), Mark Lindsay (former lead singer of Paul Revere & the Raiders), and The Turtles featuring Flo & Eddie toured 47 cities in Paradise Artist's \\"Happy Together\\" tour. As of 2016, Gary Lewis and the Playboys are still touring the world on their own and occasionally with other popular 1950s, 60s, and 70s acts. The group performs on cruise ships, at casinos, festivals, fairs, and corporate events. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:Musicians from Newark, New Jersey Category:Military personnel from California Category:Military personnel from Newark, New Jersey Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American rock singers Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers Category:United States Army soldiers ","title":"Gary Lewis (musician)"},{"id":"7459326","text":"Douglas High School (DHS) is a public high school in Winston, Oregon, United States.

The club was established as \\"Villa Acassuso Football Club\\" on September 7, 1922, by a group of football enthusiasts from Villa Acassuso in San Isidro Partido. At the end of 1923 the team began to participate in the third division of Asociaci√≥n Amateurs de Football (a dissident league formed in 1919), winning the title and promoting to the upper division that same year. In 1923 the club also built its first field because of a donation by Don Ernesto de las Carreras. The field was located on M√°rquez Avenue and Haedo in San Isidro and was inaugurated on November 4. Two years later the club changed its name to \\"Club Atl√©tico Acassuso\\". The name also honored Domingo de Acassuso, founder of San Isidro partido. Acassuso obtained a place in the official Argentine Football Association league because many of the major clubs had left to form a breakaway professional league, Liga Argentina de Football. Therefore, Acassuso played in the first division, although the squad finished in the last positions before the league was disbanded in 1934. That participation was its only spell in the top division.

After playing those ponies in the 1969 Cup of the Americas he was also considered the best mounted player in Argentina as well. He was inducted into the Polo Hall of Fame in 1994. A prot√©g√© of the Basque master Pierre Etchebaster, Knox was a formidable opponent on the court tennis court. He became World Champion when he defeated Albert \\"Jack\\" Johnson at the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York in 1959. He held the title until 1969, when he retired, undefeated. ===Buffalo Sabres=== With his brother Seymour H. Knox III, he presented an application October 19, 1965 to obtain a National Hockey League expansion team in 1967, but was rebuffed. In 1968, the NHL Board of Governors rejected their agreement to move the Oakland Seals to Buffalo pending league approval. Finally, on December 2, 1969, the league announced its decision to expand to Buffalo and Vancouver for the 1970-71 season. Knox was a principal owner of the Buffalo Sabres from their foundation as a National Hockey League franchise in 1970 until a few months before his death. ===Buffalo Sports=== The Knox Brothers were the impetus behind the establishment of the Buffalo Bandits of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League in 1991 and the Buffalo Blizzard of the National Professional Soccer League in 1992. The brothers also brought their vision of a state of the art sports and entertainment complex originally named the Marine Midland Arena and now called the KeyBank Center to life. The 20,000 seat complex was completed in 1996 and is located at 1 Seymour H. Knox, III Plaza on the waterfront in downtown Buffalo. It is the home of the Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bandits as well as the former home of the Buffalo Blizzard and Buffalo Destroyers of the Arena Football League. ==Personal life== In 1950, Knox was married to Lucetta Gilbert Crisp, whom he met while wintering in Aiken, South Carolina. She was the daughter of Van Devanter Crisp and Martha Crisp (n√©e Ottley), of 33 East 77th Street in New York City, and the granddaughter of James H. Ottley of New York City and Glen Cove, Long Island. was educated at the Garrison Forest School in Owings Mills, Maryland and Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. Together, they had two children: * Linda Knox McLean (b. 1951), who was married Arthur Albert Schmon II of Vancouver, British Columbia until their divorce. * Northrup Rand Knox Jr. (b. 1954), who married Victoria A. Beers in 1992. He died on July 23, 1998, in East Aurora, New York. Northrup's wife Lucetta died on October 12, 2008, after a long illness. ==Legacy== The Knox brothers, who brought major league hockey to Buffalo, were inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1992 and into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame in 1996. Northrup Knox was survived by his daughter, Linda Knox McLean, a son, Northrup R Knox Jr and five grandchildren, Richard, Lisa, and Arthur Schmon, Charles Rigby Knox and Northrup Knox III. ==See also== *Buffalo Sabres *List of real tennis world champions *Knox Farm State Park *Aiken Tennis Club *Real tennis *Buffalo Memorial Auditorium ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Sports Illustrated: School of Hard Knox * Knox Family of Buffalo, NY * Polo Hall of Fame * Obituaries: Northrup R.

La Pointe du Chay is a limestone promontory, about 5 kilometres from La Rochelle, France, between the seafront of Aytr√© and Angoulins. La Pointe du Chay is composed of layers of limestone dating back to the Sequanian stage (upper Oxfordian stage) of the Jurassic period (circa 160 million years ago), when a large part of France was submerged. These rocks were formed by the accumulation of organisms falling on the seabed, where they solidified. This happened at the time dinosaurs were roaming the earth. Many of these layers are especially visible and easily accessible at La Pointe du Chay, in which are encapsulated many small marine fossils. Layers of thick white rocks, formed during period of relatively warm seas, alternate with highly friable layers containing sands and remains of mud, formed during colder periods, and with layers containing various corals, that were formed during warmer, tropical times.Source: La Rochelle tourist information boards at the \\"Pointe du Chay\\" Liliocrinus polydactylus, from La Pointe du Chay.

It was opened in 1869 within buildings in Bean Road, several hundred yards east of Dudley town centre. It expanded in 1970 to take in the buildings of Rosland Secondary School, Beechwood Road, at nearby Kates Hill, but the Bean Road site was still used for some lessons until 1981, when it was finally declared redundant after 112 years and sold to make way for a residential development. The site at Beechwood Road had been built in 1932. Perhaps its most famous pupil was British comedian Lenny Henry, who attended from 1969 until 1974. Robert Hawthorne, the Sky Sports TV commentator, was also a pupil from 1977 to 1981. The school traditionally had an entry age of 11 years, but in September 1972 it was redesignated as a 12-16 school (gaining comprehensive status three years later) and this age range remained in place until the school's closure. The Blue Coat School finally closed in July 1989 when it merged with The Dudley School to form Castle High School, although the Blue Coat buildings remained in use for the 1989/90 academic year to accommodate the oldest two year groups who had previously been at Blue Coat. By the time the Blue Coat as a separate school closed its doors for the last time on 14 July 1989, just 334 pupils were on the roll (averaging at 83 or 84 pupils per year group) and the closure was deemed necessary as it was too small for modern secondary school standards and the site was too confined for any substantial expansion; the re-opening of Dudley secondary schools to 11-year- olds in September 1990 would have created further difficulties in accommodating extra pupils at the school. The doors closed to pupils for the last time in July 1990, when the oldest year group finished their secondary education and the year group below transferred to the main Castle High site for the final year of their secondary education. In December 1985, Dudley council had considered creating a new school called the Ednam School by a merger between the Dudley School and at least one other smaller secondary school in the town - and the Blue Coat School had been one of the schools mentioned in these plans. However, by the time the 1988/89 academic year began, Blue Coat's future was still uncertain and there was even a suggestion that it could merge with Sir Gilbert Claughton School. However, it was decided in October 1988 that Blue Coat and Dudley School would merge to form a new school to be concentrated at the Dudley School site. The buildings at Beechwood Road were reutilised in 1991 as the base of St Thomas's Community Network, which closed in September 2015 and were demolished just over a year later. New houses are expected to be built on the site.

He currently works as a scout for Swansea City. Tremmel played in the Premier League, Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. He was renowned for his shot stopping abilities and his reflexes. Tremmel holds a number of goalkeeping records. At a rate of 4.2, he had the best saves per goal conceded ratio in the Premier League for the 2012‚Äì13 season. He also had the best save percentage in the Premier League that season, at 80.9%. His saves-to-shots ratio in the Premier League and on a European basis made him second only to Manuel Neuer of Bayern Munich. ==Playing careerEarly career=== Tremmel's previous clubs include Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, where he spent three years as a youth, before joining SpVgg Unterhaching where he made his senior debut. Tremmel left Bavaria in 2002 for spells at Hannover 96 then Hertha BSC, where he spent 2004‚Äì05 in the reserve side. He then joined Energie Cottbus in 2006 on a two- year contract, announcing his intention to leave the club on 29 April 2010. On 7 May 2010, his transfer to Hertha for the upcoming season was confirmed, but the transfer failed and he signed for Red Bull Salzburg instead on 20 May 2010. Tremmel playing for Red Bull Salzburg in 2011 ===Swansea City=== Tremmel joined Swansea City on 30 August 2011 on a free transfer following their promotion to the Premier League. Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers had brought Tremmel to South Wales and signed him after his impressive pre-season performances against Celtic and Real Betis. Tremmel made his competitive debut for Swansea on 7 January 2012 in an FA Cup fixture at Barnsley, helping his team to a 2‚Äì4 away win. He made his Premier League debut on 26 February 2012 in a 2‚Äì0 away loss against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Tremmel made his fourth appearance for Swansea, and his first in the 2012‚Äì13 season, in a 3‚Äì1 win against Barnsley in the League Cup. Following an injury suffered by first choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm on 27 October 2012, Tremmel started to have a run of games in the Swansea team for the first time. Swansea, now with Tremmel in the side, went on a seven-match unbeaten run that included memorable away wins at Liverpool in the League Cup, and Newcastle United and Arsenal in the Premier League. He also managed to keep clean sheets against the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. These performances were met with praise from then-manager Michael Laudrup, who said, \\"Gerhard has done well and it is very important to know you have a goalkeeper of quality when things happen.\\" On 7 February 2013, Swansea announced that they had extended their contract with the Bavarian until the summer of 2015. On 24 February 2013, Tremmel helped Swansea beat Bradford City 5‚Äì0 to win the 2012‚Äì13 League Cup by the competition's highest-ever winning margin for the final. This achievement landed Swansea's first major trophy as well as qualification for the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Europa League. German mass tabloid Bild hailed Tremmel's \\"career highlight\\" at the \\"legendary\\" Wembley Stadium and a just reward for 15 years of hard work and professionalism in the game. On 28 May 2015, Tremmel confirmed that he would not be renewing his contract with Swansea and would therefore be released by the club. On 11 August, however, he re-joined the side, signing a two-year contract to keep him at the club until June 2017. On 22 May 2017, the club announced his release along with seven other players after he had only appeared in the EFL Trophy during the 2016‚Äì17 season. ===Werder Bremen=== Tremmel was loaned out to Werder Bremen, in his native Germany, on 28 January 2016. ==Post-playing career== Following his release by Swansea City at the end of 2016‚Äì17 season, Tremmel took up the position of a scout for the club. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals - rowspan=4SpVgg Unterhaching 1999‚Äì2000 Bundesliga 7000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî70 - 2000‚Äì01 Bundesliga 32010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî330 - 2001‚Äì02 2.

The southern terminus is at U.S. Route 22 (US 22) north of Bethlehem in Hanover Township. The northern terminus is at PA 611 in Upper Mount Bethel Township. The route heads north from US 22 to Bath, where it intersects PA 248. From here, PA 512 continues northeast and intersects PA 946 in Moorestown before it reaches an interchange with the PA 33 freeway in Wind Gap. The route heads east through the northern Northampton County boroughs of Wind Gap, Pen Argyl, Bangor, and East Bangor, intersecting PA 191 in Bangor. Past here, PA 512 continues east to PA 611. PA 512 was originally designated by 1928 to run from PA 12 (now PA 191) in Hecktown north to PA 12 in Wind Gap. In the 1930s, the southern terminus was realigned to US 22/PA 12 at Center Street and Elizabeth Avenue in Bethlehem, with PA 946 replacing the route between Hecktown and Moorestown. The road between Wind Gap and Bangor was originally designated PA 202 in 1928 before being renumbered to PA 702 in 1935 to avoid conflict with US 202. The section of road between Bangor and Mount Bethel was originally designated part of US 611 in 1926 before becoming part of PA 712 in the 1930s following the relocation of US 611 to the east. The PA 702 and PA 712 designations were both removed in the 1940s. By 1976, PA 512 was extended north to its current terminus along the former alignments of PA 702 and PA 712. Also, the southern terminus was cut back to its current location. ==Route description== PA 512 in Pen Argyl PA 512 begins at an interchange with the US 22 freeway in Hanover Township in Northampton County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, heading north on four-lane divided Bath Pike. South of this interchange, Bath Pike continues towards the city of Bethlehem, where it becomes Center Street. From the US 22 interchange, the route runs north through commercial areas with some residential development, becoming an undivided road. The road heads into East Allen Township and narrows to two lanes, continuing through agricultural areas with some homes as Beth-Bath Pike. PA 512 crosses the Monocacy Creek and Norfolk Southern's Cement Secondary, passing through the community of Clyde. Farther north, the route runs through commercial areas to the east of a cement plant before it enters the borough of Bath upon crossing the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks again. At this point, the road becomes South Walnut Street and passes businesses before it becomes lined with homes. PA 512 intersects Main Street in the commercial center of Bath and becomes North Walnut Street, soon reaching a junction with PA 248, which provides access to PA 329 and PA 987 a short distance to the west. The route continues through residential areas with some businesses in the northern part of the borough as a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. PA 512 leaves Bath and becomes Moorestown Drive, briefly passing through East Allen Township before it continues into Moore Township. The road narrows to two lanes and runs through a mix of farms, woods, and residences, passing to the east of a golf course and serving the community of Chapman Quarries. The route curves northeast and continues through rural areas with some residential subdivisions before it reaches an intersection with PA 946 in the community of Moorestown. PA 512 continues through rural areas with homes and crosses into Bushkill Township, where the name changes to Moorestown Road. The road continues northeast through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes, crossing Bushkill Creek and passing through the community of Clearfield. Farther northeast, the route enters Plainfield Township and passes through commercial areas before it reaches an interchange with the PA 33 freeway, where the route is briefly a four-lane divided highway. Past this interchange, PA 512 narrows to two lanes and intersects Sullivan Trail, at which point it turns north and enters the borough of Wind Gap. The route becomes South Broadway, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes businesses. Farther north, the road narrows to two lanes and passes homes along with a few businesses, becoming North Broadway at the Center Street intersection. A block later, PA 512 turns east onto Park Avenue for a block before it heads northeast along North Lehigh Avenue, passing residences. The route heads out of Wind Gap and crosses back into Plainfield Township, where it becomes Pennsylvania Avenue and heads through forested areas with some residential, commercial, and industrial development. The road enters the borough of Pen Argyl as West Pennsylvania Avenue and is lined with homes along with a few businesses, becoming East Pennsylvania Avenue at the Robinson Avenue intersection. PA 512 turns north onto East Main Street and curves northeast past a mix of homes and businesses. The route heads east onto Blue Valley Drive and leaves Pen Argyl for Plainfield Township, where it heads northeast through the community of West Bangor. The road enters Washington Township and runs southeast through commercial areas. PA 512 continues east and heads into the borough of Bangor, where it becomes Market Street and is lined with homes. In the commercial downtown, the route crosses PA 191 and Martins Creek before it turns south on Main Street for a block and then northeast along Erdman Street, crossing Norfolk Southern's Portland Secondary. PA 512 heads northeast along Bill Scott Boulevard through forested areas with some developments, running along the east side of the railroad tracks. The road enters the borough of East Bangor and heads east into residential areas as West Central Avenue. The route crosses Broad Street and becomes East Central Avenue, passing more homes. PA 512 turns northeast and enters Upper Mount Bethel Township, where it becomes Mt. Bethel Highway and runs through wooded areas with some farm fields and development. The route heads east and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 611. ==History== When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 512 was legislated as part of Legislative Route 165 between Wind Gap and Bangor and Legislative Route 166 between Bangor and Upper Mount Bethel Township. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, the section of paved road between Bangor and Mount Bethel was designated as part of US 611, which ran concurrent with PA 2. The road between Wind Gap and Bangor was also a paved road. By 1928, the roadway between Bethlehem and Bath existed as a paved road. PA 512 was first designated in 1928 to run from PA 12 (now PA 191) in Hecktown north to PA 12 (Sullivan Trail) in Wind Gap, heading north to Moorestown before continuing northeast along its current alignment to Wind Gap. At this time, the entire length of PA 512 was unpaved, with the portion of road between PA 12 and PA 45 (now PA 248) under construction. In 1928, PA 202 was designated to run from PA 12 (Broadway) in Wind Gap east to US 611 (Main Street) in Bangor along a paved road. Also, the concurrent PA 2 designation was removed from US 611 by this time. In the 1930s, PA 512 was realigned at Moorestown to head south to US 22/PA 12 (Elizabeth Avenue) in Bethlehem, following its current alignment south and entering Bethlehem on Center Street. A portion of PA 946 was designated on the former alignment of PA 512 between Hecktown and Moorestown. By this time, the entire route was paved. PA 202 was renumbered to PA 702 in April 1935 in order to avoid duplication with US 202, which was designated in Pennsylvania in 1934. Also, the portion of road between Bangor and Mount Bethel became the northern segment of PA 712 following the rerouting of US 611 to a different alignment to the east. The PA 702 and PA 712 designations were decommissioned in the 1940s. By 1976, the northern terminus of PA 512 was extended from Wind Gap east to PA 611, following the former sections of PA 702 and PA 712.

Wolfe is hired to exonerate the suspect, but finds that no one else has either an adequate motive or the requisite opportunity. Gambit employs three distinctive plot elements found in other Wolfe stories. The means by which poison is administered is very similar to the means used in \\"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\\". A tape recording is made in an Italian restaurant, one which also appears in \\"Poison √† la Carte\\". And the part that a gambit plays in a murder echoes \\"Method Three for Murder\\". ==Plot summary== Collins Crime Club released the British first edition in 1963, with a dustjacket design attributed to John Rose Sally Blount's father, Matthew Blount, has been arrested for the murder of Paul Jerin, a chess master. Blount had arranged for Jerin to play twelve simultaneous games of blindfold chess at his club. Well into the contest, Jerin complains of physical discomfort and cannot continue. Shortly thereafter, Jerin dies of what tests show to be arsenic poisoning. During the contest, Jerin had been sitting by himself in a small library off the chess club's main game room. He had nothing to eat or drink except a pot of hot chocolate, brought to him by Blount. After Jerin fell ill, he was diagnosed by a doctor who was playing in the contest; the doctor called for an ambulance but Jerin died at a hospital. Not only had Blount brought the hot chocolate to Jerin, he had washed out the pot and the cup after Jerin complained that he didn't feel well. Blount is charged with murder. The only people to enter the library where Jerin sat, other than Blount, were four messengers, who relayed the moves between the main game room and the library. The messengers apparently had no good opportunity to put arsenic in Jerin's chocolate. Dan Kalmus is Blount's corporate lawyer, and represents Blount after he has been jailed without bail. Blount's daughter Sally is convinced, however, that Kalmus is in love with Blount's wife Anna, and that he won't be inclined to give Blount his best legal efforts. Furthermore, Kalmus' specialty is business law, not criminal law, and he might not have the needed background. But Sally is certain that her father is innocent, so she hires a reluctant Wolfe to investigate on her father's behalf. Neither Wolfe nor Archie seems to have his heart in the case because the circumstances point so clearly at Blount. And Wolfe learns from the police that their own inquiries discovered no connection between the messengers and Jerin, whereas Blount was unhappy that Jerin had been seeing Sally. Because none of the messengers could have a motive to kill Jerin, and because he has assumed that Sally is correct that her father didn't, Wolfe conjectures that Jerin was poisoned not because the murderer had it in for Jerin, but to get at Blount, whose apparent motive would surely get him arrested. Wolfe's hypothesis, then, is that Jerin was a pawn, sacrificed in a gambit to get rid of Blount. Wolfe speaks with each of the messengers as the best alternative suspects, to try to determine which of them might have wanted Blount, not Jerin, out of the way. Each of the four has a possible motive: Sally thinks Kalmus is in love with her mother, Farrow would like to take over Blount's firm, Yerkes wants Blount's vote in a board election but won't get it, and Hausman resents Blount for going easy on him in chess games but winning anyway. Wolfe learns that there is, in Blount's words, \\"a certain fact\\" known only to Blount and to Kalmus that will demonstrate his innocence. The fact turns out to be that Blount really did put something in Jerin's chocolate, but it was sedative in effect, not poisonous. This puts a very different face on things, and as a result Wolfe and Archie, independently, are able to infer both the murderer's identity and how the arsenic got into Jerin. ==The unfamiliar word== In most Nero Wolfe novels and novellas, there is at least one unfamiliar word, usually spoken by Wolfe. Gambit contains these three (the page references are to the Bantam edition): *Trimmer. Page 71, at the beginning of Chapter 8. This word, with this meaning, also appears in Champagne for One. *Analeptic. Page 125, halfway through Chapter 12. *Contemned. Page 154, next-to-last page of the book. This word also appears in Prisoner's Base. ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe ‚Äî The private investigator *Archie Goodwin ‚Äî Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories) *Matthew Blount ‚Äî Wealthy businessman, in jail on a charge of murder *Sally Blount ‚Äî Daughter of Matthew Blount, and Wolfe's client *Anna Blount ‚Äî Wife of Matthew Blount *Dan Kalmus ‚Äî Matthew Blount's lawyer, messenger at chess contest *Charles Yerkes ‚Äî Banker, business acquaintance of Blount, messenger at chess contest *Morton Farrow ‚Äî Sales manager at Blount's company, Anna Blount's nephew, messenger at chess contest *Ernst Hausman ‚Äî Retired broker, Sally Blount's godfather, messenger at chess contest *Victor Avery ‚Äî The Blounts' family doctor, participant in chess contest ==The peripatetic Piotti== In Gambit, Piotti's restaurant is located on 13th Street, east of Second Avenue (of course, in Manhattan).Page 135, end of chapter 13. In \\"Poison √† la Carte\\", published two years earlier, the restaurant is on 14th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, thus west of Second Avenue.Page 62, start of chapter 8. Stout was not known for consistency in minor plot matters. ==Chess allusions== There is a description, in Chapter 3, of the interior of the Gambit chess club. \\"In a corner was a chess table with a marble top, with yellow and brown marble for the squares, and the men spread around, not on their home squares. The Gazette had said that the men were of ivory and Kokcha lapis lazuli and they and the table had belonged to and been played with by Louis XIV, and that the men were kept in the position after the ninth moveIn which Morphy sacrifices his own Queen in order to allow his Rook to then checkmate his opponents' King. of Paul Morphy's most famous game, his defeat of the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard in Paris in 1858,\\" In the same chapter, Archie Goodwin tried to guess the next moves of a game that he was watching. After failing every time, he \\"conceded that I would never be a Botvinnik‚Ä¶.\\" In Chapter 7, Morton Farrow says, \\"I'm all right the first three or four moves, any opening from the Ruy Lopez to the Caro-Kann, but I soon get lost. My uncle got me started at it because he thinks it develops the brain. I'm not so sure. Look at Bobby Fischer, the American champion. Has he got a brain?\\" Dr. Victor Avery, in Chapter 8, claimed that he didn't hear any conversations during a chess game because he \\"was concentrating on my reply. I was trying the Albin Counter Gambit. Houghteling had used it against Dodge in 1905Actually, the game was played in 1904. and had mated him on the sixteenth move.\\" ==Trivia== Throughout the story, one of Wolfe's diversions is the reading of Robert Ardrey's African Genesis. This book promulgated the Killer ape theory which claims that humans are naturally murderous. ==Reviews and commentary== * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime ‚Äî There is more detection in this story than in any other of the mulling-and- quizzing sort; here we really see Nero Wolfe's thoughts whirring. Moreover, Archie is in excellent form, and although a chess tournament is a feature, the game itself is not. The great scene is that in which Nero reads and burns the pages of Webster's Dictionary, Third Edition.Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. * Nancy Pearl, Book Lust ‚Äî When Stout is on top of his game, which is most of the time, his diabolically clever plotting and his storytelling ability exceed that of any other mystery writer you can name, including Agatha Christie, who invented her own eccentric genius detective Hercule Poirot. Although in the years since Stout's death I find myself going back and rereading his entire oeuvre every year or two, I return with particular pleasure to these five novels: The Doorbell Rang; Plot It Yourself; Murder by the Book; Champagne for One; and Gambit.Pearl, Nancy, Book Lust: Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment, and Reason (Seattle, Washington: Sasquatch Books, 2003, ); p. 226 ==AdaptationsNero Wolfe (Radiotelevisione italiana S.p.A.) === Sfida al cioccolato (1971) Gambit was adapted for a series of Nero Wolfe films produced by the Italian television network RAI.

However, he was asked to play early in that season but got injured in his first match for the team.

Approximately in length, it was extensively sculptured by glaciers in previous ice ages. Remote, scenic, and ecologically diverse, it is protected in both the Ruby Mountains Wilderness Area and the Seitz-Echo Research Natural Area. The main branch of Seitz Canyon begins at the summit of Mt. Silliman, at an elevation of . This high ridge also includes Mt. Gilbert at , and an unnamed peak at . The canyon then drops to the north as a spectacular headwall of over to a nearly level basin that includes Seitz Lake. It is here that the greatest evidence for glacial sculpturing can be found. The canyon shows a classic U-shaped cross section, and many patches of bare granite still retain the dark patina and striations caused by direct contact with the lower surface of the glacier that once filled this valley. From Seitz Lake the canyon makes a more gradual descent to its middle section , an area that includes a dense stand of aspen trees and beaver ponds. It then descends again to its large lower section , which includes an open forest of aspen and white fir trees, sagebrush flats, and the junction with the south branch of the canyon. Towering above are granite cliffs and pinnacles. Like its neighbor to the north, Lamoille Canyon, Seitz Canyon is branched. The southern fork begins at the highest point of the range, the north face of Ruby Dome . Nearby are two other tall peaks known locally as Ruby Pyramid and Seitz Peak. The canyon descends steeply in four steps before merging with the main branch of the canyon. This southern branch of the canyon may have once drained into the adjacent smaller valley of Thompson Creek. By this theory, early glaciers were able to break through the narrow ridge separating the canyons, and subsequently flow into the deeper main branch of Seitz Canyon. The result is that Thompson Creek is now a 'reverse' hanging valley, with its source perched up the wall of Seitz Canyon. This merger also led to a large area of exposed granite at the bottom of Seitz Canyon, and a steep cascade of the stream nearly long. The merger of the two branches of Seitz Canyon forms Rabbit Creek, which drains into Pleasant Valley and then meanders across Lamoille Valley before merging with the Humboldt River near the community of Halleck. As the stream exits the range, it passes the last unusual feature of Seitz Canyon, the best examples of lateral moraines in the Ruby Mountains. These ridges were formed as the glaciers dropped the rocks they had scraped from higher slopes. The moraines show the curve the glaciers took as they exited the confines of the rocky canyon, and exhibit multiple secondary ridges produced as the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. The canyon (and the lake within it) was named after brothers George and Edward Seitz, who were early ranchers in Pleasant Valley. George eventually left the area, but Ed Seitz became the sheriff of Elko County in 1869. == Gallery == File:SeitzLakeNV.jpgThe headwall of Seitz Canyon, and Seitz Lake, looking south File:SeitzStriations.jpgGlacial striations, patina, and sculptured granite near Seitz Lake File:RubyDomeNV.jpgRuby Dome, looking up the south fork of Seitz Canyon File:SeitzMoraines.jpgLateral moraines at the mouth of Seitz Canyon ==External links== *Seitz-Echo Research Natural Area *Scientific Description of Ruby Mountains (PDF) Category:Ruby Mountains Category:Canyons and gorges of Nevada Category:Landforms of Elko County, Nevada ","title":"Seitz Canyon"},{"id":"7459463","text":"Donakonda Airport is located at Donakonda in Andhra Pradesh, India.

Powell Library is also known as the College Library. It was constructed from 1926 to 1929 and was one of the original four buildings that comprised the UCLA campus in the early period of the university's life. Its Romanesque Revival architecture design, its historic value and its popularity with students make it one of the defining images of UCLA. ==Style== Like the building facing it across the quad, Royce Hall, the building's exterior is modeled after Milan's Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. The entrance of the library is adorned with several mosaics, one of which depicts two men holding a book bearing the phrase, from Cicero's Pro Archia Poeta, \\"Haec studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant\\" (\\"These studies nourish youth and delight old age\\"), an appropriate dictum for the vast collection for undergraduate students. There are also Renaissance Printers' Marks on the ceiling. ==History== The library is named for Lawrence Clark Powell, the University Librarian at UCLA from 1944 to 1961 and Dean of the Graduate School of Library Service from 1960 to 1966. It is part of the extensive UCLA Library system. The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, as GSLS was later known, was housed for many years in the southwestern corner of the top floor. During this period the building also contained a separate unit of the campus library system devoted to education and psychology, which was later closed and its collection distributed among the other campus libraries. In 1951, author Ray Bradbury wrote an early draft of his classic novel Fahrenheit 451 in Powell Library using typewriters that were then available for rent.https://www.usnews.com/science/news/articles/2012/06/06/ray-bradbury- author-of-fahrenheit-451-dies Students at UCLA have affectionately called this library \\"Club Powell\\" because it has a reputation for being louder than most libraries.http://www.yelp.com/biz/ucla-powell-library-los-angeles Others explain that it is because this library has a room called Night Powell that is open 24/7 beginning on third week. Currently, the whole library is open 24/7 during tenth and finals week. The Inquiry Desk staff provides fruit and coffee during this stressful time. Powell hosts de-stressor programs during tenth and finals week, which include bringing therapy dogs, origami stations, and meditation. Located in the second floor Rotunda, this UCLA library often hosts events. Past events include the Edible Book Festival, Silent Disco, Video Game Orchestra, and International Games Day. ==Services== The Hoover Collection is a digital collection of photos from the late 1920s to 1950s that features Powell Library, Royce Hall, and the construction of Janss Steps.http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz000006bd Powell Library is part of the \\"Ask A Librarian\\" service, where people can chat with a University of California librarian 24/7. ==See also== *Royce Hall *UCLA Library *Maine East High School ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Library buildings completed in 1929 Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States Category:University of California, Los Angeles buildings and structures Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in California Category:Libraries in Los Angeles ","title":"Powell Library"},{"id":"7459473","text":"Goi√°s is a Native Brazilian name, used by unspecified tribesmen to refer to themselves, derived from gua i√°, \\"one like us\\".

The lead ship in her class, she was the third United States naval vessel named for the Shenandoah River which runs through Virginia and West Virginia. The third Shenandoah was laid down on 16 September 1944 by Todd Pacific Shipyards, Inc. of Tacoma, Washington, launched on 29 March 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Daniel Hunt, and commissioned on 13 August 1945 with Captain Albert C. Burrows in command. ==Service history== Shenandoah completed her fitting out in December and sailed to the East Coast via the Panama Canal, where she reported for duty with Destroyer Force, United States Atlantic Fleet in January 1946. Until June 1947 she tended destroyers in various east coast ports, primarily at Norfolk, Virginia, her home port. The tender deployed on her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet from June through August 1947. In the next 20 years, she was assigned 13 more tours in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1958, she was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal service in Lebanon. Shenandoahs most publicized tour of duty was in 1964. She won international acclaim for her heroic rescue of the crew of the Dutch merchant ship Doris. The freighter broke loose from her moorings during the height of a storm and became impaled upon the rocks of Molo San Vincenzo in Naples outer harbor. A line was run to the freighter by the crew of the Shenandoah, and all aboard were rescued minutes before Doris rolled over and sank. The destroyer tender also won recognition in 1965 for her repairs to the bow of the aircraft carrier which had collided with a destroyer during maneuvers. Shenandoah was awarded the Battle Efficiency Pennant for her competence in destroyer tending in 1952 and 1956 and the Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1970.

She returned to her home port on 15 December 1973 and into July 1974 was tending ships on the East Coast. Shenandoah was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk, and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register on 1 April 1980.

His racing career started in 1981 aboard a Suzuki TM75 in a local Junior Motocross Championship before eventually moving onto road racing in 1985. He won Malaysia's Superbike championship in 1991. In 1993 he raced a Harris machine in the 500 cc World Championship before joining the Suzuki factory racing team in the 250 class for the latter part of the season. He did not enjoy this, feeling he was too large for the bikes.www.motorcycle.com ==World Superbike== For 1994 he joined countryman Aaron Slight on a semi-works Rumi Honda RC45 in the Superbike World Championship. After coming 5th overall in 1994, he started the 1995 season with Rumi Honda before replacing Doug Polen as the second factory rider alongside Aaron Slight, although they raced under different liveries. The bike gradually became more competitive, and Simon was strong in later part of 1995, coming 2nd in race 1 at Assen. He then spent 2 years with the Kawasaki racing team, scoring only one podium during the 1996 season finishing in 7th position. In 1997 he took two 2nd places and five 3rd places in addition to one Pole position and fastest lap to again finish 5th overall. In total he scored 10 podiums - four 2nds and six 3rds but, no wins in the series.Simon Crafar career statistics in WSBK He returned to World Superbike for 2000 as a substitute rider for Aaron Slight for two rounds. In 2002 he raced in British Superbike for the Virgin Mobile Yamaha team, coming 8th overall with two 3rd place finishes. He retired from motorcycle racing at the end of the 2002 season to spend more time with his wife and children and continues to live in Andorra to this date. ==500 GP== In 1998, Crafar rode a WCM Yamaha YZR500 in the 500cc world championship, winning the British Grand Prix at Donington Park (the last win for Dunlop in a dry race and the only non Honda win during the 1998 season and at Donington Park in 6 years), and finishing 7th in the standings, scoring two further podiums - one 2nd and one 3rd during the season with two fastest race laps - Donington Park and Phillip Island. He remained with the team for the early part of 1999, scoring points on 5 occasions. The WCM team changed to Michelin between seasons and Crafar found he could not replicate the same level of success as he had the previous year on Dunlop tyres and they parted company midway through the 1999 season. Crafar also took 10th on a one off ride on an MuZ at Donington Park during the same year. In total he has contested 25 500cc races and 7 250cc races, taking 3 podium finishes. ==Extreme Enduro== Following his retirement from road racing, Crafar continued to enjoy Extreme Enduro competing in the Red Bull Romaniacs competition held in Romania winning the Expert Class during 2007. During 2008 and 2009 Crafar worked with the organisers of the Red Bull Romaniacs competition assisting in the design and mapping of the course sections. During 2009 he was involved in a serious accident with a car whilst planning for the 2009 event that resulted in a broken back. Crafar underwent a successful operation to insert a metal plate and screws into his back.Simon Crafar seriously injured ==On Circuit Instruction== Since 2006 Crafar has been involved in on-circuit rider instruction for both track day riders and professional racers and has personally taught over 600 people on a one-to-one basis in a little over six years. Utilising his experience from competing and racing in World Championships throughout a 13 year career, Crafar uses simple, logical techniques that are very effective in allowing riders to improve their lap times in a safe and controlled manner. It was this approach to instruction that lead the organisers of the European Junior Cupwww.europeanjuniorcup.com a race series held at the WSBK championship rounds across Europe for 14- to 19-year-old riders) to approach Crafar to become the mentor and series instructor to the young racers aged 14‚Äì19 for the 2011 Championship, a position he held for the 2012 Championship. Crafar Heads up European Junior Cup Crafar is involved in one-to-one rider instruction throughout Europe. ==Motovudu Dark Art of Performance== During the latter part of 2011 Simon Crafar launched Motovudu - Dark Art of Performance, a book and DVD series that is an instructional guide to riding faster on-circuit. Filmed at the MotoGP circuit Motorland Aragon in Northern Spain by Banter MediaBanter MediaBrit GP Winner Makes Bike Training DVD and directed by Liam Andrew Wright, both the book and the film draw from Crafar's previous experiences, both racing and instructional and is designed to teach any rider how they can ride fast and stay away from unnecessary risks. == MotoGP Commentator == In 2018, Simon Crafar took on the new role of pitlane reporter for Dorna covering all the races for MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 going out on the world feed. He also does an onboard lap before each race discussing each circuit.

He grew up there and in Aurora. He worked as a bank clerk at the Bank of Toronto and as a salesman for the Red Rose Tea Company. ===Career=== Chadburn applied to enlist in both the Army and Navy in 1939, but was turned down both times. After a spell working for General Motors and with the Bank of Toronto, he was accepted by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as an Air Gunner in April 1940, but re-mastered as a Pilot. He graduated from the Number 2 Flight Training School in Ottawa on 9 October 1940 as a Pilot Officer. In December 1940 Chadburn was posted to Number 112 (Army Cooperation) Squadron flying Hawker Hurricanes and made his first operational flight in March 1941. He was posted to the United Kingdom in 1941, and joined 412 Squadron (RCAF) in June 1941, moving to 19 Squadron (RAF) in September. In February 1942 Chadburn was posted to Number 416 (RCAF) Squadron in Peterhead, Scotland as a Flight Lieutenant. Days later he took over command of the squadron, becoming the first graduate of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan to lead a Fighter Command squadron. He was also the youngest Squadron Leader in the RCAF at the age of 21. Promoted to squadron leader, Chadburn and 416 Squadron flew defensive missions over Dieppe on 19 August 1942, covering the Canadian and Allied raid and claiming his first air victories. He was then awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. After a period of leave in Canada, he was posted to No. 402 Squadron and then No. 403 Squadron, prior to his promotion to Wing Commander for the RAF Digby Wing in June 1943. He led the Wing in flying escort to American bombers and the RAF medium bombers of No. 2 Group. He was supposedly dubbed The Angel for his escort would assure the bomber crews a safe passage to and from the target. On 3 November 1943 the Wing claimed seven Bf 109's of II./JG 3 (five were actually lost), with Chadburn claiming two personally. By the time Chadburn left the Digby Wing in December he had received the Distinguished Service Order twice, the first RCAF officer to be so decorated and was one of only four in history. In early 1944, he was appointed Wing Commander, Fighter Operations at RCAF Group Headquarters Overseas. He was sent back to Canada for a War Bond drive in the spring and upon his return was made wing commander of Number 127 Wing RCAF, comprising 403, 421 and 416 Squadrons. ===Death=== On 13 June 1944, Chadburn was killed in a mid-air collision with another Spitfire pilot while taking off from a landing strip in Normandy. He was 24 years of age. ===Honours=== Chadburn's record includes five enemy airplanes destroyed (three shared), five aircraft probably destroyed (one shared), seven aircraft damaged (two shared), two E-boats destroyed, and another two damaged, as well as a destroyer damaged.'Aces High'- Shores & Williams, page 169 Chadburn was made a Chevalier (knight) in the French L√©gion d'honneur and awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme. Only three RCAF officers received the L√©gion d'honneur, and Chadburn was the only one to receive the Croix de Guerre.

A total of eighteen antibiotics were isolated in Waksman's laboratory at the New Jersey Agriculture Experimental Station at Rutgers University. Of these, streptomycin and neomycin, and actinomycin were commercialized. Streptomycin, in particular, was the first antibiotic to cure tuberculosis. Waksman used half of his personal royalties from patents for streptomycin to create the Foundation for Microbiology in 1951. The Foundation is a private organization that funds and supports microbiology research. He requested money from the Foundation to create the Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers. The idea for an institute that focused on soil science first came from Waksman's mentor, Dr. Jacob Lipman, who taught Waksman when he was an undergraduate student and later became his colleague.

These birds are monogamous. The female usually lays between three and five pale green eggs with red speckles. It nests in tree holes, usually in tree holes that woodpeckers have left. The nest is made from leaves, roots and other vegetation. Entire family groups cooperate in raising young by gathering food and nesting materials. ===Feeding=== In contrast to other brilliant starlings, which feed mainly on fruits, their diet consists mainly of insects and termites. Adult birds catch insects in flight and dig up termite mounds to find prey.\\"Golden-Breasted Starling Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo\\" Snails, spiders, crustaceans, or small vertebrates, such as lizards, sometimes integrates the diet. ==Bibliography== *Bryan Richard: V√∂gel.

As a result, many roads in the area are named in honour of parliamentary figures from that era and afterwards; these include Oliver Cromwell (Oliver Close and Cromwell Street) and Robert Peel (Peel Street). It is believed that from Cromwell Street, parliamentary leader Oliver Cromwell fired his cannons at the royalist garrison that was Dudley's Norman Castle. Kates Hill was not developed as a residential area until around the 1830s, when a large number of houses were built to accommodate people moving to the Black Country in hope of landing jobs in the ever-growing number of factories and coalpits that were being created in the region at this time. In 1840, St John's Parish Church was opened and an adjoining church school was built soon afterwards to serve the growing community. Despite hundreds of houses being built around St John's Church during the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, as recently as World War II, Kates Hill was surrounded by a substantial amount of farmland. There is still standing a historic grade II listed farm house, dating from the 17th century, at the top of Watsons Green Road; it is now solely a residential property as its farmland has long since been built on. High View Street, Kates Hill This largely rural scene disappeared after 1915, as hundreds of council houses were built in the Watson's Green Road, Highfield Road, Corporation Road and Bunns Lane areas to accommodate families who were being rehoused. These included the very first council houses to be built in Dudley, built on the Brewery Fields Estate, land which was purchased by the council in 1915 and which was completed by 1918 consisting of more than 300 houses. Most of the roads on this development were named after British heroes of the Great War; these include Kitchener Road (Herbert Kitchener), Cavell Road (Edith Cavell) and Haig Road (Douglas Haig). More houses were built in Watson's Green Road, Bridgewater Crescent and on the eastern side of Bunns Lane in the mid 1920s. Wolverton Road and the western section of Corporation Road were added at the beginning of the 1930s, and the Rosland estate which includes Green Park Road and Lupin Road was added in the late 1930s. Some of the oldest houses on Kates Hill were demolished in the late 1930s, and by 1978 almost all of the 19th century houses in the area to the east of St John's Road had been demolished. The Rosland Estate was expanded in the late 1970s when several houses, along with warden-controlled bungalows and flats for elderly residents, were built in Iris Close. In the early 1980s, similar bungalows and houses were built between St John's Road and Peel Street. Many of the newer properties on Kates Hill - notably blocks of four flats with two houses adjoining, with garages underneath the flats - are unique to the area, having been designed by an architect who received an award for designing the area's new homes which were built in 1976/77. They were built around the Peel Street area of Kates Hill, and a network of alleyways runs among the flats. This was initially popular with the estate's first tenants, as planners hoped to re-create the old-fashioned sense of community that had existed on Kates Hill earlier in the century. But this proved to be unsuccessful as initially the alleyways were popular with drug addicts, vandals and muggers. They also provided an illegal shortcut for motorcyclists. These problems have been gradually reduced since the late 1990s. From the 1950s, Kates Hill was a popular destination for Commonwealth immigrants, mainly Pakistani muslims. Racial tension in the area culminated in a string of violent clashes between white and Asian youths in August and September 1991. The original Kates Hill Council School on Peel Street was built during the second half of the 19th century when the residential area was first being developed. Part of the school was damaged by fire on 24 June 1969; shortly afterwards plans for a new school nearby were unveiled, and the new Kates Hill Primary School was completed during 1972, being officially opened on 2 May 1973 by Alderman Morris, Mayor of Dudley. The new school incorporated a nursery unit for 4-year-olds (and from the mid-1980s also 3-year-olds), meaning that it served the 3‚Äì12 age range until July 1990, after which it was redesignated as a 3‚Äì11 school. St John's Primary School moved to new buildings in Hillcrest Road on its merger with St Edmund's Primary School, also during the 1970s. But the old St John's school buildings are still standing and have since been used by several different businesses as well as local community groups. Rosland Secondary School was opened on Beechwood Road in 1932, and it merged with the Blue Coat School on Bean Road in 1970; with the Blue Coat School existing entirely within the Rosland buildings after 1981. It closed in 1989 on a merger with The Dudley School, which saw the formation of Castle High School in the town centre. It remained open for a year as an annexe to Castle High, as there was inadequate space for pupils at the Dudley School site until September 1990. In 1991, the Blue Coat buildings were converted into St Thomas's Community Network, which remained there until its closure in September 2015. The buildings were demolished a year later to make way for a new housing. Kates Hill has changed dramatically since the early 20th century, yet still retains many pre-1900 buildings; these include St John's Church and St John's School (though now in use as offices), as well as many late 19th- century houses situated around St John's Road. A few of the area's newer buildings have also been demolished. The Freebodies public house, built in St John's Road in the late 1970s, was demolished in 2014 after standing empty for six years. Several 1930s council houses in Cypress Road were demolished in the 1970s due to mining subsidence; flats and bungalows were later built on the site. An independent small press, The Kates Hill Press, was established in the area in 1992 and continues to function in Dudley. == St John's Church == St John's Church was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 21 May 2009. following an application made by St John's Church Preservation Group. The graveyard houses the famous Tipton Slasher, and internationally known education leader and artist Marion Richardson.

The monument, located at 3701 W. 119th Street, Hawthorne, California, stands on the former location of the Wilsons' house, which was demolished in the mid-1980s during construction of the Century Freeway. Music industry notables such as Dick Clark and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were among the letter- writers who supported the BBHL's landmark application process. Its status as a California State Historic Landmark, No. 1041 Site of the Childhood Home of the Beach Boys, was granted by the California State Historic Resources Commission in a unanimous vote on August 6, 2004, in Ontario, California, and the monument was dedicated on May 20, 2005. The image face of the landmark was inspired by the album cover of Surfer Girl. The lineup of the Beach Boys at that time was Brian, Carl, and Dennis; their cousin Mike Love; and David Marks (who grew up in a house across the street from the Wilson home.) Al Jardine, the group's original bassist, would later rejoin the band soon before David's departure. Six gold 45 records are embedded in the base of the landmark, each with the name of one of the Beach Boys; the three Wilson brothers to the left, and Love, Marks and Jardine to the right.

It is the sequel to the WWF Royal Rumble game that was released in 1993, and is the final part of LJN's 16-bit WWF trilogy. Players can play either One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, or a Raw Endurance Match. Unlike its predecessor, WWF RAW is multitap compatible. WWF RAW introduces differences between the characters in that they not only have their own signature moves, but differing move sets altogether (including new over-the-top \\"mega moves\\"). The game adds many moves not seen in the previous games, such as a DDT, a fallaway slam, and various types of suplexes. Additionally, wrestlers differ in attributes of speed, strength, stamina, and weight. The game itself is arcade-like and involves a \\"tug-of- war\\" system in which, when the wrestlers lock-up, a meter appears above them and players must repeatedly press buttons to pull the energy away from the opponent's side to theirs. With more energy, they can perform moves with greater impact. Once an opponent's energy is low enough, a player can perform a wrestler's unique signature move. ==GameplayMatch types=== In a One- on-One match, two wrestlers (one player versus the computer or two players) square off for a face-to-face bout. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament variations are available. One Fall matches feature an in-ring referee and are contested under standard rules. Victory is achieved by a 3-count pinfall or a count-out if a wrestler stays outside of the ring for a full ten-count. In a Brawl, however, the referee is absent. This allows unlimited time outside the ring and illegal moves such as eye raking and choking are allowed at all times. The Brawl match doesn't require a pinfall to win; instead, the first player to be entirely drained of their stamina submits in defeat. In a Tournament, a player must battle through the entire roster in a series of One Fall matches to win the championship belt. A Tag Team match is made up of two teams of two wrestlers (if two players are involved, they can choose to either control opposite teams or be on the same team against the computer). Whenever one wrestler gets tired, they can tag in their partner. A wrestler on the apron can grab an opponent if they get close to the ropes, allowing their partner to attack them. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament configurations are available. In a standard tag team match, if an illegal wrestler is in the ring for a full 10-count, his/her team will be disqualified. Otherwise, the same rules for the singles One Fall and Brawl matches apply to tag team matches. In the tag team Tournament mode, either one player or two cooperative players will choose two wrestlers to form a team and then must defeat the remaining wrestlers in a series of One Fall tag team matches to win the tag team championship. Luna Vachon takes on Yokozuna in an intergender match (Super NES version). A Survivor Series match is also similar to a Tag Team match. Instead of only 2 members on each team, a team can consist of up to four wrestlers. It is also elimination style, in which a team is only victorious when all the opponents' teammates have been eliminated by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification. Only one partner can appear on the apron at one time, but the player can change outside partners via a button command. When the One Fall option is enabled, characters cannot perform chokes and eye gouges. But if the referee gets knocked down, these attacks will be enabled until he recovers. However, the match can not end until the referee is able to count pin attempts or ring outs. If the referee is knocked down too many times, he will walk out of the ring. The match will then continue under Brawl rules. Applying certain holds to opponents which have no stamina will result in them giving up. This will not work in the Royal Rumble. The Royal Rumble begins with two wrestlers, and more adversaries enter until six wrestlers are in the ring. Additional wrestlers enter as others are eliminated. There are no holds barred and elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown out of the ring. A wrestler must be worn down before they can be thrown out, unless they're caught running with a hip toss or back body drop, or knocked off the top turnbuckle. In most cases, a Mega Move will instantly eliminate an opponent if they connect. The last wrestler remaining in the ring after all twelve have entered wins the match. At the end of a Royal Rumble, score rankings are shown giving a wrestler's total time in the ring along with a list of opponents they eliminated. A Bedlam match is similar to a Tag Team match, except both team members are allowed in the ring at the same time (essentially a \\"Tornado\\" Tag Team match). A team must defeat both members of the other team to win the match. A Raw Endurance match is a mix between a Survivor Series and a Bedlam. The player picks his first wrestler, then up to five more partners. The choosing of partners is optional, meaning a player can choose to go in with as much as a 6-on-1 handicap. The first team to eliminate all the members of the other team wins the match. ===Finishing & Mega Moves=== Every wrestler has a unique move based on their real-life finishing move. They all need to be performed in specific positions when the targeted opponent is low on stamina. They all use exactly the same button combination, and most characters taunt if the move was successful. Shawn Michaels' finishing move is the \\"Catapult Suplex\\", a version of his then finishing move the \\"Teardrop Suplex\\". Both Bret Hart and Owen Hart use the \\"Sharpshooter\\", which is a hold. If the Sharpshooter causes the opponent's health to deplete fully, then they will submit. The correct move positions are noted in the game's instruction manual. All versions of the game apart from the handheld versions also have Mega Moves. These are greatly exaggerated moves which cause the most damage. In most cases, they will knock an opponent out of the ring. If this happens in a Royal Rumble, then the opponent is eliminated. The player can execute these moves using a character specific button combination. Most of them are easy to avoid due to their long set-up animations. For example, both, Lex Luger and The Undertaker swing their arms in a circular motion before punching the opponent. As they are winding up their arms, the opponent has time to walk away from the target area. Other moves cannot be countered, like Diesel's literal throw towards the ceiling. ==RostersSNES and Genesis roster=== #Bret Hart #The Undertaker #Yokozuna #Bam Bam Bigelow #Razor Ramon #Lex Luger #Doink the Clown #Shawn Michaels #1-2-3 Kid #Diesel #Owen Hart #Luna Vachon :* The 32X version features Kwang via a code ===Game Gear roster=== #Bret Hart #The Undertaker #Shawn Michaels #Razor Ramon #Bam Bam Bigelow #Yokozuna #Lex Luger #Diesel Exclusives: #\\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage (last WWE game he would appear in for over 16 years) #Crush ===Game Boy roster=== #Bret Hart #The Undertaker #Shawn Michaels #Razor Ramon #Yokozuna #Diesel #Doink the Clown #Lex Luger ==Version differences== *The 32X version features Kwang as a hidden wrestler; he does not have his own moves, instead using Diesel's finisher, Bam Bam Bigelow's finisher, and Doink's mega move.

There are also alternating referees. *The handheld ports feature fewer wrestlers and do not include Bedlam, Royal Rumble, or Raw Endurance match types. Additionally, wrestlers share the same move set except for their signature moves, and there are no mega moves. *The handheld versions run much slower. *The Game Gear port features two exclusive wrestlers, \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage and Crush. ==Reception== On release, Famitsu magazine scored the Mega Drive version of the game a 19 out of 40.New Games Cross Review ‚Äì WWF RAW. Weekly Famitsu. No.352. Pg.29. 15 September 1995. Quick-Draw McGraw of GamePro gave it a positive review, praising the selection of fighters, variety of moves, lack of slowdown, the sound effects, and the many skill settings. He did, however, criticize the fact that all the wrestlers are rendered at the same height, even ones who have drastic height differences in real life. Next Generation reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"There are still many aspects of pro wrestling that none of the WWF games have yet to cover, so why not go after those?\\" Quick-Draw McGraw of GamePro was even more laudatory towards the SNES version, remarking that the controls are more precise and the graphics more detailed than those of the Genesis/Mega Drive version. GamePros Air Hendrix dismissed the 32X version, saying it is identical to the Genesis version aside from some minor graphical improvements. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed, and further criticized that the control is poor and the opponent AI is overly hard to beat on all but the easiest difficulty setting. They scored it a 5.75 out of 10. Next Generation reviewed the 32X version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"You're constantly required to hit as many buttons as fast as you can. All this does is give you hand cramps and blisters, and if that sounds like a good time you need some kind of social life.\\" ==See also== * List of licensed wrestling video games * List of fighting games ==ReferencesNotes== Category:1994 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Game Boy games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:LJN games Category:Realtime Associates games Category:Sega 32X games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:WWE Raw video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWF Raw (1994 video game)"},{"id":"7459667","text":"All of the Above is Youth Alive Western Australia's third praise and worship album, and first live recording in recent years.

It is notable for its Victorian architecture with bright interior and its old-fashioned poolside changing facilities. The baths is a Category B listed building. ==History== In 1886, some Edinburgh residents and members of the Bellahouston Private Baths Club, Glasgow, decided to build a swimming club in Edinburgh.

Many of the city's comparable swimming pools were part of a much wider scheme to build public baths to promote cleanliness and hygiene amongst the working classes, who did not have routine access at the time to sanitation. Warrender Baths also sported a billiard room and a reading room. Initially the facilities were a success, but by 1906 were no longer viable and were closed. They were bought by the city for ¬£3000, where they joined the city's portfolio of similar pools. Periodically suffering further closure threats, they were refurbished in 2005 and in 2020 and are now secure.

It is the home ground of Stafford Rangers F.C., a semi-professional team who play in the Northern Premier League. ==Ground history== The first competitive game at the ground took place on Saturday 5 September 1896, a North Staffordshire League fixture against Dresden United Reserves. Players changed in an upstairs club room at the Albion Hotel before crossing the road to what was then referred to as the Albion Ground. During 1920 the ground was purchased when Rangers became a limited company, and soon banking appeared around the pitch and four huts were bought from Cannock Chase War Training Group. The first Supporters' Club built a stand on the Lotus site which is quite possibly the structure in use today, and work also commenced on dressing rooms, offices and turnstiles ready for the 1921 season. Two years later the club hit financial difficulties and the ground was mortgaged for ¬£500, but worse followed, for in 1929 fire destroyed part of it. During the war Marston Road fell into disrepair but was renovated by Supporters Club members ready for use at the start of the 1946/47 season. It remained more or less unchanged until an upturn in playing fortunes during the late sixties saw the launch of a floodlighting fund. ¬£6,000 was raised and on Monday 5 September 1969 a crowd of 3,045 watched the official opener against Port Vale. The seventies saw the ground develop to its current status with a new seated stand to replace the ramshackle old stand which stood along the Marston Road side. Considerable delays were experienced following planning permission for the 450-seater and the old stand was still in place when Rotherham United's visit in the FA Cup 3rd Round on 4 January 1975 brought in the record gate of 8,536. The stand was used for the last time the following month and volunteer work helped create the new one in time for the start of the following season. The next significant work at Marston Road was the building of the new dressing room block and office complex which was officially opened in December 1977 following a match with Stoke City. New terrace steps were constructed at the Social Club end of the ground during the 1988 close season. When the new Board of Directors took over in 1997, work was carried out to tidy up the ground and the Social Club was extended. During the 2005/06 season, the floodlights were replaced and the seating capacity of the stand was increased to over 500 seats. ==StandsMain Stand Side=== 530 seats in a single stand which sits on the half way line, containing press/directors facilities. The blue seats now in place were bought from Leicester City's doomed Main Stand, due to ground improvements required for National Conference football. Either side of the stand lies shallow terracing. ===Lotus Side=== Small terrace stand that runs the length of the pitch with old wooden roof supports that according to some date back to before the First World War. ===Shed End=== The traditional gathering point for the more vocal parts of Rangers' support. The Shed End is said to have equal ability to \\"suck a goal in\\" as other supporter strongholds such as Manchester United's Stretford End and Wolverhampton Wanderers' Sir Jack Hayward Stand. The Shed End was knocked down, and a new 2,000-seat stand erected by 4 April 2007, when it was tested by the Conference Safety Officers. In May 2009 the 2,000 seated temporary Shed End stand was taken away, with crowds set to average just over 525 in the second season back in the Conference North, it was no longer necessary. The stand heavily cost the club, and they were forced to establish a '250 Club' to keep the club alive, where fans loaned the club ¬£200, and the loan was used to pay off the debt to the seating company, which could have led to administration. For the first half of the 2009-10 season the Shed End was just a terraced end, and in early 2010 crush barriers were tested, and a row were installed to increase the capacity of the Shed End, however, the Shed End still has no roof, which means the electric atmosphere is currently not created. The cost to cover the whole end was suggested to be approximately ¬£180,000. ===Social Club End=== Area of the ground in which the Social Club sits. In 1997 the Social Club was extended and a result there is limited capacity on this side of the ground. A new terrace was erected here, in time for the safety tests on 4 April 2007. As with the Shed End, the temporary covered terrace was sent back, and nothing has yet replaced the stand or any plans announced, as the 2009-2010 season has drawn to a close. ==The future== Because of the land-locked nature of Marston Road, it is widely accepted that for the club to progress then they must move away from their home of over 100 years. At present there are no official plans to do this and the club are instead upgrading the ground to meet league requirements. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Page at Stafford Rangers site Category:Football venues in England Category:Sports venues in Staffordshire Category:Stafford Rangers F.C.

The campus lies south of West Mains Road, west of Mayfield Road and east of Blackford Hill, about south of George Square. ==History== Paolozzi statue at King's Buildings In 1919 Edinburgh University bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city with the intention of building a satellite campus specialising in the Sciences. The first building was the Chemistry Building (renamed the Joseph Black Building) designed by Arthur Forman Balfour Paul in 1919.Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Arthur Forman Balfour Paul Building started in 1920 and was completed after 1924 by John Fraser Matthew. This was followed by the Zoology Building (renamed the Ashworth Laboratories) dating from 1929, also by Matthew. The name \\"King's Buildings\\" is a reference to then-king George V. During World War II, the Genetics Institute part of King's Buildings was used as the location for the first War Office Selection Board. ==Street and building names== All the campus properties shared one of two addresses until, in 2014, the University approached the City of Edinburgh Council, as the road naming authority, with a request to name all the individual roads within the campus to honour famous scientists and mathematicians associated with the University.

Leary series) is a sequence of stand-alone science fiction novels by David Drake. They center around Daniel Leary, an officer in the Republic of Cinnabar Navy (RCN), and Adele Mundy, a librarian and spy. Drake has described it as \\"an SF version of the Aubrey/Maturin series\\" by Patrick O'Brian. In contrast to the hardcore military science fiction bent of Drake's Hammer's Slammers series, these novels are more character-driven and feature political intrigue as well as battles. The plots of the novels are based on historical incidents, often from Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The prologue of each book includes details of its historical basis. == Creation == After discovering the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Drake gave some thought to space opera with two equal but very different characters as protagonists. When David Weber asked Drake for a novella to appear in the first Honorverse anthology, More Than Honor, Drake wrote a story named \\"A Grand Tour\\" about a young nobleman and his older, female tutor. Drake, Baen and Weber all liked the story, but Drake, feeling the concept needed a full-length novel to work properly, wrote With the Lightnings, which uses different characters in a similar pairing. \\"What's the connection between the novella A Grand Tour and the RCN series?\\", David Drake, May 2010 Prologue to With the Lightnings, David Drake, July 1998 == General plot == The RCN Series focuses on the intertwined lives of two primary characters. Daniel Leary is a Lieutenant (promoted to Captain in the later novels) in the Republic of Cinnabar Navy, a brilliant strategist, charismatic leader, charmer of women, and also the estranged son of Speaker Corder Leary, a feared, revered and respected member of the government of the planet Cinnabar. Adele Mundy is a librarian with a deep-rooted passion for information and knowledge, which has fueled her unparalleled talents in the areas of information retrieval by any means necessary, including systems infiltration and circumventing information security. Raised in the Cinnabaran aristocracy, Mundy is also an expert pistol shot, a skill useful for surviving and avoiding aristocratic duels. During an attempt by the totalitarian Alliance of Free Stars to stage a takeover-by-proxy of a Cinnabar ally, Mundy and Leary are pressed together by circumstance in order to serve the interests of their homeworld. Complicating matters is the fact that Mundy is living in exile from Cinnabar, after her family was executed for their part in a nearly successful treason plot against Cinnabar‚Äîa string of executions ordered by Daniel's father, Speaker Leary. Nonetheless, Daniel and Adele reach an understanding and eventually a friendship, and along with an extensive cast of characters continue their travels together in service of the RCN, defending against threats from the Alliance and others. == Technology of the RCN universe == Interstellar travel is accomplished through the use of advanced sails on the hull of starships, which take advantage of a fictional radiation to move the crafts outside of the sidereal universe, allowing faster-than- light travel. Sublight-speed travel is driven by a matter-antimatter annihilating \\"High Drive\\". Use of the High Drive in an atmosphere results in catastrophic reactions with unspent antimatter from the drive, so for intra- atmospheric operations, ships use plasma motors that vent reaction mass (water) from the fusion engines into rocket nozzles. Hand and vehicle weapons are generally based on electromagnetic acceleration of projectiles, while space weaponry consists of kinetic energy missiles accelerated to a high fraction of c (thereby rendering any warhead superfluous) and point defense plasma systems. In addition to point defense, the ship-mounted plasma systems are used for close range or atmospheric ship-to-ship combat. In atmosphere, the kinetic missiles are unusable, due to their utilization of the matter- antimatter High Drive. == Bibliography == As of 2019, the series consists of thirteen novels. The first book is available as an ebook via the Baen Free Library, and the first six can be read by downloading a ZIP archive of the free CD image included in hardcover copies of the sixth book. {  + - !

Other species live on fecal pellets or on exoskeletons of arthropodsWebster, J. and Weber, R. W. S. Introduction to fungi. Cambridge University Press, 2007.Deacon, J.W. Fungal Biology Bd. 4. Blackwell, 2005. Penicillium, Trichoderma, Mucor and Mortierella species belong to an ecology group which are the first organisms growing on roots. Salt described that the frequency of Mortierella species growing on the surface of roots from spruce is higher in comparison to other species (e.g. Fusarium, Pythium etc.).Salt, G.A. ‚ÄûThe incidence of root-surface fungi on naturally regenerated Picea sitchensis seedlings in southeast alaska.‚Äú Forestiy (1977). (Distribution map on EOL) ==Morphology== Mortierella fungi are typically coenocytic, but compared with the genus Mucor (Mucoromycotina, Mucorales), they have a stronger tendency towards septum formation. Compared with Mucor- like fungi, the mitosporangia are typically smaller, contain fewer spores and lack a columella (Fig. 1). Many Mortierella-like fungi are asexual. However, if zygospores are found, they strongly resemble Mucor-zygospores. Sometimes sexual structures are embedded in loosely arranged hyphal networks. ==Metabolism== Mortierella can grow on yeast extract, fish meal, or other media; rich in nutrients. Most laboratories grow these fungi on potato dextrose agar or corn meal agar. The genus can also grow on PARP media, which is used as a common selective medium for Pythium. Because of its similar appearance to Pythium in culture, separation of the two can be difficult until sporulation occurs. Cultivation and growth of Mortierella fungi are affected by the carbon source, addition of minerals and nitrogen source. Monosaccharides are most frequently used for the growth. Yeast extract and soybean meal are widely used as nitrogen source. Especially the balance between carbon and nitrogen in the medium influences the fungal culture. Many Mortierella spp. are chitinolytic. Experiments show that they degrade chitin nearly as efficiently as chitinolytic actinomycetes. From some Mortierella species it is also known that they are able to degrade hemicelluloses to sugar by using the enzyme xylanase. This fungus can degrade the hemicellulose from plants to get sugars for their growth.Dix N.J. and Webster, J. Fungal Ecology Bd. 1. Chapman and Hall, 1995. ==Sexual and asexual development== This is a culture of Mortierella, which is a zygomycete. The view is from the bottom to demonstrate the zonate growth that is characteristic of this genus. Some Mortierella species show sexual developmental programs in addition to mitotic reproduction. Mortierella forms zygospores that are the developmental consequence of plasmogamy between gametangia belonging to complementary mating types. The zygospores of Mortierella spp. may be naked (Fig 2 A) or surrounded by sterile hyphae (Fig 2 B) that form a nest-like structure, which may be interpreted as evolutionary early fruiting bodies. Some Mortierella species are homothallic (M. epigama, M. parvispora, M. nigrescens, M. rostafinskii, M. polycephala, M.renispora), but most are heterothallic (M. elongata, M. marburgensis, M. umbelata, M. capitata, M. indohi). The species Mortierella alpina was found to be homothallic and to form zygospores with a hyphal coat. Most Mortierella species have been found to be heterothallic and to produce naked zygospores with unequal suspensors. Very often sexual structures differ in size between mating types. The smaller suspensor, progametangium or gametangium does not enlarge during sexual development and may disappear soon after plasmogamy. The early development of such heterogametangic zygospores is illustrated in the heterothallic species, M. umbellata. In this species, hyphal coiling occurs at the contact site of sexually compatible mycelia. This is followed by development of progametangia which grow in parallel and close to each other. At the end of this development, one partner, the macroprogametangium will be larger than the other, the microprogametangium. ==Biotechnology== Umbelopsis isabellina, which used to be mis-classified as Mortierella isabellina, produces Œ≥-linolenic acid, an important poly- unsaturated fatty acid. It was re-classified as belonging to the genus Umbelopsis in part based on its fatty acid profile, in addition to classical ribosomal DNA sequencing. Various poly-unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid are produced by Mortierella alpina. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double bonds and are the acyl components of cellular lipids. Today, long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids are regarded as substances with beneficial potential in pharmaceutic and nutritional applications. They also serve a wide variety of purposes, from being a purely structural element in phospholipids to being involved in signal transduction, and as a substrate for a host of derivatives involved in second messenger function.Nisha, A. and G. Venkateswaran. \\"Optimization of media components for enhanced arachidonic acid production by Mortierella alpina under submerged cultivation.\\" Biotechnol. Bioprocess Eng. 16 (2011): 229‚Äì237 . Many species of the genus Mortierella have been found to yield exceptionally high quantities of arachidonic acid depending on the fermentation media and culture conditions. Fatty acids are normally produced in submerged culture with high carbon source supply, although this technique has drawbacks with respect to energy consumption and waste water production. In the long run, fatty acid fermentation needs to be done under economically reasonable solid-state fermentation conditions. ==Pathogenicity== Mortierella species are usually non-pathogenic for plants or animals and humans. A rare example for a pathogen is Mortierella wolfii, which is until now the only pathogen of humans and other animals. Mortierella wolfii, normally isolated from soil, rotten silage and similar substrates, causes bovine abortion, pneumonia and systemic mycosis. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Pictures of Mortierella sp. on iNaturalist.org * Mortierella in medicine--Oportunistic Pathogen Mortierella wolfii * Genomes--Mortierella elongata * Mortierella * New Brunswick Museum-- Mortierella Category:Zygomycota genera ","title":"Mortierella"},{"id":"7459766","text":"The Palouse Falls lie on the Palouse River, about upstream of the confluence with the Snake River in southeast Washington, United States. The falls are in height. The falls consist of an upper fall with a drop around , which lies north-northwest of the main drop, and a lower fall, with a drop of . ==Geology== The canyon at the falls is deep, exposing a large cross-section of the Columbia River Basalt Group. These falls and the canyon downstream are an important feature of the channeled scablands created by the great Missoula floods that swept periodically across eastern Washington and across the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch. The ancestral Palouse River flowed through the currently dry Washtucna Coulee to the Columbia River. The Palouse Falls and surrounding canyons were created when the Missoula floods overtopped the south valley wall of the ancestral Palouse River, diverting it to the current course to the Snake River by erosion of a new channel. The area is characterized by interconnected and hanging flood-created coulees, cataracts, plunge pools, kolk-created potholes, rock benches, buttes, and pinnacles typical of scablands. Palouse Falls State Park is located at the falls, protecting this part of the uniquely scenic area. ==Economic proposals== In 1984, the Franklin County Public Utility District proposed a dam be constructed upstream of the falls, allowing for a significant hydraulic head for hydroelectric power generation. This would have provided over one- third of the county's power and would have reduced ratepayer charges substantially. However, the majority of the ratepayers declined to approve the investment, preserving this geologically significant feature. ==Palouse Falls State Park== Grand Ronde Formation can be seen on the bottom, covered by the Ginkgo Flow of the Wanapum Basalt. The falls are included in Washington's Palouse Falls State Park, which provides access to the falls and has displays explaining the region's unique geology, as well as its historical ties (the Palouse Indians and the Mullan Road both took advantage of the easy access to the plateau in the vicinity of the falls). The park provides a viewpoint facing Palouse Falls that is a short walk from the parking area, campground, and picnic area. A larger trail system is being developed by the parks department. ==Kayaking== On April 21, 2009, Tyler Bradt ran the falls in a kayak, setting an unofficial world record for the highest waterfall run. Bradt's media agent released the video footage of him dropping over the falls to Sports Illustrated, which carried it on its website. The magazine carried a two-page photo of the feat in its May 18 issue. The photos were also reproduced in Spain's Hola magazine's international issue of September 23, 2009. ===Height of the falls=== As a result of the unofficial world record for the highest waterfall run, questions were raised about the correct height of the main drop for the falls. In the interest of claiming a world record, Bradt's team measured the falls and determined the height was from the top pool immediately above the main drop to the plunge pool immediately below. A regional paper, The Spokesman-Review, inquired with Washington state officials and determined that the previous height measurement was performed in 1945 using earlier techniques; the state was not prepared to perform an updated measurement using laser surveying equipment. However, a Whitman College geology professor led a team of students who determined: * The height of the plunge pool and the top pool both vary with river flows, but not uniformly. * The flow peak for 2009 was on January 9 - at that time the river top pool elevation was higher than when the measurements were made on August 18. * The estimated plunge pool elevation difference between January and August was . * Hence, a variability was seen in the height of falls over this period. * The likely height of the falls at the main drop during the highest waterfall record attempt was between 175 and . ==Official state waterfall== On February 12, 2014, the Washington House of Representatives passed HB 2119 unanimously to make Palouse Falls the official state waterfall in Washington. The proposal for the bill originated when a group of elementary school students in the nearby town of Washtucna lobbied the state legislature. ==ReferencesExternal links== Palouse Falls on the Palouse River. *Photo of the falls, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Category:Landforms of Franklin County, Washington Category:Geology of Washington (state) Category:Waterfalls of Washington (state) Category:State parks of Washington (state) Category:Landforms of Whitman County, Washington ","title":"Palouse Falls"},{"id":"7459768","text":"Githead is a musical collaboration that includes Wire's Colin Newman as well as electronic musician Robin Rimbaud (Scanner) alongside Minimal Compact members Malka Spigel and Max Franken. == Biography == The appearance of Githead and the release of their debut EP Headgit in 2004 surprised many, mainly because of the unlikely 'line up' and the fact that they operate in a pop & rock environment rather than a purely experimental one. The band's genesis was as a 'one-off', as part of the celebrations of the Swim ~ label's 10th anniversary at the ICA, but it quickly became apparent that the band was more than a mere collection of individuals and that it was able to generate its own style. Initially without a drummer, the band wrote and rehearsed in Swim's studio from the outset. This guaranteed that all outbreaks of creativity could be instantly recorded. This meant that as well as building up a repertoire, the band was also recording towards an end of released material, and was subsequently able fairly rapidly to develop enough finished material to enable selections to be made for release. Thus the debut EP Headgit was released before the band had played its third gig, and material towards the debut album Profile was already in the works before the band had even played two gigs. The first three shows were performed without a live drummer, but it had always been the band's intention to be able play with live drums. In the end Max Franken from Malka's band Minimal Compact became the band's drummer. Githead made their debut as a live four-piece in Antwerp in March 2005 following on with gigs in Spring and Summer that year. These included the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, Cit√© de la Musique in Paris, The Paradiso in Amsterdam, Barby in Tel Aviv, The Botanique in Brussels and The Garage in London. In autumn 2005 the band concentrated on writing and recording their 2nd album Art Pop.

The fund and its three sister organizations (Rainforest Foundation UK, Rainforest Foundation US, and Rainforest Foundation Norway) support indigenous rainforest peoples to assert and defend their rights, to define and promote sustainable development in their communities, and to challenge the activities and practices of governments or other entities which damage their environment and lands. The programs and projects are developed in partnership with local communities and representative indigenous NGOs. ==History== The Chief Raoni and Sting in 1989, in Paris. The Rainforest Foundation Fund was first founded in 1989 as the Rainforest Foundation International, by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux, Sting and his wife Trudie Styler after an indigenous leader, Raoni, of the Kayapo people of Brazil made a personal request to them to help his community protect their lands and culture. Since then, the Rainforest Foundation Fund, working together with its sister organizations, has funded projects that have protected a total of 28 million acres of forest in 20 different rainforest countries around the globe.The Rainforest Foundation US \\"About Us \\" ==Philosophy== The mission of the Rainforest Foundation Fund is: \\"to protect and support indigenous people and traditional forest populations in their efforts to protect their environment and fulfill their right to a secure, healthy and ecologically sound environment.\\" The Fund believes that environmental degradation necessarily violates human rights to life, health and culture. The international community widely accepts that indigenous peoples are holders of a specific set of rights and are also the victims of historically unique forms of discrimination, and it enshrined this idea in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007. The Rainforest Fund claims that its work is motivated by its recognition of a substantial disconnect between such declarations made by the governments of the world in an international forum, and the actions that those governments undertake in their own countries. They mention as an illustration the controversy surrounding the Belo Monte Dam in Brazil: \\"While at the United Nations discussions are underway on the crucial issue of climate change, and governments are finally realizing that they have to change their pattern of development, in the Brazilian Amazon plans are well advanced to build environmentally destructive mega-dams along the Xingu River, the last of the great Amazon rivers in a good state of conservation.\\" .Sarah Anne Hughes. \\"Brazil approves Belo Monte dam, despite fierce opposition, James Cameron Speaks Out\\" The Washington Post. 01 June 2011.\\"Amazon Watch's 'Stop the Belo Monte Dam' Campaign \\"Karen Hoffmann. \\"Belo Monte dam marks a troubling new era in Brazil's attitude to its rainforest\\" The Ecologist. 16 August 2001.Reuters. \\"Brazil approves Belo Monte hydroelectric dam\\" guardian.co.uk, Wednesday 1 June 2011 ==Method== The Rainforest Foundation Fund usually covers only about 80% of a project's total budget, leaving its grantee responsible for finding the remaining 20%, to avoid over-dependency on just one funding source. The fund grants money on a three-year basis, but will extend funding up to five years in certain circumstances. Grant-recipient's projects are evaluated annually. The Rainforest Foundation Fund works with an extremely small staff, with only a chairperson (Franca Sciuto) and a part-time financial director/treasurer (Li Lu). The chairperson serves as a volunteer, and handles all project screening, interim assessments and post-project evaluations. Final decisions on projects and fund disbursement are made by the Rainforest Foundation Fund board.Rainforest Foundation Fund 2006/2008 Report \\"\\" Rather than administrating large projects itself, the Fund believes that the primary beneficiaries, the indigenous peoples, should also be the primary administrators of the projects. The sister organizations in the US, UK and Norway work directly with indigenous organizations to ensure they are equipped with the administrative structures, technology and trained leadership needed to carry out their projects. ==Current work== The Rainforest Fund supports projects that defend indigenous people's rights to their lands and to live in a healthy environment. The Fund assists rainforest indigenous communities by helping them achieve official demarcation of their territories and then ensuring they are able to effectively defend their communities from violations of their rights including illegal logging, mining, other land invasions, and social disenfranchisement/denial of their rights as citizens. Many of their projects work to uphold the right of indigenous peoples to grant or to withhold. Then their free, prior and informed consent to projects that will affect their land, resources and livelihoods, and to ensure that indigenous communities are given full information and have a voice in project negotiations and the policy design process. It also makes grants to programs that assist communities in designing sustainable development strategies, and in strengthening their representative organizations.

The Court held that the primary determiner in selecting a country's law in tort should be the lex loci (the location where the tort occurred). The case was decided with Lucas (Litigation guardian of) v Gagnon. ==Background== Prior to this case, the leading case on the matter was McLean v Pettigrew, [1945] S.C.R. 62 which stated that the proper law to apply would always be the lex fori, the local law of the court, irrespective of the connection with the jurisdiction. ===Tolofson case=== A father and son from British Columbia are driving in Saskatchewan and are in a motor vehicle accident with Leroy Jensen, a resident of Saskatchewan. The son, Kim Tolofson, sues both Jensen and his father. Under Saskatchewan law the claimant must prove gross negligence in order for a gratuitous passenger to recover and the limitation period is 12 months. Kim did not sue for six years once he became 18 years old. ===Lucas case=== The Gagnon family from Ontario were driving in Quebec and were in a motor vehicle accident with Mr. Lavoie, a Quebec resident. No action was allowed under Quebec no-fault system. ==Ruling of the Court== Justice La Forest wrote for the majority. He considered the issue of territorial limits of jurisdiction. He concluded that the general policy interests were those of order and fairness.pp. 1050-1051 He was highly concerned of confusion resulting from complex rules. La Forest explicitly stated that exceptions to this rule should be rare. He argued that exceptions would \\"encourage frivolous cross-claims and joinders of third parties\\", it would create uncertainty, discourage judges to make summary judgments, and would discourage settlement. He contemplated that there may be exception at the international level where there may be injusticeat 307 he stated \\"However, because a rigid rule on the international level could give rise to injustice, in certain circumstances, I am not averse to retaining a discretion in the court to apply our own law to deal with such circumstances. I can, however, imagine few cases where this would be necessary.\\" or where both parties are domiciled in the forum.p. 310 Alberta later enacted a Limitations Act (R.S.A. 2000, c. L‚Äë12, s. 12) to get around the result in Tolofson. Subsequent cases have considered the limits of the exception to the Tolofson rule. In Hanlan v Sernesky (1998, Ont.CA) where the court found exception to the rule on an international matter. However, similar reasoning was rejected on provincial matters in Leornard v Houle (1997, Ont.CA). ==See also== * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases * Boys v Chaplin [1969] 2 All E.R. 1085 (H.L.) * Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA [1995] 1 AC 190 (P.C.) * Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, and * Hunt v T&N; plc, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289 ==ReferencesSources== * J.

Usually in dicots the suspensor cells divide transversally a few times to form a filamentous suspensor of 6-10 cells. The suspensor helps in pushing the embryo into the endosperm. The first cell of the suspensor towards the micropylar end becomes swollen and functions as a haustorium. The haustorium has wall ingrowths similar to those of a transfer cell. The last of the suspensors at the end of the embryo is known as hypophysis. Hypophysis later gives rise to the radicle and root cap. During embryo development in angiosperm seeds, normal development involves asymmetrical division of the unicellular embryo, inducing polarity. The smaller terminal cell divides to become the proembryo while the larger basal cell divides laterally to form the suspensor. The suspensor is analogous to a placental mammalian's umbilical cord. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * C.J. Alexopolous, Charles W. Mims, M. Blackwell, Introductory Mycology, 4th ed.

Underground nuclear testing is the test detonation of nuclear weapons that is performed underground. When the device being tested is buried at sufficient depth, the nuclear explosion may be contained, with no release of radioactive materials to the atmosphere. The extreme heat and pressure of an underground nuclear explosion causes changes in the surrounding rock. The rock closest to the location of the test is vaporised, forming a cavity. Farther away, there are zones of crushed, cracked, and irreversibly strained rock. Following the explosion, the rock above the cavity may collapse, forming a rubble chimney. If this chimney reaches the surface, a bowl-shaped subsidence crater may form. The first underground test took place in 1951; further tests provided information that eventually led to the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which banned all nuclear tests except for those performed underground. From then until the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, most nuclear tests were performed underground, in order to prevent nuclear fallout from entering into the atmosphere. ==Background== Although public concern about fallout from nuclear testing grew in the early 1950s, fallout was discovered after the Trinity test, the first ever atomic bomb test, in 1945. Photographic film manufacturers later reported 'fogged' films; this was traced to packaging materials sourced from Indiana crops, contaminated by Trinity and later tests at the Nevada Test Site, over 1,000 miles (‚âà1600 kilometres) away. Intense fallout from the 1953 Simon test was documented as far as Albany, New York. The fallout from the March 1954 Bravo test in the Pacific Ocean had \\"scientific, political and social implications that have continued for more than 40 years\\". The multi-megaton test caused fallout to occur on the islands of the Rongerik and Rongelap atolls, and a Japanese fishing boat known as the Daigo Fukury≈´ Maru (Lucky Dragon). Prior to this test, there was \\"insufficient\\" appreciation of the dangers of fallout. The test became an international incident. In a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) interview, the historian Martha Smith argued: \\"In Japan, it becomes a huge issue in terms of not just the government and its protest against the United States, but all different groups and all different peoples in Japan start to protest. It becomes a big issue in the media. There are all kinds of letters and protests that come from, not surprisingly, Japanese fishermen, the fishermen's wives; there are student groups, all different types of people; that protest against the Americans' use of the Pacific for nuclear testing. They're very concerned about, first of all, why the United States even has the right to be carrying out those kinds of tests in the Pacific. They're also concerned about the health and environmental impact.\\" The Prime Minister of India \\"voiced the heightened international concern\\" when he called for the elimination of all nuclear testing worldwide. Knowledge about fallout and its effects grew, and with it concern about the global environment and long-term genetic damage. Talks between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union began in May 1955 on the subject of an international agreement to end nuclear tests. On August 5, 1963, representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, forbidding testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in space, and underwater. Agreement was facilitated by the decision to allow underground testing, eliminating the need for on-site inspections that concerned the Soviets. Underground testing was allowed, provided that it does not cause \\"radioactive debris to be present outside the territorial limits of the State under whose jurisdiction or control such explosion is conducted\\". ==Early history of underground testing== Following analysis of underwater detonations that were part of Operation Crossroads in 1946, inquiries were made regarding the possible military value of an underground explosion. The US Joint Chiefs of Staff thus obtained the agreement of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to perform experiments on both surface and sub-surface detonations. The Alaskan island of Amchitka was initially selected for these tests in 1950, but the site was later deemed unsuitable and the tests were moved to the Nevada Test Site. Buster-Jangle Uncle, the first underground nuclear explosion The first underground nuclear test was conducted on 29 November 1951.Some sources identify later tests as the \\"first\\". Adushkin (2001) defines such a test as \\"the near-simultaneous detonation of one or more nuclear charges inside one underground excavation (a tunnel, shaft or borehole)\\", and identifies Uncle as the first. This was the 1.2 kiloton Buster-Jangle Uncle,Some sources refer to the test as Jangle Uncle (e.g., Adushkin, 2001) or Project Windstorm (e.g., DOE/NV-526, 1998). Operation Buster and Operation Jangle were initially conceived as separate operations, and Jangle was at first known as Windstorm, but the AEC merged the plans into a single operation on 19 June 1951. See Gladeck, 1986. which detonated 5.2 m (17 ft) beneath ground level. The test was designed as a scaled-down investigation of the effects of a 23-kiloton ground-penetrating gun-type fission weapon that was then being considered for use as a cratering and bunker-buster weapon. The explosion resulted in a cloud that rose to 3,500 m (11,500 ft), and deposited fallout to the north and north-northeast. The resulting crater was 79 m (260 ft) wide and 16 m (53 ft) deep. Teapot Ess The next underground test was Teapot Ess, on 23 March 1955. The one-kiloton explosion was an operational test of an 'Atomic Demolition Munition' (ADM). It was detonated 20.4 m (67 ft) underground, in a shaft lined with corrugated steel, which was then back-filled with sandbags and dirt. Because the ADM was buried underground, the explosion blew tons of earth upwards, creating a crater 91 m (300 ft) wide and 39 m (128 ft) deep. The resulting mushroom cloud rose to a height of and subsequent radioactive fallout drifted in an easterly direction, travelling as far as from ground zero. On 26 July 1957, Plumbbob Pascal-A was detonated at the bottom of a shaft.According to the Nuclear Weapons Archive, the yield is described as \\"slight\\", but was approximately 55 tons. According to one description, it \\"ushered in the era of underground testing with a magnificent pyrotechnic roman candle!\\" As compared with an above-ground test, the radioactive debris released to the atmosphere was reduced by a factor of ten. Theoretical work began on possible containment schemes. Dust raised by Plumbbob Rainier Layout of the Plumbbob Rainier tunnel Plumbbob Rainier was detonated at 899 ft underground on 19 September 1957. The 1.7 kt explosion was the first to be entirely contained underground, producing no fallout. The test took place in a 1,600 ‚Äì 2,000 ft horizontal tunnel in the shape of a hook. The hook \\"was designed so explosive force will seal off the non-curved portion of tunnel nearest the detonation before gases and fission fragments can be vented around the curve of the tunnel's hook\\". This test would become the prototype for larger, more powerful tests. Rainier was announced in advance, so that seismic stations could attempt to record a signal. Analysis of samples collected after the test enabled scientists to develop an understanding of underground explosions that \\"persists essentially unaltered today\\". The information would later provide a basis for subsequent decisions to agree to the Limited Test Ban Treaty. Cannikin, the last test at the facility on Amchitka, was detonated on 6 November 1971. At approximately 5 megatons, it was the largest underground test in US history. == Effects == Relative crater sizes and shapes resulting from various burst depths The effects of an underground nuclear test may vary according to factors including the depth and yield of the explosion, as well as the nature of the surrounding rock. If the test is conducted at sufficient depth, the test is said to be contained, with no venting of gases or other contaminants to the environment. In contrast, if the device is buried at insufficient depth (\\"underburied\\"), then rock may be expelled by the explosion, forming a subsidence crater surrounded by ejecta, and releasing high-pressure gases to the atmosphere (the resulting crater is usually conical in profile, circular, and may range between tens to hundreds of metres in diameter and depth). One figure used in determining how deeply the device should be buried is the scaled depth of burial, or -burst (SDOB) This figure is calculated as the burial depth in metres divided by the cube root of the yield in kilotons. It is estimated that, in order to ensure containment, this figure should be greater than 100.Hawkins and Wohletz specify a figure of 90‚Äì125. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 2em 1em 0; float:left\\" + Zones in surrounding rock - ! efefef;\\"  Name ! ffdead;\\"  Radius -  Melt cavity  4‚Äì12 m/kt1/3 -  Crushed zone  30‚Äì40 m/kt1/3 -  Cracked zone  80‚Äì120 m/kt1/3 -  Zone of irreversible strain  800‚Äì1100 m/kt1/3 } The energy of the nuclear explosion is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable with the weight of the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting on the bottom of the cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment cage, sealing the cracks.The Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2010-02-08. Susidence crater formed by Huron King Several minutes to days later, once the heat dissipates enough, the steam condenses, and the pressure in the cavity falls below the level needed to support the overburden, the rock above the void falls into the cavity. Depending on various factors, including the yield and characteristics of the burial, this collapse may extend to the surface. If it does, a subsidence crater is created. Such a crater is usually bowl-shaped, and ranges in size from a few tens of metres to over a kilometre in diameter. At the Nevada Test Site, 95 percent of tests conducted at a scaled depth of burial (SDOB) of less than 150 caused surface collapse, compared with about half of tests conducted at a SDOB of less than 180. The radius r (in feet) of the cavity is proportional to the cube root of the yield y (in kilotons), r = 55 * \\\\sqrt[3]{y}; an 8 kiloton explosion will create a cavity with radius of 110 feet. Rubble mound formed by Whetstone Sulky Other surface features may include disturbed ground, pressure ridges, faults, water movement (including changes to the water table level), rockfalls, and ground slump. Most of the gas in the cavity is composed of steam; its volume decreases dramatically as the temperature falls and the steam condenses. There are however other gases, mostly carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which do not condense and remain gaseous. The carbon dioxide is produced by thermal decomposition of carbonates, hydrogen is created by reaction of iron and other metals from the nuclear device and surrounding equipment. The amount of carbonates and water in the soil and the available iron have to be considered in evaluating the test site containment; water-saturated clay soils may cause structural collapse and venting. Hard basement rock may reflect shock waves of the explosion, also possibly causing structural weakening and venting. The noncondensible gases may stay absorbed in the pores in the soil. Large amount of such gases can however maintain enough pressure to drive the fission products to the ground. Radioactivity release during Baneberry Escape of radioactivity from the cavity is known as containment failure. Massive, prompt, uncontrolled releases of fission products, driven by the pressure of steam or gas, are known as venting; an example of such failure is the Baneberry test. Slow, low-pressure uncontrolled releases of radioactivity are known as seeps; these have little to no energy, are not visible and have to be detected by instruments. Late- time seeps are releases of noncondensable gases days or weeks after the blast, by diffusion through pores and crack, probably assisted by a decrease of atmospheric pressure (so called atmospheric pumping). When the test tunnel has to be accessed, controlled tunnel purging is performed; the gases are filtered, diluted by air and released to atmosphere when the winds will disperse them over sparsely populated areas. Small activity leaks resulting from operational aspects of tests are called operational releases; they may occur e.g. during drilling into the explosion location during core sampling, or during the sampling of explosion gases. The radionuclide composition differs by the type of releases; large prompt venting releases significant fraction (up to 10%) of fission products, while late-time seeps contain only the most volatile gases. Soil absorbs the reactive chemical compounds, so the only nuclides filtered through soil into the atmosphere are the noble gases, primarily krypton-85 and xenon-133. The released nuclides can undergo bio- accumulation. Radioactive isotopes like iodine-131, strontium-90 and caesium-137 are concentrated in the milk of grazing cows; cow milk is therefore a convenient, sensitive fallout indicator. Soft tissues of animals can be analyzed for gamma emitters, bones and liver for strontium and plutonium, and blood, urine and soft tissues are analyzed for tritium. Although there were early concerns about earthquakes arising as a result of underground tests, there is no evidence that this has occurred. However, fault movements and ground fractures have been reported, and explosions often precede a series of aftershocks, thought to be a result of cavity collapse and chimney formation. In a few cases, seismic energy released by fault movements has exceeded that of the explosion itself. ==International treaties== Signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963 by representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the Limited Test Ban Treaty agreed to ban nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, and underwater. Due to the Soviet government's concern about the need for on-site inspections, underground tests were excluded from the ban. 108 countries would eventually sign the treaty, with the significant exception of China. In 1974, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) which banned underground tests with yields greater than 150 kilotons. By the 1990s, technologies to monitor and detect underground tests had matured to the point that tests of one kiloton or over could be detected with high probability, and in 1996 negotiations began under the auspices of the United Nations to develop a comprehensive test ban. The resulting Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed in 1996 by the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China. However, following the United States Senate decision not to ratify the treaty in 1999, it is still yet to be ratified by 8 of the required 44 'Annex 2' states and so has not entered into force as United Nations law. ===Monitoring=== In the late 1940s, the United States began to develop the capability to detect atmospheric testing using air sampling; this system was able to detect the first Soviet test in 1949. Over the next decade, this system was improved, and a network of seismic monitoring stations was established to detect underground tests. Development of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in the mid-1970s led to an improved understanding of the relationship between test yield and resulting seismic magnitude. When negotiations began in the mid-1990s to develop a comprehensive test ban, the international community was reluctant to rely upon the detection capabilities of individual nuclear weapons states (especially the United States), and instead wanted an international detection system. The resulting International Monitoring System (IMS) consists of a network of 321 monitoring stations,and 16 radionuclide laboratories. Fifty \\"primary\\" seismic stations send data continuously to the International Data Center, along with 120 \\"auxiliary\\" stations which send data on request. The resulting data is used to locate the epicentre, and distinguish between the seismic signatures of an underground nuclear explosion and an earthquake. Additionally, eighty radionuclide stations detect radioactive particles vented by underground explosions. Certain radionuclides constitute clear evidence of nuclear tests; the presence of noble gases can indicate whether an underground explosion has taken place. Finally, eleven hydroacoustic stations and sixty infrasound stations monitor underwater and atmospheric tests. ==Gallery== File:Buster-Jangle Uncle 001.jpgBuster-Jangle Uncle File:NNSA-NSO-252.jpgTeapot Ess File:Storax Sedan nuke.jpgStorax Sedan File:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpgSedan Crater File:Bowline Schooner 001d.jpgBowline Schooner File:Nevada Test Site craters.jpgNevada Test Site subsidence craters == See also == * Nuclear weapons testing * Subsidence crater * Tired mountain syndrome * Nuclear bunker buster * List of induced seismic events ==Notes and referencesFurther reading== *\\"The Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions\\", Project Director Gregory E van der Vink, U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, OTA-ISC-414, (Oct 1989). *IAEA review of the 1968 book: The constructive uses of nuclear explosions by Edward Teller. ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20060908032343/http://www.princeton.edu/~globsec/publications/pdf/3_3-4Adushkin.pdf *Nuclear Pursuits, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, September/October 2003 *http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20041218041325/http://www.ingv.it/~roma/SITOINGLESE/research_projects/CTBTO/explosions.html *http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/ugt.htm *https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/ugt-nts.htm *http://www.atomictraveler.com/UndergroundTestOTA.pdf *http://www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1215_web.pdf *The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions, M.

He played in France, the Netherlands and his native England. He notably played for Grimsby Town, Scunthorpe United, Northampton Town and Lincoln City, having also had spells with AJ Auxerre, Leeds United, FC Utrecht, Walsall, Hull City, Bristol Rovers, Notts County, Lincoln United and Lincoln Moorlands Railway. Forrester has since set up home in Lincoln and runs his own key cutting business as well as coaching youngsters in the city. ==CareerAJ Auxerre=== At the age of 16, Forrester moved south of England to France, where he was to ply his trade for Auxerre, a team with unprecedented success for the size of their town. However, \\"after a year of homesickness\\", Forrester returned to Leeds in an attempt to break into their first team, after failing to make any first team appearances. ===Leeds United=== Whilst at Leeds, Forrester had two relatively successful loan spells at Southend United and Grimsby Town, however, only managed to bag 9 first team appearances for The Whites, stating he \\"was not able to consistently perform at the top level.\\" This eventually led him to join Grimsby Town on a permanent basis. His highlight whilst at Elland Road was undoubtedly winning the FA Youth Cup in 1993, helping to defeat a Manchester United squad 4‚Äì1 on aggregate over a two-legged final, scoring Leeds' first goals in both their 2‚Äì0 victory at Old Trafford and their 2‚Äì1 win at Elland Road. Forrester scored a total of 11 goals in 1993's FA Youth Cup for the Yorkshire outfit. This Manchester United team contained players who were to become internationals, including David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Robbie Savage and Keith Gillespie. ===Grimsby Town=== The Mariners had seen enough in Forrester's loan spell to offer him a permanent deal, and in the 1995/96, his contributions to the club were justly recognised as he received the Grimsby Town Supporters Young Player of the Year award. Despite this, his goal:game ratio was somewhat poor, which led to Forrester joining Grimsby's Lincolnshire rivals, Scunthorpe United. ===Scunthorpe United=== Forrester's spell at The Iron was arguably his most successful spell at a club. He quoted \\"Joining Scunthorpe was the best football decision I have made because it allowed me to play first team football on a regular basis and this is where I 'came of age' as a footballer.\\" Despite being a firm favourite at Scunthorpe, another opportunity for him to play abroad came along, this time at the reasonably successful F.C. Utrecht of Holland. ===FC Utrecht=== Those at the Stadion Galgenwaard obviously saw enough potential in Forrester to take him on under the Bosman ruling, however, once again his spell away from home was short-lived, stating \\"things never really worked out in Holland.\\" And after only one first team appearance to his name, and two short loan spells at Walsall and Northampton Town, Forrester headed back to England to play for Northampton on a permanent basis. ===Northampton Town=== In terms of success, Forrester's spell at Northampton was very similar to that of Scunthorpe. Scoring a goal every other game and winning promotion with The Cobblers rivalled his success at The Iron. His impressive displays led Peter Taylor, manager of the uprising Hull City, to hand him a contract. ===Hull City=== Hull City were by no means like a club who Forrester had played for before, they were playing in the fourth tier of English football, yet according to Forrester, were a \\"different animal.\\" This was perhaps why Forrester's first team appearances were limited for The Tigers. Being surplus to requirements at the KC Stadium, despite being named in the Hull squad for every game of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Forrester scored against previous club Northampton Town in a 5‚Äì1 mauling of his old side for Hull City but was still applauded by the Northampton fans, showing the respect his attitude won. Forrester soon found a new club, this time Bristol Rovers. ===Bristol Rovers=== Forrester's time at The Pirates was somewhat frustrating, only managing to bag a handful of goals in 52 appearances. He was farmed out on loan to Lincoln City and scored 5 goals in 9 appearances, helping them reach the League Two Play-off semi-finals. His performances whilst on loan at Sincil Bank won him instant respect, and led him to sign a permanent deal for the Lincolnshire outfit shortly after. ===Lincoln City=== Having already played for Scunthorpe United and Grimsby Town, Forrester was no stranger to playing football in Lincolnshire. Despite the fact that he did not gain promotion with The Imps, his goal:game ratio was that of a goal every other game and he was a very influential figure in a side which pushed for promotion for two seasons whilst he served at the club. During his first full season at the club, the 2006‚Äì07 season, Forrester scored three hat-tricks in the opening stages and went on to be the club's top scorer. In May 2008, Forrester was offered a year-long extension to his Lincoln contract, although this was not accepted and he decided to join League Two rivals Notts County to the dismay of the Lincoln faithful. ===Notts County=== After failing to agree a new contract at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, on 11 June 2008 he signed a contract for Notts County. Forrester was released by the Meadow Lane club after the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. ===Lincoln United=== On 6 August 2009, Forrester signed for Non League side Lincoln United, effectively dropping four levels down from League Two to play for United.Latest Sport news in Lincolnshire ‚Äì News Stories & Events  This is Lincolnshire In December 2009, Forrester and fellow former Lincoln City player Sam Mullarkey departed the club due to the desire of the club to trim the budget. ===Lincoln Moorlands Railway=== In April 2010, Forrester came out of retirement to play for Lincoln Moorlands Railway until the end of the season, debuting in the 3‚Äì0 home victory over Selby Town on 7 April 2010. He departed the club at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season and returned to his retirement. ==Retirement== Upon his retirement, Forrester remained in Lincoln where he began to coach youngsters, as well as setting up his own company, Community Business Solutions Limited, a firm which specialises in reducing energy bills for its clients. In June 2011 he hinted at a possible return to professional football after impressing in a match in memory of the late Richard Butcher, Forrester hinted that he would be tempted to re-sign for former club Lincoln City following their relegation to the Conference National a few months earlier.Jamie Forrester ready to come out of retirement for Lincoln City  This is Lincolnshire In September 2011 Jamie began to work on new Sports Channel ‚Äì Sports Tonight Live where he has turned his hand to TV presenting on The Basement Show, which takes a light-hearted look at Football Leagues 1 and 2 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Jamie Forrester at Soccerbase * The Jamie Forrester Soccer Academy Jamie's Soccer Academy * England FA profile Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:AJ Auxerre players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:FC Utrecht players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Hull City A.F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Lincoln United F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Footballers from Bradford Category:Lincoln Moorlands Railway F.C. players ","title":"Jamie Forrester"},{"id":"7459918","text":"This is a list of singles which topped the Irish Singles Chart in 1968.

He was born in Dairsie, the second son of a Presbyterian minister. His elder brother was Robert Forsyth Scott, who was to become Master of St John's College, Cambridge. Both brothers were educated in Stuttgart, then the capital of W√ºrttemberg. He worked first as a journalist. For the London Evening Standard he covered the reprisals for the murder of J. W. W. Birch, in Perak, in 1875. He then reported from Burma, usually in Rangoon but also travelling to Mandalay, for the London Daily News and the St James's Gazette. He remained in Burma until 1882, and during most of this period was a schoolmaster (briefly acting headmaster) at St John's College, Rangoon. His most famous book, The Burman: his life and notions, was published at this period, under a pseudonym which mystified literary London but was no secret to people in Rangoon. In 1884 Scott was again a full-time journalist, reporting, once more for the Evening Standard, on the French invasion of Tongking (now northern Vietnam). This was when he began his collecting of manuscripts, documents and ephemera, which eventually became the Scott Collection at Cambridge University Library. On the British annexation of Upper Burma he was invited to join the Burma Commission, the nucleus of the colonial civil service; he returned to Burma in 1886, stationed initially at Mandalay, Meiktila and Hlaingdet. He was a Deputy Commissioner in Burma, and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in November 1901. In The Trouser People: a Story of Burma in the Shadow of the Empire, Andrew Marshall recounts Scott's adventures as he cajoled and bullied his way through uncharted jungle to establish British colonial rule in the Shan States, where the administration was initially established at Fort Stedman but soon moved to Taunggyi. Scott wrote more than 15 articles for the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.s:Author:James George Scott His collection of manuscripts and documents was given by his brother's widow to Cambridge University Library in 1934, and, long afterwards, was catalogued by Sao Saimong and Andrew Dalby.

He was a member of the Republican Party, who served as U.S. Representative from Delaware. ==Early life and family== Smithers was born in Dover, Delaware, the son of the county prothonotary, Nathaniel and Susan Fisher Barratt Smithers. He was educated at Ezra Scovell's school in Dover and then at the West Nottingham Academy under Rev. James Magraw. Earning his undergraduate degree at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania in 1836, he entered the law department of Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with the class of 1840. He was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1841 and commenced its practice in Dover. His wife was his half cousin, Mary Smithers and they had four children, only one of whom survived into adulthood. She was the sister of diplomat Enoch Joyce Smithers. After Mary's death, Smithers married Mary Barratt Townsend of Frederica, Delaware. ==Professional and political career== Beginning his political career as a Whig, he turned down the nomination to run for Congress in 1844 but did serve as clerk of the State Legislature in 1845 and 1847. He was a delegate to the Whig Convention in Philadelphia that nominated Millard Fillmore in 1848. But he became estranged with the mainstream of the Whigs in the state when the party rejected the gradual abolition of slavery and voted in local option concerning alcohol in 1847. He co-operated with the American Party but did not become a member. He was a chair of the state delegation to the Republican Convention in Chicago that nominated Abraham Lincoln. Smithers served as secretary of state for Delaware under Governor Cannon from January 20, 1863 until November 23, 1863 when he was elected to the U.S. Congress to fill a vacancy opened with the death of Democrat William Temple. While there he served on the critical Special Committee of Reconstruction and helped turn down the efforts of Arkansas and Louisiana members to be re-admitted. He also shepherded the amendment through Congress which abolished the purchase of relief from the draft. At the Baltimore Republican Convention in 1864, he was a member of the executive committee but did not support Andrew Johnson's nomination as vice-president. Now classified as an Unconditional Unionist, he was defeated after that one term by John A. Nicholson, a Democrat, in 1864 and returned to private practice. He did continue to lead the Delaware Republican delegation, in 1868 nominating Grant and in 1880 voting for Blaine. Back in Dover, he was president of the First National Bank and served on the school board. Dickinson College awarded him the honorary doctorate in 1890. ==Death and legacy== Smithers died at Dover and is buried there in the Old Methodist or Whatcoat Cemetery. ==Almanac== Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and have a two-year term. {class= style=\\"width: 94%\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" align=\\"center\\" -bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=8 style=\\"background: #ccccff;\\" Public Offices -  Office  Type  Location  Began office  Ended office  notes -  U.S. Representative  Legislature  Washington  December 7, 1863  March 3, 1865  - } {class= style=\\"width: 94%\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" align=\\"center\\" -bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=8 style=\\"background: #ccccff;\\" United States Congressional service - !

However, he is the only son by his father's dynastic second wife, Baroness Vera Sch√§ffer von Bernstein (1914‚Äì1994). Although he is his father's second son, Prince Konrad was heir to the headship of the House of Saxe-Meiningen because his father's first marriage to commoner Margot Gr√∂ssler was morganatic; and as such, his older half-brother, Prince Friedrich Ernst (1935-2004), did not have dynastic rights. Upon the death of his father on 4 October 1984, Prince Konrad succeeded to headship of the House of Saxe-Meiningen. Since becoming head of the house, he is sometimes given the titular title Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, in addition to the title Duke of Saxony which all male members of the house of Wettin bear. In 1996, Prince Konrad began legal proceedings against the Russian government seeking the rehabilitation of property that had been expropriated after World War II by the Soviet Union. ==Education and career== Prince Konrad studied economics at the University of Heidelberg and business management at University of G√∂ttingen. Professionally, Prince Konrad is a qualified banker who has worked for various banks as an analyst. Since 1998, he has been an independent advisor specialising in the restructuring of companies, and has also spent time working in the air and car industries. Currently, Prince Konrad is a partner in the Rudolf D√∂ring Law Firm; and since 2007, he has been Managing Director of GWP German Wind Power GmbH. ==Titles and styles== *14 April 1952 ‚Äì present: His Highness Prince Konrad of Saxe-Meiningen, Duke of Saxony, J√ºlich, Cleves and Berg, of Engern and Westphalia, Prince of Saalfeld, Landgrave in Th√ºringia, Margrave of Meissen, Count of Henneberg, Camburg, of the March and Ravensberg, Lord of Kranichfeld, Ravenstein, etc. Konrad styles himself Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. ==Succession== Prince Konrad is unmarried. His closest male relative is his nephew, Constantin Prinz von Sachsen-Meiningen (b. 1980), son of his elder morganatic half-brother, Friedrich Ernst Prinz von Sachsen- Meiningen from his second marriage with morganatic Princess Beatrice of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha, a half-sister of Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Constantin has a son, Michael (b. July 2015), with Sophia Lupus, although it is unclear whether the parents are married.Netty Royal - NEWS ¬ª BIRTHS ¬ª 2015 In addition to Constantin, additional male line descendants of the House of Saxe-Meiningen can be found in the Barons von Saalfeld, who descend from the morganatic marriage of Ernst, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen with Katharina Jensen. Should Prince Konrad fail to de-morganatise either his nephew or the Barons von Saalfeld then upon his death the House of Saxe-Meiningen will become extinct in the male line. The closest heir will be the first non-morganatic member of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. ==Ancestry References External links== *A photograph of Prince Konrad Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:House of Saxe-Meiningen Category:Princes of Saxe-Meiningen ","title":"Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen"},{"id":"7459977","text":"The 1908 Italian Football Championship season was won by Pro Vercelli.

He received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Franklin and Marshall College in 1958 and a Bachelor of Civil Law from William & Mary School of Law in 1962. Buckwalter was a legal aid attorney in Lancaster from 1964 to 1966, and then was a clerk to Judges John Bowman and Anthony Appel of the Court of Common Pleas in Lancaster County. He left that position to become an assistant district attorney of for the county in 1970, and was made a full district attorney in 1978.

Unlike other cities, the bisection does not occur in the Central Business District, nor do the Interstates serve the downtown region, rather The Akron Innerbelt and to a much lesser extent Ohio State Highway 8 serve these functions. * Interstate 77 connects Marietta, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio. It features 15 interchanges, four of which permit freeway to freeway movements. It runs north-south at the southern part of the city to its concurrency with Interstate 76 (east) where it takes a westerly turn and after the concurrency takes a northwest turn. The cosigned section is highly congested and under review by the Ohio Department of Transportation. * Interstate 76 connects Medina, Ohio to Youngstown, Ohio and farther environs. It runs east-west and has 18 interchanges four of which are freeway to freeway. The East Leg was rebuilt in the 1990s to feature 6 lanes and longer merge lanes. The concurrency with Interstate 77 is eight lanes, with extremely close interchange spacing, high crash rates and heavy congestion. The Kenmore Leg is a four lane leg that is slightly less than two miles (3 km) long and connects to I-277. * Interstate 277 is an east-west spur that it forms with US 224 after I-76 splits to the north to form the Kenmore Leg. It is six lane and cosigned with U.S. 224. * The Akron Innerbelt is a six lane, spur from the I-76/I-77 concurrency and serves the urban core of the city. Its ramps are directional from the Interstates so it only serves west side drivers. ODOT is considering changing this design to attract more traffic to the route. The freeway comes to an abrupt end near the northern boundary of downtown where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The freeway itself is officially known as \\"The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Freeway\\". The freeway was originally designed to connect directly to Route 8, but plans were laid to rest in the mid seventies due to financial troubles. Advocacy groups such as the Akron Innerbelt Integration Initiative have promoted the idea of finishing the freeway, a contrast with the city administration that would like it destroyed and redeveloped. No announcements on its future have been made. * Route 8 the original state highway is a limited access route that connects Akron's northern suburbs with the Interstates. When I-77 moves to the west with I-76, Route 8 begins. The second freeway in Akron to be completed, it went through a major overhaul in 2003 with brand new ramps and access roads. In 2007 ODOT will begin to limit access on Route 8 from Route 303 to I-271, providing a high speed alternative to Cleveland. ==Roadways== Category:State highways in Ohio Category:Transportation in Akron, Ohio ","title":"Roads in Akron, Ohio"},{"id":"7460004","text":"Psychostick is an American comedy rock band from Tempe, Arizona, now residing in Chicago, Illinois, known for their silly image and usage of humor in their songs and lyrics. Their style is referred to by themselves and some online album review sites as \\"humorcore\\". To date they have released five albums nationally. Their debut album, We Couldn't Think of a Title, was released on May 16, 2003. Their second album, Sandwich, was released on May 5, 2009, and their third album, titled Space Vampires VS Zombie Dinosaurs in 3D, was released August 16, 2011. Their fourth album was released on the fourth of November in 2014 titled IV: Revenge of the Vengeance, followed by their latest album Do released on July 24, 2018 during a webcast. They began touring nationally in July 2006, and have toured with Mushroomhead, Look What I Did, Powerglove, Bobaflex, and have played with many national bands, including Three Days Grace, Army of Anyone, Sick Puppies, Anew Revolution, The Exies, Smile Empty Soul, as well as many others. ==HistoryOrigins and early years (2000‚Äì2003)=== Around the 1990s in Odessa, Texas, the first inception of Psychostick existed under the name \\"Asinine\\", with the line-up consisting of Josh Key on vocals, Steve W. on guitar, Marvin S. on bass, and Bozzy C. on percussion. In 2000, Key ended Asinine and moved to Phoenix, Arizona to follow high-school friend and future vocalist Rob Kersey. Needing to complete the line-up, they found drummer Alex Preiss, through an ad in the local \\"musicians wanted\\" section of the Phoenix New Times and through Alex, found bassist Hunter Alexander and played shows under the new name, \\"Psychostick\\". The band released two initial demo tapes, \\"Don't Bitch, It's Free\\" (September 2000) and \\"Die... A Lot!\\" (August 2001). Uninterested in the comedy-metal genre, Alexander departed from the band in December 2001, and was replaced by Mike Kocian. ===We Couldn't Think of a Title and early success (2003‚Äì2007)=== Psychostick performing in Austin, Texas in 2006. From left to right: Mike Kocian, Alex Dontre, Rob Kersey, and Josh Key. On May 16, 2003, the band self- released their debut album, We Couldn't Think of a Title, from which, after their record deal with Rock Ridge Records, was re-released on September 12, 2006. The album has had minor chart success in the US, reaching No. 41 on the Billboard's Top Heatseekers, No. 4 on the Billboard's Top Heatseekers (West North Central),[ Billboard's Top Heatseekers (West North Central)] and No. 48 on the Billboard's Top Independent Albums. The album contained the song \\"BEER!!\\", which would go on to be one of their most well-known songs. Psychostick gained notoriety in spring 2007, when their song \\"Beer\\" received heavy airplay on XM Radio's Liquid Metal show for seven weeks. The band, with additional guitarist Vince \\"V\\" Johansen, commenced touring nationally on June 13, 2006, playing alongside Bobaflex, as well as Indorphine, for the first few weeks. Johansen would leave the band in late 2006. On September 25, 2007, the band released their holiday EP, The Flesh Eating Roller Skate Holiday Joyride. It was originally intended as a split album with Indorphine but who were unable to find the time to work on their half of the album. The holiday EP was mildly successful, reaching No. 18 on Billboard's Top Holiday Albums. The stress of touring caused bassist Kocian to part ways with the band in 2007. ===Sandwich (2008‚Äì2009)=== Around the time of Kocian's departure from Psychostick, Indorphine disbanded after touring with Psychostick on the Holiday Hate 2007 tour in December. Needing a new bassist, the band contacted Indorphine vocalist Jimmy Grant to fill in the vacant bass slot. The band also recruited rhythm guitarist Jake McReynolds, figuring \\"they would do it all at once\\" since they were going through a line-up change. The band then embarked on their first tour with the 5-piece lineup, entitled the \\"Holy Crap We're Touring\\" tour, on February 6, 2008. In late 2008, the band went into the studio to record their second album, Sandwich. It was the band's first studio album since their 2003 debut album. The album finished production in January 2009 and was released on May 5, 2009 or, as what the band calls it, \\"Psycho de Mayo.\\" The album enjoyed the same success as their debut album, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard's Top Heatseekers and No. 41 on the Billboard's Top Independent Albums. The band then toured in celebration of the album's release, sharing select dates with 9mm Solution, Screaming Mechanical Brain, Severed Nerve, Saved By Ruin, and Diabase. In December 2009, after the Holiday Hate Tour: Season 3 tour, Jimmy Grant left the band for reasons unknown, followed by Jake McReynolds later in April 2010. ===Space Vampires VS Zombie Dinosaurs in 3D (2010‚Äì2013)=== Soon after releasing an EP The Digital Appetizer (with Joshy playing both guitar and bass on the EP), the band recruited Matty J. \\"Moose\\" Rzemyk through mutual acquaintance Billy Rymer, drummer of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The band then started the Parental Advisory Tour, playing with Green Jell√ø and Nashville Pussy. The band announced during a webcast on November 4, 2010, that they are working on their new album to be released in summer 2011. The title of the new album, Space Vampires VS Zombie Dinosaurs in 3D, was announced on another webcast on March 10, 2011, and the band has said that it will have a \\"Tentative August 2011 release date\\" through Rock Ridge Music. Through the band's Facebook on July 12, the album release was given an official date of August 16, 2011. In early 2011, Josh started working with an authoring company on putting Psychostick songs for sale on Rock Band Network. On January 19, 2012, \\"BEER!!\\" was released on the Xbox 360's Rock Band Network and is playable on Rock Band 3. On June 28, 2012, \\"Political Bum\\" was released. On February 1, 2013, \\"This is Not a Song, It's a Sandwich!\\" was released. ===Crowdfunding campaigns, Revenge of the Vengeance and Do (2013-present)=== In November 2013, the band started a crowdfunding campaign to build a studio, which would serve both to produce their next album, but also to produce other content like music videos and short films. The goal was successfully met a month later. The band's fourth album was released on November 4 of 2014. On September 18, Psychostick live streamed for two hours, announcing the title of their fourth album IV: Revenge of the Vengeance, the release date (4 November 2014), and the preorder packages. In July 2018, the band surprise released their fifth album Do; it's their first album released independently after their contract with Rock Ridge Music expired. The album has gone on to chart on Billboard as #1 Comedy Album, #6 Heatseekers East North Central, #14 Hard Rock Albums, #6 Heatseekers West North Central, #39 Rock Albums, #39 Independent Albums, #7 Heatseekers Mountain, #9 Heatseekers Psychostick premiered their newest single, \\"Rent in Peace\\" on August 22, 2019. James Rolfe who is best known to star as the Angry Video Game Nerd appears in the video. ==Musical style and lyrical themes== Most of Psychostick's lyrics revolve around observational comedy, binge drinking, broken relationships, and occasional pop culture references. Running gags include the repeated misspelling of the band's name, and the band's supposed unpopularity or the pigeonholing of the band as the band who plays the \\"Beer Is Good\\"-song. Some songs are parodies of various themes of music, such as love songs (Orgasm = Love), sad, depressing songs (Prozak Milkshake) or radio rock (#1 Radio $ingle). The band often makes use of short skits between songs, but occurrences of humor and scripted comedy also happen mid- song. Psychostick mixes influences from funk metal (particularly prevalent on We Couldn't Think of a Title), groove metal and nu metal. The band initially labelled themselves as \\"humorcore\\" as a joke, referencing a trend of the various \\"-core\\" genres at the time; Rawrb notes that \\"comedy metal is a better descriptor\\" of the band's music. Although lyrically rich in humor, unlike many bands who tend to use a lot of comedy, the instrumental portions of the songs are not neglected and are very serious. When interviewed about their style, Rawrb often compares how serious the band takes their music and lyrical content to how serious a comedian takes their comedy. He will often correct the interviewer saying, \\"We're comedic musicians that take every part of this band very seriously.\\" guitarist Joshy often reminds those who are curious that Psychostick is \\"serious about being dumb.\\" Both We Couldn't Think of a Title and Space Vampires VS Zombie Dinosaurs in 3D contained instrumental songs, but not without humour: Largiloquent Dithyramb's only lyrics are \\"DOG FOOD / TASTES GOOD / WITH CHEESE\\", while Six Pounds of Terror is played over the growling of an agitated Maltese dog.Meet the Six Pounds of Terror, Psychostick. The music is entirely produced by the band; guitarist Josh is responsible for the engineering and mixdown. ===Live performances=== During live shows and in videos, the band dons specific outfits (a spiky hat for Rawrb, a hachimaki for Josh and large moose antlers for Matty) and uses goofy prop comedy with objects like rubber chickens, stuffed animals or their instruments. Vocalist Rawrb has been known to use a Guitar Hero guitar and a tennis racket during performances. They have played a number of unrecorded songs live, including \\"The World's Shortest Song\\" (during \\"The Holiday Hate Tour\\" they called it \\"The Worlds Shortest Christmas Song.\\" During the \\"Sandwich CD Release Party Tour\\" they called it \\"The Whole Sandwich Album in 0.4 Seconds\\"), \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\\" \\"The Sombrero Prophecy,\\" \\"The Log Song\\" (a slinky parody from The Ren and Stimpy Show), the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme song, \\"Happy Birthday,\\" \\"HURRY UP!!\\" (a song played live for when a band member has to make an instrument repair) a rendition of Gloria Estefan's \\"Conga\\" (Rob and Josh each drag out a drum head and do some percussion themselves during the song), and Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up,\\" in a live attempt at rickrolling. More recently, Psychostick \\"metaled-up\\" several songs including \\"Danger Zone\\" by Kenny Loggins, the theme from Angry Birds and a mash-up of \\"Push It\\" by Static-X and \\"Push It\\" by Salt- n-Pepa. In their newest tour, called the \\"Our Tour Can Beat Up Your Tour Tour\\", the band covered the main theme from the Chemical Plant Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. ==Band membersCurrent members=== Psychostick With Full Force 2018 02.jpgSinger Rob Kersey Psychostick With Full Force 2018 06.jpgGuitarist Josh Key Psychostick With Full Force 2018 03.jpgDrummer Alex Dontre Psychostick With Full Force 2018 01.jpgBassist Matty J Rzemyk * Rob \\"Rawrb\\" Kersey ‚Äî lead vocals (2000‚Äìpresent) * Josh \\"The J\\" Key ‚Äî guitars, vocals (2000‚Äìpresent) * Alex \\"Shmalex/The Boy\\" Dontre (formerly Preiss) ‚Äî drums (2000‚Äìpresent) * Matty J \\"Moose\\" Rzemyk ‚Äî bass, vocals (2010‚Äìpresent) ===Former members=== * Hunter Alexander ‚Äî bass (2000‚Äì2001) * Mike \\"Mike Hawkizzard\\" Kocian ‚Äî bass, backing vocals (2001‚Äì2007) * Vince \\"V\\" Johansen ‚Äî guitar (2004‚Äì2006) * Jake \\"Jakermeister\\" McReynolds ‚Äî guitars, backing vocals (2008‚Äì2009) * Jimmy \\"Jimmychanga\\" Grant ‚Äî bass, vocals (2008‚Äì2009) ===Touring members=== * Jesse \\"Turff\\" McInturff ‚Äî rhythm guitar (Holiday Hate Tour 2007) * Cassidy Nee ‚Äî bass (Holiday Hate Tour 2007) * Rev.

It was abolished for the 1997 general election when it was replaced by Rochford and Southend East. Southend East was a mostly safe Conservative seat throughout its existence, although their majority was only just over 500 votes in 1966, and at the by-election in 1980 when the Conservatives held the seat by only 430 votes.

The Wrong War) is an episode of the television program Hornblower. It is set during the French Revolutionary Wars and very loosely based on the chapter of the same name in C.S. Forester's novel Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and on the actual ill-fated Quiberon expedition of 1795. The main title is based on the often derogatory term for the French used by the British (as well as other English speakers) and on the red coats of the British soldiers. The secondary title deals with Horatio's own duty to the Crown and the alliance with the French and his struggle with his own sympathy towards the French revolutionaries. ==Plot summary== Fran√ßois de Charette is a royalist general who raises a force of French exiles to restore the French king to power. He is supported by the British government, who provide Royal Navy vessels to ferry a combined expeditionary force of French royalist troops (the \\"frogs\\") and a half-battalion of British redcoats (the \\"lobsters\\") across the English Channel to Quiberon, but one important thing has gone wrong. A lieutenant carrying a copy of the orders has been murdered and the orders stolen. Captain Pellew, who is in charge of the transports, believes this to be the work of French spies and begs his superiors to call off the invasion, but they ignore him and the army sets off for disaster. Horatio Hornblower is assigned to hold and, if necessary, blow up the bridge at Muzillac. The French officer in charge of the royalist forces, Colonel Marquis de Moncoutant, is a nobleman who held feudal authority over the region prior to the revolution. He is obsessed with revenge, to the extent of guillotining all the republican officials and supporters who are taken prisoner. The French revolutionary forces counterattack, rout the royalists and execute de Moncoutant, using the same guillotine. Hornblower and his small naval detachment manage to reach the British troops, who conduct a disciplined retreat and reach their ships. The main departure from the original story is the introduction of French peasant girl Mariette, a schoolteacher who is fluent in English. She and Hornblower fall in love, but she is killed by French revolutionary troops en route back to his ship, as she tries to escape with him. ==Cast== * Ioan Gruffudd as Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower * Robert Lindsay as Captain Sir Edward Pellew * Jamie Bamber as Acting Lieutenant Archie Kennedy * Jonathan Coy as Lieutenant Bracegirdle * Paul Copley as Matthews * Sean Gilder as Styles * Peter Vaughan as Admiral Lord Hood * Samuel West as Major Lord Edrington * John Shrapnel as Fran√ßois de Charette * Antony Sher as Marquis de Moncoutant * Estelle Skornik as Mariette ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1999 television films Category:1999 films Category:1990s historical films Category:1990s war films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on historical novels Category:Films based on military novels Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in the 1790s Category:French Revolutionary Wars films Category:Hornblower (TV series) Category:War television films ","title":"The Frogs and the Lobsters"},{"id":"7460046","text":"Vokzalna () is a station on Dnipro Metro's Tsentralno‚ÄìZavodska Line.

Indult is a term from Catholic canon law referring to a permission to do something that would otherwise be forbidden. ==Description== Following the introduction of the Mass of Paul VI to replace the former rite in 1969‚Äì1970, a petition was sent to the Pope asking that the Tridentine rite be permitted to continue for those who wished in England and Wales. Some English Roman Catholics had an attachment to the Tridentine Mass, as the Mass which had been celebrated by the English Martyrs of the Reformation and by priests in the years in which Catholicism had been subjected to sometimes severe persecution. However, the petition noted the exceptional artistic and cultural heritage of the Tridentine liturgy, and was signed by many prominent non-Catholic figures in British society, including Agatha Christie, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Kenneth Clark, Robert Graves, F. R. Leavis, Cecil Day-Lewis, Nancy Mitford, Iris Murdoch, Yehudi Menuhin, Joan Sutherland and two Anglican bishops, those of Exeter and of Ripon.Rediscovering Traditionalism, John Casey John Cardinal Heenan approached Pope Paul VI with the petition and asked that use of the Tridentine Mass be permitted. On 5 November 1971, the Pope granted the request.

Sanjabi (; 11 September 1905 ‚Äì 4 July 1995) was an Iranian politician of National Front. ==Early life== He was born in Kermanshah in September 1905 to the chief of the Kurdish Sanj√¢bi tribe. He studied law and politics at Sorbonne University. He worked as a law professor at the University of Tehran. ==Career== Sanjabi and Allahyar Saleh led the Iran Party, a nationalist, progressive, leftist and anti-Soviet group, in the 1950s. The party became part of the National Front. Sanjabi was a loyal supporter of Mohammad Mossadegh and he later served as minister of education under Mossadegh in 1952. Mossadegh had led the movement to nationalize the British-controlled oil industry in Iran (which, after nationalization, became known as the National Iranian Oil Company) and after this was accomplished, he became engaged in a heated battle with the British (who had previously controlled the oil industry and wished to reassert control over it) and with the forces rallying around Mohammad Reza Shah (the king of Iran who was opposed to Mossadegh's policies vis-a-vis the British, as well as the prime minister's efforts at limiting the Shah's power and influence). After a CIA-MI6 coup d'√©tat overthrew Mossadegh in August 1953 and reestablished the Shah on the throne, Sanjabi, along with other Mossadegh supporters, went into opposition against the Shah's regime. He was heavily involved in the formation of the Second National Front in 1960. The reconstituted National Front was to remain active for five years, but under increasingly worsening circumstances. Despite its moderate demands for electoral reforms and a Shah that would \\"reign and not rule\\", the Shah refused to tolerate the Front's activities. His powerful security forces, most notably the infamous SAVAK, silenced the likes of Sanjabi and other secular democrats. Due to this and a variety of other factors, it had dissolved by 1965. The Front was to remain dormant until the late 1970s. It was revived in late 1977 by Sanjabi as its leader. As the general secretary of the National Front during the revolutionary uprising of 1978‚Äì1979, Sanjabi and his colleagues initially wished to negotiate a peaceful solution with the Shah. However, on 3 November 1978, he met as representative of the National Front with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in France. He had gone there hoping to convince Khomeini to support the creation of a coalition government headed by the National Front. Despite the rising revolutionary fervor, Sanjabi and many other liberals had remained loyal to the idea of a constitutional monarchy with the Shah as ceremonial figurehead and they wished to bring Khomeini over to their point of view. Khomeini, however, refused to budge and reiterated his demand for the overthrow of the monarchy. In the end, Sanjabi, acting as head of the National Front, capitulated to Khomeini's demands. In addition, he accepted the leadership of Khomeini and opposed to the alliance with the Tudeh party. Sanjabi emerged from his meeting \\"with a short declaration that spoke of both Islam and democracy as basic principles\\",Modern Iran Nikki R. Keddie, Yann Richard p. 233 and Sanjabi declared his support for Khomeini and joined his forces. After the overthrow of the monarchy on 11 February 1979, Khomeini \\"explicitly refused to put the same word, democracy, into either the title of the Republic or its constitution.\\" Sanjabi served as the foreign minister of the provisional government led by Mahdi Bazargan. Sanjabi was in office from to February to April 1979. ===Attacks and arrests=== Sanjabi's house in Tehran was bombed on 8 April 1978. The underground committee for revenge, a state- financed organization, proclaimed the responsibility of the bombing. He was arrested on 11 November 1978 and freed on 6 December. ==Personal life== Sanjabi was married to Fakhrolmolouk Ardalan Sanjabi (7 September 1921 - 21 February 2011) and had four children, three sons and a daughter. Khosrow, Parviz, Saeed and Maryam ==Later years and death== Sanjabi left Iran in 1982 and went to Paris. Later he settled in the US.

Hefle was also a cyclist and a cyclist judge. ==Early life== Hefle was born in Milwaukee, WI. Hefle's father was Louis Hefle. Hefle's mother was Nancy (nee Woods) Hefle. == Education == Hefle earned all three of her degrees at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (B.S. - Microbiology, M.S. - Food safety, and Ph.D. - Food toxicology/immunology/allergy), then did her post-doctoral work in the allergy section at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Medical School. == Career  Food Allergy Research === In 1995, Hefle became a Research Assistant Professor of Food Science and Technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Hefle was a rearcher and co- director of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP). Hefle performed research and extension to the food industry. Hefle was an expert on food allergies and food allergens. In 1999, in response to protesters of genetically altered food, Hefle noted that there is no evidence that genetically modified foods have caused spikes in allergies. Hefle developed and validated ELISA tests for many allergens. ELISA is an acronym for Enzyme- Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays. Hefle earned two patents for analytical methods on aflatoxin detection and her research led to the development of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detecting any residual allergen foods that could contaminate other foods and created ELISAs for detecting peanut, egg, almond, walnut, and milk products. Hefle authored or co-authored over 130 peer-reviewed publications and earned two patents as a result of her efforts. Hefle was active in several professional organizations. Hefle received the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Samuel Cate Prescott Award in 2000. In 2004, Hefle was named an IFT Fellow. In 1999, Hefle was given the University of Nebraska's Institute of Agricultural and Natural Resources Dinsdale Family Faculty Award and earned the Marie Kelso Speaker Award from the candy and confectionery industries. Hefle also was named fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology in 2003. As a member of IFT, Hefle was active in leadership role in the organization's Biotechnology, and Toxicology & Safety Evaluation divisions, was a Scientific Lecturer, a member of the Biotechnology Issues Task Force, and a Council Representative to the IFT Executive Committee. == Cycling == Hefle was an avid cycling rider and racer, competing since the early 1990s in road and track cycling events. Becoming a cycling judge in 1991, she advanced to the rank of national commissaire in 2006. Hefle was one of only 19 women to ever attain this honor in the United States and one of only 50 overall to do so. The United States has a total of 1500 cycling officials in this country as of 2006. In the mid-1990s, she founded American Bicycle Racing (ABR) in Tinley Park, Illinois in order to bring out more grass roots cycling and support to junior and master-level riders that USA Cycling was neglecting. Hefle worked as its technical director until her death in 2006. == Personal life == On August 30, 2006, Hefle died of cancer in Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S. She was 46 years old. A memorial was held in her honor in Lincoln, Nebraska on September 14, 2006. IFT had an \\"In Memoriam\\" article on her in their October 2006 Food Technology magazine.

She was the first wife of the explorer, John Franklin. ==Early years and education== Eleanor Anne Porden was born in London, 14 July 1795. She was the younger surviving daughter of the architect William Porden, of Berners Street, London, an eminent architect, and his wife Mary Plowman. Another sister and brother had died in infancy. Her mother was an invalid, and after an older sister's marriage, Eleanor nursed her mother from 1809 until her death in 1819. An intelligent young woman, Porden was educated privately at home. She acquired with facility a knowledge of several languages, and was interested in the arts and sciences, Porden attracted attention for her poetry from an early age. Her family and friends were fond of literature, and a salt-box for poetical contributions was kept at her father's house. Her first major work, the allegorical The Veils; or the Triumph of Constancy, was placed in that depository before she had completed her seventeenth year. ==Career== Published in 1815, when she was twenty, she prefaced The Veils with an introduction which gave a clear indication of her interests and education:‚Äî\\"The author, who considers herself a pupil of the Royal Institution, being at that time attending the Lectures given in Albemarle-Street, on Chemistry, Geology, Natural History, and Botany, by Sir Humphry Davy, Mr. Brand, Dr. Roger (sic, for Roget), Sir James Edward Smith, and other eminent men, she was induced to combine these subjects with her story; and though her knowledge of them was in a great measure orally acquired, and therefore cannot pretend to be extensive or profound, yet, as it was derived from the best teachers, she hopes it will seldom be found incorrect.\\" It included a dedication to the Countess Spencer, and obtained the admiration of her social circle. The reviews of the period made favourable mention of the work. It represents the regions of the four so- called elements, earth, air, fire, and water; and shows their active properties under the imagery of fabled inhabitants engaged in antagonistic struggles for supremacy. A critic of Virtue and Company (1875) stated:‚Äî\\"The operation of this Rosicrucian machinery is ingenious, and the versification not below mediocrity. Crudeness and pedantry are the most prominent faults of The Veils.\\" In 1818, she met her future husband, John Franklin, on board his ship, HMS Trent, before his departure on David Buchan's British Naval North Polar Expedition. This inspired a short poem, The Arctic Expeditions. In 1822, she produced her best work, an epic poem on the subject of the third Crusade. It was during Franklin's absence that she researched and wrote the historical epic poem, C≈ìur de Lion, or The Third Crusade. A poem, in sixteen books. This was published in two volumes, with a dedication to the king, George IV. Based on historical research, and also on mediaeval romances, it recounts the adventures of Richard I of England on the Third Crusade. Other prominent characters include Guy of Lusignan, Isabella of Jerusalem (portrayed as a femme fatale), and Conrad of Montferrat, whom she depicts as a flawed, tragic Byronic hero, in contrast with the unequivocally hostile treatment by her contemporary Walter Scott in The Talisman. She also depicts Richard's former fianc√©e, Alasia of France, fighting for the Saracens as the female knight Zorayda, and being mortally wounded by her own son (fathered by Henry II). Indeed, despite such fanciful episodes, strongly influenced by Torquato Tasso, her poem has more historical content than Scott's better-known novel. Her sources included the works of Joseph Fran√ßois Michaud and Charles Mills. Also in 1822, Franklin returned from the Arctic, her father died, and she ruptured a blood-vessel on the lungs, which increased an inherent tendency to consumption. She made her acceptance of Franklin's proposal conditional on his acceptance of her continuing her career as a poet after their marriage. She wrote to him six months before the wedding:‚Äî\\"it was the pleasure of Heaven to bestow those talents on me, and it was my father's pride to cultivate them to the utmost of his power. I should therefore be guilty of a double dereliction of duty in abandoning their exercise.\\" ==Death== She married Franklin on 19 August 1823. She gave birth to their daughter, Eleanor Annabelle, on 3 June 1824, after which for a short time her health revived. Childbirth, however, accelerated the advance of the tuberculosis from which she suffered, and she died on 22 February 1825, aged twenty-nine. She had encouraged her husband not to let his concerns for her health impede his career, and he had set off on the second Arctic Land expedition shortly before her death. On his return, he married her friend Jane Griffin.

The Romans made a \\"Pharum\\" at the port, that was renowned as one of the best of Ancient Levant; then created a Roman road from southern Anatolia toward Berytus and Damascus, that greatly improved the commerce through the port of Laodicea. The city enjoyed a huge economic prosperity thanks to the wine produced in the hills around the port and exported to all the empire. The city was famous because of the textile products. Laodicea minted coins from an early Roman date, but the most famous are from Severian times. Classical Statue at the National Museum of Latakia A sizable Jewish population lived in Laodicea during the first century. Under Septimius Severus the city was fortified and was made for a few years the capital of Roman Syria: in this period Laodicea grew to be a city of nearly 40000 inhabitants and had even an hippodrome. Christianity was the main religion in the city after Constantine I and there were many bishops of Laodicea who participated in ecumenical councils, mainly during Byzantine times. The heretic Apollinarius was bishop of Laodicea in the 4th century, when the city was fully Christian but with a few remaining Jews. An earthquake damaged the city in 494 AD and successively Justinian I made Laodicea the capital of the Byzantine province of \\"Theodorias\\" in the early sixth century. Laodicea remained its capital for more than a century until the Arab conquest. ==Bishops of Laodicea== Saint Paul visited Laodicea and converted the first Christians in the city. Slowly the bishops of Laodicea grew in importance but were always under the Patriarch of Antioch. The most important bishops were: * Lucius of Cyrene (1st century), mentionedin Acts, considered first bishop by tradition * Thelymidres (fl. 250‚Äì251), bishop during the Decian persecution. * Heliodorus, became bishop during the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (251‚Äì253) * Socrates (died. c. 264) * Eusebius (died c. 268), a native of Alexandria in Egypt * Anatolius (c. 268 ‚Äì 282/283), a native of Alexandria in Egypt * Stephen, apostasized during the Diocletianic persecution (303‚Äì313) * Theodotus (303/313 ‚Äì c. 335), an Arian * George (died 359), an Arian * After George there were two rival bishops in Laodicea: ** Pelagius (360‚Äì381/394), an Arian ** Apollinarius (c. 360 ‚Äì c. 392), founded the Apollinarians * Elpidius, bishop by 394, deposed in 404, restored in 416 * Macarius (429-451) * Maximus (around 458) * Nicia * Costantinus (510‚Äì518) * Stephanus (553) ==NotesBibliography== * Butcher, Kevin.

A fictional story of involvement and disillusionment with Scientology, the film explicitly uses Scientology terms throughout, as well as including clips from actual Scientology promotional and training videos. It was released as free use media to the Internet in September 2006 by the filmmaker. The brochure of the Indie Memphis film festival stated that The Bridge was the \\"first feature film\\" about the Church Of Scientology. While it is set against the background of the Church of Scientology and the Sea Org, the characters and situations depicted are fictional. == Plot == Sea Org officer Ronnie Miscavige describes the planetary Scientology dissemination campaign. After the title sequence, Scientologist Diane Wheat (Carole Smith) is seen in an auditing session with the head of her local church, Robert Solomon (Bill Baker). Diane describes her trouble with finances and having her car repossessed. The next day Robert has Diane model her financial difficulties in clay. She is worried that her other financial obligations keep her from moving up Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom. Robert tells her that she can work at the church in exchange for services to move up the Bridge. Parallel to these events, Richard Grey (Tom Padgett) is trying to contact his daughter Amy at the Flag Land Base in Clearwater. Church employees refuse to allow him to speak to her because, unbeknownst to him, he has been declared a suppressive person. He arrives at the local church on Saturday seeking more information. Diane, who is working as a receptionist, hands him a copy of the ethics order declaring him a suppressive person, and he leaves. The next day, Diane is working at the church again when two teenage girls arrive. The girls have seen the South Park episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" and want to attend a service for their own amusement. Diane tells them that the church does not have Sunday services, and shows them a promotional film for Dianetics instead. At home, Richard is reading the Operation Clambake and Lermanet.com web sites when he receives a panicked instant message from a friend. The friend tells him to watch a news report from Clearwater, and he learns that Amy has died after falling from the Fort Harrison Hotel. Shortly afterward, Robert calls Richard and informs him that he may not attend the funeral because Amy and her mother have disconnected from him. At a celebration of L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, Robert announces that Diane has attained the state of Clear and gives her a Clear bracelet. After the celebration, he takes the bracelet away (but reminds her that she may purchase one of her own as they are not free) and shows her a film that encourages her to continue on the Bridge by taking the Operating Thetan courses at Flag. Late in the night, while she is cleaning, a distraught Richard comes by and asks if he can talk to anyone about being allowed into the funeral service. She refuses, but Richard insists on dropping off some old Scientology books and tapes that used to belong to Amy. Diane listens to one of Amy's cassettes from the high‚Äìlevel Clearwater Scientology center and hears a man's voice speaking scoldingly about being \\"willing to talk to the auditor\\", in an impenetrable jargon laden with nonsense words. In the final act, protesters are seen outside the church loudly picketing over the death of Amy. When Diane walks out to confront them, they ask her to step outside the church gate and proceed to tell her the story of Xenu and the Wall of Fire from Operating Thetan level 3 (OT III). Robert notices Diane outside the church, tells her to go back inside, and threatens the protesters, but not before they have finished telling her the story. Once Diane is back inside, Robert runs her on a security check to determine whether she has any doubts or ill will toward Scientology. Richard calls Amy's mother, who is still in Scientology and asks to be allowed at the funeral. She refuses and ends the call to avoid being sent to ethics. In the evening, Robert reminds Diane of the need to continue up the Bridge, and mentions the Wall of Fire at OT III. That night, disillusioned after returning to a room which earlier she was prevented from entering (being told it is a fully furnished office for the return of L. Ron Hubbard) and discovering it is merely a closet, Diane walks out the door of the church and leaves Scientology. The film ends with a written dedication: \\"For all who speak out ‚Äî for those who have been silenced.\\" ==Cast== *Bill Baker as Scientology leader *Nathan Berry as second Protester *Adam Craycroft as Protester *Brian Forrest as Micah D.

At the time of the film's release, Hanover was an 18-year-old student. His studies in college focused on film. Former Scientologists were involved in the production of the film; in addition to critics of Scientology associated with Operation Clambake. Hanover noted the film was an original script which he wrote along with his assistant director. They wrote the script prior to eliciting input from others. Prominent critics of Scientology later assisted with funding, input, and acting roles in the film. The film production took place in Tennessee. Hanover filmed The Bridge over a total period of six days, for a production budget of US$600.00. == Distribution == The Bridge premiered at the Operation Clambake 10-year anniversary in Stavanger, Norway on September 2, 2006. Operation Clambake stated of the premiere, \\"We are especially excited for the movie 'The Bridge' ... The world premiere in Stavanger is a great honor\\". It was shown at the 9th annual Indie Memphis Film Festival in October 2006, as a feature presentation. Hanover released copies of the film in 2006, to Google Video and Internet Archive. The film credits stated: \\"The Bridge' is licensed as royalty‚Äìfree digital media, and may be distributed online for personal viewing without permission. All offline distribution rights are reserved by Brett Hanover.\\" ==Director requests removal of film from Internet== Jeannette Walls reported in an MSNBC entertainment column that the film had been removed from the Internet. MSNBC quoted journalist and scientology critic Mark Bunker, who stated, \\"It appears that Scientology has hired investigators to dig up dirt on Brett Hanover to shudder him into silence. They have succeeded.\\" In a case study on fair use, Jackson West of NewTeeVee cited the removal of the film from the Internet as an example of \\"a worst‚Äìcase scenario of inappropriate behavior by a wealthy rightsholder toward work critical of that rightsholder\\". A few weeks after the film's release to the Internet, Hanover requested its removal, stating on his website, \\"due to copyright issues, I ask that this film be withdrawn from circulation ... Do not contact me concerning this film, I am no longer supporting it.\\" (Due to frames, click Films, then \\"A Word About 'The Bridge'\\"). As of 2007, the notice was taken down. This statement itself by Hanover and all references to the film were subsequently removed from his website. The Internet Archive removed the film from its site, stating there were rights issues involved; YouTube and Google also removed copies of the film from their websites, but the film has since been reposted by other users, and has not been removed again. ==Reception== Cory Doctorow reviewed the film for Boing Boing, and commented, \\"It's not a bad movie ‚Äî it moves a little slow, some of the dialog is stilted, but not bad for an indie feature shot in five days, and the information about the Church jibes with my own research into its practices.\\" Chris Davis of Memphis Flyer wrote, \\"This locally produced feature directed by Brett Hanover uses materials created by the Church of Scientology and stories told by former members of L. Ron Hubbard's controversial sci‚Äìfi religion to build a tragic narrative about misplaced faith and insidious fraud. Scientologists will hate it. People who hate Scientologists won't like it nearly as much as the Tom Cruise episode of South Park.\\" The Commercial Appeal characterized the film as a \\"fact‚Äìbased dramatization of life inside the Church of Scientology\\". Journalist and Scientology critic Mark Bunker observed, \\"It took a lot of courage to make the movie and a lot of talent to make it a good movie.\\" Allmovie classified the production as a feature film \\"Religious Drama\\", involving themes of \\"Cons and Scams\\". Jackson West of NewTeeVee commented, \\"the production value is minimal and the structure episodic, making for a somewhat wooden narrative. But the premise and script were helped by efforts from former Scientologists and anti- cultists to craft an allegorical critique of the Church of Scientology.\\" American skeptic and activist freethinker, Jim Lippard, recommended the film stating, \\"Watch it, it's pretty well done.\\" ==See also== *List of American films of 2006 *The Profit *The Bridge to Total Freedom *Scientology in popular culture *Scieno Sitter ==Endnotes== : Mark Bunker won an Emmy Award in 2006 from the Pacific Southwest Emmy Awards division of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. : The Bridge director and producer, Brett Hanover, designated websites Xenu.net and Xenutv.com as \\"official sources for information\\" about the film. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2006 films Category:American films Category:Films about religion Category:English-language films Category:Scientology in popular culture Category:Works critical of Scientology ","title":"The Bridge (2006 drama film)"},{"id":"7460231","text":"The white-headed buffalo weaver or white-faced buffalo-weaver (Dinemellia dinemelli) is a species of passerine bird in the family Ploceidae native to East Africa. The buffalo part of its name derives from its habit of following the African buffalo, feeding on disturbed insects. Two subspecies are recognized. ==Taxonomy== The white-headed buffalo weaver was first described by the German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell in 1845. ===Subspecies=== Two subspecies of the white-headed buffalo weaver are now recognized. *D. d. dinemelli (E. R√ºppell, 1845), northern part of its range: Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, northern Kenya. *D. d. boehmi (A. Reichenow, 1885), southern part of its range: Kenya and Tanzania. ==Description== The white-headed buffalo weaver is in length and in weight. In addition to its white head and underparts, the white-headed buffalo weaver has a vividly orange-red rump and undertail coverts. Its thighs are dark brown. Narrow white bands can be found on the wings. Both sexes are similar in plumage and hard to differentiate. The bill is conical and black. D. d. dinemelli has a brown tail, whereas D. d. boehmi has a black tail. ==Distribution and habitat== The white-headed buffalo weaver is native to the African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It prefers habitats such as savanna, and shrublands, but especially dry brush and acacia thickets. ==Behaviour== Perched at the National Aviary Like most weavers, it is a gregarious bird which forages on the ground for insects, especially beetles and butterflies, fruits, and seeds, often in company with starlings. Foraging is often done in groups of 3‚Äì6 birds. It has various calls and the sound is sometimes parrot-like: ‚Äúskwieeer‚Äù, ‚Äúkiiyerr‚Äù, a ringing and repetitious ‚Äútew‚Äù. In addition, variable sounds such as chuckles and whistles can be heard at breeding and roosting sites. The sounds are slow and drawn out. They also make trills: ‚Äútsu-weely- weely-wair‚Äù. They often perch in trees and hang upside-down and can be very noisy. Breeding and roosting is done in groups and they can be defensive against intruders, usually by making noise. Altercations are rarely fatal and usually vocal. Males display to females by spreading their wings to show their white wing-patches and red-orange tail-coverts. Breeding pairs are monogamous and nests are built together. The breeding season is related to rainfall and varies according to local conditions. Nest materials are pushed together, not interwoven, to form an oval wide. A short entrance tube opens downwards and is about above the ground. Soft materials line the inner portions of the nest, which usually has several rooms, with defensive thorny branches on the outside. A large tree will have several of their nests, which other birds, such as the African pygmy-falcon, are known to use instead of building their own. The female incubates 3‚Äì5 greyish to pale blue eggs with red, brown and olive markings for 11‚Äì14 days. Both parents feed the chicks. ==ReferencesExternal links== * White-headed buffalo-weaver - Species text in Weaver Watch. white-headed buffalo weaver Category:Birds of East Africa Category:Birds described in 1845 ","title":"White-headed buffalo weaver"},{"id":"7460244","text":"Toshiko Akiyoshi in Japan (also released as Long Yellow Road, Toshiko Akiyoshi Quartet) is an album by pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi, recorded at the Osaka Expo Hall in Osaka, Japan in 1970 and released by Toshiba Records.

The 2001 census recorded a population of 492 in the Parish Council area of Corsenside of which West Woodburn is the main settlement. The village is situated south of the border with Scotland and about north of Hexham. West Woodburn lies on the line of Dere Street, a Roman road which linked Eboracum (York) to the area around Din Eidyn (Edinburgh), and thus later England to Scotland. To the west is the remains of a Roman fort known as Habitancum. The route is now the A68 road. The River Rede, a major tributary of the River North Tyne, flows through the heart of the village. The river gives its name to the valley of Redesdale, as the local area is called. Telfer and Old Hemp Memorial West Woodburn's most famous resident of recent times was PC Joseph Carroll, husband of Caroline Carroll, a primary school teacher. On 13 April 2006 PC Carroll was killed in a road traffic incident. PC Carroll was killed by Stephen Graham, a communications instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in an incident that was later found to be manslaughter. Mr Graham engaged the handbrake (at 70 mph) of the PC's patrol car whilst he was being taken to a cell for the night after being arrested. Since this incident regulations of the transport of people in police custody have been reviewed. It is believed that if PC Carroll had not been wearing his seat belt he would have survived the incident. Inspector Kerr Henry who was in the car with PC Carroll and Mr Graham was injured along with Graham. Another little known, but extremely influential resident of West Woodburn, was Adam Telfer and his sheepdog Old Hemp. Telfer was a shepherd who lived in the village circa 1893 and is best known for being the man who first bred the Border Collie sheepdog. A campaign was started to install a memorial to Telfer and Old Hemp, and permission was granted by the relevant authorities.

Born in Philadelphia, Lowe started Teen Records and in 1955 was working with Freddie Bell and the Bellboys. He asked Freddie Bell to rewrite the lyrics of \\"Hound Dog\\" to appeal to a broader radio audience. Teen Records and the group had a regional hit with this version of the song, which was one of four songs the group did with Lowe. It was this same version that Elvis Presley heard in Las Vegas, Nevada, adopted, recorded, and made his own. Lowe went on to co-pen with Kal Mann the chart-topping song, \\"Teddy Bear\\", for the same singer. Bernie Lowe sometimes masqueraded as 'Harold Land'. This enabled him to be affiliated with both ASCAP and BMI. Lowe founded Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's Cameo Records in 1956, and Cameo was later expanded into the Cameo-Parkway Records label. The owners then signed a then unknown singer, Ernest Evans, to their burgeoning label. Evans would soon change his name to Chubby Checker, whose success helped Cameo-Parkway become one of the largest independent record labels in the United States.

Lydgate's work was in turn inspired by Giovanni Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium (\\"Concerning the Falls of Illustrious Men\\") and the other significant work of exemplary literature in English: The Monk's Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer. The title refers to holding a mirror up to the actions of famous people and reflecting their deeds so that magistrates and other people in important positions can learn from their errors. Most of the poems take the form of ghosts examining themselves and their deeds in front of a mirror. Similar titles were popular in the middle ages and there were numerous other works which presented themselves as a speculum (Latin for \\"mirror\\") chief among them the Speculum Maius by Vincent de Beauvais, who lived during the time. ==Contributors== William Baldwin and George Ferrers were the first editors of the work and the principal contributors. Between them they are credited with writing fifteen of the nineteen lives which made up the work when it was published in 1559 by Thomas Marsh, although some of the lives are unsigned and are only conjectured to be written by them. Other contributing poets include: Thomas Phaer, Thomas Chaloner and Thomas Churchyard, with one poem supposedly by John Skelton despite his having died thirty years before. There are also some links in prose between the poems, conversations between the poets themselves which mention several other noble lives. Baldwin also sets forth his reasons for beginning the work: :When the printer had purposed with hym selfe to printe Lidgate‚Äôs booke of the fall of Princes, and had made privye thereto, many both honourable and worshipfull, he was counsailed by dyvers of them, to procure to have the storye contynewed from where as Bochas [Boccaccio] lefte, unto this presente time, chiefly of such as Fortune had dalyed with here in this ylande‚Ä¶which advice liked him so well, that hee requyred mee to take paynes therein. ==Editions== A first edition of the work was compiled as early as 1555 by the publisher John Weyland, but only the title page remains, attached to his edition of Lydgate. Weyland was apparently denied a licence to publish by the Lord Chancellor Stephen Gardiner effectively suppressing the work and putting the publisher out of business. Baldwin in a later printing commented that: :\\"The wurke was begun & part of it printed iiii years agoe, but hyndred by the Lord Chancellor that then was.\\" Gardiner died the same year but the work was still not immediately published. This was a difficult time in England during the reign of Mary I when most works were suspected of having a political subtext. Poems dealing with the mistakes of the nobility of the preceding age were bound to be controversial, either by insulting the ancestors of the ruling class or, under the pretext of criticism, subtly praising the regime's political enemies. The accession of Queen Elizabeth I, which brought with it a change in the country's religion, allowed the publication of the 1559 edition. Despite press restrictions easing under the new queen the subject was still difficult. Baldwin's original plan, inferred from clues in the extant poems, seems to have been to write three volumes of lives: up to the reign of Edward VI, up to the reign of Richard III of England and lastly lives up to the reign of Mary. Although it appears that the work was well received Baldwin did not continue the plan. Whether this was due to ill health‚Äîhe probably died around 1563‚Äîor because the recent lives were more controversial, is uncertain, but it is significant that the next major expansion of the work confined itself mainly to the ancient past. Traditionally the impetus and planning for the entire work has been ascribed to Thomas Sackville. As he was only eighteen years old at the time of the first edition this seems unlikely, and he is listed as a contributor only in the third edition of 1563. The reason for Sackville receiving much of the credit for the work is in part that he was the most famous of the writers to work on the Mirror but also because his contributions, Induction and The Complaint of Henry Duke of Buckingham, are often the only ones regarded as having any lasting literary merit. Another reason for the ascription to Sackville is due to the reorganisations the work underwent in later editions, giving accidental prominence to Sackville's sections and confusing later readers. The edition of 1563 contained only eight extra lives and of these at least one is known to have been written around the time of the earlier poems but left out when they were published. The next edition in 1574 was printed again by Thomas Marsh with the editor and main author being John Higgins. Confusingly the new edition was named The first parte of the Mirour for Magistrates as it dealt with much earlier lives which were placed before the poems of the previous editions. Whilst the poetic style is markedly similar to the other poems, Higgins is seen as a much inferior poet and he greatly changed the focus of the work. The critical assessment of the lives of people from recent history which was evident in the compositions of Baldwin's and his contemporary writers, gave way to mostly laudatory accounts of the distant legends of the early Britons. What was once a politically contentious book, examining lives offering warnings to the present on the errors of the past, was now a work displaying national pride in England's history; many of which were taken from the largely mythical Historia Regum Britanniae. This focus on England's supposed glorious past and often defiance of Rome had much to do with the country being alienated from much of the rest of Europe because of its Protestant religion. Thomas Blenerhasset, in 1578, took it upon himself to write another collection of lives of ancient Britons but as this was with a different printer it did not include the previous poems. Because this work robbed Higgins of British material for his next edition, the majority of the new lives printed in 1587 were noble Romans. He also include a couple of poems by Francis Dingley: Flodden Field and Lamentation of James IV. By the 1610 edition the once popular Mirror had fallen out of fashion and its reputation was tarnished even more by the poor editing skills of Richard Niccols. He incorporated most of Blenerhasset's work but removed numerous lives and most of the links in prose between the poems. Why some of the lives were removed is unclear but some clearly might have embarrassed the new Scottish ruling class of the new king James I. He also added ten of his own poems including a more patriotic account of Alfred the Great to replace Blenerhasset's poem, which focused on Alfred being destroyed by lust, and England‚Äôs Eliza a homage to the late queen. Ignoring the omissions of the Niccols edition, the entire work contained almost one hundred lives, covering the period from Albanact in 1085 BC to Elizabeth in 1603 and written over 60 years. Whilst the work was dismissed and largely forgotten after 1610 the lives from the Baldwin era were popular and highly regarded during the Tudor period. Philip Sidney, mentions the work in his Defence of Poesy, saying that it was \\"meetly furnished of beautiful parts\\". The influence of the work was evident in many contemporary works such as Albion's England by the poet William Warner and Cromwell by Michael Drayton which was actually included in the 1610 edition. It was also significant for its development of the form of tragedy in English literature, with Higgins' story of Lier and Cordila providing a source for Shakespeare's King Lear. ==Modern reception== Most later critics, if they mention the work at all, can not avoid pointing out its many faults. Often only Sackville's contribution is regarded as worthy of preservation. Many of the other poems are told in a dull, didactic tone and Edmund Gosse, writing in 1913, whilst offering guarded praise, said \\"‚Ä¶the unflinching poetasters grind out in their monotonous rime royal‚Ä¶\\"Gosse, Edmund, Gossip in a Library ==The lives of the various editions== What follows is a list of the lives added in the principal editions of the Mirror for Magistrates: ===1559=== Robert Tresilian, Roger Mortimer, Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, Thomas Mowbrey, Richard II, Owen Glendower, Henry Percy, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Thomas, Earl of Salisbury, James I of Scotland, William de la Pole, Jack Cade, Richard, Duke of York, John Clifford, John Tiptoft, Richard, Earl of Warwick, Henry VI, George, Duke of Clarence, Edward IV Story in prose of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and his wife Eleanor Cobham ===1563=== Anthony Woodville, William Hastings, Henry, Duke of Buckingham, William Collingbourne, Richard III, Shore‚Äôs Wife (Jane Shore), Edmund Beaufort and the Blackesmith (Lord Audley) ===1574=== Albanactus, Humber, Locrinus, Estrildis, Sabrine daughter of Estrildis, Maddan, Malin son of Maddan, Mempricius, Bladud, Cordila, Morgan, Forrex, Porrex, Kimarus, Morindus, Nennius and in a 1575 copy Irenglas ===1578=== Guidericus, Carassus, Helena, Vortiger, Uther Pendragon, Cadwallader, Sigebert, Lady Ebbe, Alurede, Egelrede, Edric and Harold ===1587=== Iago, Pinnar, Stater, Rudacke, Brennus, Emerianus, Chirinnus, Varianus, Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Guiderius, Lelius Hamo, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Londricus, Severus, Fulgentius a Pict, Geta, Caracalla, Nicholas Burdet, James IV, Flodden Field and Cardinal Wolsey ===1610=== Arthur, Edmund Ironside, Alfred, Godwin, Robert Curthose, Richard I, John, Edward II, Edward V, Richard III and Elizabeth ==References== *Budra, Paul, Mirror for Magistrates and the De Casibus Tradition (2000) University of Toronto Press Inc. *Ward and Trent, eds. et al. 1907-1921.

Young, produced by Herbert F. Solow, and starring Tom Conti, Giancarlo Giannini and Edward James Olmos. It is based on a novel by Celia Gittelson with screenplay by Richard Kramer and David S. Ward under a different name. It was the last film to be distributed by Embassy Pictures. ==Plot== A year after his election, a youthful Pope (Conti) longs to be involved in ordinary people‚Äôs lives again, as he was when he was a priest. During an audience, the Pope communicates with a deaf mute young girl whose village has no priest. Accidentally locked out of the Vatican, the Pope travels to the small impoverished and demoralized village, his identity concealed by his beard growth. He realizes that the people need to rebuild a dilapidated aqueduct but, more importantly, that they must regain their community spirit and self-sufficiency. Without expertise and, initially, only the help of some street-wise orphans, he starts construction. All this is watched skeptically by a mysterious neighbour played by Giannini and opposed by local thugs led by Ciolino (Olmos) whose ill-gotten gains depend on the village remaining overly dependent on outsiders. ==Themes== Although this movie is often classified as a comedy, it has serious themes, including what it takes for a community to develop resilience and how redemption occurs. The \\"cry\\" \\"heard\\" from a mute girl for a priest in her village comes at a time when the young Pope is going through a spiritual crisis. When he locks himself out of his lofty Vatican world, he makes his way to Montepetra (Mount of Peter, or stone) and begins to grasp his true vocation again by challenging tyranny and helping return water (baptismal grace) to the community to restore their strength. In Christian thought, there is always sacrifice of those who initially resist, then come by grace. It is a saving grace, as even the most skeptical of the community discover. ==Production and release== The movie was shot in Italy: in the cities of Rome, Mantua and the ghost town of Craco. Saving Grace premiered in the United States on May 2, 1986, and in the Philippines on April 11, 1987. ==Critical reception== Walter Goodman of The New York Times said, 'There's no more engaging actor around than Tom Conti, but not even he, with the assistance of such notables of international moviedom as Giancarlo Giannini, Erland Josephson and Fernando Rey, can lift Saving Grace out of its slough of sentiment.' ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1986 films Category:1986 comedy films Category:American films Category:Embassy Pictures films Category:English- language films Category:Films about Christianity Category:Films about fictional popes Category:Films directed by Robert M.

Originally designed by the Los Angeles firm of Allison & Allison (James Edward Allison, 1870‚Äì1955, and his brother David Clark Allison, 1881‚Äì1962) and completed in 1929, it is one of the four original buildings on UCLA's Westwood campus and has come to be the defining image of the university. The brick and tile building is in the Lombard Romanesque style, and once functioned as the main classroom facility of the university and symbolized its academic and cultural aspirations. Today, the twin-towered front remains the best known UCLA landmark. The 1800-seat auditorium was designed for speech acoustics and not for music; by 1982 it emerged from successive remodelings as a regionally important concert hall and main performing arts facility of the university. Named after Josiah Royce, a California-born philosopher who received his bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley in 1875, the building's exterior is composed of elements borrowed from numerous northern Italian sources. While very different in their composition and near-symmetry, the two towers of Royce make an abstract reference to those of the famous Abbey Church of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. A building of very similar form on a much smaller scale was a centerpiece of the College of California campus in Oakland in 1860, the predecessor of the University of California. ==Renovation== Severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Royce Hall underwent a $70.5 million seismic renovation. Designed by architects Barton Phelps & Associates and Anshen + Allen Los Angeles and completed in 1998, the project combined structural strengthening and functional improvements with extensive interior updating. The iconic towers were strengthened and restored on an emergency basis. The project for the 200,000 square foot building itself inserted a new, six-story structural system of concrete panels located in the auditorium walls and connected by concrete beams to the building's historic exterior brickwork. Eligibility for National Register listing prompted FEMA earthquake resistance requirements well beyond normal safety levels and triggered close design scrutiny by preservation officers. The new \\"soft\\" structure is designed to respond in unison with original masonry infill to provide maximum earthquake resistance and protect the building's historic fabric from damage. ===Auditorium=== The sidewalls of the auditorium were reconfigured to hold foot-thick concrete shear panels the volume of which could have lessened its reverberant character. New wall openings, cut into abandoned rooftop areaways, are enclosed by new structure to form operable acoustic galleries allow variable acoustic responses. Along with new ceiling coves, the galleries increase the volume of the hall by 40,000 cubic feet and lengthen its reverberation period by over a second at their maximum setting. Skylights in the gallery restore natural light to the spectacular coffered ceiling, now for the first time, brightly illuminated. Unlike the former plaster interior, the new walls are clad in brick and terra cotta identical to that on the original exterior of the building. The uneven texture of projecting blocks improves sound diffusion. Its pattern is abstracted from Lombard Romanesque motifs in Lucca and other cities in the valley of the Po River in northern Italy. The hall, post renovation, covered . The hall contains a 6,600-pipe E.M. Skinner pipe organ, renovated and expanded in 1999 by Robert Turner. During the 1930s, Salt Lake Tabernacle organist Alexander Schreiner gave public recitals three times a week on the instrument. The organ was later featured in several recording sessions of the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta. It serves as one of the home venues for the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Luminaries who have appeared on its stage include musicians George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, and Ella Fitzgerald, and speakers Albert Einstein and John F. Kennedy. In 2012, the hall installed a new $128,000 Steinway concert grand piano. Nicknamed \\"Sapphire\\" by the staff, the piano has already been used as the centerpiece of a $25,000-per-plate fundraising dinner to support emerging artists.

The first subscription series included the great contralto Marian Anderson, the Budapest String Quartet, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In addition its world-renowned acoustics, the monument is a must-see for anyone who visits UCLA, especially because of its asymmetrical features. Students in one of the building's arcades In 1960, Henri Temianka founded and conducted his \\"Let's Talk Music\\" series at Royce Hall; this orchestra became the California Chamber Symphony (CCS), which gave more than 100 concerts over the ensuing 23 years, including premieres of major works by such composers as Aaron Copland, Dmitri Shostakovich, Darius Milhaud, Alberto Ginastera, Gian-Carlo Menotti and Malcolm Arnold. Soloists who performed with the CCS under Temianka's direction included David Oistrakh, Jean-Pierre Rampal and Benny Goodman. A \\"Concerts for Youth\\" series included participation by children from the audience. Presentation of the annual Los Angeles Times book prizes are made during the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in association with UCLA in Royce Hall. For many years, Royce Hall has been the venue of choice for various culture nights produced by cultural student organizations on campus, including Vietnamese Culture Night (VCN), Samahang Pilipino Cultural Night (SPCN), Chinese American Culture Night (CACN), and Korean Culture Night (KCN), among others. In 2014, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered the Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership at Royce Hall. ==In popular culture== *Parts of the film The Nutty Professor were filmed in Royce Hall. *In 1985, Patrick Stewart performed a demonstration of various plays at Royce Hall to aid a friend who was a member of the faculty.

The earliest land grant known to have been given out in the land that is now Dickerson was granted to Arthur Nelson: He received in 1739. Most of what is now considered Dickerson originally belonged to Nathan Hempstone. Before the Civil War, Dickerson was little more than a couple roads, a store, and a few houses. After the Civil War, the population began to rise more sharply. This was because after the Civil War, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company were able to continue their hunt for a route to place the Metropolitan Branch. Travelers wanted a way to travel west toward the capital and other places without having to go to Baltimore first. They decided on a route that passed through Dickerson and began construction. The railroad line going from Dickerson to Point of Rocks, MD was finished in 1871; the entire line was open for public use in 1873.The History of Dickerson, Mouth of Monocacy, Oakland Mills, and Sugarloaf Mountain by Dona L.

When the railroad was completed, it continued to serve the townspeople and local farmers as a general store. A post office was put in the store in 1891. The store has been moved three times: first in 1890 to allow space for the train station; second, when they widened road in 1910; and last in 1928 when they added a second track to the railroad.

The Ronde om Texel (Round Texel) is a regatta for catamarans around the island of Texel in The Netherlands. Round Texel was first organized in 1978. In that year Sigi Lach (from Germany) won in a Hobie 14 in a field of 84 participants. Since then the race grown into the biggest catamaran race in the world with an annual average of 600 cats participating. The race has its start and finish near Paal 17 on the North Sea and is approximately 100 kilometers long. It is organized once a year on a Saturday in June. The race starts an hour before high tide to ensure that there is enough water to pass the high mud flats northeast of the island. This tidal prerequisite determines the date that is chosen each year for the event. Strong tidal currents and variable winds around the island make Round Texel a highly tactical race that has been won alternately by professional sportsmen and skilled outsiders. Notable winners have been Reginald White, the first multihull Olympic champion, who won Round Texel in 1994 at the age of 59. In 2003 the trophy went to Darren Bundock, world champion in several multihull classes in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The 30th anniversary race on June 23, 2007 was won by Darren Bundock and Glenn Ashby from Australia in a F18 Hobie Tiger. Line honours were won in 2007 and 2008 by Xander Pols and Tjiddo Veenstra. In 2009 they took a second place in the line honours ranking. The female helm Carolijn Brouwer and her crew Wouter Samama made history after finishing on June 10, 2012 in 3 hours, 10 mins and 35 seconds placing first overall and becoming the first female helmsman to win. Brouwer: 'We were already gone at the starting gun. Wouter checked the line well and said I just had to go. He told me not to look over the shoulders, but I did it secretly. That was an enjoyment.\\"'In the gusts we got some height in order to stay out of the surf. Only after fifteen minutes, Xander Pols past us. We really haven't seen any other F18's around us. It was quite exciting at the VC-buoy, because we were double trapezing and sometimes you hit the ground there, so we put on the brakes a bit. However, later on at Oudeschild we really got stuck.\\" When asked how this success feels, Brouwer says: 'This is amazing. We went for it, but this is better than expected. Finally a normal Round Texel Race, because last year we were already hit and broken before the start.' ==External links== * Round Texel website Category:1978 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Annual sporting events in the Netherlands Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1978 Category:Sailing competitions in the Netherlands Category:Sports competitions in North Holland Category:Sport in Texel ","title":"Round Texel"},{"id":"7460448","text":"Vansinnesvisor is the name of the fourth album by the Viking metal band Thyrfing.

The PSC's responsibility was expanded in 1920 to include regulating and setting rates that utility companies charge their customers for electricity. The legislature expanded the PSC's responsibilities in later years to include those companies that provide gas, water, and communications, as well as transportation common carriers such as trucking and air carriers. The PSC effectively determines the rate of profits that most of these companies are allowed to earn. However, some of its traditional responsibilities have passed to the federal government with the passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1994 and the Federal Communications Act of 1996.Alabama Public Service Commission website @ www.psc.state.al. ==Election of commissioners== The Alabama Public Service Commission is composed of three elected members, a President and two associate commissioners. They run statewide in partisan elections and each serves a 4-year term. When vacancies occur they are filled by appointment by the Governor of Alabama. There is no limit to the number of terms to which they may be elected. The President of the Commission is elected during the cycle of U.S. Presidential elections and the two associate commissioners are elected during United States midterm elections ==Current commissioners== *President: **Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh (R) *Associate Commissioners: ** Place 1 - Jeremy H. Oden (R) ** Place 2 - Chris \\"Chip\\" Beeker, Jr. (R) Recent Associate Commissioner Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh was elected to the Presidency of the PSC on November 6, 2012, when she defeated the one term incumbent Democrat Lucy Baxley. Baxley had been the only remaining statewide elected Democrat still in office in Alabama and was first elected in 2008, with a margin of about 10,000 votes which translated into 50.3% of the vote over Republican Twinkle Cavanaugh.Biringham News, November 5, 2008 Commissioner Baxley previously served as Alabama State Treasurer and Lieutenant Governor before losing a race for governor to Bob Riley in 2006. Commissioner Cavanaugh, in defeating Baxley in 2012 received just over 55% of the ballots cast and had a margin of about 100,000 vote. She had previously served as both Executive Director and later was elected as the first female Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. She was initially elected to the Commission on November 2, 2010, in her third campaign for statewide office. She defeated long-time commissioner Jan Cook with 56% of the vote and a margin of more than 186,000 votes. The seat that Cavanaugh vacated for the PSC Presidency was filled for the remainder of her term by an appointee by Governor Robert J. Bentley. In July 2014, Cavanaugh called on the people of Alabama to pray for God's intervention to prevent the EPA's proposed regulations for coal-power plants from taking effect, stating that the EPA was attempting to take \\"what God's given a state\\" from the people of Alabama. Commissioner Chip Beeker was elected in 2014 when he defeated incumbent Republican Terry Dunn in the GOP primary runoff on July 15, 2014. Beeker was unopposed in the general election that November and was re-elected again on November 6, 2018. Commissioner Jeremy H. Oden was appointed to a vacancy on the PSC by Governor Robert Bentley at the beginning of December 2012 to the seat vacated by Cavanaugh upon her election to the PSC Presidency. Oden had served in the Alabama House of Representatives from 1998 until his appointment.Jeremey H. Oden, Commissioner, Place 1 Commissioner Oden was nominated on June 3, 2014 for a full four-year term. Oden was unopposed in the general election. He was re-elected again on November 6, 2018 following a very narrow primary victory in June, 2018. ==History and prior commissioners== Sometimes, the commission served as a stepping stone to run for higher offices in the state, although not always successfully. Commissioners B. B. Comer and Gordon Persons moved from the PSC to the office of governor. Long-time Commissioner C.C. \\"Jack\\" Owen unsuccessfully ran for governor from the PSC. In 2018, Commission President Twinkle Cavanaugh ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for Lt. Governor losing to Will Ainsworth who went on to win the office. Commissioner Jim Folsom Jr. was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990. He was elevated to the governor's office in 1993 upon the felony conviction of Gov. Guy Hunt. As an incumbent, he was defeated in the gubernatorial election in 1994 by Republican Fob James. Folsom stayed out of elective politics for 12 years. Folsom returned to public office with his 2006 election to the office of Lieutenant Governor. He was again defeated for re-election in 2010 when he lost the Lieutenant Governor post to Republican Kay Ivey. Folsom is the son and namesake of two-time Alabama governor James E. \\"Big Jim\\" Folsom, famous for being a progressive on civil rights when it was unpopular to be so. Commissioner Jim Zeigler served a single term on the PSC. He was elected State Auditor in November, 2014 and on January 19, 2015 returned to statewide office. He is a vocal opponent of what he terms \\"wasteful government spending\\" and a critic of Governor Robert Bentley. In 1946, Jimmy Hitchcock parlayed his earlier fame as an Auburn University football player and major league baseball player to a seat on the Commission and served there until his death in 1959. One of the most infamous and colorful politicians in Alabama was Commissioner Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor, a Democrat who had earlier served as police commissioner in Birmingham. He made national news when he ordered the police to use dogs and fire hoses on civil rights demonstrators during the Civil Rights protests in the 1960s. He lost a race for governor in 1970 in the Democrat primary to eventual nominee, George Wallace. Commissioner Ed Pepper and his wife were killed in the worst fire in Alabama history in 1966. The Dale's Penthouse restaurant fire in Montgomery took 26 lives. He was the nephew of well-known U.S. Senator and Congressman Claude Pepper of Florida, an Alabama native. The long-serving Claude Pepper became a national spokesman for senior citizens. Two commissioners were convicted of felony offenses while serving and were automatically removed from office‚ÄîJuanita McDaniel and Kenneth \\"Bozo\\" Hammond. Hammond later was elected Mayor of his native Valley Head, Alabama. Sibyl Pool became the first of six women to serve on the PSC when she took office in January, 1955. Three of those women have been President of the PSC. Hammond, Lynn Greer, and Pete Matthews all had previously served in the Alabama Legislature as Democrats and a fourth, Jeremy Oden, was a Republican state legislator at the time of his appointment. Greer later lost a race for Congress in north Alabama's Tennessee Valley district. Greer was then three times elected to the state legislature again as recently as 2014 as a Republican. { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" ! rowspan=2  Years - ! President ! Place 1 !

He was one of the founders of Aurora University, Fu Jen Catholic University and Fudan University. Ma Xiangbo's original given name was Jianchang () but was changed to Liang (). \\"Xiangbo\\" was his courtesy name. He also adopted the Catholic name \\"Joseph.\\" ==Biography== Ma Xiangbo was born in Dantu, Jiangsu province to a prominent Catholic family. At the age of 11, he enrolled in a French Jesuit school in Shanghai, Coll√®ge Saint-Ignace (now Xuhui High School), where he remained first as student and later as teacher until 1870. In 1870, he was ordained priest in the Jesuit order. Yet due to the French aggressions towards China, Ma would leave the priesthood in 1876 and eventuallybe married and have a family. In 1886/87, he visited France and eventually devoted his life to higher education. Ma founded the following institutions of higher learning: * Aurora University (1903) * Fudan University (1905) * Catholic University of Peking, later renamed Fu Jen Catholic University, in co-operation with Ying Lianzhi. His idea of establishing a highest body of learning was eventually realized in 1928 by his close friend, the educator Cai Yuanpei, who established the Academia Sinica. Ma Xiangbo and his brother, Ma Jianzhong, also led significant political lives. Ma Jiangzhong was a prominent official in the Qing government and Ma Xiangbo served as a diplomat from 1881 to 1897 in various postings in Asia including Japan (Tokyo 1881, Yokohama 1892), Korea (1882-1885?), Europe (Britain and France 1886-1887) and the United States. == References Further reading== Ma Xiangbo was featured on the cover of The Young Companion magazine, #150, in April 1939.

Khail and Ingram had been long time fixtures on the Sacramento, California music scene, Khail a guitar tech for hometown nu metal band Papa Roach since 1997, and Ingram running Ascensive Marketing and Promotions, promoting many of Sacramento's bands, clubs, and music publications. Having known each other from shows around Sacramento- Abrishami, Khail, and Ingram began talking about forming a band. Light conversation turned to action in early 2002 with the three writing what would become their debut album Seven Deadly Songs. Working with longtime friend, vocalist, and producer Jacoby Shaddix (who originally used the name John Doe), the band entered the Velvet Tone Studios in Sacramento between the months of January and February 2004. The band had signed a record deal with Papa Roach's self- owned label El Tonal Records.

It was directed by David H. Bell. ==Plot synopsis== ;Act I In St. Louis, Missouri, in 1952, ten-year-old Danny Lucas telephones for help because his mother won't wake up. His mother, Elizabeth Lucas, has swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and is taken to the psychiatric ward. The caseworker from social services, Mrs. Crandall, places an angry Danny in foster care (\\"It's Better This Way\\"). Mrs. Crandall informs Elizabeth that contact with Danny will be limited to gifts and letters. Elizabeth returns home determined to correct her past mistakes and get Danny back (\\"Fill In The Blank\\"). She writes to Danny asking him to follow her clues to their conclusion (\\"Letter From Elizabeth\\"). Danny's foster family is the Milligans, a childless couple awaiting a baby. Mrs. Crandall delivers, from Danny's mother, a model plane and instructions to speak with the elderly Harold Bixby. Through Mr. Bixby's remembrances, we are introduced to John Robert Anderson - a World War I fighter pilot (\\"In These Skies\\") who meets (\\"In This Moment\\") and falls in love with Ruth Whitlow (\\"In These Skies\\" (Reprise)). At school, the troubled and angry Danny meets Emily. He tells Emily about the 'clues' from his mother. Emily enthusiastically offers to help him solve the mystery (\\"Now I'm On Your Case\\"). Mrs. Milligan struggles with baking Toll House cookies. She equates her success as a mother with successfully baking the cookies (\\"Make It From Scratch\\"). Elizabeth sends Danny the diaries of Ruth Whitlow. Through the diaries, we see that Ruth's relationship with John Robert Anderson leads to marriage (\\"Be My Bride\\"). John Robert is stationed in France. Ruth writes of her longing for him and her pride in his service (\\"Ruth's Letters\\"). John Robert challenges a hostile airman to a bet and teaches him a lesson (\\"Anique's Tavern Song\\"). Another letter from Ruth reveals that she is pregnant (\\"I'm Going To Have This Child\\"). John Robert continues his service in France (\\"The Dogfight\\") and his life ends there (\\"Act I Finale\\"). ;Act II Danny is learning to trust his foster parents, the Milligans (\\"Now I Know\\"). Another package arrives from his mother. Through Ruth's diaries, we meet her young son Charlie Anderson, nicknamed \\"Ace\\". She sings of her dream for her son to be the aviator and hero that his father was. Charlie dreams of becoming an aeronautical engineer (\\"Soaring Again\\"). Also in this package is a letter from Elizabeth and her yearbook from St. Louis University 1935, and a photo. Through these items, Elizabeth Lucas and Charlie \\"Ace\\" Anderson are shown as they meet (\\"It's Just A Matter Of Time\\"; \\"I Know It Can Be Done\\") and fall in love (\\"Missing Pieces\\"). The photo of Ace is the first time that Danny has seen his father; his mother has previously refused to speak about him (\\"So That's Him\\"). After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Charlie, fueled by his mother's desires for him, joins the Air Force. Elizabeth opposes this but agrees to marry him before he leaves. While in training, Charlie feels the spirit of his father John Robert (\\"Father And Son\\"). Charlie is asked to join the \\"Flying Tigers\\" - a voluntary assignment. Elizabeth is furious that Charlie would put himself in danger for a voluntary mission. Charlie feels connected to the father he never knew and believes that he is making the best choice. Elizabeth, on the other hand, feels that the stories of John Robert's heroism have led Ace to make a bad choice. They argue and separate in anger. Ace joins the Flying Tigers in China (\\"We're The Only Ones\\"). Ruth, Elizabeth, Ace and Danny each consider the emotional changes they are experiencing. Elizabeth reveals that she is pregnant (\\"Seeing Thing In A Different Light\\"). Ace perishes in the skies over Siam. Elizabeth sings of her overwhelming shock, anger and inability to forgive (\\"That's What It Should Say\\"). \\"Ace\\" speaks to Danny. He tells Danny that he can \\"Choose To Fly\\" in many ways, in his heart and mind, not necessarily or only in a plane. Danny is reunited with his Mother.

Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, who was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963. The memorial is shaped like the stump of a felled tree, symbolizing a life cut short. Inside is a bronze relief of Kennedy, with an eternal flame burning in the center. It is encircled by 51 concrete columns, one for each of the 50 states in the United States plus one for Washington, D.C., that nation's capital. The emblems of the states (and of the District of Columbia) are displayed on each of the columns, and the columns are separated by slim panels of glass. The monument measures approximately in circumference around its base, and there is space within the memorial for approximately 100 visitors at a time. The monument was built in 1966 with funds donated by American Jewish communities. Yad Kennedy and its adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. ==Name== The Hebrew word yad, which is used for a number of memorials in Israel (including the well-known Holocaust memorial museum Yad Vashem), comes from the Book of Isaiah, chapter 56, verse 5: \\"And to them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name (yad vashem).\\" ==Location== View of Yad Kennedy on hilltop The site is located from downtown Jerusalem, in the same general direction as Hadassah Medical Center, on top of the highest of the Jerusalem hills, at an elevation of . The site overlooks what was at the time of the dedication the Jordanian village of Bittar (now a part of Israel's West Bank), the historic site of Betar, famous as the last stronghold of the Jewish revolt led by Simon Bar Kochba against Roman forces in 132-135 CE. The view from the parking lot has been described in the Frommer's travel guide as \\"breathtaking - a never-ending succession of mountains and valleys.\\" On a clear day, the Mediterranean Sea can be seen in the direction of Tel Aviv, away.Hill, Leonard. \\"Israel's memorial to JFK\\", European Stars and Stripes, 27 June 1969. The memorial can be reached by following the winding mountain roads past Ora and Aminadav. It is approximately 45 minutes by foot from the nearest main road, where the closest Jerusalem city bus is #20, although special tour buses are normally utilized for group visits. The monument and adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. The area designated as the JFK Peace Forest is part of the larger \\"Aminadav Forest\\", a 7,000-dunam forest in Ein Kerem. ==History== Interior with eternal flame and columns decorated with state seals Max Bressler of Chicago, Illinois, then president of the American Jewish National Fund, came up with the proposal for the memorial in 1964. (pay per view) Bressler, for whom the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem is named, had hoped to lead an American delegation to the dedication ceremony, but he died in 1966. ===Fundraising=== On 13 January 1964, former Pennsylvania Governor George M. Leader announced plans for the memorial, stating that he would serve as the General Chair of a State committee to raise funds. He stated that similar committees would be set up in each State, as well as some additional committees in countries overseas. On 22 November 1964, the first anniversary of the assassination, the Jewish National Fund sponsored meetings in major Jewish communities throughout the United States. The meetings were described as tributes for the fallen President as well as symbolic dedication ceremonies for the planned memorial. American communities pledged to fund the planting of trees in the forest in addition to funds for the memorial. For example, in July 1965, the community of Los Angeles, California pledged to have 100,000 trees planted as a result of a banquet sponsored by JNF attended by more than 1000 government, union, and management leaders. ===Dedication=== Dedication plaque at Yad Kennedy, Jerusalem Nearly 2000 people, including many official guests representing the Israeli and United States governments, came to witness the dedication, along with hundreds of tourists, American students, and Israelis. An Israeli children's band played Hatikva, the Israeli national anthem, along with the U.S. anthem, the Star Spangled Banner. The New York Times reported that the children \\"tried valiantly\\" to play the U.S. song, playing very slowly, but then many strong voices from among the crowd helped out until the music \\"swept the audience.\\" Close up of sloping columns Among the guests at the 4 July 1966 dedication was U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who had chaired the commission tasked with investigating the 1963 assassination. Among other guests were Levi Eshkol, Prime Minister of Israel, Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem, and Walworth Barbour, the United States Ambassador to Israel. Chief Justice Warren, who was reported to be so enthusiastic about the memorial after actually seeing it for the first time that he rewrote his remarks, noted: > We choose to do this on the American Independence Day but also in honor of > the independence of Israel and other free nations. We are all confronted > here by history because this is the birthplace of the world's three > religions on which our own civilization is based and which contributed the > all-important principle that all people are God's children and entitled to > live in peace. Warren noted that Washington, D.C. had many memorials, but that this area, with the forest as a \\"living memorial,\\" would have \\"greatly pleased\\" Kennedy for two reasons. First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the importance of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, \\"What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument\\". Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 of the differences between the people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that \\"Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit\\". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: \\"Shalom.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol spoke as well, noting that Kennedy's memory would be kept alive by this memorial \\"not only as a friend of Israel but also as a symbol of the lofty ideals of his country and of all humanity,\\" dedicating the memorial to \\"the man who opened new frontiers of international relations and human friendships.\\" In remarks offered by the American ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, he noted that \\"A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors. In thus honoring and remembering the late President Kennedy, the men and women of the Jewish National Fund honor themselves--beyond and above the glory they have already earned in their work for Israel.\\" Jacob Tsur, world president of the Jewish National Fund, praised the memorial as well, \\"conceived in the shape of a mighty trunk of a fallen tree, among the thousands of saplings which will grow one day into a great forest.\\" ==Design== Bronze relief of John F. Kennedy at Yad Kennedy Yad Kennedy was designed by the Brazilian-born Israeli architect David Resnick, who later won the 1995 Israel Prize in architecture, and the Ukrainian-born Israeli sculptor Dov Feigin. Feigin created the bust of Kennedy along with a memorial wall that includes excerpts from a number of Kennedy's speeches. Resnick said that \\"the entire complex is intended to symbolize the vigor of a great man whose life was tragically ended in mid-growth by assassination\\". Resnick was awarded the contract to design the memorial after a nationwide competition. His initial vision for the memorial was a \\"free form\\" but generally circular shape, set within a reflecting pool. However, because money was being raised for the memorial by groups in all 50 states in the U.S., as well as groups in Washington, D.C., a vision of columns for each of those locations ultimately helped him come up with the concept of a tree trunk, linked to the idea that Kennedy's life had been cut down like a tree that is felled in its prime. The courtyard below the memorial includes a number of plaques acknowledging contributions by individuals and groups. In addition to the Kennedy relief and eternal flame, papers and photographs relating to the subject of Israel-United States relations until the time of Kennedy's assassination are kept in a small library. In 1974, a picnic site was added on the grounds of the memorial, open to visitors. The JNF announced that the site would \\"include rustic benches and tables, water facilities and shaded eating areas,\\" and would be \\"close to the impressive stone and metal memorial-but far enough away not to pollute the area.\\" ==Kennedy Peace Forest== Kennedy Family Planting Circle The Kennedy Peace Forest was dedicated before the memorial, with official dedication ceremonies taking place on 22 November 1964, on the first anniversary of Kennedy's assassination. In June 1966 Jewish National Fund officials announced that 1.5 million trees had already been planted in the forest in preparation for the memorial's planned 4 July dedication ceremonies. The announcement noted that another 2 million trees had been planted in the adjoining \\"United States Freedom Forest,\\" with a goal of planting 5.5 million trees in the two forests, as a number equal to the Jewish population of the United States. More than three million dollars in donations had been received at that point for the Kennedy Forest, from more than 100,000 donors. In June 1968, the JNF announced it would plant 500,000 trees in the Kennedy Forest in memory of John F. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated on 6 June of that year. In 1999, JNF announced that trees would also be planted in memory of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette- Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, all victims of a 16 July 1999 plane crash in the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. In April 1989 a forest fire (possibly the result of arson) destroyed approximately and 3000 trees in the forest. ==Special events== Among the many special events that have taken place at the memorial was a visit by a number of officers and crew members from the United States aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV67), named in honor of the same U.S. president memorialized by this monument, during a 1997 port visit to Haifa.Library of Congress Veterans History Project: Arnold Resnicoff collection, AFC/2001/001/70629, May 2010. ===Tree planting=== A VIP Kennedy Memorial tree planting center is included on the grounds of the memorial, where many distinguished visitors from other countries have planted trees. In May 1978 Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of the president, visited the memorial and planted a tree in the forest. Other members of the Kennedy family who have visited the memorial and planted trees include U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy (JFK's brother), on 11 December 1986; (subscription required) Joan Kennedy (Teddy Kennedy's first wife), on 24 January 1983;KKL-JNF photo archives, photo d733-154. and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and his sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (JFK's nephew and niece; children of Robert F. Kennedy), on 1 January 1987.KKL-JNF photo archive, photos d751-139 and d753-152. A special \\"Kennedy Family Planting Circle\\" was established by the Jewish National Fund.Bardenstein, Carol B. \\"Trees, Forests, and the Shaping of Palestinian and Israeli Collective Memory\\", in Acts of Memory: Cultural recall in the present, Mieke Bal, Jonathan V. Crewe, and Leo Spitzer, eds. 1999: University Press of New England, p. 162. . In 2001 Kennedy's daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, then Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, visited Yad Kennedy during her tour of Israel with her husband and three of her four daughters. U.S. Navy chaplains including Chief of Chaplains Rear Admiral Byron Holderby (second from right) plant trees during a 1998 visit to Yad Kennedy Visiting American military personnel are among those who plant trees at the memorial because of its remembrance of an American president. Among those who have planted trees at the site are former Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force. Israeli groups also take part in the tree planting tradition, especially on the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, an occasion linked to trees. On some occasions as many as 4000 Israeli school children have come to the Kennedy Peace Forest to plant trees on that holiday. In addition to individual or group tree plantings, there have been special occasions when smaller \\"forests\\" have been dedicated within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. For example, as early as January 1966, even before the dedication of the memorial, a forest was planted in honor of Ambassador Avraham Harman, Israel's ambassador to the United States. The \\"Avraham Harman Forest\\" was contributed by Bnai Zion, a pro-Israel \\"fraternal group\\" in the U.S., and Golda Meir, newly retired from her post as Israel's Prime Minister, was one of the participants in the dedication ceremony. Other specially designated areas within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest include a \\"woodland\\" set up to memorialize the victims of the 1972 Lydda airport (now named Ben Gurion International Airport) terrorist attack. ==Gallery== File:Yad Kennedy aerial photo.jpgAerial view File:Yad Kennedy donor wall.jpgForest and memorial Donor Wall File:Yad Kennedy with State emblems.jpgEmblems on memorial columns File:Yad Kennedy California State emblem.jpgSample State emblem (California) ==See also== *John F.

The son of Philip, he married Margaret Harliston in 1470 and had 21 children. According to a biased non-contemporary account of Baker's governorship, Philip De Carteret opposed the alleged cruelty of the rule of Matthew Baker as Governor of Jersey, who had been appointed with vice-regal Powers in all but name. It was alleged that Baker conceived a plot to implicate De Carteret as a traitor, using a letter purportedly written by De Carteret to the Normans. De Carteret was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil to await trial by combat. According to a chronicle of events, - written by a member of the De Carteret family some 70 years later - his wife Margaret, who had only recently given birth, secretly took a boat to the English mainland to convince King Henry VII of her husband's innocence. He was freed and his lands and chattels returned to him, and Baker was later recalled from office. Henry VII was not absolutely convinced of De Carteret's loyalty, however, and placed him under a Bond of ¬£1,000 as surety for his future good conduct. ==Sources== *Blanche B. Elliott (1923).

Nejat worked on education during the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Originally a Pan-Turkist, in 1918, the Ottoman government sent him to Germany, where he became a Communist and participated in the Spartacist German Revolution along with the \\"Workers and Peasants Party\\" he formed with Turkish students and workers who were in Germany. This group published the paper Liberation. They were recalled in 1919 back to Turkey, where they changed the name of the party to the Turkish Workers and Peasants Socialist Party. Members of this party were eventually going to make the bulk of the Istanbul organization of the Communist Party of Turkey. Liberation was published in Turkey, and Ethem Nejat was writing articles about the proletariat, capital, class struggle; the paper also had articles about the October Revolution. The Turkish Bolshevik Mustafa Suphi, exiled in Russia, was planning to get in touch with communist groups in Turkey and form the Communist Party of Turkey by uniting the different communist groups in Turkey. As Suphi was in Baku, Nejat took the initiative among communists within Turkey. This enabled the first congress of the Communist Party of Turkey to be held on September 11, 1920, in Baku, at which Nejat made a speech on the \\"Workers Struggle in Istanbul\\". The Turkish Workers and Peasants Socialist Party constituted one of the three major factions of the new communist party. He was elected as the general secretary of the new party. With the Communist Party, Nejat's supporters published the magazine Kurtulu≈ü, which became the de facto legal press organ of the party. After several months, the party leaders decided to return to Turkey in order to join the ongoing struggle. One their way to Ankara to meet Mustafa Kemal, they were attacked by the inhabitants of the cities they were passing. Finally they decided to return to Baku with a boat from the city of Trabzon.

The special received generally favorable reviews in the School Library Journal, which reviewed it in 1983 and 2007. ==Plot== Strawberry Shortcake lives in a place called Strawberryland, with her calico cat Custard; her house resembles a shortcake. Her friendsHuckleberry Pie, Blueberry Muffin, Raspberry Tart, Plum Puddin' and toddler Apple Dumplin'also live close by. One morning, during their Market Day, Strawberry's friends discuss plans for her sixth birthdayall except for lazy Huckleberry Pie. Strawberry's villain, the Peculiar Purple Pieman, lives atop the Pie Tin Palace on a black hill called Porcupine Peak. While she is doing chores, the Pieman sends his crows\\"berry birds\\"to retrieve some berries for his pies. Strawberry tries shooing the flock away with her broom, but a moving tree helps out as a scarecrow, and she thanks him for helping. In desperation, the Pieman heads down to Strawberryland himself to get his supply, dressed as a kind old peddler. At noon, Strawberry calls her friends over for lunch, but they leave her behind and go to Lilac Park to prepare for her surprise party. Soon after, the disguised Pieman meets her and offers watering cans for sale. To his chagrin, Strawberry cannot afford to buy a magical one guaranteed to produce strawberries seven feet tall. Assisted by Lucky Bug, Huckleberry's ladybug aide, he goes to the Park, where Huckleberry pays for the equipment. Strawberry soon arrives at the venue to see her friends, who greet her with \\"Happy Birthday\\" and give her a present: the Pieman's watering can. The device fails to grow anything and spills over instead, flooding the Park and much of Strawberryland. The children are dismayed that the Pieman tricked them for his berry-stealing plot, and soon they harvest every bit of that supply over to him. The group travels to the Pie Tin Palace on rafts made of flotsam. Landing upon a mud field, they find out from Lucky Bug that Apple Dumplin' ended up at the Palace; they now have no way to rescue her. Mr. Sun, the narrator of the story, grants Strawberry a wish. She wishes to defeat the Pieman, and a grove of marching trees help her accomplish this; their stomping causes the Palace to collapse. Afterward, Apple Dumplin' gives him a note demanding that he surrender and do good deeds; he reluctantly does so, giving the toddler and berries back to Strawberry and company. At the end of the special, Strawberry Shortcake offers him a chance to sell his pies at Strawberry Market, and become friends with her. ==Cast== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 5px;\\" - ! style=\\"background:darkGrey; width:200px;\\"Name ! style=\\"background:darkGrey; width:250px;\\"Character ! style=\\"background:darkGrey; width:50px;\\"Source -  Russi Taylor  Strawberry Shortcake rowspan=\\"7\\" -  Robert Ridgely  Peculiar Purple Pieman -  Romeo Muller  Mr. Sun / Narrator -  Julie McWhirter  Huckleberry Pie -  Joan Gerber  Blueberry Muffin / Apple Dumplin' -  Pamela Anderson  Raspberry Tart -  Bob Holt  Escargot - } ==Production== Produced and sponsored by the Kenner toy company, The World of Strawberry Shortcake was the first of six television specials to star the title character. The franchise began in 1977, when American Greetings staff member Muriel Fahrion drew the first designs of Strawberry and her pet cat Custard. In 1979, she appeared in greeting cards; dolls, books and games soon followed. The special was made by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, which previously worked on The Point! and Frank Zappa's 200 Motels, both from 1971; RLR Associates of New York City was another production partner. Animation work was also handled by Japan's Toei Doga. At the time of production, the producers called it a \\"morality play for tots\\". One of the crewmembers was Romeo Muller, writer for several Rankin/Bass television specials. Muller served as writer, co-producer and lyricist of the Strawberry Shortcake special; he also voiced Mr. Sun, the narrator. After he proposed the idea to Kenner, the company and American Greetings agreed to do it. According to Jack Chojnacki, co-president of Those Characters from Cleveland, a subsidiary of American Greetings, the card manufacturer considered new additions to the script, and reminded the writer that every character should be marketable. With those suggestions in mind, Muller came up with a villain called the Peculiar Purple Pieman. The Toy Group division of General Mills, which owned Kenner at the time, spent US$400,000 on the special. For the music, director Charles Swenson invited the duo Flo & Eddie, who were also involved with 200 Motels and who had an office near the Murakami-Wolf-Swenson headquarters. They wrote three songs in a day, which were approved by both Swenson and Muller, and went on to score the whole special. Mark Volman stated that he and Howard Kaylan aimed \\"to do something different with children‚Äôs records\\", which \\"weren‚Äôt really a respected medium and companies weren‚Äôt used to paying people for producing something slick for kids\\", with songs that could stand on their own and be liked by fans of the duo's old group, The Turtles, while also providing positive messages for children. The tracks were recorded by Flo & Eddie at Sun Swept Studios, with the only outside musician being the facility's owner, John Hoier. ==Release== Upon completion, Muller was satisfied with how The World of Strawberry Shortcake turned out. Although he pointed out the lack of such influences in the special, he told The New York Times in April 1981: \\"I suppose the show is a commercial, in the largest sense of the word.\\" Some time after the title character's debut at the 1980 American International Toy Fair, major television networks in the U.S. were offered a chance to air the special. They also deemed it an advertisement for the toy line, and rejected it. On March 28, 1980, the special debuted on independent stations in over 90 U.S. cities; it aired on WNEW (now WNYW) in the New York City market, and on KTLA in Los Angeles. Kenner launched a collection of dolls and toys based on the special, concurrently with the original broadcast. This led John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to proclaim, \\"Onward and upward with the art of marketing!\\" In 1981, the Lexington Broadcast Services Company acquired syndication rights to The World of Strawberry Shortcake, along with its follow-up, Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City. By 1986, the Television Program Source took over the rights for the first special. It was released on 16 mm film by the Coronet company in 1982, and on VHS and Beta in October 1985 by Family Home Entertainment. A Region 1 DVD from Illumination FilmWorks,featuring this special and Big Apple City, was released on March 6, 2007. In Germany, the original special premiered on ZDF on April 4, 1983, as Emily im Erdbeerland. A soundtrack album was released by Kid Stuff Records the same year as the original airing. The track list featured the \\"Strawberry Shortcake Theme\\", along with \\"Smile a Sunny Morning\\", \\"Sunflower Market\\", \\"Monster Trees\\" and \\"Berry Talk\\". \\"Smile a Sunny Morning\\" ==Reception== The World of Strawberry Shortcake was reviewed twice by the School Library Journal. In the December 1983 issue, Margaret Bush said that the \\"Story, characters, dialogue and bits of stage business are busy, bright, contrived, and will appeal of young children.\\" She added, however, that \\"Some of the lyrics and dialogue are not easily understoodit sounds as if adult voices may be attempting to simulate the voices of small children.\\" In 1987, Kathleen Pulcini of The Video Directory called it \\"Delightful fun for children.\\" ==See also== * List of 1980s Strawberry Shortcake specials ==NotesReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1980 films Category:1980 television films Category:1980s American animated films Category:1980s fantasy films Category:American films Category:Animated television specials Category:1980s children's fantasy films Category:Strawberry Shortcake films Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Television shows written by Romeo Muller ","title":"The World of Strawberry Shortcake"},{"id":"7460763","text":"The Greek Ecologists () (previously Union of Ecologists, ) is a Greek \\"fringe\\" and \\"bizarre ecological party\\".Nicholas Paphitis, \\"Press Watch\\" , Athens News, 13 November 1997. The party's president is Dimosthenis Vergis, a former auto- worker, trade unionist, journalist, and peace activist. Vergis has been described as a \\"self-styled ecologist\\"\\"In brief\\" , Athens News, 9 September 1997. and \\"a self-styled, modern-day Dionysus ‚Äì God of wine, revelry and fertility\\".As described by the blurb for ABC Television's broadcast of Dominique Schwartz \\"Foreign Correspondent\\" programme, Episode 12, Series 10, 19 September 2000.

The Greek Ecologists and its leader are not accepted as a Green party by the Ecologist Greens, which enjoys international recognition as Greece's green party. The Ecologist Greens have condemned Vergis, stating: \\"The public can be assured that the political culture of Ecologist Greens and the Green movement, in general, has nothing to do with behaviour that makes a mockery or which, through strange - at least - and disastrous interests (such as abuses, money laundering), has damaged the interest in the environment and the political perspectives of ecology in Greece.\\"Ecologist Greens, \\"Election FAQ\\" , July 2007. ==History== In 1997, an Athens prosecutor issued a warrant for Vergis' arrest after his party published a poster in which he appeared nude with a smaller picture of International Association of Athletics Federations president Primo Nebiolo inset near Vergis' genitals.\\"In brief\\" , Athens News, 9 September 1997. In August 1998, lawyers representing the Archbishop of Athens successfully went to court to prevent the party using a poster in the municipal elections showing Vergis shaking hands with the archbishop.\\"ŒïŒæœéŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œø œÑŒøœÖ ŒëœÅœáŒπŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ Œî.

Railway from the 2nd July 1885 The Catskill Mountain Railway (CMRy) was a narrow gauge railroad, long, running from Catskill to Palenville in Greene County, New York. Organized as the Catskill Mountain Railroad (CMRR) in 1880, it bas built in 1881 and 1882. The principals had interests in shipping on the Hudson and in hotels in the Catskill Mountains. Unlike most railroads, the CMRR was built primarily for the purpose of transporting passengers and was intended to operate seasonally. Most people using the line were summer tourists who travelled by steamboat from points along the Hudson River. Their final destinations were hotels and boarding houses located high in the Catskill Mountains. While the railroad served its purpose of bringing passengers closer to the mountain top resorts, it still left them with an arduous hour-long stage trip up the face of the Catskill Escarpment (also known as the Wall of Manitou). In 1885 a branch was built to Cairo, New York, with the intent to carry bluestone, hay and fruit, and was run year round. That same year, the CMRR was reorganized as the Catskill Mountain Railway. == Competition == Competition soon arose, in the form of the Stony Clove & Catskill Mountain and the Kaaterskill railroad companies, both controlled by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad. These narrow gauge railroads brought passengers much closer to their final destinations, saving them the difficult stage trip CMRR patrons had. To counter the competition, the Otis Elevating Railway was formed, hiring the company of Elisha Otis's sons\\"The Otis Elevating Railway\\", Scientific American, Oct. 5, 1895; reprinted by The Catskill Archive to build a cable railroad. This railroad was completed in 1892. in length, it raised passengers in 10 minutes - saving a one-hour stage ride. At the summit, of track was laid to connect with the terminus of the Kaaterskill Railroad. By 1897 connecting service on the Kaaterskill Railroad had become so bad, that a new railroad, the Catskill and Tannersville Railway was constructed to run from the Otis to Tannersville. This line paralleled the existing Katterskill one as far as Tannersville. Hastily built, this line had curves as sharp as 20 degrees and a maximum speed of 7 miles per hour. Locally, it was affectionately known as the \\"Huckleberry\\" for the fruit which grew along its right of way. During a 1904 reconstruction of the Otis, a switch was installed to connect with the C&T; permitting through freight to operate from Catskill to Tannersville. Because of the slanted seats necessary on the Otis, passengers still had to change cars. A great boon to the CMRR was the development of the shale brick in 1888 by the Elmira Shale Brick Company. By 1898, raw material mined on the Cairo branch for the Catskill Shale brick company comprised, by tonnage, 95% of the freight carried. The last trains were run in 1918. == Locomotives == { !Number !Name !Builder !Type !Date !Shop No. !Notes - 1 S. Sherwood Day Dickson Manufacturing Company  1882 335  - 2 John T.

Originally scheduled for November, the elections were pulled forward after Parliament failed to elect a new president to replace Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The result was a resounding victory for the incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP), which won 46.6% of the vote and 341 seats. The party's leader Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan was consequently re-elected as Prime Minister of Turkey. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) came second with 20.9% of the vote and took 112 seats. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which had failed to surpass the 10% election threshold in the 2002 election, re-entered parliament with 14.3% of the vote and 71 MPs.Turkey re- elects governing party BBC News, 22 July 2007 The election was fought mostly on Turkey's debate over la√Øcit√© that had been perceived to be under threat from the AKP's nomination of Foreign Minister Abdullah G√ºl, an Islamist politician, for the Presidency. Developments in Iraq (explained under positions on terrorism and security), secular and religious concerns, the intervention of the military in political issues, European Union membership negotiations, the United States and the Muslim world were other main issues. In addition to the AKP, CHP and MHP, several Kurdish nationalist and socialist parties formed an electoral alliance named the Thousand Hope Candidates (Bin Umut Adaylarƒ±) and contested the election as Independents in order to bypass the 10% threshold. The alliance, formed of the Democratic Society Party (DTP), Labour Party (EMEP), Freedom and Solidarity Party (√ñDP) and the Socialist Democracy Party (SDP), polled strongly in the south-east where there is a large Kurdish population, winning 3.81% of the national vote and 22 seats in Parliament. ==Background== Originally due to be held in November, the election was called early after the 2007 presidential election resulted in parliamentary deadlock. The governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) had nominated former Prime Minister and serving Foreign Minister Abdullah G√ºl as its presidential candidate, amid huge opposition and concern over his former Islamist political background. The controversy was largely caused due to the Turkish Presidency's symbolic role in safeguarding secularism. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) subsequently boycotted the parliamentary process of electing a president, denying the government the 67% quorum of MPs necessary for G√ºl's election to be validated. As required by the constitution, a snap early general election was called for 22 July 2007. ==Conduct== Over 42 million people were eligible to vote in the election. ===Minimum age=== According to a recent change in election law, the minimum age for candidates for parliament was reduced from 30 to 25. But due to the fact that laws do not take effect for one year after passage, only candidates above the age of 30 were able to be elected in this election. ===Death threats=== On 14 May A death threat was issued by the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to the Republican People's Party (CHP), Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), True Path Party (DYP) and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to withdraw their candidates in the cities of Van and Hakk√¢ri allowing Democratic Society Party (DTP) dominance. Turkey, NATO, UN, United States and EU recognizes the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) as a terrorist organization. ===Parliamentary threshold=== According to Turkish election laws, a party must gain at least 10% of national vote to be represented in the Grand Assembly. Ostensibly, this law is aimed at preventing a highly fragmented parliament, and yet it is also argued that this is used as a cloak to keep the Kurds from the parliament. Many parties that failed to cross this threshold in the last election will seek a return to Parliament. As the 10% threshold requirement only holds for political parties, to bypass this requirement, the Democratic Society Party decided to have its candidates run as Independents. On 13 May DTP announced that if they wanted to, they could lock up the elections by putting in five to ten thousand independent candidates. The next day in a statement, the Supreme Election Committee () responded to DTP's threat by stating that there is no issue and that they would simply use \\"larger envelopes\\". ===Eligibility for election=== Muammer Aydin, the President of the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey, claimed that after the scrutiny of the candidates in terms of their eligibility, the election board decided that Erbakan and former DEP (Democratic Society Party) parliamentarians (Orhan Doƒüan, Selim Sadak and Hatip Dicle), who was jailed after being found guilty of supporting the PKK, would not be allowed to stand as candidates in the election. In a statement regarding some of the candidates in prison, DTP leader T√ºrk said that hundreds of people support them, even though some are associated with murder cases. The Supreme Court of Appeals wrote a letter to DTP and demanded the cancellation of the candidacy of 74 founding members on the basis that they have criminal backgrounds which automatically disqualifies them from being the elected. DTP leader T√ºrk said, \\"DTP took the decision to show these people as candidates because [the] Kurdish people see Ankara, the Parliament, as the place for a solution.\\" DTP's move to promote candidates with criminal background was perceived as building a \\"politics of controversy\\" in the country as T√ºrk also stated that they had taken the necessary measures to fill the positions of candidates who might be rejected by the Supreme Election Board. ==Issues== The stage of the elections were set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between Erdoƒüan's government, which has been criticized as having Islamic leanings, and the country‚Äôs secular movement, supported by the Turkish military. Erdoƒüan, it is said, wants to divert the attention of the voters from local issues to theoretical and ideological ones by making the election a platform for the Presidential election. ===Positions on higher education=== The capacity of Turkish higher educational institutions falls short compared to the number of high school graduates. The Higher Education Council is responsible from the planning, implementation and accreditation of higher education in Turkey. The Higher Education Council limits the number of the available educational institutions based on the available educators (PhD) in the public sector. The second branch, private universities (established by vakifs) are limited by the conditions of accreditation set by the Higher Education Council. Erdoƒüan announced that the problem lies with the \\"Higher Education Council\\". Erdoƒüan proposed that if his party is elected, they will change the constitution to solve this issue. Erdoƒüan did not give the details or the financial implications of his plan. During the same speech, Erdoƒüan also proposed to establish a higher educational institution in every province. Critics claim that there is at least one university in every province, and the problem is not construction of buildings but recruiting qualified professors. Erdoƒüan did not talk about his previous campaign issues, such as the use of the hijab (specially women's head covering) as a religious symbol in higher education which he had previously promoted based on the concept of Islamic jurisprudence. ===Positions on the presidency=== The 2007 presidential election was deadlocked in the failed negotiations on the issues surrounding the new president by the parties. The lack of this negotiation forced the Prime Minister Erdoƒüan and his party to declare early elections to establish a new parliament to tackle the issues of the Presidency. Erdoƒüan claims that the position of President is political and it should be elected by the public not by the parties. \\"How can those who see the election of the Turkish president by popular vote as a problem for the regime ask votes from the people?\\" asked Erdoƒüan. The Republican People‚Äôs Party accused Erdoƒüan of acting with \\"a sense of vengeance\\" for having failed first to secure his, then his chosen candidate, Gul's election. Now, at the expense of creating a \\"degenerated parliamentary system\\", he is trying to secure a new path to his goal. Baykal said it would mount a legal challenge to this ideology. Baykal claims that the position of president in Turkey is non-partisan, and should be above political concerns and is designed to play an oversight role. The President's job description and powers demand that the policies articulated from this office should reflect a balance within the country, and be an institution which all the parties can trust. Because of this balancing act, according to Baykal, it is very important to create [he says \\"protect\\"] the neutral point [through reaching an agreement at the parliament among the parties] as to the President, thus preventing domination of a single party [which might generate PM and President at the same time] and control every mechanism of the Turkish political system. ===Foreign policy=== Position of parties regarding Foreign issues. {style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:0px; font-size:95%;\\" align=center !Issue !CHP !AKP !MHP - align=center align=rightEU membership Support Support Oppose - align=center align=rightRelations with US Support Support Support - align=center align=rightCyprus Confederation Confederation Two independent states } Positions on terrorism and security The PKK is a Kurdish group listed as a terrorist organization by many international organisations, however, after the post-invasion Iraq, 2003‚Äìpresent PKK continued to have training/propaganda camps in northern Iraq and perform attacks using these secure locations into Turkey. The status of these bases have been debated in the Turkish political system for the last two decades. During the 1990s, with the political order, Turkish military destroyed PKK bases in northern-Iraq for the short term reliefs. Nationalist Movement Party wants the military to destroy PKK camps, and it is willing to give this order to the army anytime as camps reestablish. Erdoƒüan did not give this order and claimed that he is expecting the request from the military. The military claims the political goal of the military activity should be established by the Erdoƒüan's ruling party, before any consideration. The Democratic Society Party is against the destruction of these camps, and Ibrahim Aydogdu, the Diyarbakir branch leader of the DTP, claimed on February 18, 2007 \\"Any attack on Kirkuk [northern Iraq] would be tantamount to an attack on Diyarbakir in Turkey\\". ==CampaignParties and regions=== Fourteen parties contested the election: {  - ! colspan=2Parties -  * Bright Turkey Party (Aydƒ±nlƒ±k T√ºrkiye Partisi, ATP) * Communist Party of Turkey (T√ºrkiye Kom√ºnist Partisi, TKP) * Democratic Party (Demokrat Parti, DP) * Felicity Party (Saadet Partisi, SP) * Freedom and Solidarity Party (√ñzg√ºrl√ºk ve Dayanƒ±≈üma Partisi, √ñDP) * Independent Turkey Party (Baƒüƒ±msƒ±z T√ºrkiye Partisi, BTP) * Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkƒ±nma Partisi, AKP)  * Labour Party (Emek Partisi, EP) * Liberal Democratic Party (Liberal Demokrat Parti, LDP) * Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyet√ßi Hareket Partisi, MHP) * People's Ascent Party (Halkƒ±n Y√ºkseli≈üi Partisi, HYP) * Republican People's Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, CHP) * Workers' Party (ƒ∞≈ü√ßi Partisi, ƒ∞P) * Young Party (Gen√ß Parti, GP) } Additionally, members of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi, DTP) stood as independents in mainly Kurdish-inhabited districts; over 600 independents contested the election in total.

The Republican People's Party (CHP), a center-left party, will be looking forward to form a single party, or most likely a coalition government. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, speaking at a parliamentary group meeting of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) on Friday, stated that they are not engaging in restricted politics but that their party is a center party that is open to all segments of society. Alliances The threshold of 10% forces minor and medium sized parties to form alliances. The first official offer came from Liberal Democratic Party who offered an alliance to nine political parties both from left and right wings, including the Motherland Party and Democratic Left Party. Unification: :Liberal parties: On June 2, 2007, the True Path Party changed its name to Democratic Party (DP), and the Motherland Party was to merge into DP. However, the Motherland Party did not dissolve itself in a party congress. On 2 June 2007 Erkan Mumcu made a statement accusing DYP leader not having fulfilled the promises he made in the unification protocol. :Left parties: The Republican People's Party (as the largest centre-left political party) had expressed their wish to amalgamate with the Democratic Left Party and the Social Democratic People's Party. As of May 17, 2007, they made an election alliance with Democratic Left Party. Groups and unions: :Armenians in Turkey: The Patriarch Mesrob II Mutafyan of Constantinople gave his support to Erdoƒüan's Justice and Development Party. Mesrob II claimed that Erdoƒüan has been good to his people, gave his support to Armenians' rights and was less nationalist than the Kemalist CHP. Mesrob II claimed that he represents a substantial amount of Armenian votes [around 40,000] and has power to effect the results in his region.The interview was published in Hurriyet :Alevis in Turkey: This elections Alevi representation will not vote as a block to Republican People's Party as they were in the past. Imports/exports Justice and Development Party: Erdoƒüan, speaking at a parliamentary group meeting of JDP, stated that they are not engaging in restricted politics [only based on religion] but that their party is a \\"center party\\" that is open to all segments of society. Imports: In alliance with his goal: Ankara Chamber of Industry Chairman Zafer √áaƒülayan, Ahmet ƒ∞yimaya (from DYP), Mehmet Doma√ß, Associate Professor Zeynep Daƒüƒ±, Professor Zafer √úsk√ºl (from SHP), Fazilet Daƒücƒ± √áƒ±ƒülƒ±, Professor Yusuf Ziya ƒ∞rbe√ß, Osman Yaƒümurdereli, Ertuƒürul G√ºnay (from CHP), Reha √áamuroƒülu (Alevi) and √úlk√º G√∂kalp G√ºney are imported to the party. Exports: Before the party lists declared; the establishing member and the State Minister Abd√ºllatif ≈ûener said he would not run for parliamentary elections. Bandƒ±rma deputy Turhan √á√∂mez, declared that he will not run. Motherland Party: After the failed unification (alliance) there are members that quit the party. Exports: Nejat Arseven, L√ºtfullah Kayalar (to CHP), Edip Safder Gaydalƒ± (to CHP) and ≈ûerif Bedirhanoƒülu among them. Finance Campaign finance has been an issue in Turkey, as religion-based parties were said to have taken foreign monetary support.

Furthermore, the election of independent DTP member Sebahat Tuncel was criticised by opponents; she was elected from prison, having been arrested in November 2006 for alleged links to the PKK. ==Analysis== While the AKP gained votes over 2002, the resurgence of the nationalist MHP resulted in a slight net loss of 23 seats for AKP. AKP was therefore unable to obtain a two-thirds majority for the second time since the party first contested a general election in 2002. Still, with 61.8% of the seats, the AKP maintains a large outright majority in the 16th Parliament. The resurgence of the MHP gives them 71 seats to make them the third party for the 16th Parliament. Their resurgence proved far more costly for the CHP, who lost 66 seats but maintained their position as the second party in the 16th Parliament. Independents fared far better in 2007 than in 2002, earning a 5.2% share of the popular vote, up from 1% in the previous election. As a result, the number of independent MPs in the 16th Parliament (60th government) will increase from 9 to 27. == See also == * Politics of Turkey * History of the Republic of Turkey#AKP government (2002‚Äìpresent) ==ReferencesExternal links== *CNN Turk article (in Turkish) *2007 elections news in English *2007 elections news in Turkish *Turkishpolitix.com - Online Dossier on elections in 2007 (in English) 2007 Category:2007 elections in Europe Category:2007 elections in Turkey ","title":"2007 Turkish general election"},{"id":"7460796","text":"Drawing of a scene from the play in The Illustrated London News, 1870 The Palace of Truth is a three-act blank verse \\"Fairy Comedy\\" by W.

In 1904, the American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer suggested that Phaner derived from the Greek œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅœåœÇ (phaneros) meaning \\"visible, evident\\". In 2012, researchers searched the general literature published around 1870. The Palace of Truth had premiered only 12 days prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript assigning the genera, and they saw that three character names in the play, King Phanor, Mirza and Azema, corresponded to the genera Phaner (fork-marked lemur), Mirza (giant mouse lemur) and Azema (mouse lemur) described by Gray in the same publication and equally enigmatic. The researchers concluded that Gray saw Gilbert's comedy and named the three lemur genera after its characters. Dunkel, A. R., J. S. Zijlstra and C. P.

These plays, influenced by the fairy works of James Planch√©, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or supernatural interference.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907‚Äì21).

The Palace of Truth was the first of these, followed by Pygmalion and Galatea (1871), a satire of sentimental, romantic attitudes toward myth, The Wicked World (1873), and Broken Hearts (1875). At the same time, Gilbert wrote some dramas, including Sweethearts (1874) and Charity (1874), all of which helped to established his artistic credentials as a writer of wide range, who was as comfortable with human drama as with the comedies for which he is most famous.Stedman, chapter 8 W.S.

The play ran for approximately 140 performances at the Haymarket,An advertisement in The Times, 22 April 1871, p. 8, states that the 135th performance would be the \\"last but five\\" and that a new piece would open at the theatre on 29 April.

An exchange in the piece, where the character of Zoram, the court composer and a poseur, makes the following complicated musical remark, was tried out by Gilbert on his future collaborator, Arthur Sullivan, some months before the play was produced (Gilbert had looked up the definition of \\"harmony\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and translated it into blank-verse, as follows):How, Barry, in The Strand Magazine, July‚ÄìDecember 1891 :Believe me, the result would be the same, :Whether your lordship chose to play upon :The simple tetrachord of Mercury :That knew no diatonic intervals, :Or the elaborate dis‚Äëdiapason :(Four tetrachords, and one redundant note), :Embracing in its perfect consonance :All simple, double and inverted chords! ==Roles and original cast== Poster for the play's 108th performance *King Phanor, a philanderer; likes \\"yes\\" men ‚Äì J.

The Queen is upset because the Princess is to become engaged tomorrow to the Prince but seems not to love him. The Prince speaks flowery words of love to the Princess. The Queen, jealous, wonders why the King visits the Palace of Truth once a month, while she has never been there in eighteen years of marriage. The King reveals that the palace is enchanted, and every visitor there is bound to speak the truth. The speaker is not aware that he is telling the truth, and it is impossible to keep a secret there. The two decide to bring the Prince and Princess there to find out if they truly love one another. They will also bring all the courtiers. The King tells Gelanor and Mirza that he has a talisman that will keep the holder from having to tell the truth. Act II ‚Äì Inside the Palace of Truth The King is holding the talisman. Everyone else tells the truth: The Princess's singing is terrible; Chrysal did not mean one word that he said at court; Zoram (the composer) doesn't know one note from another, etc. Chrysal and Zoram declare a duel because of the truth they speak. The Prince confesses that at least 500 ladies have kissed him, among other things, and of course the Princess is unhappy. Azema timidly reveals that she wants to try her charms on the Prince. The Prince rejects her, so Azema tries to charm Chrysal. The Prince decides that the palace must be enchanted and shows up human nature as it is and everybody is affected by it, but he doesn't realise that the enchantment affects him. He tells Mirza that he loves her and then reveals this to the Princess. She breaks their bond and gives him his freedom and then pleads with him to take her back and give her until that night. Other characters confess love for each other in strange pairings. After the King reveals that he made love to Mirza in the shrubbery and Mirza admits that she hates the King, he realises that his talisman is not working. Now the King wants to leave! Act III ‚Äì On the Avenue of Palms at night Chrysal has a sword and is ready for the duel with Zoram. Zoram arrives, and the two combatants tell each other, with great bravado, how afraid they are of each other. Gelanor tells them that the Palace makes one say what he thinks. Zoram and Chrysal decide that thoughts are not important. They shake hands. The Queen talks with old Gelanor, and Azema goes to tell the King of this meeting. The Princess begs Mirza to let her have the Prince, and Mirza says she will do so and then go away. She tells him of her love for him and adds that she is going away. The Princess reenters unobserved, and is moved by Mirza's speech. She goes forward and puts Mirza's hand in the Prince's and sets him free. The Prince gives Mirza a ring as a pledge of his love and wants one in return ‚Äì a handkerchief or a glove. She brings forth a handkerchief from her pocket and the crystal talisman falls out. Mirza tells him that it is the talisman; she took it from the King and put the false one in its place. The King arrives, and the Prince gives him the talisman. He tells the Queen she has been found with Gelanor. The Queen truthfully says that it was an innocent meeting. The Queen asks the King if he had been philandering with Azema and, because he has the talisman, he is able to lie, denying it. The Queen apologises. The Prince admits that he has been a fool. The King give the talisman to the Prince but he gives it to the Princess, speaks from his heart and kisses her. The Queen breaks the talisman, also ending the enchantment of the palace, and all note the lessons they have learned. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== *Lengthy synopsis and character descriptions at the G&S; Archive *Libretto *Links to reviews of the play from The Times. *Illustrated scene from The Palace of Truth *Discussion in The Cambridge History of English and American Literature *Includes information about the play *Includes information about a 1905 revival Category:Plays by W.

There is one main crown with a cleft in it that, within the incisal third of the crown, looks like two teeth, though it is not two teeth. The number of the teeth in the arch will be normal. == Signs and symptoms == * Misaligned teeth can lead to chewing difficulty and damage adjacent structures * Occlusion affected, causing deviation * Asymmetry of the dental arch due to enlarged crown * Aesthetic problem * Delay or obstruct the eruption of adjacent tooth * Tooth anatomy making the surface hard to clean and increase susceptibility of dental decay and periodontal disease == Cause == The cause of gemination is still unknown. However, there are a few possible factors contributing to gemination: * Vitamin deficiency * Hormonal irregularities * Infection or inflammation of areas near to the developing tooth bud * Drug induced * Genetic predisposition * Radiotherapy that caused damage to the developing tooth germ ==Mechanism== The phenomenon of gemination arises when two teeth develop from one tooth bud and, as a result, the patient has an extra tooth, in contrast to fusion, where the patient would appear to be missing one tooth. Fused teeth arise through union of two normally separated tooth germs, and depending upon the stage of development of the teeth at the time of union, it may be either complete or incomplete. On some occasions, two independent pulp chambers and root canals can be seen. However, fusion can also be the union of a normal tooth bud to a supernumerary tooth germ. In these cases, the number of teeth is also normal and differentiation from gemination may be very difficult, if not impossible. In geminated teeth, division is usually incomplete and results in a large tooth crown that has a single root and a single canal. It is an asymptomatic condition. The prevalence of gemination or fusion is 2.5% in primary dentition, and 0.1 - 0.2% in permanent dentition. It is more frequently observed in primary than permanent dentition; anterior than posterior teeth; unilaterally than bilaterally. It commonly occurs in the primary upper incisors. == Diagnosis == * Clinical examination * Radiographs - shown as two crowns arising from one single root == Treatment == * Patient should be advised to maintain a good oral hygiene to prevent plaque accumulation. * Fissure sealants and resin restorations for deep grooves and fissures to prevent dental caries. * Orthodontic treatment * Reshape and restore teeth with appropriate material. * Root canal treatment, followed by the reduction of medio-distal width of the tooth. Restore teeth with crown. * Root canal treatment then surgically divide the tooth into two teeth. * If the tooth is not suitable for root canal treatment, then extraction could be considered. Fixed or removable prosthetic may be needed after extraction. * Transplantation of supernumerary teeth to replace the geminated tooth. Before root canal treatment or extraction are carried out, the clinician should have thorough knowledge about the root canal morphology to avoid complications. == Related abnormalities of the dentition == *Amelogenesis imperfecta *Dentinogenesis imperfecta *Hyperdontia - More than the average number of teeth *Anodontia - Lack of tooth development == References  External links == Category:Developmental tooth disorders ","title":"Tooth gemination"},{"id":"7460803","text":"Kalles may refer to: * Kalles Kaviar, a brand of Swedish caviar * Kalles (Bithynia), a town of ancient Bithynia * Kalles (river), a river of Asia Minor ","title":"Kalles"},{"id":"7460808","text":"Vikingarnas FK was a Swedish football club which was founded in 1908.

It is the only member of the monotypic genus Eulacestoma and family Eulacestomidae. ==Taxonomy== The wattled ploughbill was long thought to be related to the whistlers (Pachycephalidae), and shriketits (formerly Pachycephalidae, now often treated as its own family). In particular the wattled ploughbill and crested shriketit share a similar large bill. Genetic studies have shown that these birds are not closely related, and as instead more closely related to the sittellas. Because of its genetic and morphological uniqueness, in 2014 Richard Schodde and Leslie Christidis placed it in its own monotypic family Eulacestomidae. The wattled ploughbill is a monotypic species, meaning it has no accepted subspecies. A subspecies clara has been proposed, but it is not reliably distinct from other birds in this species. ==Description== It is approximately , olive-brown songbird with a strong, thick, wedge-shaped black bill. It weighs . The sexes are different. The male has black underparts, an almost golden forehead, black wings with golden scapulars, and a pair of large circular pink wattles on the cheek. The female has olive green plumage and pale olive below. Only the adult male has wattles. ==Distribution and habitat== The wattled ploughbill is distributed and endemic to central mountain ranges of New Guinea. ==Behaviour== The diet consists mainly of insects. The species feeds from the forest floor to up to , from the understory to the mid-level of the forest. It particularly favours groves of bamboo as a micro-habitat for feeding. It forages on branches and twigs, gleaning insects from the surface and prising off bark to expose prey. The species will readily join mixed-species feeding flocks. ==Conservation== Widespread throughout its large range, the wattled ploughbill is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==References== * del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

The state has a separate appointed board that administers the Alabama Community College System. The governor is the ex officio president of the K-12 board and has voting privileges on all matters, although they are seldom exercised. The remaining eight members are elected to four-year terms in partisan elections from single-member districts of approximately equal population. However, most issues before the board are not necessarily considered as partisan in nature. There is no limit on the number of terms to which members may be elected. Members in Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 are elected in the same cycle as the President of the United States, with their next election scheduled for 2020. Members in Districts 2, 4, 6, and 8 are elected in the same cycle as the Governor of Alabama, with their most recent election occurring in 2018. The eight single-member districts are re-drawn by the Alabama Legislature following each di-cennial U.S. Census. Alabama is currently one of six states that has an elected state school board.Brandon Moseley, Alabama Political Reporter, 5/10/2019 The other states with elected boards are Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, and Texas. A seventh state, Ohio has a board that is a combination of elected and appointed members. ==Officers of the board== A President Pro Tem and a Vice President are chosen among the eight Board members each year to lead Board meetings in the absence of the Governor. Of the current eight members, six are Republicans and two are Democrats. Six of the board members are female, two of which are African-American (Ms. Richardson and Ms. Ella Bell) and two are male (Mr. Newman and Mr. Reynolds). A state Superintendent of Education is appointed by the board to serve as its secretary and executive officer, although he has no vote on issues before the Board. ==Notable board history== The first African-American to serve on the Alabama State Board of Education was Peyton Findley (1871-1873), he was from Lafayette in Chambers County and at his birth in 1824 was \\"free-born.\\" Active in the Republican Party after the Civil War, during the Reconstruction Period, he served a single term on the State School Board. Among his contributions was the introduction of a measure to the Board to create Alabama's first institution of higher-learning for blacks. It was first located in Marion in Perry County and initially called the Lincoln Normal School. In 1887, it was re-located to Montgomery and renamed. Today, it is the nation's third oldest \\"historically-black\\" college, Alabama State University. The first African- American woman to serve on the Alabama State Board was Democrat Ethel H. Hall (1987-2011) of Fairfield, Jefferson County. One recent Board member was Al Thompson, he was appointed to a vacancy on the Board by Governor Robert Bentley in June, 2014 but he resigned in mid-2015 to take a similar position on the new governing body of the Alabama two-year college system. Governor Bentley replaced him with Matthew Brown of Fairhope in Baldwin County on July 16, 2015. Thompson and Brown successively followed board member, Tracy Roberts, who had resigned for undisclosed \\"personal reasons\\" after just one and one-half years on the board. Mr. Brown was defeated for re-nomination by Jackie Ziegler on April 12, 2016, but remained as a member of the Board until his term expired in January, 2017. From the end of Reconstruction until 1986, no Republicans were elected to the Alabama State Board of Education. That year, Spencer Bachus (1987-1991) won 57% of the vote in District 6, dislodging a 26-year Democrat incumbent and becoming the first Republican on the Board in over 100 years. In 1998, the GOP won four of the eight elected seats and achieved a majority in 2008. Democrats usually no longer contest the six Republican held seats and the GOP did not contest either of the black-majority Democrat held seats at the last elections in 2018. ==2020 board elections and failed constitutional amendment== There was a recent vacancy on the board due to the death of District 5 member Ella Bell (2001-2019) who passed away on November 3, 2019 shortly before qualifying closed for the seat. On January 7, 2020, Governor Kay Ivey appointed Dr. Tommie Stewart for the remainder of the unexpired term. She will only serve through the General Election in November, 2020. Both parties have contested Seats 1 and 3 with GOP incumbents seeking re-election and one Democrat qualifying in each race. In the Seat 5 race held by Dr. Tommie Stewart, ten Democrats qualified for the Democratic party nomination and one Republicans qualified. Therefore, the winner of the Democratic primary for District 5 will face the Republican nominee, Lesa Keith in the General Election in November, 2020. In District 7, the incumbent Jeffrey Newman did not seek re-nomination and only Republican Belinda Palmer McRae qualified for the seat in either major party. Ms. McRae will also be elected in November, 2020. In the Regular Session of the Alabama Legislature in 2019, it passed a proposed constitutional amendment to abolish the current eight elected School Board members and replace them wit an eight-member Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. That measure went to the voters in the March 3, 2020 primary and was overwhelmingly defeated by a three to one margin.Alabamavotes.gov website Should that amendment have passed, the existing board would have been abolished before the new members from Districts 5 and 7 would assume their seats. The proposed amendment would have further changed the current members from \\"representing the voters\\" to Commission members whose appointment would be contingent upon \\"representing the racial composition of the student population\\" in Alabama. This will have altered the racial composition of the board from its current 2 minority seats of the eight to being three of the eight Commission members with the further stipulation that the 3 minority members be chosen by the Governor from a list of names submitted to the Governor from members of the Legislative Black Caucus. African-American voters also rejected this attempt to remove their \\"right to vote\\" . The Governor would be unrestricted in the other five appointments.Brandon Moseley, Alabama Political Reporter, June 3, 2019 ==Board members== Members of the board include: *President (The Governor of Alabama) - Kay Ivey *Superintendent/Secretary - Dr. Eric Mackey *Board Members: **District 1: Jackie Zeigler, (R) (2017‚Äìpresent) **District 2: Tracie West, (R) (2019‚Äìpresent) **District 3: Stephanie W.

He is a former coach of the Sierra Leone national football team. Gray made over 300 appearances in his senior career, with his longest stays being with Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. Gray totaled 50 goals in his career. ==Playing career== After playing for Crystal Palace's youth team in 1980‚Äì81, Gray moved into non-league football with Corinthian Casuals and Dulwich Hamlet where he was spotted by Crystal Palace manager Steve Coppell. Gray moved to Palace and quickly became a regular in the team, playing in the forward positions. In the 1985‚Äì86 season, Gray top-scored with 11 goals. However, after the signings of Ian Wright and Mark Bright, Gray moved into central-midfield, and his career came alight. Gray then achieved promotion with Aston Villa and had a spell at Queens Park Rangers, before returning to Selhurst Park for the 1989‚Äì90 season. This proved to be a remarkable season, and Gray managed to secure himself a legacy that will survive in Palace fans' hearts forever. In the league Palace survived comfortably, and they found themselves in an FA Cup Semi-final against champions Liverpool, who were gunning for a league and cup double. Having led 2‚Äì1 at one point, Palace were 3-2 down, and were on the verge of leaving Villa Park with their heads down, before Gray jumped forward to head an 87th-minute equaliser. Alan Pardew's goal in extra-time ensured that Gray and his Palace teammates would get to play in the FA Cup Final. The final would be against Manchester United, and in the match Gray played well as Palace secured a 3‚Äì3 draw. In the replay, Palace were beaten by a single goal: 1‚Äì0. The following season, Palace achieved far more than even the biggest optimists expected. The Eagles chased Liverpool and Arsenal until the end, but had to settle for third place in the First Division. As well as this, they picked up silverware, in winning the Zenith Data Systems Cup. In November 1991, Gray's play was rewarded with a call-up to the England team, and he made his solitary international appearance against Poland in a crucial qualifier for the EURO '92. Gray left Palace at the end of that season, after their form slumped following the sale of Ian Wright, and went to Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£900,000. Whilst at Tottenham he was involved in a dramatic game against Chelsea; he scored a penalty to level the game at 3-3 and moments later Spurs were awarded another penalty but this time Dmitri Kharine saved Gray's effort. Chelsea went on to win 4‚Äì3. His spell at Spurs would be less successful and, following a loan move to Swindon Town, he was sold to CA Marbella for an undisclosed fee. He would round out his career with short spells at Falkirk, where he played in the 1997 Scottish Cup Final, Bury, and Millwall. ==Coaching career== After finishing playing, Gray later went into management. He was appointed as the head coach of Sierra Leone in 2006. He stated he believed Sierra Leone could qualify for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, which they did not. One of the methods for achieving this was to tempt British-born players such as Nigel Reo-Coker, Liam Rosenior and Steve Kabba to accept call-ups to the Sierra Leone team. In 2005, Andy was voted in Palace's Centenary XI. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:English football managers Category:England international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Corinthian-Casuals F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Dulwich Hamlet F.C. players Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. players Category:CA Marbella footballers Category:Expatriate football managers in Sierra Leone Category:Sierra Leone national football team managers Category:Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Andy Gray (footballer, born 1964)"},{"id":"7460995","text":"North Hertfordshire was a parliamentary constituency in Hertfordshire.

Bypassed by the M8 motorway on 28 May 2010, the town is located on the R639 road at its junction with the N77. The River Erkina flows through Durrow and joins the River Nore about 1.5 km east of the town. The town takes its name from the Irish (Darmhagh Ua nDuach - the oak plain [in the territory] of Ui Duach). ==History== Durrow (yellow circle at lower right) was an exclave of County Kilkenny until 1842. The earliest recorded church in the village was in 1155. Evidence from the Archaeological Survey carried out by the Office of Public Works in 1995 suggests that this area has been visited, if not inhabited, since as early as the Bronze Age. An urn-burial found on the lands of Moyne Estate dates roughly to the same period as those found at lronmills and Ballymartin (900‚Äì1400BC). Fulachta Fiadh (early cooking sites) have been identified at Aharney and near Ballacolla. The ring forts and other enclosures that dot the landscape point to a more permanent, if dispersed, settlement of the land by the Celts (500BC‚Äì500AD). At some point in pre- history, the land was part of the kingdom of Ossory, and remained so as part of Upper Ossory into the seventeenth century. There are numerous religious settlements in the area that date back to the 6th century. While the monastery founded by St. Fintan on the banks of the Erkina is perhaps the best renowned, documented evidence exists for other such establishments at Dunmore, Clonageera, Dereen, the Course wood, Tinweir, Ballinaslee, Tubberboe and Newtown. The coming of the Normans in the 12th century sounded the death knell for many of these early Christian settlements and the lands were subsumed (despite heated objections from the Earls Marshall, who wanted it for themselves) into the Manor of Durrow, an Episcopal Manor for the Bishops of Ossory. Indeed, it was this development that sowed the seeds for the establishment of the town of Durrow as we now know it. In 1245, Geoffrey de Turville, the Bishop of Ossory from 1244 to 1250, was granted permission from the King to hold a yearly fair at this manor for six days beginning on St. Swithin's Day and a weekly market on a Thursday. After the Reformation, the manor passed into the ownership of the Earl of Ormond. In 1600, when Upper Ossory was made part of Queen's County (now Laois), Ormond ensured that Durrow remained an enclave of County Kilkenny where he was based. Ormond released the manor on 19 February 1708 to \\"William Flower and his heirs, forever\\". It was under the patronage of Flower and his descendants, the Lords Ashbrook, that the present town developed and prospered. In 1841‚Äì42 it was transferred from Kilkenny to Queen's County. ==Climate== A weather station broadcasts from Durrow providing real time data. The station was set up in May 2008. It is a Davis ProVantage 2 station and monitors temperature, rain, wind, wind direction, humidity and atmospheric pressure. Also, a Met √âireann climate station (472) was installed in 2010 and the observations are sent to Dublin on a monthly basis. The climatological station measures rainfall in a manual gauge, soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm, air temperatures including wet-bulb, daily max, daily min and grass minimum temperatures. The station is envisaged to last thirty years and establish a climate profile for Durrow. The weather of the town can be described as temperate with rare extremes when compared to other locations around the world. However, when looking at the observations and comparing it to other locations around Ireland it is notable that Durrow is amongst the warmest locations in the country during the summer, and the coldest in winter. Owing to the proximity of the \\"sunny southeast\\" the town receives lower rainfall than the national average. The record high temperature of 31.3c was recorded during the heatwave of 2018 whilst the record low temperature of -14.0c was recorded on Christmas morning 2010. The below table was last updated on June 27th 2019. ==Sport== Harps GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, and Lions A.F.C. is the local soccer club.

There is also woodland in the vicinity of Durrow, such as Bishops Wood, which extends on both sides of the R693 (Dublin - Cork Road). The river Erkina, a tributary of the River Nore, is also in the area. ==Scarecrow festival== Durrow's \\"Scarecrow Festival\\" takes place each year in late July. The 2015 festival took place between 26 July and 3 August. The idea is that people from the town and area create their own scarecrows made from straw and other materials.

It is the main town in the Shire of Wandering. At the , Wandering had a population of 294. ==History== The area's name, although an English word, appears to owe its name to a local Aboriginal word, \\"wandooin\\", after the wandoo or white gum tree that is prevalent in the area, although some sources suggest it was named to recall the first sighting of wandering stock, and was originally applied to Wandering Brook, first recorded in 1866. Wandering was first settled in 1859 by members of the George Stedman Watts family when their straying wagon team horses were found grazing in lush grass around a fresh water spring known to this day as Horse Well. In 1861, they selected an area on what is now the south-eastern approach to the town, and named it \\"Grassdale\\" - the property is still owned by the Watts family to this day. A road board (later to become the Shire Council) was convened in 1874 within slightly different boundaries to the present day. By 1877, there was sufficient population in the area for the government to set aside land for a school. In 1911-12, the government surveyed a number of lots and then gazetted the townsite of Wandering. However, the decision two decades earlier to build the railway some distance to the east restricted the town's growth. Also, fresh water was not readily available - the town was reliant on two Water Corporation dams until scheme water was extended here in 1997. Subsequently, rural residential subdivisions in the area on lots have been developed.Source: Shire of Wandering From 1944 to 1977, the Wandering Mission, also known as St Francis Xavier Mission, was operated as a home for Aboriginal children by the Pallottine Fathers.Wandering (St Xavier) Mission, Signposts; German Missionaries in Australia: Wandering Brook A recollection of growing up in the mission is in Glenyse Ward's autobiography, Wandering Girl (Magabala Books, Broome, 1988). It was later the subject of a number of sexual abuse claims.Catholic Church schools and homes with the most child abuse claims revealed, ABC News 16 Feb 2017. ==Present day== Wandering is primarily an agricultural region, which produces hay, cereal crops, pulse crops (such as lupins), oil seed (canola), wool, lamb and beef. Timber milling and viticulture are also practised. The town's school (K-7) still operates with mixed-grade classes, and accommodation is offered at a caravan park with powered sites. The original Agricultural Hall (1896) now hosts a telecentre for the use of the town's residents, and a nearby hall hosts local community groups and clubs. ==Climate== Wandering has a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool, damp winters. In winter, it is one of the coldest towns in Western Australia, not infrequently recording temperatures below .

The Frisian League is historically linked to the Christian Democratic Appeal, which is currently one of the major parties of the Netherlands. ==Party history== The Frisian League was founded on 24 March 1898 by the reformed minister Hoedemaker. It was founded as one of several parties that were founded in the 1890s, which all turned again the leadership and ideology of Abraham Kuyper, the leader of the Protestant Anti Revolutionary Party. Kuyper had initiated a new political course for Protestantism in the Netherlands, which included cooperation with the Catholics, in the coalition, strategical support for extension of suffrage a rejection of theocracy in favour of a specific conception of state neutrality, sphere sovereignty and a strong party organization and party discipline. The party also rejected the split of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands from the Dutch Reformed Church. The party won one seat (Harlingen) in the 1901 elections, which was taken by the minister Schoking. It held its one seat in the 1905 elections. In 1908 the party merged with the Christian Historical Party to found the Christian Historical Union. ==Name== The rather complicated name of the party League of caucuses on Christian Historical foundation in the province of Friesland was chosen to convey several things: the party was not a centralized party with party discipline, instead it was a league of local caucuses; the term Christian Historical was used before 1898 to denote supporters of the main Protestant party, the Anti Revolutionary Party, emphasizing the Protestant nature of the history of the Netherlands; and finally the only representatives of the party came from Friesland, although it also had branches in South Holland. ==Ideology & issues== The Frisian League was a conservative Protestant party. It saw government as a god-given institution, which should act according to biblical norms. Society should furthermore follow its historical course. Power should not be based on the opinion of the majority but on authority. The most important issue for the party was the increasing neutrality of the state and the acceptance of Catholicism. The party advocated a Protestant theocracy and was strong anti-papist. Furthermore, the party opposed general suffrage. ==Representation== This table shows the Frisian League's results elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter. It also possible that the party leader is member of cabinet, if the League was part of the governing coalition, the \\"highest ranking\\" minister is listed. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - ccc;\\" !

Its support was heavily regionalized in Friesland. ==International comparison== As a party for Protestant dissenters of a catholic-Protestant alliance the Frisian League is a unique phenomenon in international perspective. Its political course, which included support of limited government, rejection of universal suffrage and hostility against Catholicism, is comparable to the course of the British Conservative Party in the late 1800s and to some extent American Party of the United States. ==References== Category:Protestant political parties Category:Defunct Christian political parties Category:Defunct political parties in the Netherlands Category:Confessional parties in the Netherlands Category:Conservative parties in the Netherlands Category:Regionalist parties in the Netherlands Category:Political parties established in 1898 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1908 Category:1898 establishments in the Netherlands Category:History of Friesland Category:Politics of Friesland Category:Politics of South Holland ","title":"Frisian League"},{"id":"7461155","text":"The 1909‚Äì10 Prima Categoria season was won by Internazionale. ==Final classificationResults tableChampionship play-offReferences and sources== *Almanacco Illustrato del Calcio - La Storia 1898-2004, Panini Edizioni, Modena, September 2005 *Carlo Chiesa, La grande storia del calcio italiano, Chapter 2: Juve, scippati due titoli!

Its ruins are located in southern Istria, Croatia, between the villages of Muntiƒá and Valtura. ==History== In pre-Roman times, Nesactium, ruled by its legendary king Epulon, was the capital of the tribal population of the peninsula called Histri, who were also connected to the prehistoric Castellieri culture. Some theories state a later Celtic influence, but who they were and where they came from has never been discovered for certain. It is believed that their main economic activities were trade and piracy all over the ancient Mediterranean Sea. In 177 BC, the town was conquered by the Romans and destroyed. Rebuilt upon the original Histrian pattern, it was a Roman town until 46‚Äì45 BC, when the Ancient Greek colony Polai was elevated to Pietas Iulia, today Pula. The town was located on the ancient road Via Flavia, which connected Trieste to Dalmatia. The area was abandoned by the Romans in the 6th century, following the Slav invasions.

The Kisber Felver is not widely known, but has merit in sport horse disciplines. Only a handful of people continue breeding Kisber Felver horses today. ==History== The Kisber Stud was founded in 1853, and initially bred Thoroughbreds. It successfully produced racehorses and was the origin for champions such as the unbeaten mare Kincsem, who was entered in The Guinness Book of World Records. Through a carefully controlled breeding program, a distinct horse type evolved. The Kisber Felver was bred by crossing Thoroughbreds with Furiosos, Trakehners, Arabians, Anglo-Arabians, and Selle Fran√ßais, while maintaining the a high ratio of Thoroughbred blood. The Kisber Felver is a relatively young breed, developed over the past hundred years, and they display good conformation, athletic ability, movement, and a lively temperament. Like many other horse breeds, the Kisber Felver was endangered during the World War I and World War II. In 1945, more than half of the breeding stock were taken as war spoils. 150 Kisber Felver horses were imported for the US Remount, but were sold at public auction in 1947 when the remount disbanded. Unlike other European imports such as the Lipizzaner, the imported Kisber Felvers were widely crossbred, reducing the count of purebred animals. In 1961, the Dalmand Stud took hold of the remaining purebred Kisber Felvers. The stud has continued the breeding to the day. ==Characteristics== Kisber Felvers are a sporthorse breed developed to perform in a variety of modern sport horse disciplines. They stand between and can be any solid color but are often bay or chestnut. All stallions intended for breeding must be inspected and licensed by the breeding committee. ==External links== * Oklahoma State University page Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Hungary ","title":"Kisber Felver"},{"id":"7461249","text":"WLIW-FM (88.3 FM) is a radio station licensed to Southampton, New York and serving eastern Long Island and coastal Connecticut. Owned by WNET, it is a sister station to PBS member television station WLIW, and features programming from American Public Media, NPR and Public Radio International. The station also broadcasts in HD. It is the only NPR station on Long Island (population about 8 million). It is one of three public radio stations broadcast to eastern Long Island. The other stations are Connecticut-based WSHU/WSUF and Connecticut Public Radio, both of which access the market via repeater stations. In addition to its to NPR programming, local programs include jazz, rhythm and blues, world music and music from Broadway theater, as well as \\"Heart of the East End\\" with Gianna Volpe, \\"The Afternoon Ramble\\" with Brian Cosgrove and \\"The Urban Jazz Experience\\" with Ed German. ==HistorySouthampton College (1978‚Äì2010)=== The original station was a carrier current station, WSCR, housed in a Southampton College dormitory suite, and run as a student club. The founding members included Aaron Mann, Peter Sarros, Bruce Chappelle, Andy Novick, and Mike Unher. After much of the equipment was lost to theft, and finding the theft covered by insurance, construction of a new stereo FM station began in the basement of Southampton Hall by 1978. The antenna tower was raised in January 1980, and the station went on the air, still as a club and funded by student activity fees, as WPBX at 91.3 MHz on March 11, 1980. The first two songs played were \\"On the Air\\" and \\"DIY\\" by Peter Gabriel. The original power output of the FM transmitter was ten (10) watts. However, even with this low RF power output, the station could be received by a listener in Sag Harbor, NY, 7 miles away, who employed a yagi type directional antenna, pointed towards the station's transmitter on the Southampton campus. It was completely student-run, with free-form programming, and largely ignored by the administration, until 1981-82 when the administration imposed some control and installed Joseph Valerio to run the station. Valerio arranged to carry Texaco's Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts and programming began evolving toward an NPR-style format. On July 6, 2002, the station changed its call sign to WLIU. In February 2002, the station changed to a jazz format. In April 2004, the station changed to a news format. ===Peconic Public Broadcasting (2010‚Äì2020)=== The station broadcast from the second floor of Chancellors Hall on the campus of Stony Brook Southampton until the spring of 2010. The State University of New York at Stony Brook had taken over the LIU campus (previously named Southampton College) in 2006. At the time of the takeover, an agreement was made to permit the station to continue to broadcast from the school through 2009 and that it could continue to use the tower on the campus through 2024. The transfer of ownership of the station from Long Island University to Peconic Public Broadcasting was completed on December 15, 2010 and the call-letters changed to WPPB to reflect this. The studios were moved to Hill St. in Southampton village after Peconic Public Broadcasting took ownership. The acquisition was led by Wallace A. \\"Wally\\" Smith who was station manager of WLIU. Smith was station manager of KUSC when it converted from an all rock station to a classical music station in Los Angeles, California and was President of that radio station until 1996 (Smith's wife Bonnie Grice was an on air announcer at both KUSC and WPPB. She left WPPB for Sag Harbor radio station WLNG shortly before the announcement of the sale to WNET). The grassroots effort had included Alec Baldwin, Joy Behar and Jann Wenner. The package for the acquisition was $2.7 million ($1.35 million in cash; picking up $400,000 in transition operating costs; and maintaining WCWP radio station for one year at LIU's parent C.W. Post campus‚Äîestimated at $1 million). ===WNET.org (2020‚Äìpresent)=== On October 24, 2019, it was announced that WNET would acquire WPPB for nearly $1 million, making it a sister to its Long Island PBS member station WLIW. WNET's purchase was consummated on March 18, 2020, at a final price of $944,834. On June 15, 2020, the station rebranded and changed its calls to WLIW-FM, adding more national NPR programming to its lineup. ==ReferencesExternal links== * LIW-FM Category:NPR member stations Category:Mass media in Suffolk County, New York Category:Southampton (town), New York Category:Radio stations established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"WLIW-FM"},{"id":"7461267","text":"G√∂teborgs FF is a Swedish football club located in Gothenburg. ==Background== G√∂teborgs Fotbollf√∂rening was founded on 20 August 1897 and is located in Gothenburg.

They occur in isogamous and anisogamous species. Depending on the group, different mating types are often referred to by numbers, letters, or simply \\"+\\" and \\"‚àí\\" instead of \\"male\\" and \\"female\\", that refer to \\"sexes\\" or differences in size between gametes. Syngamy can only take place between gametes carrying different mating types. Reproduction regulated by mating types is especially prevalent in fungi. Filamentous ascomycetes usually have two mating types referred to as \\"MAT1-1\\" and \\"MAT1-2\\", following the yeast mating type locus MAT. Under standard nomenclature, MAT1-1 (which may informally be called MAT1) encodes for a regulatory protein with a high motility-group (HMG) DNA-binding motif, while MAT1-2 (informally called MAT2) encodes for a protein with an alpha box motif, as in the yeast mating type MATŒ±1. The corresponding mating types in yeast, a non-filamentous ascomycete, are referred to as MATa and MATŒ±. Mating type genes in ascomycetes are called idiomorphs rather than alleles due to the uncertainty of the origin by common descent. The proteins they encode are transcription factors that regulate both the early and late stages of the sexual cycle. Heterothallic ascomycetes produce gametes that present a single Mat idiomorph and syngamy will only be possible between gametes carrying complementary mating types. On the other hand, homothallic ascomycetes produce gametes that can fuse with every other gamete in the population (including its own mitotic descendants) most often because each haploid contains the two alternate forms of the Mat locus in its genome. Basidiomycetes on the other hand can have thousands of different mating types. The adaptive function of mating type in the ascomycete Neurospora crassa is discussed in the article Neurospora crassa. That matings in N. crassa are restricted to interaction of strains of opposite mating type may be an adaptation to promote some degree of outcrossing. Outcrossing, through complementation, could provide the benefit of masking recessive deleterious mutations in genes that function in the dikaryon and/or diploid stage of the life cycle. ==See also== * Mating in fungi * Mating of yeast * Mating-type region *Neurospora crassa *Saccharomyces cerevisiae ==References== * C.J.

It is an obligate anaerobe and is a common inhabitant of the alimentary tract within humans and animals. ==Pathogenicity== F. necrophorum is responsible for 10% of acute sore throats, 21% of recurrent sore throats and 23% of peritonsillar abscesses with the remainder being caused by Group A streptococci or viruses. Other complications from F. necrophorum include meningitis, complicated by thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, thrombosis of the cerebral veins, and infection of the urogenital and the gastrointestinal tracts. Although this infection is rare, researchers agree that this diagnosis should be considered in a septicaemic patient with thrombosis in an unusual site, and underlying malignancy should be excluded in cases of confirmed F. necrophorum occurring at sites caudal to the head. The above statistical analysis is dated, necessarily. A 2015 study of young adult students presenting to a single clinic in Alabama had F. necrophorum as the predominate causative organism for pharyngitis 21% of the time (and found in 9% of asymptomatic students). In the same study, Group A Streptococcus was found in 10% of pharyngitis patients (1% of asymptomatic students). ===Treatment=== F. necrophorum infection (also called F-throat) usually responds to treatment with penicillin or metronidazole, but penicillin treatment for persistent pharyngitis appears anecdotally to have a higher relapse rate, although the reasons are unclear. ===Infection in animals=== This bacterium has been found to be associated with the foot disease thrush in horses. Thrush is a common infection that occurs on the hoof of a horse, specifically in the region of the frog. F. necrophorum occurs naturally in the animal's environment, especially in wet, muddy, or unsanitary conditions, such as an unclean stall. Horses with deep clefts, or narrow or contracted heels are more at-risk to develop thrush. F. necrophorum is also a cause for lameness in sheep. Its infection is commonly called scald. It can last for several years on land used by either sheep or cattle, and is found on most land of this type throughout the world. Due to its survival length in these areas, it is unrealistic to try to remove it. Sheep most often get scald due to breakage or weakness of the skin surrounding the hoof. This can occur due to strong footbaths, sandy soils, mild frostbite, or prolongened waterlogging of a field, and results in denaturing of the skin between the cleats. F. necrophorum is the cause of necrotic laryngitis (\\"calf diphtheria\\") and liver abscesses in cattle. :See also Blain, an archaic disease of uncertain etiology. == References Further readingExternal links== *Type strain of Fusobacterium necrophorum at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-negative bacteria Category:Horse diseases Category:Fusobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 1886 ","title":"Fusobacterium necrophorum"},{"id":"7461283","text":"Masasa Moyo (born July 23, 1970) is a Canadian actress and voice actress. ==FilmographyFilm=== * Kingdom Come (2001) - Delightful Slocumb * Nosferatu L.A.

It is generally regarded as a controversial experiment, with no clear consensus as to its overall effectiveness. The original focus of the polytechnic institutions was STEM subjects, especially degrees in engineering, applied science, and life sciences, but soon after they formed, they developed faculties in humanities, law, architecture, journalism and other professional practice occupations. With the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, this era ended when polytechnics became \\"new universities\\", broadening their educational scope and conferring degrees in their own right. The University of Ulster was formed in 1984 from a merger between the New University of Ulster and the Ulster Polytechnic - the only such \\"trans binary merger\\" that crossed the divide. ==Further reading== *Pratt, J.

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 6,266. In the 1960s and 1970s, two overspill housing estates, Spath Lane in HandforthGoogle Maps: Handforth (Retrieved 29 November 2014) and Colshaw Farm nearby in Wilmslow, were built to re-house people from inner city Manchester.Google Maps: Colshaw Farm (Retrieved 29 November 2014) ==History== Handforth's original name was Handforth cum-Bosden, and for many years it was in the parish of Cheadle. The name \\"Handforth\\" is believed to originate from the Saxon Hanna's Ford, when there was a crossing on the River Dean. The first mention of Handforth is in a charter dated between 1233 and 1236. Handforth is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 but, at that time, it may have been recorded as a component part of the parish of Cheadle. One of the earliest references to Handforth occurs in a deed of transfer (copy held by the John Rylands Library) between Lord Edmund Phitoun and Henry de Honeford and dated 1291. The deed relates to the site of a water mill and ‚Äúassigns a whole half of the water of Honeford between the two highways of which a certain way comes from Wilmyslawe and the other way which comes from Macclisfeld and extends itself beyond said water towards Bolleschawehefd.‚Äù During the Crusades, Handforth acquired its own Coat of Arms, which displays the Honford Star. The Honford Star originated from Henry de Honford who, while fighting in the Crusades, painted a silver star on his black shield after seeing a star fall from the sky during a night attack on the Saracens.Graham Rollason, Handforth (Retrieved 4 December 2014) The town was referred to as Honford in John Speede's map of the area in 1611,Map of Cheshire, by John Speed, Published By Basset & Chiswell, 1676 (Retrieved 29 November 2014) after the local feudal family known as the de Honford's. Handforth Hall The oldest building in Handforth is Handforth Hall, a typically Tudor-styled black and white timber building built by Sir Urian Brereton in 1562. It was originally named Honford Hall after the de Honford's. Sir Urian was escheator of Cheshire, one of the privy grooms to King Henry and knighted in 1544 at Leith during an attack on Edinburgh. Sir Urian Brereton died at Handforth Hall on 19 March 1577 and is thought to be buried in a chapel at St Mary's Church, Cheadle. In the south chapel are three recumbent effigies. Two are in alabaster and are thought to represent members of the Hondford (or Handford) family, Sir John, who died in 1461 and his son, also named John. The third is in sandstone and represents Sir Thomas Brereton who died in 1673. The most famous resident of Handforth is Sir Urian's great grandson, the Parliamentary General, Sir William Bereton, who fought in the Civil War. During the First World War an Internment camp was set up in Handforth for both civilian and military prisoners. The camp was converted from a disused print works built in 1910. The site was requisitioned by the War Office in 1914 and designed to hold no more than 3,000 men. Handforth camp was opened on 6 November 1914 with the arrival of 500 prisoners. From May 1915 following the aftermath of the Anti-German riots which swept a number of cities, and the decision to intern ‚Äòenemy aliens‚Äô the civilian population in the camp increased. A number of men were sent to Handforth from Liverpool. Handforth was inspected by an attach√© to the American Embassy in London on 1 April 1916. At this time there were 2,713 prisoners at the camp. At the height of operations the internee population was greater than that of the village of Handforth itself. Later on when German soldiers captured from the front line started to arrive, the local population started to take a greater interest and watched the new arrivals, with crowds gathering at the nearby railway station. The Manchester Evening News reported on Wednesday 17 March 1915: \\"Great excitement prevailed at Handforth and Wilmslow today when it became generally known that about 600 German prisoners taken during heavy fighting in the North of France were expected to arrive for internment at the concentration camp.\\"‚ÄòHandforth, Cheshire East: German Takeover of a Sleepy Village‚Äô, BBC World War One at Home http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023084q‚ÄòHandforth Concentration Prison‚Äô, Diverse Narratives of WWI, http://diversenarratives.com/2015/02/05/handforth- concentration-prison/‚ÄòPrisoners of War and Internees (Great Britain)‚Äô, International Encyclopaedia of the First World War, http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/prisoners_of_war_and_internees_great_britain During the Second World War Handforth, along with Cheadle Hulme, was home to large parts of RAF Handforth. This was a maintenance unit, classed as a universal stores depot, and had the official Royal Air Force name RAF Handforth No 61 M.U. (Maintenance unit). The depot opened in 1939, closed in 1959 and covered large areas of land in both Handforth and neighbouring Cheadle Hulme. Greyhound Inn, Handforth c.1905 (since demolished) The depot stored and dispatched every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was served by a large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline near Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is at the rear of the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre. The only surviving buildings of RAF Handforth are the government pay offices adjacent to the Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in MoD use to this day. In January 2017, government plans were announced to build a garden village on the eastern margin of Handforth village, to include 2,000 houses with facilities including a nursery and care home. ===Administrative history=== Handforth-cum-Bosden was part of the Stockport Registration District between 1837 and 1877, until it was divided onto the separate parishes of Handforth and Bosden. Handforth continued to be part of the Stockport Registration District from 1877 to 1936 when it was then incorporated into the parishes of Wilmslow and Cheadle and Gatley. The parish of Bosden was abolished in 1900 and incorporated into the parish of Hazel Grove and Bramhall. Handforth along with other towns, such as Whitworth, Poynton and Alderley Edge, successfully objected to being part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester when it was formed in 1974, as a result of plans laid out in the Local Government Act 1972.Local Government Act 1972 (Retrieved 29 November 2014) From 1974 until the changes in local government which occurred in 2009, Handforth was administered by both the Macclesfield Borough Council and also the Cheshire County Council. On 1 April 2009, it became part of the Cheshire East unitary authority. ==Geography== Handforth borders Heald Green to the north and Wilmslow to the south, between the Cheshire Plain and the Pennines.Macchi, L. (1990). \\"A Field Guide to the Continental Permo-Triassic Rocks of Cumbria and Northwest Cheshire\\". Liverpool Geological Society, Liverpool: 88 pages. The area lies near the River Dean, a tributary of the River Bollin that flows north‚Äìwest and eventually joins the River Mersey near Lymm. The local geology is mostly glacial clay, as well as glacial sands and gravel.Taylor, B.; Price R., and Trotter F. (1963). \\"The geology of the Country around Stockport and Knutsford\\". Memoir of the Geological Survey GB: pp 20‚Äì22.British Geological Survey 1:50K map series sheets 96-98, 108-110, 122,123 and accompanying memoirs The majority of buildings in the area are houses which date from the 20th or 21st centuries. However, there are a few buildings in the area that are earlier than that and date back to before the 20th century and as far as the 16th century (such as Handforth Hall). === Climate === Handforth experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. ==Physical geography== The eastern half of Cheshire, in which Handforth is located, is Upper Triassic Mercia Mudstone laid down with large salt deposits which were mined for hundreds of years around Northwich. Separating this area from Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone to the west is a prominent sandstone ridge known as the Mid Cheshire Ridge. A footpath, the Sandstone Trail, follows this ridge from Frodsham to Whitchurch passing Delamere Forest, Beeston Castle and earlier Iron Age forts. The highest point in Cheshire is Shining Tor on the Derbyshire/Cheshire border between Macclesfield and Buxton, at above sea level. Before county boundary alterations in 1974, the county top was Black Hill () near Crowden in the far east of the historic county on the border with the West Riding of Yorkshire. Black Hill is now the highest point in West Yorkshire. ==Governance== Handforth is situated in Cheshire East, a unitary authority area with borough status in the county of Cheshire. Handforth falls within the constituency of Tatton, a strongly Conservative constituency represented by Esther McVey. It is the third most affluent constituency in the UK outside of Kensington and Cities of London and Westminster. The area is also represented in the European Parliament by being part of the North West England constituency. ==DemographyPopulation=== The historic population of Handforth was 650 in 1851, and 911 in 1901. According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the Handforth Ward has a population of 9,139 people.Office for National Statistics (Retrieved 29 November 2014) This is an increase from the data in the 2001 Census, when the Handforth Ward had a population of 8,014 people.

It is recorded that John Wesley preached at nearby Finney Green on 1 September 1748. Roman Catholic: St. Benedict's Roman Catholic Church, part of the Diocese of Shrewsbury. The Church was officially opened by the Bishop of Shrewsbury on 29 November 1968. It is perhaps particularly important to its congregation that the ground on which they tread when entering the Church was once trodden on by Ambrose Barlow on the way to his mother's birthplace at Handforth Hall, and that the youthful scholars of the nearby St Benedict's school are playing in a playground which was once the 'garden or pleasureground' mentioned by Richard Brooke.Heusel, F.E. (1982) Handforth Through The Ages, Cheshire Libraries and Museums Anglican: St. Chad's Church of England, which is part of the Diocese of Chester, is the Anglican Church based in Handforth. During the 19th century a Chapel of ease was built in Handforth, which was part of the Parish of Cheadle. It was consecrated in 1837 as a chapel to St Mary's Church, Cheadle, becoming the parish church for Handforth and part of Cheadle in 1877. Due to growth of the Handforth population in the late 19th century, the Church went through extensive redevelopment and expansion and the new St Chad's Church was consecrated by Francis Jayne, Bishop of Chester on St Chad's Day, 2 March 1899.Church of England: Diocese of Chester (Retrieved 30 November 2013)RC Diocese of Shrewsbury (Retrieved 30 November 2013) ==Transport== Handforth railway station is on a double-track electrified line that runs from Manchester Piccadilly to Crewe via Levenshulme, Cheadle Hulme, Stockport and Wilmslow.

Tragic!. Argos lives in Berlin with his partner and their son. ==Music== Argos is the lead singer of the rock band Art Brut, and sometimes plays the bass guitar in Keith TOTP. Argos is also the lead singer of the project Everybody Was in the French Resistance...Now!, in which he and multi-instrumentalist Dyan Valdes of The Blood Arm write musical responses to pop songs. Their album \\"Fixin' the Charts, Volume 1\\" was recorded in Joshua Tree in summer 2008. In June 2011, Eddie appeared as guest vocalist on Akira The Don's \\"Living In The Future\\" single. In 2018 Argos collaborated with Berlin-based band Gurr on Christmas songs for a \\"Christmas Business\\" EP. In 2012, Argos wrote an article for DIY magazine as to why he should be the UK's 2013 entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. ==Paintings== As well as his musical output, Argos is also an enthusiastic painter. Argos explained his love of painting to Skyscraper Magazine: \\"I really enjoy painting. I love painting great big thick black lines of acrylic paint on canvas. I don't paint very complicated things, just simple images and words really. Nothing ever comes out the way I intend it to, probably because of my Dyspraxia, so I'm always surprised at how they turn out\\". ==Writing and comics== Argos writes an occasional column about comic books for PLAYBACK:stl called \\"Pow! To The People\\". He has also contributed a cover quote to the collected edition of Jamie McKelvie's 'Phonogram: The Singles Club' graphic novel. A lifelong comic book enthusiast,name=\\"musicblog.merseyblogs.co.uk\\"/ Eddie's passion for comic books has already crossed over into Art Brut's music and art work, with Art Brut vs Satan's \\"DC Comics & Chocolate Milkshake\\" referencing the legendary publishers of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Justice League and Green Lantern. The same album also had artwork designed by acclaimed graphic novelist Jeff Lemire. In 2010, Argos unveiled his comic book themed side project named \\"Spoiler Alert\\", whose three track EP featured songs inspired by DC Comics characters Batman, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle. Art Brut's 2011 album, Brilliant! Tragic! was created by acclaimed comic book artist Jamie McKelvie. \\"I can remember the first comic I ever read\\" Argos said, \\"it was the Beano, the day I had my tonsils out. I was given it as a treat as I couldn't eat anything. It might have been the only time I've turned down Ice Cream, it blew my tiny 6 year old mind. I loved comic books growing up but always had a fear they might be something I would have to give up as an adult. Then one day somebody, I still don't know who, put some Batman comics through our letter box. These blew my tiny 11-year-old mind. They were pretty full on, nothing at all like the Adam West goofing around show I had seen Saturday morning television. In these stories people were being murdered, they were political, and morally ambiguous. If my mum had known how different they were from the Saturday morning kids show she would have taken them off of me. I loved them though and realised then that they were something that would stay with me into adult life and have spent all my money on comics ever since\\". Argos has also gone on record stating \\"Batman is the greatest fictional character of all time. No argument\\". To accompany the album Brilliant! Tragic!, Art Brut commissioned a comic book to be released simultaneously. The Brilliant!

Resting spore is a term commonly applied to both diatoms and fungi. == In fungi == A resting spore can be a spore created by fungi which is thickly encysted (has a thick cell wall) in order to survive through stressful times, such as drought. It protects the spore from biotic (microbial, fungal viral), as well as abiotic (wind, heat, xeric conditions) factors. It is found in Anabaena. Resting spores of a particular fungus are known create the phenomenon known as late potato blight. They can lie dormant within the soil of a field for decades until the right conditions occur for viability (plant host present, rain, fire etc.). == In diatoms == A similar resting spore life stage is also present in diatoms, and in such case, is also often referred to as the hypnospore. Importantly, the resting spore of marine diatoms is not an obligate stage of the life cycle, except in the minority of studied taxa, where spore production immediately follows the first cellular product of sexual reproduction, the auxospore. Generally, resting spore formation in diatoms is primarily considered a survival tactic for adverse conditions by producing dense spores with thick silica frustules that can sink cells out of the surface, typically high in light and temperature, into the cooler, darker and nutrient rich depths. Spores have been observed to last decades in such conditions that reduce metabolic demand, awaiting mixing events that may carry them back into favorable environmental conditions where they may germinate. === Formation, morphology and germination === The formation of resting spores is considered to be the consequence of environmental stress. Spore formation has been described immediately proceeding bloom formation although there are a variety of potential causes for spore formation in blooms. Studies of resting spore formation in diatoms have found that nitrogen limitation, temperature, and light limitation are all capable drivers of spore formation. The differences in resting spore formation reflects the immense diversity in the phylogeny of diatoms. Notably, resting spores are not a feature of all diatoms. Although they can be found in freshwater varieties, and pennate diatoms, they are considered most prevalent in marine centric diatoms. Within marine centric diatoms, resting spore formation has been most commonly observed from a vegetative parent cell, but some species have been noted to require an auxospore parent cell, which is the product of sexual reproduction. The formation of resting spores is product of two acytokinetic divisions of the parent cell, wherein the cytoplasm of the daughter cells is shared. The resting spores produced may be either exogeneous (mature spore has no contact with parent cell), endogenous (completely enclosed within the parent cell), or semi-endogenous (only the hypovalve of the resting spore enclosed within the parent thecae). The common characteristic of diatom resting spores is a thick silica frustule. Generally, the frustule will be morphologically similar to the vegetative cell, but it can differ greatly. The frustule itself may be with or without a cell girdle, which dictate alternate germination processes, whereby the thecae of resting spores with girdles become the hypotheca and both valves are shed when the girdle is absent. === Ecological significance === Resting spore formation plays an important role in the survival of diatoms through periods of adverse environmental conditions. The formation of a spore with a thick frustule increases the density of the diatom, allowing a drop in the water column to the sediment or pycnocline where reduced light, and potentially cooler temperatures may increase the lifespan of the spore by reducing the metabolic imbalance between demand and resource availability. Dropping deeper into the water column may also put the resting spore in a place where nutrient availability is greater. The thick silica frustule can also serve during period as a resting spore to enhance the resistance to zooplanktonic grazers, which are known to be a frequently dominant source of mortality for many marine phytoplankton. Ultimately, the resting spore relies that it will be mixed back up to the surface at a time when conditions for growth are favorable and it can germinate. This suggests that generally, a shallow neritic habitat is needed to be able to mix back into the photic zone. If the spore is an obligate part of the life cycle, shallow depth requirement can limit range unless the pycnocline is sufficient to suspend the spore. Resting spores are believed to last potentially decades with germination remaining viable. Resting spores may allow diatoms to survive environmental variability from weekly and seasonal scale to decadal patterns like the NAO. This can allow diatoms to survive in areas where they cannot grow year-round or perhaps even every year. It has even been proposed that the resting spore stage of diatoms has aided survival through mass extinction events including the cretaceous extinction, which brought an estimated three quarters of all plant and animal life to extinction. This extinction was also characterized by its limitation to solar radiation, necessary for diatoms which are photosynthetic. However, as laboratory experiments have shown, light limitation could trigger resting spore formation, which might have allowed many spore forming diatoms to survive a mass extinction event such as the cretaceous. In conjunction with survival through adverse environmental conditions, the resting spore is considered important for seeding with cells that can await opportune conditions and start a population. This is believed to be important in regions like the North Atlantic where deep winter mixing is then stabilized and a shallower, nutrient rich mixed layer develops. In such regions, seeding by resting spores could provide competitive advantage through founder's effect. Simply, if a diatom has a competitive growth rate, and is among the first to pioneer a newly available resource, it may have a competitive advantage. For the purposes of seeding, a spore sinking to the benthos has also been hypothesized to reduce the likelihood of advective transport outside the habitable range, meaning by sinking to the sediment of an area that previously had favorably growth conditions, fewer cells will be transported outside the habitable range they will ever be able to grow in. While these are important advantages to spore formation, the mortality rate is presumably high, particularly in oceanic zones, where pycnoclines may suspend spores, but presumably many resting spores are lost beyond the reach of the mixing zone. While from the standpoint of diatoms this is disadvantageous, it has been evidenced that rapid sinking and sedimentation of resting spores, particularly in large events after blooms, may represent an important export of nutrients to the deep ocean. Resting spores may be particularly important, because of their rapid sinking rate, which might reduce the opportunity for being recycled back into the food web of the photic zone. ==See also== *Chlamydospore *Endospore ==References== *C.J.

As the author notes, the practice of including new material in the central section of a ternary-form (sonata) movement is not a Beethoven innovation- there are examples in and preceding Mozart's music. The work takes approximately 26 minutes to perform. The second movement was originally sketched out in G major before taking its current form. According to Anton Schindler (Beethoven's notoriously unreliable associate and biographer), Beethoven came to regret the third movement. Schindler wrote, \\"He definitely wished to delete the Scherzo allegro... because of its incompatibility with the character of the work as a whole.\\"Schindler, Anton; ed.

He was born in Tarnowskie G√≥ry. He started his international career in the Polish under-18 team with which he reached the finals of the 1981 World Cup. He then went to achieve 3rd place at the Under-20 World Cup with Poland. He moved to the first national team in December 1985 and was the number one pick for the next decade. He won 52 caps for the Poland national football team, the first coming on 9/12/1985 against Tunisia, and the last on 25/4/1995 against Israel.

Wandzik began his career at Rodlo Gorniki before moving to Ruch Chorz√≥w. After a couple of years playing there he transferred to rival club G√≥rnik Zabrze. With Gornik Zabrze he went on to win the Polish League in 1985-1988 and came third in 1989. His reliability earned him a transfer to Greek club Panathinaikos FC in the summer of 1990. With Panathinaikos he achieved much success reaching the semi-final of the Champions League in 1995, losing only to Ajax in the second game. He also went ahead and won the Greek League in 1991, 1995 and 1996, the Greek Cup in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995, the Greek League and the Greek Supercup in 1993 and 1995.

As head of the investigative commission, Qodirov established that militants of Al-Qaeda are behind the attacks and made this information public. One of Qodirov's briefings noted that terrorists, in particular from the Islamic Movement of Turkestan, were trained by Arab instructors in the militant training camps in Pakistan. After the suicide attack on Friday July 30, 2004, which targeted the Israeli and American embassies and the office of Uzbekistan's chief prosecutor, Qodirov worked with the experts from United States, Israel and (Germany). The group under his leadership established that terrorists used explosives that could only be made by those who were trained in the terrorist camps in Chechnya and Afghanistan.

Ikhtiyor Abdullayev, the state adviser to the president of the republic, was appointed in his place.

H. Qodirov under articles 165, 205, 210 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan\\". At the beginning of May 2018 media reported that the state of health of 66-year- old Qodirov during the interrogations deteriorated significantly, as he was under severe pressure, and medical assistance was insufficient. At the same time, sources in the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that there is still a long wait before Qodirov will be charged with anything, because it is a very large-scale case. Despite this, on May 21, 2018, the President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyayev, promised that he would force Rashid Qodirov to publicly declare himself guilty on national television. == Trial and torture == The trial of Kadirov and his co-defendants began behind closed doors on January 7, 2019 in Yunusabad District Criminal Court.

Kadirov and the remaining nine co-defendants held in pre- trial detention since February 2018 are at continued risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

He was a fundraiser for Illinois Democratic and Republican politicians. After becoming a major contributor to Rod Blagojevich's successful gubernatorial election, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years and as a result he was able to have business associates appointed onto several state boards. Rezko and several others were indicted on federal charges in October 2006 for using their connections on the state boards to demand kickbacks from businesses that wished to engage in dealings with the state. While the others pleaded guilty, Rezko pleaded not guilty and was tried. He was found guilty of 16 of the 24 charges filed against him and on November 23, 2011, he was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison. ==Early life and education== Tony Rezko was born in 1955 in Aleppo, Syria, to a prominent Syriac Catholic family. After graduating from college there, Rezko moved to Chicago and earned an undergraduate and a master's degree in civil engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1970s. He joined an engineering company, designing nuclear power plants, then left to design roads for the state Transportation Department, making $21,590 in his first year there. ==Career== While he was an engineer, Rezko started buying vacant lots and developing single family residences. He also began investing in fast-food restaurants, including the first Subway in Chicago. Many properties were in lower-income African American neighborhoods where he met Jabir Herbert (J.H.) Muhammad, former manager of heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali and son of the late Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad. Rezko was asked in 1983 to support the successful mayoral candidacy of African-American Harold Washington. J.H. Muhammad's company, Crucial Concessions, hired Rezko in 1984 and won a food contract on Lake Michigan beaches and in many South Side parks. Rezko put together endorsement deals for Ali, became the executive director of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, and traveled the world with Ali for five years. In 1997, Crucial Concessions opened two Panda Express Restaurants at O'Hare, under the city's minority set- aside program. It lost those franchises in 2005, on the grounds that J.H. Muhammad was merely a front man for Rezko, who had been appointed trustee of Elijah Muhammad's affairs in the early 1990s. In March 2008 Muhammad sued Rezko, alleging that he had been swindled out of his home and business interests. In January 1989, Rezko and attorney Daniel Mahru, CEO of a firm that leased ice makers to bars and hotels, founded a real-estate development and restaurant holding corporation called Rezmar Corporation. Between 1989 and 1998, Rezmar rehabilitated 30 buildings, a total of 1,025 apartments, spending more than $100 million from the city, state and federal governments and bank loans. Rezko and Mahru weren't responsible for any government or bank loans or the $50 million in federal tax credits they got to rehab the buildings. Rezmar put just $100 into each project and got a 1% stake as the general partner in charge of hiring the architect, contractor, and the company that would manage the buildings. They selected Chicago Property Management, also owned by Rezko and Mahru, to manage the buildings, including selecting the tenants and making repairs. Rezmar also got upfront development fees of at least $6.9 million in all. Under its deals with the Chicago Equity Fund, Rezmar promised to cover all operating losses in any building for seven years, but had no obligation after that, although the Federal Government could recover the tax credits that Rezmar sold from the holders if the projects did not survive for fifteen years or more. By 1998 the company had a net worth of US$34 million and it then turned to purchasing old factories and parcels of land in gentrifying areas of Chicago and turning them into upscale condominium complexes. Rezko was named \\"Entrepreneur of the Decade\\" by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association. Rezko's investment in restaurant food chains had started with a chain of Panda Express Chinese restaurants. In 1998, Rezko opened his first chain of Papa John's Pizza restaurants in Chicago and by 2002, he had twenty- six stores in Chicago, at least fifteen in Wisconsin, and seven in Detroit, part of the financing for these stores was through GE Capital. By 2001, Rezko began to fall behind on his franchise payments and loans and he transferred the franchises to several business associates. In 2006, during a lawsuit with Papa John's over his franchise fees, Rezko renamed his Papa John's restaurants to Papa Tony's. Rezko also had a lien filed against his home after losing a civil lawsuit to GE Capital. As his business ventures began failing, Rezko entered into several partnership with Iraqi-born business executive Nadhmi Auchi, including a massive 2005 real estate development project on Chicago's South Loop whose value was pegged by an observer familiar with the deal at $130.5 million.Rezko sells Loop project for $131M In 2008, Rezko was imprisoned for his failure to disclose a $3.5m loan from Auchi. ==Legal troubles== Rezko was later convicted on 16 charges of corruption and fraud and was sentenced to serve 10 1/2 years in prison. ===Public corruption charges=== In October 2006, Rezko was indicted along with businessman Stuart Levine on charges of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, and attempted extortion as a result of a federal investigation known as \\"Operation Board Games.\\" Levine was once a top Republican fund-raiser who had switched loyalty in recent years. Rezko and Levine were charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from businesses seeking to do business with the Illinois Teachers System Board and the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board from 2002 to 2004. Levine pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Rezko and others. While the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, Levine expects to receive about a 5-1/2 year sentence in return for his testimony. The case was prosecuted by Patrick Fitzgerald. Rezko pleaded not guilty, and the trial related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on March 6, 2008. He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court that he had no access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5 million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk. On May 6, both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko's lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges. Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's \\"corrupt use of his power and influence\\" to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.Corrupt mastermind or victim of frame-up? Chicago Tribune, May 13, 2008 The case went to the jury on May 13 and after three weeks of deliberation, the jury found Rezko guilty of six counts of wire fraud, six counts of mail fraud, two counts of corrupt solicitation, and two counts of money laundering, but found him not guilty on three counts of wire and mail fraud, one count of attempted extortion, and four counts of corrupt solicitation. According to CBS News the \\"high-profile federal trial provided an unusually detailed glimpse of the pay-to-play politics that has made Illinois infamous.\\" While the jury was deliberating on the Board Games trial, an arrest warrant was issued in Las Vegas for passing bad checks in two casinos and failing to pay $450,000 in gambling debts that were accrued between March and July 2006. Another casino had also filed a civil complaint for a total of $331,000 in 2006 and was given a judgment of default in 2007. ===Charges related to private business dealings=== Rezko was indicted, along with a business associate, for wire fraud related to the alleged sale of his pizza business to a straw buyer at an inflated price in order to obtain millions of dollars in loans from GE Capital. Rezko initially pleaded not guilty to these charges. In 2011, Rezko would change his plea to guilty. As part of a plea deal and his agreement to drop his appeal of his previous conviction, Rezko pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was given a 7 1/2 year sentence to run concurrently with the 10 1/2-year sentence he is presently serving for his previous conviction. ===Release from federal prison=== In July 2015 Tony Rezko was released from federal prison to a halfway house in Chicago. ==Ties to politiciansTies to Rod Blagojevich=== Rezko's relationship with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and his family were at the root of the federal corruption case which led to Rezko's conviction. Rezko donated $117,652 to Blagojevich's campaigns, and is credited by the prosecutor in his trial with having delivered bundled contributions totalling almost $1.44 million. Since 1997, Blagojevich's wife, Patricia, has made at least $38,000 acting as Rezko's real-estate agent on several of his company's property acquisitions. When Blagojevich won the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2002, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years. Rezko recommended many of his business associates and their relatives for positions within state government, three of whom were appointed to the state board that oversees hospital projects. the state's development board was run by another former Rezko business associate. Rezko and Republican fundraiser Stuart Levine were charged in a 24-count federal indictment for allegedly using Rezko's influence with public officials to demand millions of dollars in kickbacks from companies that wanted to do business with the state. Levine pleaded guilty and served as the chief witness against Rezko at trial. Levine and several other witnesses implicated Blagojevich in the schemes. The last indictment in Operation Board Games before Blagojevich himself was indicted was that of William F. Cellini who was indicted for conspiring with Rezko to shake down Chicago-based Capri Capital to get a substantial contribution to Blagojevich in exchange for allowing Capri to manage $220 million in the Teachers Retirement System. After Thomas Rosenberg of Capri threatened to tell authorities, the plan was abandoned.William F. Cellini, Sr., Indicted - fbi.gov - October 30, 2008 Capri has substantial investments in the Watergate complex and King Abdullah Economic City. ===Ties to Barack Obama=== History In 1990, after Barack Obama was elected president of the Harvard Law Review, He interviewed with Rezmar Corp. Rezko did not decide to hire him however exclaimed he'd have a great shot at politics. Obama instead took a job with the firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland,now Miner, Barnhill & Galland. which primarily worked on civil rights cases. The firm also represented Rezmar and helped the company get more than $43 million in government funding. The firm's former senior partner, Allison S. Davis, later went into business with Rezko and, in 2003, was appointed to the Illinois State Board of Investment by Governor Blagojevich at Rezko's request. On July 31, 1995, the first ever political contributions to Obama were $300 from a lawyer, a $5,000 loan from a car dealer, and $2,000 from two food companies owned by Rezko. Starting in 2003, Rezko was one of the people on Obama's U.S. Senate campaign finance committee, which raised more than $14 million. Rezko organized an early fundraiser for Obama that Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendell claims was instrumental in providing Obama with seed money for his U.S. Senate race. Obama in 2007-2008 identified over $250,000 in campaign contributions to various Obama campaigns as coming from Rezko or close associates, and said that he donated almost two-thirds of that amount to nonprofit groups. Real estate dealings In 2005 Obama purchased a new home in the Kenwood District of Chicago for $1.65 million (which was $300,000 below the asking price but represented the highest offer on the property) on the same day that Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, purchased the adjoining empty lot from the same sellers for the full asking price. Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention,\\"Asked who approached her about the house, Schwan [the seller's broker] told Salon, 'I honestly don't remember. Tony Rezko lived across the street, so he'd been interested in the lot.'\\" but denied any coordination of offers. According to Obama, while the properties had originally been a single property, the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots, but made it a condition of the sales that they be closed on the same date. Obama also stated that the properties had been on the market for months, that his offer was the better of two bids, and that Ms. Rezko's bid was matched by another offer, also of $625,000, so that she could not have purchased the property for less. After it had been reported in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence- peddling, Obama purchased a 10-foot-wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value. According to Chicago Sun-Times columnist, Mark Brown, \\"Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development.\\" Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety and stated \\"I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it.\\" On December 28, 2006, Mrs. Rezko sold the property to a company owned by her husband's former business attorney. That sale of $575,000, combined with the earlier $104,500 sale to the Obamas, amounted to a net profit of $54,500 over her original purchase, less $14,000 for a fence along the property line and other expenses.The $54,500 figure is before any property tax and other expenses Ms. Rezko incurred during her ownership In October 2007, the new owners put the still vacant land up for sale again, this time for $1.5 million. Obama's letters In June 2007, the Sun-Times published a story about letters Obama had written in 1997 to city and state officials in support of a low-income senior citizen development project headed by Rezko and Davis. The project received more than $14 million in taxpayer funds, including $885,000 in development fees for Rezko and Davis. Of Obama's letters in support of the Cottage View Terrace apartments development, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said, \\"This wasn't done as a favor for anyone; it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project. I don't know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago. There was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and Obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district.\\" Rezko's attorney responded that \\"Mr. Rezko never spoke with, nor sought a letter from, Senator Obama in connection with that project. In the South Carolina Democratic Party presidential debate on January 21, 2008, Senator Hillary Clinton said that Obama had been associated with Rezko, whom she referred to as a slum landlord. The Los Angeles Times indicated that its own review showed Rezko played a deeper role in Obama's political and financial biography than Obama has acknowledged. Within days of the debate, a photo of Rezko posing with Bill and Hillary Clinton surfaced. When asked about the photo, Hillary Clinton commented: \\"I probably have taken hundreds of thousands of pictures. I wouldn't know him if he walked in the door.\\" ===Ties to other politicians=== Rezko's first significant political act was hosting a fundraiser for Harold Washington during Washington's successful campaign to become Chicago's mayor. He has since raised funds for many other politicians. In addition to Blagojevich and Obama, prominent Democrats that Rezko or his company, Rezmar, have contributed money to, or fund-raised for, are Congressman Luis Gutierrez, a friend for over two decades, Comptroller Dan Hynes, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn, former Chicago Mayors Daley and Washington, and former Cook County Board President John Stroger. Rezko has also raised money for Republicans, including former Illinois Governors Jim Edgar and George Ryan. The late Rosemont, Illinois, Mayor Donald Stephens and Rezko co-chaired a multimillion-dollar fund-raiser for President George W. Bush in 2003. Rezko headed the 2002 campaign finance committee for Stroger. Stroger appointed Rezko's wife, Rita, to the Cook County Employee Appeals Board, which hears cases brought by fired or disciplined workers. The part-time post pays $37,000 a year. A Rezko company had a contract to maintain pay telephones at the Cook County Jail under Stroger. The Chicago Sun-Times puts Rezko's contributions to Stroger at $148,300. ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Tony Rezko Case complete coverage from the Chicago Tribune * Tony Rezko complete coverage from the Chicago Sun-Times * Eric Zorn, RezkoWebliography The Chicago Tribune, February 7, 2008 * Antoin Rezko Indictment, United States Department of Justice, Oct 11 2006 Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American Eastern Catholics Category:American food industry business executives Category:American lobbyists Category:American people of Syrian-Assyrian descent Category:American people convicted of fraud Category:American political fundraisers Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American restaurateurs Category:American white-collar criminals Category:Businesspeople from Chicago Category:Illinois Institute of Technology alumni Category:American people convicted of bribery Category:People from Aleppo Category:Syrian businesspeople Category:Syrian Eastern Catholics Category:Syrian emigrants to the United States Category:Syriac Catholics Category:American businesspeople convicted of crimes ","title":"Tony Rezko"},{"id":"7461673","text":"Joseph Buffington (September 5, 1855 ‚Äì October 21, 1947) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and of the United States Circuit Courts for the Third Circuit and previously was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. ==Education and career== Born on September 5, 1855, in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Buffington received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1875 from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and read law in 1878. He entered private practice in Kittanning from 1878 to 1892. ==Federal judicial service== Buffington was nominated by President Benjamin Harrison on February 10, 1892, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania vacated by Judge James Hay Reed. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 23, 1892, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on September 26, 1906, due to his elevation to the Third Circuit. Buffington received a recess appointment from President Theodore Roosevelt on September 25, 1906, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Third Circuit vacated by Judge Marcus Wilson Acheson. He was nominated to the same position by President Roosevelt on December 3, 1906. He was confirmed by the Senate on December 11, 1906, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals. He was a member of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (now the Judicial Conference of the United States) from 1922 to 1937. He was the last appeals court judge who continued to serve in active service appointed by President Roosevelt. He assumed senior status on June 1, 1938. His service terminated on October 21, 1947, due to his death in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ===Scandal=== During the 1930s, Buffington became involved in a scandal involving his colleague on the Court of Appeals, Judge John Warren Davis. Buffington was found to have been signing opinions drafted by Davis, in cases in which Davis received bribes. Davis was forced out of office, but no formal action was taken against Buffington, who was described as being \\"aged, senile, and nearly blind\\" by that time. He took what is now called senior status, a form of semi- retirement, on June 1, 1938, and ceased hearing cases.

They were overseen by the Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal. ==The Children of the Chapel Royal== Arthur Sullivan aged 13 when he was a chorister of the Chapel Royal, wearing the State Dress Sometime in the 12th century or earlier, a distinct establishment known as the Chapels RoyalThe Chapels Royal was created within the English Royal Court and its musical establishment now claims to be the oldest continuous musical organization in the world. Children sang in church because their high voices were considered closest to the angels. The Choir's, now just ten, boys are traditionally known as the Children of the Chapel Royal, and wear the distinctive State uniform introduced at the Restoration. Their special school within St James's Palace no longer operates, having closed in 1923; the boys all attend the City of London School and receive a choral scholarship from The Queen. In former times when educated within the court they were very much a part of court life and by ancient tradition were entitled to many small special privileges. The Choir's duties remain to sing the regular services in the chapel of the Monarch's home and to otherwise attend as commanded. It is based in the two chapels of St James's Palace and services are also sung in the chapels of Kensington and Buckingham Palaces. The Choir also takes part in many State and National ceremonies and at private events within the Royal Household. It consists of six Gentlemen in Ordinary and ten choristers and a Sub-Organist.The choir of the Chapels Royal ===The troupes of child actors=== The Children of the Chapel (if from the establishment of the Chapels Royal also known as the Children of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, the Children of the Chapel Royal, the Children of the Queen's Revels, the Children of the Revels) and the Children of the Blackfriars Theatre or Children of the Blackfriars, and finally the Children of the Whitefriars Theatre or Children of the Whitefriars were troupes of child actors in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. By the accession of James I in 1603, the Chapels Royal was staffed by a dean, a sub-dean, and 32 gentlemen (both priests and laymen); it also had a choir of 12 boys. William Cornysh, who was Master of the Children from 1509 to 1523, first began the practice of having the boys' choir perform dramatic interludes at Court. William Hunnis was Master of the Children of the Chapel from 1566 to 1597; under his stewardship the boys played repeatedly at Court until 1584. In 1576 (the same year James Burbage built The Theatre and began the era of popular Elizabethan drama), Hunnis's deputy Richard Farrant rented space in the old Blackfriars priory, and began public performances by the boys. For unknown reasons, the troupe did not act at Court after 1584 (though they did give some performances outside London). When the Children of Paul's were suppressed in 1590, due to their playwright John Lyly's role in the Marprelate controversy, the fashion for troupes of child actors went into abeyance for the next decade ‚Äì inevitably affecting the Children of the Chapel. (When Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage was published in 1594, it was described as \\"Played by the Children of Her Majesty's Chapel.\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 426. The uncertainty of that play's date clouds the question of when those performances occurred.) In 1600 the Children of the Chapel returned to the public stage with regular performances. Nathaniel Giles, their Master from 1597 to 1634, became one of the lessees (with Henry Evans) of the Blackfriars Theatre that James Burbage built in 1596, and brought the Children to play there. The boys performed at Court on 6 January and 22 February 1601. They had a big hit that year with Ben Jonson's The Poetaster. Nathan Field, John Underwood, and William Ostler, all of whom would later join the King's Men, were in the cast. Even in the early years of this period, the Children of the Chapel were mired in controversy: Giles drafted, and sometimes nearly kidnapped, boys that he wanted in his troupe. (Incredibly enough, he had a legal right to use such techniques ‚Äì but only for the boys' choir, not for acting.) Solomon Pavy, the young actor eulogized by Ben Jonson upon his premature death in 1603, was one boy \\"pressed\\" into service in this high-handed way. So, reportedly, was Nathan Field. In one notorious instance, a man named Henry Clifton brought a complaint before the Star Chamber in December 1601, maintaining that Giles had in fact kidnapped Clifton's young son Thomas while the boy was walking home from grammar school. (Giles was censured; Clifton got his son back.) The Children of the Chapel performed plays by Jonson, George Chapman, John Marston, Thomas Middleton, and others during the next several years; they specialized in the satirical comedy that appealed to Court wits and a \\"Gentle\\" audience, in contrast to the more popularly oriented drama of William Shakespeare, Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, and similar writers. The company experienced popularity and success in the first years of the century; when the House of Stuart inherited the monarchy, the Children of the Chapel, like other troupes of actors, received royal favor ‚Äì they became the Children of the Queen's Revels (1603-5). Yet they also experienced the downside of this brand of drama: when the play Eastward Hoe (1605) won official censure and landed two of its authors, Jonson and Chapman, in jail, the actors earned a share of the disapproval. They lost their Royal patent, and became simply the Children of the Revels (1605-6). After another scandal, this one involving The Isle of Gulls by John Day (1606), they were known as the Children of the Blackfriars. They managed to offend the King a third time, in 1608, in regard to their production of George Chapman's two-part play The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron. The double play offended the French Ambassador, who got it banned from the stage. (The Ambassador was particularly bothered by a scene in which the French Queen slaps the face of the King's mistress ‚Äì a scene that was omitted from the printed texts of the plays.) When the Court was not in London, however, the Children of the Blackfriars performed the plays again, in their original offensive form. The angry James swore that the boys \\"should never play more but should first beg their bread.\\"Ioppolo, p. 129. Yet the King liked plays too much to maintain this resolve over the long term, and the Children were eventually able to continue. They even performed at Court the following Christmas season. Also in 1608, the King's Men took over the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre, effectively evicting the previous tenants. The children's company moved to the new Whitefriars Theatre, and became, perforce, the Children of the Whitefriars (1609). In 1610, however, they regained royal favour, due to the influence of Philip Rosseter, lutenist to the Royal household and their new manager; they were the Children of the Queen's Revels once again. The company performed Jonson's Epicene in 1609; in 1611 they acted Nathan Field's A Woman is a Weathercock, both at Whitefriars and at Court. Field was in the cast of both productions. They played at Court four times in 1612-13, performing plays by Beaumont and Fletcher. For a time around 1613, the boys' troupe was linked with the Lady Elizabeth's Men. After losing their Whitefriars lease at the end of 1614, they moved to Rosseter's short-lived Porter's Hall Theatre (1615). The last play they are known to have acted was Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady. The company apparently collapsed around 1616. A warrant, granted in 1626 to Nathaniel Giles to take up singing boys for the service of the Chapel Royal, contained a proviso that the children so to be taken should not be employed as comedians or stage- players, or act in stage plays, interludes, comedies, or tragedies, \\"for that it is not fitt or decent that such as sing the praises of God Almighty should be trained or imployed on such lascivious and prophane exercises.\\" ==NotesReferences== *Chambers, E.

The album reached No. 11 in Australia, but despite heavy promotion, was the last to be released through Chrysalis. Amphlett explained: \\"We still owed them more than a million dollars - unpaid reimbursement of their advances for recording, distributing and promoting three albums, and supporting all those tours, yet they let us off the hook. Chrysalis knew, as did we, that we'd never be able to repay such a sum. They figured that because Temperamental hadn't broken us in the States, we were never going to make it there and they'd be smarter to write off our debt as a tax deduction. 'It's time to split', they said. 'We can't do anything more with Divinyls'.\\" Amphlett believes the album contains some of the band's best songs, written \\"throughout the emotional maelstrom of the exits of (manager) Vince (Lovegrove), Bjarne, Rick and JJ\\", including \\"Back to the Wall\\", \\"Punxsie\\" and \\"Better Days\\", as well as \\"Hey Little Boy\\". ==Background and recording== Rehearsals began in Los Angeles in October 1986, with the band by then reduced to just singer Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Guitarist Bjarne Ohlin had already left and drummer JJ Harris was sacked at the insistence of producer Mike Chapman, who regarded him as inadequate for the task. The band's label, Chrysalis Records, told Amphlett and McEntee it regarded the album as a make-or-break record, following the lacklustre sales performance of its predecessor, What a Life!. The pair returned to Australia in December 1986 for a series of Australian Made gigs in the capital cities, with Divinyls joining a lineup that included Mental As Anything, I'm Talking, The Triffids, The Saints, Models, Jimmy Barnes and INXS. Amphlett and McEntee were supported on stage by Rick Grossman (bass), Kenny Lyon (keyboards) and Americans Tommy Cain (drums) and Frank Infante (guitar). Grossman quit at the close of the Australian Made tour and checked into a rehabilitation clinic for treatment for heroin addiction and Amphlett and McEntee returned to Los Angeles in 1987 to begin recording. The new lineup for the album included Lyon, Machinations drummer Warren McLean and Tootieville bassist Tim Millikan. Recording began at Rumbo Studios, but ceased after complaints about noise by Neil Diamond, who was recording in the next studio. The band transferred to Sunset Sound Recorders with Chapman to complete the album. ==Track listing== # \\"Temperamental\\" (Christina Amphlett, Mark McEntee) ‚àí 4:30 # \\"Back to the Wall\\" (Amphlett, McEntee, Richard Feldman) ‚àí 4:38 # \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (Don Baskin, Bob Gonzales) ‚àí 3:21 # \\"Punxsie\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:16 # \\"Dance of Love\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:04 # \\"Better Days\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:00 # \\"Dirty Love\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:35 # \\"Because\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:06 # \\"Fighting\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 3:45 # \\"Run-a-Way Train\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) ‚àí 4:30 # \\"Out of Time\\" (Amphlett, McEntee) [CD-only bonus track; not on LP] ‚àí 5:46 ==Personnel== * Christina Amphlett ‚àí vocals * Mark McEntee ‚àí guitars, vocals * Tom Lang - guitar, piano, hammond organ, background vocals * Warren McLean ‚àí drums * Tim Millikan ‚àí bass * Mike Chapman ‚àí producer * Bob Clearmountain - mixing (all tracks except \\"Fighting\\", \\"Run-a-Way Train\\", \\"Out of Time\\") photo and design: Hubert Kretzschmar ==Charts== {  !align=\\"left\\"Chart (1988) !align=\\"left\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"Australian Album Chart align=\\"center\\"11 } ==References== Category:1988 albums Category:Divinyls albums Category:Albums produced by Mike Chapman Category:Chrysalis Records albums ","title":"Temperamental (Divinyls album)"},{"id":"7461743","text":"Appellate Division may refer to: * Bangladesh Supreme Court, Appellate Division * New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division * New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division ==See also== *Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island#Appeal_Division *Court of Appeal (disambiguation) *Court of Appeals (disambiguation) *State court (United States)#Nomenclature ","title":"Appellate Division"},{"id":"7461747","text":"Union Township is one of the fourteen townships of Pike County, Ohio, United States.

Described as a \\"Sega simulation\\", the player takes control of Sega Tar≈ç, who must help save a struggling Sega from losing the console market to its rival DOGMA, who owns 97%. Gameplay involves battling employees and other characters throughout various Sega development studios, some being taken from older Sega game franchises. It features many tongue-in-cheek references to Sega and the video game industry, particularly Sony and its PlayStation 2 console. Development was directed by Tez Okano, who developed the game in secret for two years before presenting it to Sega. The company misconstrued the game as a joke at first and dismissed it, however a second presentation impressed them and allowed development to continue. Okano marketed the game himself with a small budget of $200, half of which he spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. Several characters, such as Segata Sanshiro and a Ferrari from Out Run, had to be cut for licensing issues. Toei Animation produced the game's animated cutscenes. The game was initially exclusive to the Sega Direct online service, its popularity eventually warranting a physical release. It was produced on a small budget. Segagaga received a favorable reception from critics, being commended for its humor, gameplay and bizarre nature, alongside its usage of various Sega franchises and for poking fun at the industry itself. One critic labeled the game as the \\"swan song\\" of the Dreamcast. It is one of the last games released for the system, published two days before the Dreamcast's discontinuation on March 31. ==Gameplay== In-game screenshot, showing the player fighting Amigo from alt=A boy standing face to face with Amigo, a monkey with maracas Segagaga is a role-playing simulation video game, described as a \\"Sega simulation\\". Controlling the young Sega Tar≈ç, the player is tasked with saving a struggling Sega from losing the console market to their rival DOGMA. The player must progress through various Sega development studios and fight various employees, who due to the stress and pressure brought on by tight work constraints have turned into mutants. Unlike other role-playing games, Tar≈ç \\"attacks\\" by shouting verbal abuses and insults, such as telling them their game is terrible or they will never get a girlfriend. Enemies have a \\"will meter\\" that weakens as the player deals more insults towards them, and will win the fight once it fully drains. Failing to defeat an enemy will result in a month of development time being lost, which will become critical as the game progresses. Once an enemy is defeated, they may become willing to ally with the player and aid them in their adventure. Should the defeated enemy accept, the player will need to quickly answer questions within a ten-second timer, such as how much the employee will make and what work conditions there are. If the player succeeds, they can place the new employee into one of four development group positions, including director, designer, planner, and programmer ‚Äî development teams will increase the player's stamina and \\"creativity\\", detrimental to later sections of the game. Based on player decisions, teams can either make a small number of high- quality games or quickly produce shovelware games to hopefully generate profit. The game will end after three years of development time are completed; the ending is based on the player's performance. A notable feature of Segagaga is its many cameos and callbacks to other Sega game franchises, alongside tongue-in-cheek parodies of the game industry itself. Tar≈ç will come across numerous Sega characters throughout the game, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Ristar, Alex Kidd, Sir Pepper III from Clockwork Knight, Nei from Phantasy Star 2, Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone, the Bad Brothers from Golden Axe, Panda from Baku Baku Animal, Amigo from Samba de Amigo, and the F-14 Tomcat from After Burner. Towards the end of the game, Tar≈ç pilots a starship known as the \\"R-720\\", a nod to the R-360 arcade cabinet, into outer space that features a shoot'em up level reminiscent of Thunder Force. Tar≈ç will fight various mechs designed after older Sega game consoles, such as the Sega Genesis and Master System. The story takes place in the year 2025, depicting Sega with having only a 3% share of the console market, the other 97% being owned by their rival DOGMA ‚Äî a spoof of Sega's rival Sony, featuring parodies of the PlayStation 2 and other Sony characters. To help save the company from total collapse, Sega establishes \\"Project Segagaga\\", lead by company newcomers Sega Tar≈ç and Yayoi Haneda in order to assist Sega in claiming 100% of the market and achieving world domination. ==Development== Segagaga was developed in secret within the company for two years (former corporate office in alt=A three-section building with glass windows Segagaga was directed and designed by Tez Okano, who worked on the game in secret for two years before presenting it to the company, fearing that \\"anything could have happened\\" if the project was revealed. When it was initially shown off, Sega's management misconstrued the game as a sort of joke, and dismissed the game. When Okano presented the game again, Sega Hitmaker president Hisao Oguchi became impressed and allowed development of the game to continue. The game was produced on a small budget. Toei Animation produced the opening and cutscenes; because of the budget, Okano was given a small discount. Development was handled by Sega Hitmaker, a production studio best known for titles such as Virtua Tennis and Crazy Taxi. The game was originally titled Sega Sega, later being changed to Segagaga to make the word \\"Sega\\" sound less intrusive. Early versions of the game had nearly 300 production issues, some of which caused characters to be removed from the game entirely, such as the Japanese Sega Saturn mascot Segata Sanshiro and the Ferrari from Out Run. Okano utilized a large number of Sega franchises due to their popularity and for them being freely available to use. Once the finished product was presented, Sega felt that it didn't cast a negative impression on the company and authorized its release. ==Release== Okano was given a meager $200 budget to market the game; roughly half of it was spent on a wrestling mask to promote the game. He set up signing events at locations across Akihabara, rewarding those who visited all four of them. Assisting him was Sega public relations head Tadashi Takezaki and Sega AM3 employee Taku Sasahara to help promote it, managing to garner a full-page newspaper story on the game. Segagaga was released in Japan on March 29, 2001, as an exclusive for the Sega Direct online service. A promotional Dreamcast VMU memory card, designed after the exterior of the Mega Drive, was released the same day. On May 1, the Japan Adult Children's Association ordered Sega to remove the game from the service due to one of the game's characters being called \\"Adult Children\\", a Japanese term that can be used to refer to a child that grew up from an alcoholic parent; Sega issued a public apology and reissued an altered version of the game that replaced the name of the character. The popularity of the game lead to the release of a physical version, and later a budget version. A special collector's box was also made that contained the game, a Segagaga shirt, notebook, and enamel pins with the Segagaga, Sega Mark III, Mega Drive, Game Gear, Saturn, and Dreamcast logos. The Thunder Force-inspired shoot'em up level in Segagaga was later released for Japanese mobile phones as a standalone game on June 2, 2005 for the Sega Ages mobile service, titled Segagaga R-720. It featured additional enemies and bosses not found in the Dreamcast game, such as having a giant Sega Saturn as a boss. The soundtrack for Segagaga has been released several times; the first of these was split into two different volumes, titled Segagaga Soundtrack Blue Edition and Segagaga Soundtrack Red Edition, were both jointly released in Japan in December 2001. The second, Segagaga 5 Original Soundtrack, was released on July 20, 2006 in Japan to commemorate the five-year anniversary of the game's release \\\\- this album was later split into two volumes and released digitally for both iTunes and Amazon Music in 2015. ==Reception== Likely due to its late release in the Dreamcast's lifespan, Segagaga was not a commercial success. In its first week of release, the game sold an estimated 18,000 copies. In total, it has sold little over 34,000 copies. Official Dreamcast Magazine US applauded the game's sense of humor and bizarre premise, saying that its design and amount of content \\"will surprise many\\". They also expressed disappointment towards the lack of an overseas release. Japanese publication Famitsu praised its usage of older Sega game characters and unique setting, alongside its role-playing elements and humor towards the game industry as a whole, notably with DOGMA being a spoof of Sony, Sega's then- biggest rival. In a more negative light, Dreamcast Magazine Japan commended the game for its \\"ambitious\\" premise, but felt that its humor would only really be appreciated by hardcore Sega fans and would fall short to those that weren't. They unfavorably compared its gameplay to Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?, recommending that RPG enthusiests instead buy that game instead of Segagaga. In a 2009 retrospective review, Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 commended Segagaga for its gameplay and humor, namely for poking fun at the Japanese video game industry at the time and for presenting a somber look towards the company as they were approaching a near-collapse. He also liked the game's large usage of Sega fanservice and its bizarre, outlandish battle system, as well as for being a generally import-friendly game despite its large usage of Japanese. Kalata concluded his review writing: \\"Anyone willing to brave the Japanese language will find one of the most original, self- referential titles ever made, a stroke of genius that's a virtual dream come true for Sega fans.\\" Retro Gamer magazine stated in 2020 that the game \\"remains a work of crazy reflexive genius, and demands to be played by anyone with even a passing interest in games industry history\\", highly-praising its strange battle system and tongue'n cheek references to the then-collapsing company. Eurogamers Martin Robinson listed it as one of Sega's stranger video game products for its self-awareness and humor, writing: \\"The final days of Sega's final console had a fatalistic air to them, and Segaga punctured all that with brilliant self-awareness.\\" Writing for GamesRadar+, Chris Antista described it as an \\"amazingly bizarre swan song\\" for the Dreamcast, and expressed interest that Sega re-release the game for digital distribution services such as Xbox Live. ==NotesReferencesExternal links== * Category:2001 video games Category:Crossover video games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Dreamcast-only games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Parody video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sega- AM3 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games about video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Satirical video games ","title":"Segagaga"},{"id":"7461755","text":"Mount Wells is a locality and land feature located in bushland near Boddington, south-east of Perth. It is located on the Bibbulmun Track and is also known as Wourahming Hill. ==History== Mount Wells's history, as the highest point in the area, was as a fire lookout for the surrounding timber milling region. The original fire tower and huts were ironically destroyed by fire in 1961, but rebuilt in 1962. It was renovated by the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and a Karnet Prison crew in 1997 for overnight use by walkers on the 'new' Bibbulmun Track, Western Australia's award-winning walk trail, stretching nearly 1,000 kilometres from the Perth Hills to Albany. ==Present day== A sleeping shelter for 8-10 people has been constructed from an old firetower-keeper's hut, complete with old wood stove, for overnight use by walkers on the Bibbulmun Track. The nearby tower is still occasionally used as a fire lookout and offers views of the Darling Scarp as well as nearby gold mining operations. A 14 km return walk to Boonering Hill, a giant granite mount rising above the jarrah forest north of Mount Wells, is popular among bushwalkers, with verticordia flowers covering its fringes in spring. ==Boddington Gold Mine== The nearby Boddington Gold Mine, south-east of the locality and presently owned by Newmont Mining (67%) and AngloGold (33%), commenced operations in 1987. It ceased mining operations on 30 November 2001 after all known economic gold oxide resources had been processed, and is currently in a \\"care and maintenance\\" phase.

Originally a solicitor, he requalified as a barrister and also pursued a parallel career as a legal academic. He later became a High Court judge and served as Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division from 1976 to 1981. Afterwards he served as Vice-Chancellor of the Supreme Court from 1982 to 1985. A prolific legal writer, he is known for such works as The Law of Real Property, Lectures on the Town and Country Act 1947, and A Manual of the Law of Real Property. ==Early and private life== Megarry's father was a solicitor in Belfast; his mother's father was a Major General. Megarry was born in Croydon, Surrey and was educated at Lancing and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He did not concentrate on his academic studies at university, writing for student newspaper Varsity as its first music critic, played football and tennis for his college, and obtained a pilot's licence; he ended up with a third class degree. He married his wife, Iris, in 1936, and they had three daughters. His wife died in 2001, but he was survived by his daughters. Having trained as a solicitor, he practised as one from 1935 to 1941. He also taught law students, and lectured at Cambridge from 1939 to 1940. He worked at the Ministry of Supply during World War II, rising to Assistant Secretary by 1946. With encouragement from Arthur Lehman Goodhart, Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University, he retrained as a barrister, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1944, and left the Civil Service to practise as a barrister in 1946, specialising in equity and land law. In parallel to his legal career, he also taught law at Cambridge University, becoming a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1945, and rising to become a university Reader by 1967. He was elected as a member of the Bar Council in 1948. He became a QC in 1956, was a bencher at Lincoln's Inn in 1962, and was Treasurer in 1981. Megarry was also highly regarded as a legal scholar, publishing numerous articles in the Law Quarterly Review, of which he was an assistant editor. He was president of the Society of Public Teachers of Law between 1965 and 1966. In 1970, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. He was prosecuted at the Old Bailey for submitting false income tax returns in 1954. The prosecuting counsel was Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, the Solicitor General and later Speaker of the House of Commons; counsel for the defence was Frederick Lawton, later a senior judge. Megarry's tax affairs were complex, with his earnings as a lecturer dealt with by his wife and his self- employed income from his legal practice dealt with by his clerk. Each assumed that the other was dealing with certain items of income, but in fact neither did, so it was omitted from Megarry's tax returns. The judge directed the jury to acquit Megarry, on the grounds that the error was a genuine mistake with no intention to defraud the tax authorities. ==Judicial career== Megarry was appointed as a High Court judge in 1967, assigned to the Chancery Division, and receiving the customary knighthood. He became Vice-Chancellor of that Division in 1976, effectively its head, as the deputy of the absent Lord Chancellor. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1978, and held the new post of Vice-Chancellor of the Supreme Court from 1982 to 1985. He had a traditional view of the law, and was unwilling to set new legal precedent. In Gaiman v National Association for Mental Health,[1970] 2 All ER 362 he ruled that the National Association for Mental Health was able to expel 302 suspect members, to prevent a suspected take-over by the Church of Scientology. In Midland Cold Storage v Steer[1972] 3 All ER 941 he denounced picketing by dock workers as \\"the law of the jungle\\", but held that he had no jurisdiction to ban it, deferring to the National Industrial Relations Court. He was the first Chancery judge to sit outside London, when he attended a mock funeral in Iken in Suffolk to test how easy it would be to carry a coffin along an alleged right of way in St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocesan Board of Finance v Clark.[1973] 3 All ER 902 He sat in the case of Tito v Waddell (No 2),[1977] 3 All ER 129 brought by the former residents of Banaba Island, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, whose island was all but destroyed by phosphate mining. He took the court on a 3-week trip to the south Pacific, to visit the island. After sitting for 206 days, Megarry delivered a judgment containing 100,000 words. He asked the Crown to do its duty to the islanders, but found that he was unable to require it to do anything. He was appointed as Vice-Chancellor in 1976. In 1977, he declined to grant The Beatles an injunction to prohibit the sale of an unauthorised record based on informal and unrehearsed tapes. In 1979, he upheld a worldwide playing ban imposed on George Best by FIFA arising from a complaint by Best's former employer, Fulham Football Club. Also in 1979, he was unable to uphold a complaint in Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner,[1979] 2 All ER 620 regarding phone tapping during a police investigation. However, in 1984 the European Court of Human Rights decided that it was a contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. Megarry ordered Granada Television to disclose the name of a confidential source in 1980, following leaks of information from British Steel Corporation. He ruled in two cases involving the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984. In the first case, Cowan v Scargill[1985] Ch 270 he declined a request from the National Coal Board for a mandatory order to direct union representative how to act as trustees of a pension fund, but gave directions on the representatives' fiduciary duties instead, saying that in his opinion the trustees were obliged to consider investment outside the UK and in industries that compete with coal. He would have said breach of the former would have risked the miners leaders being in contempt of court; breach of the latter would simply enable them to be removed as trustees.This decision has been since as inconsistent since, e.g. in Harries v Church Commissioners for England [1992] 1 WLR 1241, ethical investment was held to be allowed. In the second case, a month later, he prohibited the NUM from calling a strike in Nottinghamshire, because a ballot had not been held, and then declared that an NUM plan to discipline non-striking miners was illegal. He was chairman of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for 15 years, from 1972 to 1987. == Legal writings == Megarry was also an accomplished legal writer, publishing several leading textbooks. He is perhaps best known as joint author of The Law of Real Property with William Wade, first published in 1957 and usually known as Megarry and Wade. A 6th edition, edited by Charles Harpum, was published in 1999. Megarry also wrote a handbook to the Rent Acts in 1939, which ran to 11 editions by 1988. His Lectures on the Town and Country Act 1947 was published in 1949, shortly after the new town planning legislation was passed, and he also published A Manual of the Law of Real Property (1946), which ran to 8 editions. He was the sole editor of the 23rd edition of Snell's Equity (1947); he then edited the 24th edition (1954) to the 27th edition (1973) jointly with Paul Vivian Baker. His works broke new ground, in presenting technical areas of the law in a clear and systematic way, to the benefit of generations of law students. His love of the minutiae of legal practice led him to publish several legal miscellanies, including Miscellany-at-law (1955), Arabinesque- at-law (1969), Inns Ancient and Modern (1972), A Second Miscellany-at-Law (1973) and A New Miscellany-At-Law (2005). In 2014, The Green Bag published a \\"rump\\" chapter, titled \\"Contempt,\\" that Megarry had written but not readied for publication before his death, and had entrusted to renowned legal lexicographer Bryan A. Garner to see into print. He was also a book review and assistant editor of the Law Quarterly Review from 1944 to 1967, and a consultant for the BBC's radio programme Law in Action from 1953 to 1966. He also published An Introduction to Lincoln's Inn in 1971. ==Retirement== He retired as a judge in 1985, but occasionally sat until 1991. He was a member of the panel of judges of the Privy Council that decided the important negligence case of Yuen Kun Yeu in 1987. In retirement, he lectured in law in North America, and was Visitor at the University of Essex and in Cambridge. He was an active member of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies into the 1990s. His last book, A New Miscellany-at-Law, was published in December 2005. He died in London. ==NotesReferences== *Obituary, The Times, 16 October 2006 *Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 17 October 2006 *Obituary, The Guardian, 19 October 2006 *Obituary, The Independent, 28 October 2006 Category:English judges Category:English legal writers Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:People educated at Lancing College Category:Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge Category:People associated with the University of Essex Category:Knights Bachelor Category:1910 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Chancery Division judges Category:English Queen's Counsel ","title":"Robert Megarry"},{"id":"7461762","text":"Ingrƒ´da Latimira, formerly Ingrƒ´da ≈™dre, (born 15 January 1958) is a Latvian politician who belongs to the Latvian Farmers' Union political party. ≈™dre is a former professional basketball player who worked as an accountant after the end of her basketball career.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. With . It was built in 1883 by the Deseret News under the direction of Henry Grow. Workers used paper making equipment brought in from the old Sugar House Paper Mill to grind logs from nearby canyons into pulp. Rags gathered from old clothes were also used to produce the pulp, which was then placed into molds and dried. During its operation, the mill could yield up to 5 tons of paper per day. The mill provided jobs and paper for nearly ten years.; the railroad increased the demand for cheaper paper manufactured outside the area. In 1892, the Cottonwood Paper Mill was sold to Granite Paper Mills Company. On April 1, 1893, a fire broke out among its indoor stored stockpile of paper. Many hearing the alarm thought it an April Fools' Day prank. All that remained following the fire was a stone skeleton. The structure was partially rebuilt in 1927 for use as an open-air dance hall, known as the Old Mill Club, and remained so until the 1940s. In the late 1960s, rock bands played there on Friday and Saturday nights. It was also used in the 1970s and 1980s as a haunted house and a craft boutique. It was declared a historic site by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers in 1966, and was condemned by the city of Cottonwood Heights in 2005. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Salt Lake County, Utah ==ReferencesExternal links== * Historic American Buildings Survey, C.W.

He held the IBO flyweight title from 2000 to 2001 and the IBO super-flyweight title in 2004, and once challenged for the IBF flyweight title in 2003. At regional level, he held the Commonwealth flyweight title from 1998 to 1999; the British flyweight title in 1999; and the European flyweight title in 2000. As an amateur he represented Ireland in the flyweight division, winning bronze medals at the 1993 World Championships and 1996 European Championships, and reached the quarter-finals of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, US. == Background == Kelly was born and brought up in Belfast, Northern Ireland. ==Amateur career== As an amateur at club level, Kelly fought out of the Holy Trinity Boxing club in the Turf Lodge area of West Belfast. At national level Kelly boxed for Ireland and won the national title five times. During his career fighting for the national team he won a bronze medal at the flyweight division during the 1993 World Championships in Tampere, Finland. Kelly followed that bronze medal with another bronze medal at the 1996 European Championships in Vejle, Denmark. The bronze medal Kelly won at the European Championship in Vejle gave him automatic qualification for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, US, where he reached the quarter-finals. ===Olympic results=== Member of the 1996 Irish Olympic Team as a flyweight. His results were: *Defeated Yuliyan Strogov (Bulgaria) 12‚Äì11 *Defeated Hussein Hussein (Australia) 27‚Äì20 *Lost to Bulat Jumadilov (Kazakhstan) 6‚Äì13 == Professional career  Debut === Kelly, under the mentorship of Mickey Hawkins, then turned professional in September 1997, gaining a victory in his debut fight at the Ulster Hall in Belfast, with a first-round knockout (KO) over Chris Thomas on a card that included Steve Robinson, Julius Francis and fellow Northern Irishman Neil Sinclair. === Initial title fights === Kelly won his first seven fights, five by KO, before he had a chance to fight for his first title in December 1998 when he challenged Alfonso Zvenyika Lambarda for his Commonwealth flyweight title in Chester, England. Kelly won this fight via points decision (PTS) over twelve rounds. His next fight was against British flyweight champion Anthony Hana in March 1999. Kelly defeated Hana via PTS to add the British title to his Commonwealth belt. He next fought Keith Knox, who had been knocked out by Lambarda earlier in 1998. Kelly was leading on points when the fight was stopped in the sixth round due to cuts. Kelly had a number of cuts to his hairline and a bad cut above his right eye when the referee stopped the fight sending Kelly to suffer his first defeat as a professional. Kelly returned to the ring five months later and won the WBC International super-flyweight title against Igor Gerassimov. Kelly quickly added the European flyweight title in February 2000 and the IBO flyweight title in September 2000. Kelly's winning streak continued with a further addition to his record when he added the lightly regarded WBF flyweight title in May 2002. ===IBF world title fight in Colombia=== After a win over Jovy Oracion in October 2002, Kelly was then out of the ring for almost a year and only returned in September 2003 to an unexpected fight against Irene Pacheco at the Sal√≥n Jumbo del Country Club, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia for the IBF flyweight title. Kelly was a major underdog going into the fight as Pacheco was highly rated and as, with the exception of a fight against Mike Thomas in the US in 1998, Kelly had never fought as a professional outside Ireland and Britain. Pacheco proved too strong for Kelly, whose lack of power was highlighted when he was unable to answer the barrage of head and body punches from Pacheco. Kelly was knocked to the floor three times in round six before the fight was stopped in round seven. ===Cancelled Darchinyan fight=== Kelly again returned to boxing, now under the guidance of Tommy Gilmour to rebuild his career. After two more wins in his native Belfast, he defeated Jason Booth to win the IBO super-flyweight title. This win lined Kelly up with a fight against Vic Darchinyan, again for the IBF title in November 2005, but this fight fell through after a dispute as to whether the fight should take place in Sydney, Australia or somewhere in Ireland or Great Britain as well as a dispute over the purse. Kelly's future then looked uncertain, although he did face and defeat Ian Napa in Liverpool on the day he was supposed to face Darchinyan, beating Napa on points. ===Maludrottu controversy=== In April 2006, Kelly challenged Simone Maludrottu at the Andersonstown Leisure Centre in Belfast. Kelly was attempting to become the first Irishman to capture the European bantamweight title and the first Irish fighter to win the European title at two different weights. Maludrottu was the naturally bigger man and carried more power, having fought at bantamweight for the majority of his career, however Kelly possessed the faster hands and higher technical ability. Kelly's footwork and accurate jabs frustrated Maludrottu as Kelly stayed out of range, leaving him unable to make his superior power pay. Despite this, Maludrottu won an extremely controversial unanimous decision (UD). Punch stats showed that Kelly landed 155 punches while Maludrottu landed only 87, with the vast majority of onlookers believed that Kelly had won a fairly comfortable decision, but the Sardinian was given the verdict by all three judges. Kelly's promoter Tommy Gilmour stated that \\"that was shameful. It was the biggest robbery I've seen in 35 years of boxing\\". In the following rematch in Maludrottu's hometown of Olbia, Sardinia, Italy on 25 November 2006, Maludrottu stopped Kelly inside three rounds after Kelly's trainer Mickey Hawkins threw in the towel. Kelly announced his retirement immediately after the fight stating \\"the time has come for me to walk away. The defeat on Saturday night just confirmed that to me. Every sportsman comes to a point when they know they are at that stage when it is time to go. I've had a great career with highs and lows and I've achieved an awful lot\\". This was to be Kelly's last fight, although he was still the number one ranked Irish bantamweight boxer at the time. == See also == *List of boxing triple champions *List of British flyweight boxing champions ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Male boxers from Northern Ireland Category:Boxers at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic boxers of Ireland Category:Irish male boxers Category:AIBA World Boxing Championships medalists Category:Bantamweight boxers ","title":"Damaen Kelly"},{"id":"7461795","text":"Trade unions in Afghanistan have a brief and turbulent history, beginning in 1967 and effectively ending with the Islamic state of the Mujahideen.

Samuels quickly become embroiled in a rivalry against Grado, with Sha tormenting Grado for months, leading to a singles match between the two at Fear & Loathing VII at the Barrowland Ballroom. Sha would be victorious in this match, after Martin Stone became involved in the contest. The following year, Sha aligned himself with James R. Kennedy's faction, The 55, composed of Sha, Kid Fite, Timm Wylie, Martin Kirby & Bram. Often acting as hired mercenaries for The Black Label, the team of Samuels & Kid Fite would eventually target Polo Promotions and the ICW Tag Team Championships. After a number of contests between the teams, including a match at Fear & Loathing VIII, The 55 would eventually capture the titles at the final event of 2015. Sha & Fite would remain champions until Barramania II, on 3 April 2016, losing the titles back to Polo Promotions. At Shug's Hoose Party 3, Sha would shock the ICW fans, when he defected from The Black Label to join Mark Dallas's team, aligning with Grado & Noam Dar against Drew Galloway, Wolfgang & Jack Jester, to win Dallas 50% of the company back from Red Lightning. This story would continue for the rest of the year, with Team Dallas (Sha Samuels, DCT, Chris Renfrew & Grado) defeating The Black Label (Drew Galloway, Jack Jester, Bram & Kid Fite) to gain 100% control of ICW. In the aftermath of this, Sha continued to feud with former tag team partner Kid Fite, leading to a Glasgow Street Fight at Barramania 3, which involved Sha almost being run down by a car, and both men fighting inside the legendary Barras market, before Sha picked up the win, ending the feud. That same night, Sha was assaulted by his former friend Grado, who signed with Rudo Sports & Entertainment Brand, headed by the returning Red Lightning. After months of refusing to face Grado, Sha eventually agreed, and defeated Grado in a Loser Leaves ICW match at Shug's Hoose Party 4. That same weekend, Sha also teamed with Noam Dar in a special one-off match, against Bram and then-ICW World Heavyweight Champion Joe Coffey. Sha then began teaming with Jack Jester as The Kinky Party, an odd- couple pairing that became extremely popular with fans. After being attacked by the Kings Of Catch, Sha & Jester challenged the young team to a match at Fear & Loathing, which The Kinky Party would go on to win. With their eyes set on the ICW Tag Team Championships, The Kinky Party eventually faced The P.O.D (Rampage Brown & Ashton Smith) for the titles in Newcastle, successfully capturing the straps. This began an almost 8 month reign, in which The Kinky Party found themselves at odds with ALPHA/EVIL (Bram & Iestyn Rees). After defending the titles against ALPHA/EVIL for a second time at Fear & Loathing XI, The Kinky Party would lose the titles back to The P.O.D that same night, with Ashton & Rampage cashing in their title match opportunity that they had won earlier in the evening. After unsuccessfully attempting to regain the titles, Sha & Jester have become embroiled in a rivalry with The Anti-Fun Police. ===World of Sport Wrestling (2017)=== On 23 March 2017 Impact Wrestling announced that they would be teaming with ITV to yet again bring back World of Sport Wrestling with Jeff Jarrett as an executive producer as a ten episode series.

It was broadcast on 16 June 1994 as part of the group's prize for winning the Pick Me competition. The second version was shown in the US and directed by Mark Pellington. This video has been described as similar to the music video for the Pearl Jam song \\"Jeremy\\", also directed by Pellington. Like the \\"Jeremy\\" video, the US \\"Tomorrow\\" video includes: harsh lighting, especially on the face; various disturbing images, such as a pig eating money and shots of a spider-like creature; quick shifting between random images; and handwritten notes. The US version of \\"Tomorrow\\" received high rotation on MTV, which \\"led to an abundance of radio requests\\". ==Reception== In the United Kingdom, the song made No. 59 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1995. ===ARIA Music Awards=== On 20 October 1995, at the ARIA Music Awards, \\"Tomorrow\\" won three categories: 'Single of the Year', 'Highest Selling Single', and 'Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single'; the group won two further awards for their work on the related album, Frogstomp. At the ceremony they performed a cover version of Radio Birdman's \\"New Race\\" with Tim Rogers (of You Am I) joining them on stage. Their trophies were collected by Josh Shirley, the young son of Frogstomps producer, Kevin Shirley. ===Critical response=== AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the \\"angst-ridden single\\" as \\"from the standard grunge formula\\". In February 2004, Australian rock musician Scott Owen of The Living End was asked for \\"the most influential Australian music release\\" and answered that it was Silverchair's \\"Tomorrow\\", he explained \\"it taught kids that if you give it a go you have the chance to take on the world\\". ==Live performances== On 9 December 1995, the songs \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Pure Massacre\\" were performed by Silverchair on Saturday Night Live, hosted by David Alan Grier. ==Soundtrack appearances== \\"Tomorrow\\" was used in \\"The Mystery of Morning Wood\\", an episode on season six of Beavis and Butt-head, in 1995. At the start of the episode the two main characters are singing Boston's \\"More Than a Feeling\\", then concluded that the song was stupid and ended by stating how the video fails to disturb them. The song was also released as downloadable content for the video games Guitar Hero World Tour in 2009,https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/19/guitar-hero-world-tour-dlc-tracks- for-january/ Rock Band in 2010,https://www.shacknews.com/article/63462/rock- band-dlc-silverchair-flyleaf and Rocksmith 2014 in 2014.https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation-4/rocksmith-all- new-2014-edition-silverchair-tomorrow A re-recorded version of \\"Blind\\" was used in the film The Cable Guy in 1996 and included on the soundtrack album. \\"Stoned\\" was used in the movie Mallrats in 1995 and included on the soundtrack album.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/soundtrack ==Parody== Australian band Silverpram released a parody version of \\"Tomorrow\\", titled \\"Frogstamp\\", in 1995. The lyrics of the parody were centred around the young age of the Silverchair band members at the time, with the chorus lyrics changed to \\"I turn four tomorrow.\\" The single peaked at #72 on the Australian ARIA singles chart. ==Tomorrow EP and other releasesPersonnel== ;Silverchair members * Ben Gillies ‚Äì drums * Chris Joannou ‚Äì bass guitar * Daniel Johns ‚Äì lead vocals, lead guitar ;Production and art work * Producer, engineer ‚Äì Phil McKellar ** Producer, recording, mixing (Album Version) ‚Äì Kevin Shirley ** Mastering (Album Version) ‚Äì Ted Jensen * Studios ‚Äì Triple J studios, Sydney * Photography ‚Äì David Anderson ==Awards and nominations== ;ARIA Music Awards {  - !

Smaldone is best known for his extensive work with the deaf during his lifetime. Father Smaldone was a gifted preacher known for his commitment to proper catechesis and to the care of orphans and the mute, which earned him civic recognition. Smaldone's sainthood cause commenced in 1964 and in 1995 he became titled as Venerable under Pope John Paul II who soon after beatified him in mid-1996. Pope Benedict XVI canonized him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 15 October 2006 in Saint Peter's Square. ==Life== Filippo Smaldone was born in Naples in 1848 as the first of seven children to Antonio Smaldone and Maria Concetta De Luca. He made his First Communion in 1858 and received his Confirmation in 1862. He almost failed the examination for minor orders because he did not want to abandon his apostolate for his studies. He returned to Naples in 1876 ‚Äì with the permission of the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples Venerable Sisto Riario Sforza ‚Äì after a period of education in the Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati. He was made a subdeacon on 31 July 1870 and ordained a deacon on 27 March 1871. Smaldone was ordained to the priesthood on 23 September 1871. During his studies he began efforts to help the deaf of Naples and also did work with the sick. But at one stage he grew depressed, being frustrated over his mute students. He asked to give up teaching in favor of going to the foreign missions. But his spiritual director convinced him to remain and to continue his work. Smaldone almost died of cholera when it struck the area in 1884, and he credited his survival to the Madonna. In 1885 he founded an institution for the deaf and for the mute at Lecce on 25 March 1855 with the assistance of Father Lorenzo Apicella and several nuns that he had under his care. He opened several other branches of his order in 1897 in both Rome and Bari. On 18 December 1912, his order was aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor. . The order went on to receive the decree of praise from Pope Benedict XV on 30 November 1915 and full papal approval from Pope Pius XI after Smaldone's death on 21 June 1925. Smaldone founded both the Eucharistic League of Priest Adorers and the Eucharistic League of Women Adorers to promote the Eucharist and he also served for a brief period of time as the superior of the Missionaries of Saint Francis de Sales. The civic authorities commended and recognized him for his work as did religious authorities who made him a canon of the Lecce Cathedral. In 1880 he was sent to Milan as an expert at a conference of teachers for the deaf. He died on 4 June 1923 at 9:00 pm from diabetes-related complications combined with heart difficulties. His remains were later relocated in 1942 to the order's motherhouse. In 2005 there was a total of 40 houses with 398 religious in nations such as Rwanda and Moldova. ==Sainthood== The canonization cause commenced in an informative process that opened in 1964 under Pope Paul VI and concluded its business sometime after this. The introduction to this process titled him as a Servant of God. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process in Rome on 23 May 1989 and received the Positio in 1989 which allowed for theologians to approve it on 3 February 1995 and the C.C.S. to likewise approve the cause on 16 May 1995. Pope John Paul II declared Smaldone to be Venerable on 11 July 1995 after the pope confirmed that the priest had indeed lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated and then validated on 7 May 1993 while a medical board later approved it on 1 June 1995. Theologians also assented to this miracle on 27 October 1995 as did the C.C.S. on 12 December 1995. John Paul II issued formal assent needed and deemed that the healing was a miracle attributed to Smaldone's intercession on 12 January 1996, and presided over Smaldone's beatification on 12 May 1996. The process for a second miracle spanned from 2000 to 2002 at which point it received validation on 4 April 2003 before receiving the assent of the medical board on 3 February 2005; theologians assented to it on 17 May 2005 as did the C.C.S. on 17 January 2006. Pope Benedict XVI approved this on 28 April 2006 and canonized Smaldone in Saint Peter's Square on 15 October 2006. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Catholic Forum * Salesian Missions Category:1848 births Category:1923 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:19th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century Christian saints Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th- century Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:20th-century Christian saints Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Canonizations by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:19th- century Neapolitan people Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Filippo Smaldone"},{"id":"7461938","text":"Pebble Township is one of the fourteen townships of Pike County, Ohio, United States.

US 29 and SR 15 traverse Alabama in a general northeast/southwest slope. It has never been a major route in the state; its significance was completely overshadowed with the completion of Interstate 65 (I-65) and I-85 during the 1970s. Today, US 29 and SR 15 serve primarily to connect numerous smaller towns and cities in the southwest, south-central, and eastern parts of Alabama. US 29 has concurrencies with SR 113 from the Florida state line, through Flomaton, SR 3 from Flomaton to Brewton, SR 41 from Brewton to East Brewton, SR 15 from East Brewton to the Georgia State Line, SR 55 and then SR 12, in Andalusia, SR 9 from Brantley to Luverne, SR 10, from Luverne to Troy, SR 6 in Union Springs, SR 8 from Tuskegee to Alliance, and SR 38 in Opelika. Concurrencies with U.S Highways include US 31 from Flomaton to Brewton, US 84 in Andalusia, US 331 from Brantley to Luverne, US 82 in Union Springs, US 80 and unsigned SR 8 from Tuskegee to Alliance, and US 280 between Exits 58 and 62 along I-85 in Opelika. US 29 also runs along I-85 between Exit 51 Auburn and Exit 64 east of Opelika. ==Route descriptionFlorida state line through East Brewton=== US 29 enters downtown Flomaton in a concurrency with SR 113 from a bridge over a large railroad yard north of Century, Florida. Descending from that bridge over both the railroad yard and Ringgold Drive, the route is named Sidney E. Manning Boulevard, and has its first intersection with Church Street. The road briefly runs straight north for one block between College Street and Poplar Street, then turns back to the northwest. Sidney E. Manning Boulevard ends at US 31 and US 29/SR 113 makes a right turn joining those routes in a concurrency, crossing a bridge over Big Escambia Creek. Throughout the multiplex with US 31, the road winds along the north side of the Alabama- Florida state line, occasionally making southeast turns. SR 113 turns left and diverts from US 29 and 31 heading towards its terminus at I-65, while US 29 and US 31 continue along hidden SR 3\\\\. For the rest of its journey US 29, US 31, SR 3 and SR 15 wind mostly toward the northeast. A former section of US 31 branches off to the east where it enters Pollard, but US 29/US 31/SR 3 bypasses that community. The road intersects the former segment three times after this. The routes pass by a Georgia-Pacific paper mill just outside of the Brewton City Limits. After the bridge over Burnt Corn Creek, a truck detour veers off to the left onto Persimmon Street, because the main road flanks too closely to a former Louisville and Nashville Railroad line, entering the Brewton Historic Commercial District. The concurrency with US 31/SR 3 ends at SR 41 and US 29 and SR 41 instantly cross that line as they share a wrong way concurrency. The road crosses the Buddy Mitchell Bridge over Murder Creek into East Brewton and Mildred Street becomes Forest Avenue. The end of the concurrency with SR 41 is also the beginning of SR 15 where it remains almost throughout the rest of the state. Just as it did with the overlap with US 31, US 29 winds around the north side of the Alabama-Florida state line. Briefly curving more towards the northeast, it serves as the termini of two county roads, Escambia CR 22 (Ridge Road) and Escambia CR 4 (Brantley Road), before curving back towards the east. East of Escambia CR 43, US 29/SR 15 crosses over a bridge over Conecuh River and enters Conecuh National Forest where it passes through Dixie, and then crosses the Escambia- Covington County line. Along the way, it passes through the communities of Rome and then Pleasant Home, and after curving more toward the north and leaving the forest serves as the northern terminus of SR 137\\\\. Continuing at that northeast trajectory, it passes through Carolina, which contains a wye intersection with Covington CR 36 (Jacobs Road), and a short multiplex with Covington CR 31 between a blinker-light intersection with Rockhole Bridge Road and Salem Church Road, which has no signals of any sort whatsoever. ===Andalusia through Luverne=== The road officially enters Andalusia at the southern terminus of the concurrency with SR 55\\\\. US 29/SR 15/ SR 55 becomes a four lane undivided highway with center left-turn lane provisions It passes the other end of Brooklyn Road (Covington CR 42), then off to the northeast encounters the southern terminus of South Three Notch Road, which was once part of SR 15\\\\. SR 55 leaves the concurrency with US 29 at the west end of the concurrency with US 84/SR 12, and US 29/SR 15 joins that route in another concurrency. US 29/US 84/SR 12/ SR 15 crosses a railroad line as it continues to curve toward the east until it runs southeast then straight east as it encounters Three North Road again. This intersection is the official end of the US 29/US 84 concurrency. US 29/SR 15 turns left onto Three Notch Road, while US 84/SR 12 crosses the same railroad line it encountered northeast of the beginning of the concurrency, and runs east through Opp, Elba, Dothan, and towards coastal Georgia. North of Andalusia, the road curves towards the northwest as it approaches the western terminus of CR 40 (Antioch Road), and then straightens out towards the north as it runs through Heath, where another former segment of SR 15 and Three Notch Road now known as Straughn School Road branches off to the northeast. After the intersection with Barton Road, US 29/SR 15 curves to the northwest again replacing the trajectory of Barton Road itself. From there, a dirt road named CW Green Road branches off northwest of the road. The routes descend along a hill where the run under some power lines, then runs over a culvert before making another left curve and encountering the north end of CW Green Road, which this time is paved. Immediately after this intersection it encounters Covington CR 82 (Haygood Road) and takes it along in a hidden concurrency as it curves to the west. The road crosses another bridge over the Conecuh River and enters Gantt, where it runs straight north, along the way serving as the northern terminus of CR 59 (Point A Road), letting go of another part of CR 82 at Gantt-Red Level Road, and serves as the southern terminus of CR 37 (Oakley-Streak Road). Curving to the northeast, the road passes through Dunns and then runs along the north shore of Gantt Lake eventually passing through Clearview. Maintaining relatively the same trajectory while the coastline of the lake moves away from the road, US 29/SR 15 enters Crenshaw County where it becomes Andalusia Highway and passes through Searight. The road makes a slight curve to the left, but still remains northeast as it passes through Dozier, where it has a blinker-light intersection with Crenshaw CR 77 and becomes Dozier Highway. Further north, it serves as the eastern terminus of SR 106\\\\. The road enters the Town of Brantley just west of the intersection with Spring Hill Road and the name changes to West Emmett Avenue, which runs practically to the east until further downtown where it turns left onto an intersection with US 331 and unsigned SR 9 while East Emmett Avenue continues as a local city street. US 29, U.S 331, SR 9 and SR 15 are co-routed until they split at Luverne, specifically at SR 10 (Third Street). US 331 makes a left turn onto West Third Street, while US 29 makes a right turn onto East Third Street. From there US 29 and SR 15 follow SR 10 east as the name changes from East Third Street to Troy Highway, then curves to the northeast into the Crenshaw-Pike County line north of Chrenshaw CR 50 (Camp Ground Church Road). Once in Pike County, the road starts to curve to the east. ===Troy area to Rural Macon County=== After the intersection with Pike CR 1174 (formerly CR 31), the road descends into a valley then climbs a hill, that crests just before the intersection of Pike CR 2205 (formerly CR 47). East of Pike CRs 2214 and then 1165 (formerly part of CR 25), the road crosses a third bridge over the Conecuh River. Approaching Troy, a railroad line begins to flank the north side of the road while Pike CR 1101 runs along the north side of those tracks, as US 29/SR 10 gains the name Montgomery Street. SR 10 leaves the concurrency with US 29/SR 15 at a quarter- cloverleaf interchange with US 231 and unsigned SR 53\\\\. The ramps are on the southwest and southeast corners, due to the railroad line flanking the north side of the road. Three Notch Road is encountered again, as US 29/SR 15 leaves Montgomery Street to turn left and go north, crossing the same railroad line it passed by over US 231, which itself curves towards the north. In the meantime, the route runs northeast until after the intersection of Love Street, where it turns straight north. The road runs along the west side of the town square between Church and Elm Streets, and later passes just outside of the College Street Historic District. After the intersection with Pierson Street, the road curve to the northeast. Beginning near a cold-storage facility, the road runs along the west side of the same railroad line it had encountered in downtown Troy. After the intersection with Pike CR 55, the road crosses a bridge over that line and then runs along the east side. Both the road and the railroad line curve from the northeast to the southeast, and along the way US 29/SR 15 serves as the southern terminus of SR 223\\\\. The road continues to curve to the southeast until it enters Banks, where it turns left onto a blinker-light intersection with Monticello Avenue crossing that same railroad line in the process, while SR 93 continues south from there. US 29/SR 15 runs mostly eastbound as it serves as the northern terminus of SR 201\\\\. After passing through some of the wetlands surrounding Richland Creek, it serves as the northern terminus of SR 130 north of Monticello, and then the route curves to the northeast. The last community in Pike County is Josie, where it then to north-northwest before the intersection with Pike CR 6628\\\\. After curving to the right as it intersects Pike CR 6652, it runs northeast as it crosses the Bullock County line and descends along a hill. After the county line it passes through communities such as Tanyard, where it intersects CR 53 before curving more towards the north as it runs along bridges over Mill Creek and Double Creek, then Perote, where it intersects Bullock CR 8, then makes a reverse curve as it climbs a slight hill before running straight north. The road tilts north-northwest as it enters Blues Old Stand, and then begins to curve towards the northeast where it passes through Scottland. Winding past a power line right-of-way before making another curve towards the north, it passes through Aberfoil where it has a brief overlap with Bullock CR 31, but more importantly serves as the northern terminus of SR 239, with a connecting road south of that terminus. From there, US 29 curves to the northwest. Approaching Union Springs as it crosses a fourth bridge over the Conecuh River, a US 29 Truck along with hidden SR 197 (Martin Luther King Boulevard South), branches off to the right then the road turns straight north onto South Prairie Street. Further north it crosses a bridge over an abandoned railroad line between Underwood Avenue and Holcombe Avenue. Later South Prairie Street becomes North Prairie Street as US 29/SR 15 makes a right turn onto a concurrency with US 82 and unsigned SR 6 (Blackmon Avenue) for two blocks. The concurrency does not end as US 29/US 82/SR 6/SR 15 makes a left turn onto Martin Luther King Boulevard North, terminating US Truck Route 29. Two blocks after that, US 82/SR 6 makes a right turn onto Conecuh Avenue East, terminating the concurrency, and US 29/SR 15 continues north. On its way out of the city limits, US 29 widens from three lanes to four as it curves to the northwest, then narrows back down to three lanes as it curves to the northeast before finally leaving the city just south of Bullock CR 23, then runs over a culvert over Old Towne Creek. In Sedgefield US 29 curves to the north- northwest and serves as the southwest end of Bullock CR 115\\\\. The road runs relatively in the same direction even as it passes through the Moores Creek wetlands, before the northeast end of CR 115, then crosses a bridge over Dobbs Creek just south of the Bullock-Macon County line. Shortly after this, it runs through Fort Davis which has a one block concurrency with Macon CR 2, due to a culvert over a tributary of Dobbs Creek. It then passes by the abandoned Seaboard Air Line Railroad line and station just before the post office. At the intersection of Saint Mark's Road it makes a curve to the northeast and further north passes through communities such as Cotton Valley and later Davisville where it has another concurrency, this time with Macon CR 47\\\\. ===Tuskegee to the Georgia state line=== In Tuskegee, US 29 becomes Union Springs Road in front of the George Washington Carver Elementary School, and makes a sharp curve to the west-northwest as it approaches Macon CR 10, where it turns into South Main Street. Before reaching Downtown Tuskegee, US 29 makes a slight right curve, but still remains northwest. Running through historic downtown Tuskegee, it makes a right turn in front of the town green to join eastbound US 80 and unsigned SR 8 in Downtown Tuskegee. SR 81, begins on the east side of the town green, before moving to North Main Street, while SR 81 Truck also begins and runs along the concurrency with US 29 and US 80\\\\. US 29, US 80, SR 8, SR 15, and SR 81 Truck are co-routed along East Martin Luther King Junior Drive until the intersection with General Chappie James Drive, where truck route 81 turns north. Later the routes enter Tuskegee National Forest. They briefly leave the forest but then re-enter it together until they split at an interchange southwest of Alliance, which is also the eastern terminus of SR 186\\\\. This interchange has a single eastbound ramp on the southeast corner, and a bi-directional quarter-cloverleaf ramp on the northwest corner. After leaving the forest for the last time and then intersecting a dirt road named Lee Road 191, the route takes a brief dip and then crosses the Macon-Lee County line. Southwest of Auburn, US 29 becomes South College Road, encounters an industrial park at Cox Road and Sand Hill Road (Lee CR 10) and then has an interchange with I-85 at Exit 51. US 29/SR 15 joins I-85 in a concurrency, while South College Road becomes SR 147\\\\. The freeway segment continues northeast into the city of Opelika, the county seat of Lee County. At Exit 58 I-85/US 29 gains a second US concurrency at Exit 58, its four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Gateway Drive, where US 280 (and unsigned SR 38) joins from the northwest. The three highways cross over a Norfolk Southern Railway line just west of their four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 51 and SR 169 south of downtown Opelika. US 280/SR 38 splits east toward Phenix City and ColumbUS at the next interchange with US 431 and unsigned SR 1, which is Exit 62. At Exit 64, US 29 leaves I-85 and joins West Point Parkway, but the road runs in close proximity to I-85 from the Auburn area to near Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Though independent of I-85, US 29 has intersections with some relatively important roads leading to it, first among them Andrews Road (unmarked Lee CR 799) which leads I‚Äë85 at Exit 66 as well as a Walmart Distribution Center, then crosses Lee CR 177\\\\. The road briefly turns east, then curves towards the northeast. At the terminus of Lee CR 390, it turns north-northeast and runs under a power line right-of-way. Lee CR 266 branches off to the northwest, while US 29 branches off to the northeast, then the road intersects Lee CR 270\\\\. From there the road curves north-northeast, then crosses an abandoned railroad line between the intersections of Lee CRs 268 and 271, and later runs through a wooded area where it crosses the Lee-Chambers County line where West Point Parkway becomes the Millard Fuller Memorial Highway. North of this border, it starts to make a slight curve to the northeast, where it encounters a multiplex with Chambers CR 388,US 29/Chambers CR 388 overlap (Google Maps) the western end of which leads to I-85 at Exit 70. The road officially enters the City of Valley approximately southwest of the intersection with Ben Brown Road. After the intersection with Judge Brown Road, the road gradually widens from two to four lanes as it crosses the Duwayne Bridges Bridge, and then after the intersection with Fairfax Bypass, becomes a divided highway. From there, the road winds through the former community of Fairfax. The road cuts through a portion of the historic district named for that community. After leaving that district at the intersection with Cusseta Road and River Road, the divider ends at a street named \\"Boulevard\\" but the road remains four-lanes wide as it begins to flank the Chattahoochee Valley Railroad Trail.Chattahoochee Valley Railroad Trail (TrailLink) It also gains a continuous center left-turn lane, which it possesses almost throughout the rest of the state. In the former community of Langdale, the road winds down a slight hill then curves from 64th Boulevard to 20th Street, as the trail moves away from the road again in order to run along the Horace King Memorial Covered Bridge. The route, the trail and the bridge are part of the Langdale Historic District, and so are the former Landgale Cotton Mill, the Sears Memorial Auditorium, and various schools. Between 21st Avenue and 59th Street, US 29 crosses a bridge over Moores Creek then intersects Chambers CR 209 (Fob James Road), where it also has a crossing with the same rail trail.Chattahoochee Valley Railroad Trail (TrailLink) Fob James Road leads to Exit 77 on I-85. Roughly near Lanier Health Services, the route enters the former community Eady City and stays there until the intersection of 40th Street, but the route still remains in Valley, although around 33rd Street it enters the former community known as Shawmut, where it runs along the eastern edge of the Shawmut Historic District. The northern border of that district ends at 29th Boulevard, which is north of 23rd Drive,Intersections of 23rd Drive and 29th Boulevard with US 29 in Shawmut, Valley, Alabama (Google Maps) the gateway to Shawmut. Just north of 28th Street the divided highway briefly returns within the vicinity of I-85 at Exit 79, the last exit for I-85 within the state. In Lanett the road runs over a bridge over a former Western Railway of Alabama line and then serves as the eastern terminus of SR 50, the last state highway to intersect with US 29\\\\. At that intersection the road curves straight to the northeast, and becomes Glimer Avenue. A residential frontage road runs along the east side between South 14th Street and South 10th Street. At the intersection of First Street, the numerical order of the side streets reverts forward. North of there, the same WRA line the road crossed over before the intersection with SR 50 begins to flank the east side of the road. The last intersection in Alabama is with North Seventh Avenue, a local street completely dominated by a car and truck dealership. US 29 enters the State of Georgia which runs northwest to southeast and the City of West Point, thus bringing SR 15 to an end. ==History== The original southern terminus of US 29 was in Tuskegee, Alabama, and ran along today's Alabama State Route 81 and Alabama State Route 14. It was extended south into Brewton by 1934.End of US highway 29, including 1928 Alabama DOT map (US Ends.com) Within Flomaton, US 29 was originally a segment of US 331 between 1926 and 1936. US 29 was extended to the road in 1935. Three Notch Road is a local street that was the name of former segments of Alabama State Route 15 US Highway 29 once passed through downtown Auburn and downtown Opelika. The US Highway has been concurrent with Interstate Highway 85 from Exit 51, south of Auburn, to Exit 64, northeast of Opelika. This change was made by Alabama Department if Transportation in the 1990s. Route markers have been appropriately relocated since then, though some maps still show the old route in this area as being part of SR 15. ==Major intersectionsReferencesExternal links== *US Highway 29 in Alabama (AARoads) 29 Alabama Category:Transportation in Escambia County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Covington County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Crenshaw County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Pike County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Bullock County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Macon County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Lee County, Alabama Category:Transportation in Chambers County, Alabama ","title":"U.S. Route 29 in Alabama"},{"id":"7461988","text":"Taita (), officially TaitƒÅ, is one of the northernmost suburbs of the city of Lower Hutt in New Zealand, situated toward the northern end of the city.

Palazo Antinori. Giuliano da Maiano (1432‚Äì1490) was an Italian architect, intarsia-worker and sculptor, the elder brother of Benedetto da Maiano, with whom he often collaborated. == Biography == He was born in the village of Maiano, near Fiesole, where his father was a stone-cutter who moved his family and business to Florence, where, according to Vasari, he operated a stonemason's yard, providing mouldings and carved stone detail for construction. Giuliano showed early promise, and his father hoped at first to make of him a notary, but his talent for sculpture and design won out. His first designs were for the intarsia inlay in the fittings for the New Sacristy of the Duomo, Florence, carried out in collaboration with Benedetto in 1463-1465, where Giuliano carved the wooden bas-reliefs of putti and garlands in the frieze, and for works in Palazzo Vecchio in collaboration with Benedetto, notably the ceiling in octagonal compartments and the white marble doorcase in Benedetto's Sala d'Audienza intarsia in the Sala dei Dugento (1472‚Äì1477) and in the Sala del Giglio. In 1480 he finished a tabernacle of the Madonna dell'Olivo for the Cathedral of Prato, executed in collaboration with his brothers Benedetto and Giovanni. As an architect he was virtually the house architect for the Pazzi, rebuilding Palazzo Pazzi (1462‚Äì1472),Now Palazzo Pazzi-Quaratesi. the main seat of the family, for Jacopo de' Pazzi. For the Strozzi, at the Palazzo dello Strozzino he added a piano nobile (c. 1456) in the manner of Palazzo Medici-Riccardi to a ground floor that had been begun by Michelozzo; he is also often credited with Palazzo Antinori (1465‚Äì1469). In Siena, he built Palazzo Spannocchieschi (c. 1475), in the Florentine manner of delicately rusticated facade and twinned arch-headed windows within a blind arch that had been established in Florence by Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai and Michelozzo's Palazzo Medici- Riccardi. Between the two cities, at San Gimignano, Giuliano is credited with enlarging the Romanesque church of Santa Maria and building the chapel of Santa Fina, in collaboration with Benedetto; at Arezzo, where Benedetto built the Portico of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Giuliano built the cloister of the Badia. The Badia of Fiesole influenced the design of the Brunellesque church of Santa Maria del Sasso, outside Bibbiena, built in 1486-87,The former church had burned in 1486. where documents show craftsmen were presenting their bills to Giuliano for countersigning.Ludovico Borgo, \\"Giuliano da Maiano's Santa Maria del Sasso\\" The Burlington Magazine 114 No. 832 (July 1972), pp. 448-452. The monks of San Marco were in charge, but the patron was a Medici, for stemme for the church were being painted even as construction progressed; doubtless it was Lorenzo de' Medici himself who paid the expenses. The rock for which the church is named, site of an apparition of the Virgin Mary, rises through the floor at the domed crossing, where Giuliano's delicate domed baldachin identifies and protects the sanctified spot. Plan of the Villa Poggio Reale His established reputation elicited commissions in Rome, Loreto (Basilica della Casa Santa), Faenza (at the cathedral, 1474‚Äì1486), in Recanati, where Lorenzo sent him to build Palazzo Venier for Cardinal Anton Giacomo Venier, and in other locations in the Marche. Above all, from 1487 he worked in Naples, where Alfonso, then duca di Calabria, employed him at the Villa di Poggio Reale (1487‚Äì1488, demolished).George L. Hersey, Afonso II and the Artistic Renewal of Naples (Yale University Press) 1969, pp 60ff. Giuliano also erected the marble Porta Capuana closely flanked by the cylindrical towers of the Castello; it takes the form of a triumphal arch with Corinthian columns and an elaborate sculptural program; in the Sala Grande of the Castello he carved bas-reliefs above the doors, within and without (Vasari). He died in Naples in 1490, and Alfonso himself supplied mourners for the funeral.

When the microgametophyte is first formed inside the pollen grain four sets of fertile cells called sporogenous cells are apparent. These cells are surrounded by a wall of sterile cells called the tapetum, which supplies food to the cell and eventually becomes the cell wall for the pollen grain. These sets of sporogenous cells eventually develop into diploid microspore mother cells.

These megaspores then develop into the haploid female gametophytes. This occurs within the ovule, which is housed inside the ovary. == The Process == Refer to the figure above to observe the process of megagametogenesis, which is detailed below. Prior to megagametogenesis, a developing embryo undergoes meiosis during a process called megasporogenesis. Next, three out of four megaspores disintegrate, leaving only the megaspore that will undergo the megagametogenesis. The following steps are shown in Figure 1, and detailed below. # The remaining megaspore undergoes a round of mitosis. This results in a structure with two nuclei, also called a binucleate embryo sac. # The two nuclei migrate to opposite sides of the embryo sac. # Each haploid nucleus then undergoes two rounds of mitosis which creates 4 haploid nuclei on each end of the embryo sac. # One nucleus from each set of 4 migrates to the center of the embryo sac. These form the binucleate endosperm mother cell. This leaves three remaining nuclei on the micropylar end and three remaining nuclei on the antipodal end. The nuclei on the micropylar end is composed of an egg cell, two synergid cells, and the micropyle, an opening that allows the pollen tube to enter the structure. The nuclei on the antipodal end are simply known as the antipodal cells. These cells are involved with nourishing the embryo, but often undergo programmed cell death before fertilization occurs. # Cell plates form around the antipodal nuclei, egg ell, and synergid cells. == Variations == Plants exhibit three main types of megagametogenesis. The number of haploid nuclei in the functional megaspore that is involved in megagametogenesis is the main difference between these three types. === Monosporic === Bisporic megagaetogenesis is shown in the figure and outlined below. The most common type of megagametogenesis, monosporic megagametogenesis, is outlined above. This type of megagemetogenesis only allows one megaspore to undergo megagametogenesis, while the other three undergo programmed cell death. === Bisporic === As the name implies, bisporic megagametogenesis involves two genetically different haploid nuclei. # These two nuclei undergo a round of mitosis. # Then, the nuclei on the micropylar end of the structure undergo a second round of mitosis. # Next, the nuclei rearrange to form a trinucleate endosperm mother cell and the characteristic arrangement of the micropylar end, with an egg cell and two synergid cells. # Cell plates form around the egg cell and synergid cells. ==Eudicots== In eudicot plants, the entire process happens inside the ovule of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process described here is common. This process starts with a single diploid megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes meiotic cell division to form four cells that are haploid. Three cells die and one that is most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes mitosis three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell which then becomes the polar nuclei. The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the antipodals. The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac. == Post- megagametogenesis == Megagametogenesis creates the female gametophyte, which is an integral part of pollination, a very prominent process in plants. The male counterpart to megagametogenesis is called microgametogenesis. Microgametogenesis is the process of the formation of the male gametophyte. During pollination, the female gametophyte communicates with the pollen tube to ensure that it comes in contact with the ovule. When contact is made, the pollen tube grows through the micropyle opening into a synergid cell, that dies when this occurs. The death of the synergid cell signals to the pollen tube to release the sperm. This process creates the embryo, seed coat, and endosperm which, after pollination, will become crucial parts of the seed. == Implications == Pollination is an essential process of global crop production. Its success is economically crucial for farmers. Additionally, pollination success is required for global food security. Cereals, or the seeds of grain crops, are most important staple food to humans around the world. They make up 48% of the calories consumed by humans. == See also == * Megaspore ‚Äî it is the female part of the flower in which seeds are formed. it consists of 7 parts: funicle, hilam, integuments, micropyle, chalaza, nucellus, embryosac * Microspore ‚Äî it is the male part of the flower in which pollen grains are stored. * Gametophyte == References  Further reading == * Category:Reproduction ","title":"Megagametogenesis"},{"id":"7462163","text":"Rules of Civility & Decent Behaviour In Company and ConversationWashington, George.

He had switched playing time between Chivas and CD Tapatio since then, with a brief stay in Chivas Coras in the 2005-2006 season. He took part in Chivas's Championship win in the Apertura 2006. Esparza was given high praise by Mexico coach Javier Aguirre for his performances and was expected to cement a place in the 2010 World Cup starting line-up. However a knee injury picked up in the final game of the season ended his world cup hopes and he is not expected to be back in full training until June 2010. ==International career== Omar Esparza has played with the Mexico national football team in three categories. He was present with the Mexico U-17 Team, in which he and his team mates won the U-17 World Cup in Peru in 2005. He played in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship Match where Mexico obtained the cup against Brazil. The score was 3-0, and Esparza scored the 2nd goal of the final. He has also played with U-20 in the FIFA U-20 World Cup that was held in Canada where he was an important player.

Though both cities have rich histories influenced by Greeks, Oscans, Etruscans, Samnites and finally the Romans, they are most renowned for their destruction: both were buried in the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. For over 1,500 years, these cities were left in remarkable states of preservation underneath volcanic ash, mud and rubble. The eruption completely obliterated the towns but ironically was the cause of their longevity and survival over the centuries. However, for both cities, excavation has brought with it deterioration, as both natural forces and human activity (whether accidental or deliberate) have played their part in the slow disintegration of the sites. Problems range from paintings being exposed to light and buildings being worn away by weathering, erosion and water damage to inappropriate excavation and reconstruction methods to outright theft and vandalism. As stated by Henri de Saint-Blanquat: The ancient city was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund, and again in 1998 and in 2000. In 1996, the organization claimed that Pompeii \\"desperately need[ed] repair\\" and called for the drafting of a general plan of restoration and interpretation.World Monuments Fund, List of 100 Most Endangered Sites - 1996 , New York, NY: 1996, p. 31.] ==Problems of conservation== While the excavation of the cities has led to a wealth of information on the two towns and on Roman life in general, it has also allowed the sites to come under the attack of the elements. Some of this is unpreventable; however, much of it can be slowed or completely stopped through human intervention. Unfortunately, funding is in such a state that not everything can be saved. An estimated US$335 million is needed to carry out all the works necessary in Pompeii alone. ===Weathering and erosion=== Pompeii and Herculaneum have been excavated for centuries (excavations began in 1738 in Herculaneum, and later in 1748), and all exposed structures have been affected by general deterioration over time. In particular, since the eruption disrupted many of the buildings, excavation has left them unstable and vulnerable to collapse, such as the town wall of Pompeii. In many places, walls have partially collapsed, and much of the site is closed to visitors because of the danger it poses to them. Many artifacts themselves are also damaged by natural processes. In Herculaneum, the carbonised remains of objects, once exposed to the air, deteriorated within days. Only when a substance (lampblack) was applied were they able to survive in the open. Also in Herculaneum, the bones of hundreds of victims found at the beach have been left in the open air due to a lack of funding, and are steadily disintegrating. This fresco of a girl's initiation into the cult of Dionysos shows not only damage before and during the eruption, but also a distinct fade in the lustre of the paint caused from exposure after excavation. Flash photography is prohibited to inhibit further deterioration. Light exposure The frescoes, sculptures and paintings prevalent in both towns were highly preserved, retaining a large amount of detail, colour and vibrancy. Unfortunately, on excavation, they began to fade due to exposure to natural light, as well as beginning to crumble and pull away from the walls. However, these issues can be resolved through simple conservation techniques: earlier organic methods of preservation proved effective, and a more modern method using aluminium and plastic has had even better results. In addition, detailed reproductions have been made of many of the artworks, such as the Alexander Mosaic in the House of the Faun. Not all actions taken to preserve structures and artefacts have been effective, however, and some have caused more damage. For example, perspex cases have been constructed to protect frescoes and graffiti, however this creates a humidity trap and causes damage to the plaster. Plants and animals The region of Campania in which both sites lie is very temperate and fertile, so many plants thrive even inside the archaeological site. Henri de Saint- Blanquat identifies thirty-one plants in Pompeii, which, after growing in patches of bare earth, grow outward and attack the surrounding buildings, as well as dislodging tiles and mosaics. In particular, ivy grows along the walls, making parts crumble, and the roots undermine the foundations of the buildings. In regions traversed by tourists, their feet trample the plants; in closed-off areas, particularly those closest to unexcavated parts of the cities, this severely damages the buildings. The buildings on the left show signs of decay due to the infestation of various plants, while the debris accumulating on the footpath indicates erosion of the infrastructure. The footpaths and road have also been worn down by pedestrian activity since excavation. Feral dogs were particularly an issue in Pompeii. The dogs which occupied buildings around the Forum in the 1980s have been removed. Hundreds lived on the site, inadvertently damaging footpaths, roads and walls, as well as proving aggressive towards some tourists. In Herculaneum, pigeons are a particular problem; the acidic nature of their feces wears away the roofs and walls of many structures. Italian law prohibits them from being shot. === Human activity === Early excavations Particularly in Herculaneum, the earliest excavations revolved around collecting valuable artifacts and antiquities rather than systematic excavation. By merely digging for objects with aesthetic and commercial value, they were taken from being in situ to private collections, and thus much of the information on them was lost. Additionally, other objects not considered worthy by pursuers of Antiquarianism were destroyed, or damaged in the process of retrieving other items. These valuable objects, once discovered, were also disorganised and lost all historical meaning: a collection of bronze letters originally fixed on a wall in Herculaneum, once removed by the Bourbon kings, were taken out of order without recording the original placement or meaning. Visitors were invited to re-arrange them to form their own messages. A similar usage was made of bones: they would often be arranged together as composites of bones of several individuals, even combining those of children with adults and giving some literally two left feet. These would then be displayed for dramatic effect. Some of these remain today, but there is little hope of re-forming the original skeletons or using them to discover information on the inhabitants of Pompeii or Herculaneum.

Vesuvius. Though some directors before him had taken limited steps towards this, Maiuri was motivated to reconstruct much of the infrastructure of the two towns. This meant rebuilding walls and roofs that had been knocked down by the eruption to reproduce the facade of the towns. This was particularly important in Pompeii, where the roofs and anything more than two metres above ground level were destroyed by the eruptions. Unfortunately, the materials used in this reconstruction were mostly concrete and steel. The mix of the cement was particularly bad in many places, and the alkaline in the masonry reacted with the ancient stones, causing crumbling and erosion to walls of structures such as the House of the Coloured Capitals, as well as peeling off any existing paint. After the 1980s, these materials used in reconstruction were replaced by more modern ones which would not react badly with the original work, and the old reconstructions are being gradually replaced; however, the damage has already been done in most places, and the replacement endeavours will take many more years to complete. Tourism Tourism has been a mixed blessing for the site. As there are 2.5 million visitors to both cities every year, their presence allows for education on the conservation issues on the site. Additionally, a law was passed in Italy in 1997, which allowed for all money raised from these tourists to be directly channeled to helping with the conservation of the site. However, the massive number of tourists also causes many problems. The general movement of them causes the gradual wearing down of the roads and pavements, particularly in the more frequented areas like the Pompeiian Forum complex. Tourists also might take chips of rock or stone from the site, as well as accidentally brushing against the walls and frescoes, further increasing their rate of deterioration. The open nature of both sites to tourists is also a leading cause in vandalism and theft. Venus in Pompeii prevents vandalism of the site, as well as theft - many tourists obtain small artefacts from both cities as souvenirs. Vandalism and war Vandalism, particularly graffiti, is a problematic issue for Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tourists and others often break off parts of the city's structures to take home as mementos or souvenirs. Graffiti appears inscribed in the walls (often alongside their ancient counterparts) as well as on paintings and frescoes, particularly the less damaged or unsullied works of art. The site was also bombed by Allied air forces during the Second World War, and many of its buildings needed to be reconstructed in the postwar period. Theft While both areas are guarded, many artifacts still find their way to the illicit antiquities market. Often these acts of theft also cause accidental damage to surrounding objects, and the thieved antiquities are no longer in situ and lose their context and cultural associations. In 2003, two frescoes were hacked off a wall in the House of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii. This act of theft also damaged several other frescoes in the house, and, though a camera system exists in Pompeii, it had been out of operation for several months when the event took place. These frescoes were recovered some months later, but many others have disappeared from the site, never to be returned. ==House of the Gladiators collapse== The 2,000-year-old ‚ÄúHouse of the Gladiators‚Äù in the ruins of ancient Pompeii collapsed on 6 November 2010. Known officially by its Latin name ‚ÄúSchola Armatorum ‚Äù the structure was not open to visitors but was visible from the outside as tourists walked along one of the ancient city's main streets. There was no immediate word on what caused the building to collapse, although reports suggested water infiltration following heavy rains might be responsible. There has been fierce controversy regarding the collapse. ==Conservation projects== There are many conservation projects, endeavours and enterprises associated with both cities in an attempt to prevent further deterioration. These focus on removing the forces that attack the sites, as well as restoring the damaged artefacts and preventing further destruction. This site of conservation work on the Via dell'Abbondanza (Street of Abundance) is part of a larger project by the Soprintendenza Archaeologica di Pompeii to restore the facades and frescoes of many buildings on the street. ===Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii=== The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii is the major administrative body of both sites and others in the Naples and Vesuvuian area. It has overall responsibility for caring for both ancient cities, managing the sites, conserving them, working towards the removal of plants, providing security to prevent further theft, administering tourist entry into the site and reconstructing various buildings. It also directs many other subsidiary projects, and controls all funding and access to the two cities. Projects such as the restoration of frescoes and sculptures in Pompeii are run by the institute. Additionally, modern technology is used to help in conservation; in 2006, a laser survey was created of the Forum complex, allowing a three-dimensional, digital reconstruction. ===Moratorium=== In 1999, Pietro Giovanni Guzzo declared a moratorium on all further excavations of both sites. As then superintendent, he decided that all funds should be diverted into preserving the remains of both cities, rather than excavating more when massive amounts of work is still needed on the areas already unearthed. This has caused controversy amongst historians and archaeologists, and has become the centre of the debate on whether to focus on conservation or excavation. Classicists argue that only by continuing excavations can more ancient texts be found to reveal more about ancient Roman life. In particular, they pin their hopes on the unexcavated chamber of the Villa of the Papyri, where over 1,800 carbonised papyrus rolls have been discovered containing works of Epicurean philosophy by Philodemus. However, those in favour of conservation argue that the texts are much safer underground than exposed and we still have much to draw from what has already been excavated. Minor excavations, such as that of the House of the Surgeon currently being undertaken by the Anglo-American Project at Pompeii at a cost of 10 million euro a year, are still allowed. However, no new sites are open to be excavated. ===Herculaneum Conservation Project=== As a joint project led by the Packard Humanities Institute and the Soprintendenza Speciale per I Beni Archaeologici di Napoli e Pompeii with the British School at Rome, the project has worked since 2001 to halt the serious decay conditions which were found at the site. Initially the work focused on an emergency campaign which then transformed into works to ensure the long-term maintenance of the site. A major emphasis has been placed on ensuring that infrastructures work effectively so that when the project is completed, the Soprintendenza will be in a good position to manage the continuous care of the site. In addition scientific research is under way so that suitable methodologies can be identified to conserve Herculaneum's wall paintings, plasters, mosaics, wooden features, structures, etc. ==ReferencesOther sources== * * * ==External links== * World Monuments Fund, Conservation in the Shadow of Vesuvius: a Review of Best Practices / Conservazione all‚Äôombra del Vesuvio: un esame delle migliori pratiche, 2003. * Challenge of Saving Antiquities * History of the Management of Pompeii and Herculaneum Category:Herculaneum (ancient city) Category:Pompeii (ancient city) Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage ","title":"Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum"},{"id":"7462238","text":"The Sharing Knife is a romance/fantasy series by American writer Lois McMaster Bujold, published in 2006‚Äì2019. The original story grew so long in the telling that it was split into two volumes: Beguilement (2006) and Legacy (2007). Bujold then wrote a sequel, which was also divided, into Passage (2008) and Horizon (2009). The original title of the sequel was The Wide Green World, but Bujold and her publisher decided to make \\"Sharing Knife\\" the overall title, with the individual books given one-word subtitles and numbered 1‚Äì4. The fifth story in the series, a \\"short novel\\" titled Knife Children, was released as an electronic book on January 25, 2019. == Background == Beguilement establishes a fictional space inspired by the part of North America Bujold grew up in: the country south of the Great Lakes. Recovery from a grand collapse of a prior high magical culture has brought population and technology back to roughly the state of the early 19th-century American frontier‚Äîminus gunpowder. The grand collapse is accounted for in terms of hubris, though not in technology but in spirit, for lack of a clearer term, with a caste of near-magical aristocrats all but wiped out in a series of wars with their spirit-eating creation and its hatchlings, termed malices or blight bogles. A malice feeds on 'life force' or, in the novel's terms, ground‚Äîwhich includes not only the internal order of living beings, but also the structural integrity of all matter, the emergent properties of form and function. It is able to mold man-like agents out of wild animals, called \\"mud-men\\", and to absorb the knowledge and skills of humans that it kills. A malice that emerges in areas away from humans is likely to become somewhat strange, consuming only animals. The role of the clans of Lakewalkers, descendants of the said near-magical aristocracy, is to patrol the lands around the Dead Lake (remnant of the several Great Lakes) and to kill newly hatched malices as early in their careers as may be. This they do with knives made from the thigh bones of their own dead, \\"primed\\" in the suicide of a mortally wounded or aged Lakewalker so that their death may be \\"shared\\" with the otherwise immortal malice. Hence the series title. The Lakewalker caste's lifeway approximates Native Americans' hunter-gatherer- warrior nomadism after adoption of the horse, but differs by maintaining a single culture and language and an all-hinterland-spanning quasi-military order, the Patrol, which Lakewalker camps spend considerable resources to support. Southeast seacoast survivors from the commoner caste have been invited by them to re-settle the area south of the Dead Lake. Anyone not a Lakewalker is labeled a farmer. Farmers have little or none of the Lakewalkers' great talent and tool: \\"ground sense\\". With this, it is possible to detect and read details of all living things, as well as innate qualities of inanimate objects‚Äîthe underlying truth of the world‚Äîto a distance varying with individual talent and training --- including the presence of malices. In its absence, Farmers tend to take a jaundiced view of Lakewalkers' activities and abilities, and to discount the role of Lakewalkers in their own survival. Although both Farmers and Lakewalkers are human, and they speak the same language, there are physical differences, in addition to the Lakewalkers' ability to sense and manipulate ground. Lakewalkers are significantly taller than Farmers, and Lakewalkers have a longer life-span. ==References== Category:Book series introduced in 2006 Category:American fantasy novel series ","title":"The Sharing Knife"},{"id":"7462268","text":"Richard Sher is a longtime newscaster in Baltimore, Maryland, who spent most of his career at WJZ-TV. == Early life == Richard Sher was born in 1941 to Michael and Lillian Sher at the Women's Hospital in Bolton Hill.

It participated in the National Soccer League from the 1995/96 season until the end of the 2000/01 season, after which it folded, primarily due to financial difficulties. Throughout their tenure in the NSL, the club failed to attract supporters and had limited on-field success. == History  A new club === The Cosmos were founded in 1995 as a new franchise for entry into the 1995/96 NSL season. The club arose as a ‚Äòcommunity model‚Äô consortium with shares held by ACT Soccer Federation and a number of local clubs, with some support from the ACT Government. Canberra finished respectably in their first season for a new club. In finishing ninth, they performed better than much more experienced teams Wollongong, Newcastle Breakers and Gippsland Falcons. Much of the credit could be given to experienced Socceroo captain Paul Wade. But 1995‚Äì96 also saw the revelation of talented Canberra-based youngsters Michael Musitano and Alex Castro, who were accordingly snapped up by other clubs in the 1996 off-season. === Wooden Spoons === Canberra's second season was much more forgettable however. In finishing last, the club ended the season 16 points behind second-last placed team. Despite a dreary end to the season, a positive action would revive the club in 1997 as computing company Novell came on board with a stunningly large sponsorship deal. This allowed the Cosmos to recruit the 1996‚Äì97 coach of the year Branko Culina and after losing their best players the previous year, Canberra was a net importer of quality players for this season. New signings included Scottish defender Gordon Hunter from Hibernian, Sydney United midfielder Ante Moric and the return of Michael Musitano. Unfortunately, this did not translate into on-field performance, winning only once in the first thirteen games ‚Äì a run including an 8‚Äì0 loss to Wollongong ‚Äì and only three times in the season (including a record 8‚Äì1 win over UTS). The Cosmos finished the 1997‚Äì98 season bottom of the table again which saw the departure of Culina and appointment of former Socceroos coach Rale Rasic. New signings for 1998‚Äì99 including Melbourne Knights goalkeeper Vilson Knezevic brought hope, but a winless start to the season for Rasic's young side escalated tensions with the board and Rale departed seven weeks into the new season. The Cosmos continued to struggle in the national competition, finishing last for the third year in a row, ten points behind the second-last team. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw some on-field improvement by the club achieving nine wins and nine draws. However, the Cosmos remained unstable financially, and administrators were appointed on 30 June 2000 to oversee the club's financial position. In a time of general turmoil for the NSL, the 2000‚Äì01 season was reasonably successful for Canberra, finishing a respectable 11th place and remaining competitive throughout the year with eleven wins and four draws. === Exclusion === Soccer Australia determined in mid-2000 that it would review the NSL for the 2001‚Äì02 season, proposing to reduce the number of teams from 16 to 12. Carlton and Eastern Pride folded during the season, and Soccer Australia determined in June 2001 that Canberra Cosmos was not a 'going concern', excluding them from the league along with Brisbane Strikers. Appeals by and on behalf of the ejected clubs followed seeking a reversal of the decision, criticising the process and criteria used. Eventually the Soccer Australia board, under pressure from stakeholders and political figures agreed to ‚Äúre-admit‚Äù Canberra and Brisbane to the NSL for the 2001/2002 season. The Cosmos stepped up planning for the new season, appointing new coaching staff and even forming a partnership with English Second Division club Swindon Town. Despite looking forward, the Cosmos‚Äô financial problems remained and were unable to recover from the initial exclusion decision. After being unable to pay their NSL affiliation fee, Soccer Australia determined that Cosmos FC had not met the required conditions of entry and on 26 September 2001 terminated its right to participate in the 2001/2002 NSL season. === Statistics === {   - !Season!!Pld!!W!!D!!L!!GF!!GA!!Pts!!Table Position!!Average attendance!!Cup - !1995/96 33811144861359th of 122934 Semi-final - !1996/97 26251930691114th of 143176 First Round - !1997/98 26381529561714th of 142719 Not held - !1998/99 28432121551515th of 152337 Not held - !1999/00 34991644643614th of 162428 Not held - !2000/01 291141549553711th of 162184 Not held - } (Pld)=Games Played, (W) = Wins, (D)=Draws, (L)=Losses, (GF)=Goals For, (GA)=Goals Against, (Pts)=Points, (Cup)= NSL Cup placing == Youth system == The club had only a single 'first team' during its existence with no incorporated reserves or youth development system, owing in part to the structure of the NSL. Local players were drawn from the ACT leagues and formed a major component of the squads. While the National Youth League was in operation the ACT Academy of Sport provided the Cosmos youth side through the involvement of Soccer Canberra. The Canberran location provided a potential pathway for players from the AIS Football Squad, although no formal links were ever established. The program, aimed at developing players aged 16‚Äì17, also competed in the NYL independently. Few players graduated successfully from the ACTAS and AIS programs to the Cosmos squad. == Colours and badge == The original Canberra Cosmos logo for the 1995/96 season. In their inaugural season, the Cosmos played in predominantly dark blue shirts and dark blue shorts, colours reflecting the original ‚Äòshooting star‚Äô logo, provided through sportswear manufacturer Asics. The alternate strip was a white shirt and shorts, also with large stars in the trim. A yellow alternate strip with black shorts was later introduced. For the 97/98 season, the away colours of a white shirt with blue trim became the home colours, giving more prominence to the sponsor. For the 1998/99 season, the club emblem was revised to a circle and star design. The home strip colours were changed to red shirt and shorts with a new change strip of yellow shirt and shorts, now manufactured under a new clothing deal with Admiral Sportswear. The logo featured a blue star over a gold circle, which was later revised to a black star over a red circle to closer reflect the new red home strip. For the 2000/01 season which was to be their last due to the Soccer Australia management turmoil had unveiled a new logo for the 2001/02 season. While there was no further information on possible change in shirt colours the new logo featured black, orange and white. == Stadium == The Cosmos home ground was Canberra Stadium. During major renovations to the stadium in 1997, home games were played at Seiffert Oval in Queanbeyan. A small number of games were also played on AIS grounds. == Supporters == The Cosmos failed to attract significant support within the Canberra community which was reflected in poor attendances at games. A small but loyal group of fans formed Cosmos FC Supporters Group and were particularly active in promoting the game to the Canberra community. The group were consistently in attendance at home games and often travelled to away fixtures, particularly matches against the seven clubs located in New South Wales. The official Canberra Cosmos mascot known as ‚ÄòCosmo‚Äô appeared at most home games throughout the club's tenure. Adorned in a blue white and silver helmet and jumpsuit, Cosmo would ride a unicycle, juggle and entertain the crowd from the sideline and during pre-game and halftime, notably being sent to the stands by the referee during one game for allegedly inciting the crowd to violence. == Notable former players == Below is a list of players who have represented Canberra Cosmos in the NSL and who have at least one senior or junior international cap for a FIFA sanctioned national team. { class=\\"sortable \\" + FFFFFF;\\" Canberra Cosmos Notable Former Players - !

She was by Herbager out of Sweet Tooth (by On-and-On). This made her a half sister to the brilliant colt Alydar, who gained fame for his rivalry with the 1978 Triple Crown winner, Affirmed. Our Mims was named after Melinda Markey, the daughter of Rear Admiral Gene Markey, second husband of Calumet Farm owner Lucille Markey. Alydar and Our Mims were both owned by Calumet and trained by John M. Veitch. ==Racing career== Our Mims lost each of her seven starts as a two-year-old. When she was three, Veitch entered her in an allowance at Florida's Hialeah Park, which she won. Then she won the Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Park, the Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont Park (at which Melinda Bena [nee Markey] was present to accept the winner's trophy on behalf of Calumet Farm), the prestigious Alabama Stakes at the Saratoga Race Course, and the Delaware Handicap at Delaware Park. Our Mims' performances earned her the Eclipse Award for the champion three-year-old filly. During this season, CBS sportscaster, Jimmy the Greek commented that \\"the only horse that could beat 1977 Kentucky Derby champion Seattle Slew was Calumet Farm's Our Mims.\\" At the end of her racing career of 18 starts, she had six wins, placed in six starts, and was third once. She earned $368,034. ==Broodmare== The foals of Our Mims did not do much on the track, but they were superior producers. Our Mims' first foal, Heavenly Blue by Raise a Native, produced Play On and On, who was the dam of several stakes winners, including Continuously, sent to England and then on to California to win a major race there. Her third foal was Mimbet, the dam of the 1997 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner, Elmhurst. Our Mims came up barren when she turned twenty-one. Attempts to breed her for the next five years brought fruitless results. The champion was left in a cattle field to fend for herself. She ate whatever she could find in the field with no protection from the weather and no vet care. ==Rescue== Our Mims was saved by a woman named Jeanne Mirabito, who found her and brought her food. Two years later, after continued personal care of the mare, Mirabito convinced the owners to donate the ailing old horse to a local horse rescue, and Jeanne adopted Our Mims from that rescue. Our Mims lived in comfort until her death on December 9, 2003, at the age of twenty-nine. She is buried at Calumet's equine cemetery, the first horse buried in the cemetery who was not owned by the farm.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8453367 Our Mims final resting place In tribute to the horse, Jeanne Mirabito created Our Mims Retirement Haven,http://www.ourmims.org/ Our Mims Retirement Haven a rescue farm specializing in the care of retired Thoroughbred broodmares, on her farm in Paris, KY. With the creed, \\"Specializing in restoring health and spirit in aged mares,\\" OMRH's first mare was Our Mims' half-sister, Sugar and Spice.

His official title was, \\"Secretary of the First Ward.\\" FBI agent William Roemer believed Marcy to be a made man in the Chicago Outfit when Roemer testified before the U.S. Senate in 1983. ==Background== Marcy was born in Chicago, Illinois on September 6, 1913 to an Italian American family. His name was originally Pasqualino Marciano until he formally changed it. He and Tony Accardo both worked for Al Capone. Marciano was a gunman for the original Capone gang. He became the head of the first ward which controlled everything from the governor on down. ==The First Ward== Marcy ran Chicago's old 1st Ward which encompassed Chicago's Downtown. Alderman Fred Roti and Democratic Committeeman John D'Arco, Sr., both of whom also had close ties to the Chicago Outfit, took their direct orders from Marcy. Marcy regularly met with the mob's main enforcers at Counselor's Row restaurant, across the street from Chicago City Hall. ==The FBI== Beginning in the 1950s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation tried for over three decades to bring down Marcy and his associates. According to former FBI agent William F. Roemer, Jr., their tactics included illegally bugging the First Ward's Headquarters at 100 North LaSalle Street in 1962. Although the bug, dubbed \\"Shade,\\" revealed a great deal about the activities of the First Ward's political machine, nothing could be used in court. ==The sting== Finally, in the mid 1980s, criminal defense attorney and longtime First Ward associate Robert Cooley secretly approached Federal prosecutors. He declared, \\"I want to help you destroy the First Ward. I want to help you destroy Pat Marcy.\\" Cooley proceeded to wear a wire while meeting with Marcy and several other First Ward members, including D'Arco and Roti, implicating them in numerous acts of corruption, including fixing trials on the Outfit's behalf. According to Cooley, Marcy had influence in Cook County politics, job appointments in law enforcement, and court decisions. During the same period, Michael Corbitt, the imprisoned former police chief of Willow Springs, Illinois, began cooperating with federal prosecutors. According to Corbitt, Marcy was so trusted by the Outfit that the money skimmed from casinos in Central America and Las Vegas was delivered directly to him. ==Imprisonment and death== As a result of these investigations, Marcy was indicted (91 CR 1045) with one count of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), six counts of bribery, and six counts of extortion. Marcy died during the trial, in March 1993. ==References== * William F.

A series of surgeries at a young age complicated this, leaving him blind in his right eye, and weakened in his left.Chicago Antisocial article in Chicago Reader Counts was initially located in Austin, Texas. In the 1990s, Counts became notorious with his prank phone calls to the Austin Community Access Center, in particular Alex Jones's show. An incident occurred - though with varying claims from both sidesAustin Chronicle: Alex Jones: Conspiracy Victim or Evil Mastermind? World Independent News Group: Alex Jones-FBI Connection \\\\- in which Counts was involved in the assault of Jones in a parking lot with three other individuals. As a follow- up, it was claimed that Jones used FBI connections to label Counts a terrorist and claimed he possessed child pornography. Federal agents raided the FringeWare Review bookstore, headquarters of an early cyberculture magazine that Counts wrote articles for. The case was later dropped. In 2000, Counts relocated to Chicago. Whilst there, he met Neil Keener, who would later join Counts in the band Bull of Heaven. == DJ work == In the 2000s, Counts worked as a DJ to afford a living. He worked at various clubs, including Lava, Whiskey Sky, Reserve, Darkroom, the Allstate Arena, as well as performing at private functions. In July 2005, Counts was again involved in an incident - this time the alleged battery of a bouncer at the Lava club. There are two sides to this story;Chicago Antisocial article in Chicago Reader Counts claims that he was told the set he was playing was \\"too loud\\" by club owner Brian Sarpalius (aka Phantom 45), who then subsequently interfered with and eventually unplugged Counts' equipment prior to having him removed by a bouncer. Sarpalius claims that it was actually Counts who caused a scene, and damaged the club's equipment. Counts allegedly discharged a can of mace at the bouncer's feet as a warning shot, though the stories of this differ from both sides. Later in the night, Counts was arrested, and his equipment was lost for several days whilst it was in possession of another club-goer the night of the incident. Counts had been DJing at the Lava club for four years prior to Sarpalius becoming the new owner, and this incident ending his shows there. The charges against Counts were dropped after a lengthy court case. == Musical career == In September 2006, Counts gained notoriety when he created a mash-up of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds with The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, aptly titled Sgt. Petsound's Lonely Hearts Club Band and credited to the band The Beachles. The mash-up album was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds, and was favoured by various sites.Entertainment Weekly PopWatch: Meet the BeachlesBoingBoing: Beachles - Noise Mashup of Beatles and Beach Boys This popularity reached EMI, who in turn issued Counts a cease and desist notice,Cease and Desist email sent to Counts demanded the IP addresses of everyone who downloaded it through his blog, and attempted to sue him for upwards of $30 mil.Rolling Stone: The Music‚Äôs Over For Pet Sounds/Sgt.

Under the leadership of Zarni, then a graduate student at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, it galvanized principally American students, attracted much media attention, and helped force over forty multinational corporations to withdraw from Burma, including ARCO, PepsiCo, and Texaco. The Free Burma Coalition became one of the largest and most effective human rights campaigns in the world, linking groups and individuals across many countries at its height. It used the boycott of Pepsi to highlight corporate complicity in human rights abuses by the military regime in Burma. On April 26, 1996, USA Today published a cover story about the Free Burma Coalition with a front page picture of Zarni. From 1995 to 1997, the Free Burma Coalition took over the leadership of the existing boycott of Pepsi. Free Burma Coalition activists ramped up the pressure on PepsiCo until 1997 when the company completely severed its remaining business ties in Burma. The Free Burma Coalition also campaigned successfully for the withdrawal of over forty corporations from Burma, including many apparel companies and several oil companies, such as ARCO, Unocal, and Texaco. In 2003, Zarni started to express publicly his growing disillusionment with Aung San Suu Kyi's leadership and her policy of sanctions and boycotts. He also attacked what he viewed as the \\"self-serving ways\\" of many of his former fellow activists in the Free Burma Coalition and the movement in general. Newspapers inside Burma documented that Zarni had met with members of the military junta during this time. Because, even prior to his perceived coziness with the military and USDP (the political party of the military), Zarni had been regarded by the core network of democracy activists inside Burma as largely an opportunistic fraud, who had not even been in Burma during the 1998 protests, it led to strained relationships between Zarni and other activists. It was unclear whether Zarni expressed his supposed disillusionment of Aung San Suu Kyi's policy only after he was largely ostracized by democracy activists inside the country. It is also unclear whether his meetings with the military fed into his change of heart about sanctions and what relationship he continues to have with the military and its main political party. Zarni and a group of Western-educated Burmese dissidents explored alternatives to what they termed as \\"the sanctions and boycott orthodoxy.\\" In 2003, Zarni switched his position and started to claim that economic sanctions and political pressure by Western countries on Burma was counter-productive and futile as long as China, India, Thailand and other Asian countries continued to do business with and provide political support to the ruling regime. Following Zarni's change in policy, the staff and virtually all the group's supporters and funders left the Free Burma Coalition and founded the U.S. Campaign for Burma, which maintains the Free Burma Coalition's mission and policies. More recently, Zarni has recreated himself as an activist, who is the leading voice on social media, in the various transnational campaigns and movements, which claim to advocate for the Rohingya. He has, once again, switched his position, and now advocates for new sanctions to be placed on Burma. The Free Burma Coalition is now largely moribund, with Zarni as the organization's sole spokesperson. Moreover, Zarni now advocates to have Aung San Suu Kyi and other democracy activists inside the country be put on trial in international criminal court for crimes against humanity against the Rohingya. The same individuals and groups that he advocated to \\"free\\" previously are now, in his opinion, \\"genocidal\\", and deserving of being imprisoned. ==External links== *Free Burma Coalition Category:Burmese democracy movements ","title":"Free Burma Coalition"},{"id":"7462448","text":"State Highway 147 (SH 147) is a state highway that runs from Zavalla north near to Shelbyville in Deep East Texas.

It began its existence as Madras Legislative Council, the first provincial legislature for Madras Presidency. It was initially created as an advisory body in 1861, by the British colonial government. It was established by the first Indian Council Act of 1861, enacted in the British parliament in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Its role and strength were later expanded by the second Council Act of 1892. Limited election was introduced in 1909. The Council became a unicameral legislative body in 1921 and eventually the upper chamber of a bicameral legislature in 1937. After India became independent in 1947, it continued to be the upper chamber of the legislature of Madras State, one of the successor states to the Madras Presidency. It was renamed as the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council when the state was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. The Council was abolished by the M. G. Ramachandran administration on 1 November 1986. In 2010 the DMK regime headed by M. Karunanidhi tried to revive the Council. The current AIADMK regime has expressed its intention not to revive the council and has passed a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in this regard. ==History and evolutionOrigin=== The first Indian Councils Act of 1861 set up the Madras Legislative Council as an advisory body through which the colonial administration obtained advice and assistance. The Act empowered the provincial Governor to nominate four non-English Indian members to the council for the first time. Under the Act, the nominated members were allowed to move their own bills and vote on bills introduced in the council. However, they were not allowed to question the executive, move resolutions or examine the budget. Also they could not interfere with the laws passed by the Central Legislature. The Governor was also the president of the Council and he had complete authority over when, where and how long to convene the Council and what to discuss. Two members of his Executive Council and the Advocate-General of Madras were also allowed to participate and vote in the Council. The Indians nominated under this Act were mostly zamindars and ryotwari landowners, who often benefited from their association with the colonial government. Supportive members were often re-nominated for several terms. G. N. Ganapathy Rao was nominated eight times, Humayun Jah Bahadur was a member for 23 years, T. Rama Rao and P. Chentsal Rao were members for six years each. Other prominent members during the period included V. Bhashyam Aiyangar, S. Subramania Iyer and C. Sankaran Nair. The Council met infrequently and in some years (1874 and 1892) was not convened even once. The maximum of number of times it met in a year was eighteen. The Governor preferred to convene the Council at his summer retreat Udagamandalam, much to the displeasure of the Indian members. The few times when the Council met, it was for only a few hours with bills and resolutions being rushed through. ===Expansion=== {  style=\\"float:left; margin-right:1em\\" + Council meetings during 1891-1909 !E9E9E9\\" align=center valign=topYears !E9E9E9\\" align=centerNo of Days - align=left 1906 align=center 2 - align=left 1897,1901 align=center 3 - align=left 1894,1907 align=center 4 - align=left 1896,1898,1909 align=center 5 - align=left 1899, 1902, 1903, 1904 align=center 6 - align=left 1900 align=center 7 - align=left 1895,1905 align=center 8 - align=left 1893 align=center 9 } In 1892, the role of the Council was expanded by the Indian Councils Act of 1892. The Act increased the number of additional members of the Council to a maximum of 20, of whom not more than nine had to be officials. The Act introduced the method of election for the Council, but did not mention word \\"election\\" explicitly. The elected members were officially called as \\"nominated\\" members and their method of election was described as \\"recommendation\\". Such \\"recommendations\\" were made by district boards, universities, municipalities and other associations. The term of the members was fixed at two years. The Council could also discuss the annual financial statement and ask questions subject to certain limitations. Thirty eight Indian members were \\"nominated\\" in the eight elections during 1893-1909 when this Act was in effect. C. Jambulingam Mudaliar, N. Subba Rao Pantulu, P. Kesava Pillai and C. Vijayaraghavachariar representing southern group of district boards, Kruthiventi Perraju Pantulu of the northern group of municipalities, C. Sankaran Nair and P. Rangaiah Naidu from the Corporation of Madras and P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer and M. Krishnan Nair from the University of Madras were some of the active members. However, over a period of time, representation by Indian members dwindled, for example, the position of Bashyam Iyengar and Sankaran Nayar in 1902 was occupied by Acworth and Sir George Moore. The council did not meet more than 9 days in a year during the time the Act was in effect. ===Further expansion=== {  style=\\"float:right; margin-left:1em\\" + Constituencies that elected members (1909‚Äì19) !E9E9E9\\" align=center valign=topConstituency !E9E9E9\\" align=centerNo of Members - align=left District boards and Municipalities align=center 10 - align=left University of Madras align=center 1 - align=left South India Chamber of Commerce align=center 1 - align=left Madras Traders Association align=center 1 - align=left Zamindars align=center 2 - align=left Large landholders align=center 3 - align=left Muslims align=center 2 - align=left Planters align=center 1 } The Indian Councils Act 1909 (popularly called as \\"Minto-Morley Reforms\\"), officially introduced the method of electing members to the Council. But it did not provide for direct election of the members. It abolished automatic official (executive) majorities in the Council and gave its members the power to move resolutions upon matters of general public interest and the budget and also to ask supplementary questions. There were a total of 21 elected members and 21 nominated members. The Act allowed up to 16 nominated members to be official and the remaining five were required to be non-officials. The Governor was also authorised to nominate two experts whenever necessary. As before, the Governor, his two executive council members and the Advocate-General were also members of the Council. P. Kesava Pillai, A. S. Krishna Rao, N. Krishnaswami Iyengar, B. N. Sarma, B. V. Narasimha Iyer, K. Perraju Pantulu, T. V. Seshagiri Iyer, P. Siva Rao, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, P. Theagaraya Chetty and Yakub Hasan Sait were among the active members. ===Diarchy (1920-37)=== Based on the recommendations of the Montague-Chelmsford report, the Government of India Act of 1919 was enacted. The Act enlarged the provincial legislative councils and increased the strength of elected members to be greater than that of nominated and official members. It introduced a system of dyarchy in the Provinces. Although this Act brought about representative Government in India, the Governor was empowered with overriding powers. It classified the subjects as belonging to either the Centre or the Provinces. The Governor General could override any law passed by the Provincial councils. It brought about the concept of \\"Partial Responsible Government\\" in the provinces. Provincial subjects were divided into two categories - reserved and transferred. Education, Sanitation, Local self-government, Agriculture and Industries were listed as the transferred subjects. Law, Finance, Revenue and Home affairs were the reserved subjects. The provincial council could decide the budget in so far it related to the transferred subjects. Executive machinery dealing with those subjects was placed under the direct control of provincial legislature. However, the provincial legislature and the ministers did not have any control over the reserved subjects, which came under the Governor and his Executive council. {  style=\\"float:right; margin- left:1em\\" + Councils under dyarchy !E9E9E9\\" align=center valign=topCouncil !E9E9E9\\" align=centerTerm - First 17 December 1920 ‚Äì 11 September 1923 - Second 26 November 1923 ‚Äì 7 November 1926 - Third November 1926 - October 1930 - Fourth October 1930 - November 1934 - Fifth November 1934 - January 1937 } The Council had a total of 127 members in addition to the ex - officio members of the Governor's Executive Council. Out of the 127, 98 were elected from 61 constituencies of the presidency. The constituencies comprised three arbitrary divisions - 1)communal constituencies such as non-Muhammadan urban, non-Muhammadan rural, non-Brahman urban, Mohamaddan urban, Mohamaddan rural, Indian Christian, European and Anglo-Indian 2)special constituencies such as landholders, Universities, planters and trade associations (South India Chamber of Commerce & Nattukottai Nagarathar Association) and 3) territorial constituencies. 28 of the constituencies were reserved for non-Brahmans. 29 members were nominated, out of whom a maximum of 19 would be government officials, 5 would represent the Paraiyar, Pallar, Valluvar, Mala, Madiga, Sakkiliar, Thottiyar, Cheruman and Holeya communities and 1 would represent the \\"backward tracts\\". Including the Executive Council members, the total strength of the legislature was 134. The first election for the Madras Legislative Council, under this Act was held in November 1920. The first sitting of the Council was inaugurated by the Duke of Connaught on 12 January 1921. In total, five such councils were constituted (in 1920, 23, 26, 30 and 34). The term of the councils was three years (except for the fourth council which was extended for a year in expectation of abolition of dyarchy ). While the first, second and fourth Councils were controlled by Justice Party majorities, the third Council was characterised by a fractured verdict and an independent ministry. The fifth council also saw a fractured verdict and a minority Justice government. ===Provincial autonomy (1937-50)=== {  style=\\"float:right; margin-left:1em\\" + Breakdown of seats !E9E9E9\\" align=center valign=topGroup !E9E9E9\\" align=centerSeats - General 35 - Mohammadans (Muslims) 7 - Indian Christians 3 - Europeans 1 - Nominated by Governor 8-10 - Total 54-56 } The Government of India Act of 1935 abolished dyarchy and ensured provincial autonomy. It created a bicameral legislature in the Madras province. The Legislature consisted of the Governor and two Legislative bodies - a Legislative Assembly and a Legislative Council. The Assembly consisted of 215 members, who were further classified into general members and reserved members representing special communities and interests. The Council consisted of a minimum of 54 and a maximum of 56 members. It was a permanent body not subject to dissolution by the Governor and one-third of its members retired every three years. 46 of its members were elected directly by the electorate while the Governor could nominate 8 to 10 members. Similar to the council, the electable members were further classified into general and reserved members. Specific number of seats were reserved (allocated) to various religious and ethnic groups. The Act provided for a limited adult franchise based on property qualifications. Seven million people, roughly 15% of the Madras people holding land or paying urban taxes were qualified to be the electorate. Under this Act, two councils were constituted - the first in 1937 and the second in 1946. Both Councils were controlled by Congress majorities. ===In Republic of India (1950-86)=== After India became independent in 1947 and the Indian Constitution was adopted in 1950, the Legislative Council continued to be the upper chamber of the legislature of the Madras State - the successor to Madras Presidency. It continued to be called as the \\"Madras Legislative Council\\". The Council was a permanent body and was not subject to dissolution. The length of a member's term was six years and one-third of the members retired every two years. The strength of the Council was not less than 40 or more than one-third of the strength of the Assembly. The following table illustrates how the members of Council were selected: {  - ! Proportion !

They were supposed to have excelled in fields like arts, science, literature, cooperative movement or social service -  One-third (1/3rd)  Elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly by proportional representation using the Single Transferable Vote System -  One-third (1/3rd)  Elected by the members of local self governmental bodies like corporations, municipalities and district boards. -  One-twelfth (1/12th)  Elected by an electorate consisting of electors who have held Graduate degrees for a minimum of three years -  One-twelfth (1/12th)  Elected by an electorate consisting of teachers of secondary schools, colleges and universities with a minimum experience of three years } The actual strength of the council varied from time to time. During 1952‚Äì53, it had a strength of 72. After the formation of Andhra state on 1 October 1953, its strength came down to 51. In 1956 it decreased to 50 and the next year increased again to 63 - where it remained till the council's abolition. Of those 63, local bodies and the assembly elected 21 each, the teachers and graduates elected 6 each and the remaining 9 were nominated. The Council could not pass legislation on its own - it had to approve or disapprove the laws passed by the Assembly. In case of conflict between the Council and the Assembly, the will of the later would prevail. When Madras state was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1968, the name of the council also changed to \\"Tamil Nadu Legislative Council\\". ==Abolition== The legislative council was abolished in 1986 by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government of M. G. Ramachandran (MGR) . MGR had nominated a Tamil film actress, Vennira Aadai Nirmala (aka A. B. Shanthi) to the Council. Her swearing in ceremony was scheduled for 23 April 1986. Nirmala had earlier declared insolvency and according to Article 102-(1)(c) of the Indian Constitution, an insolvent person can not serve as a member of parliament or state legislature. On 21 April, a lawyer named S. K. Sundaram, filed a public interest writ petition in the Madras High Court challenging Nirmala's nomination to the Council. MGR loaned Nirmala a sum of Rupees 4,65,000 from ADMK's party funds to pay off her creditors, so that her insolvency declaration could be annulled. The same day, Nirmala's lawyer Subramaniam Pichai, was able to persuade judge Ramalingam to set aside her insolvency. He used a provision in the Section 31 of The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act of 1909, which allowed a judge to annul an insolvency retrospectively if all debts had been paid in full. This annulment made Nirmala's nomination valid and the writ petition against it was dismissed. However, Nirmala withdrew her nomination to the council. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Sundar Lal Khurana asked MGR to explain how Nirmala's nomination was proposed without proper vetting. Miffed with this incident, MGR decided to abolish the council. On 14 May, a resolution seeking to abolish the council was moved successfully in the legislative assembly. The Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Abolition) Bill, 1986 was passed by both houses of the Parliament and received the assent of the president on 30 August 1986. The Act came into force on 1 November 1986 and the council was abolished. ==Revival attempt== The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has so far made three unsuccessful attempts to revive the council. Revival of the Legislative Council was one of the promises included in the election manifesto of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the 2006 Assembly elections. The DMK won the 2006 assembly election and M. Karunanidhi became Chief minister. In his inaugural address to the 13th Legislative Assembly delivered on 24 May 2006, Governor Surjit Singh Barnala said steps will be taken to move the necessary constitutional amendments for reviving the council. On 12 April 2010, the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution seeking to revive the Council. The DMK's earlier attempts to revive the council, when it was in power during 1989‚Äì91 and 1996-2001 were not successful, as it did not possess both the two-thirds majority in the Legislative Assembly and a friendly union government necessary for it to be done. On both occasions, the ADMK governments that followed the DMK governments passed counter resolutions to rescind them (in October 1991 and July 2001 respectively). The Tamil Nadu Legislative Council Bill, 2010 was approved by the Indian cabinet on 4 May 2010 and was passed by both the houses of the Indian Parliament. Constituencies for the new house were identified in September 2010.Delimitation of Council Constituencies (Tamil Nadu), Order 2010 Work on preparation of electoral rolls for them began on October 2010 and was completed by January 2011. However, in February 2011, the Supreme Court of India stayed the elections to the new council, till the petitions challenging its revival could be heard. In the 2011 Assembly elections, the AIADMK came out with a sweeping majority. The AIADMK government headed by J.Jayalalitha expressed its intention not to revive the council. The government once again passed a counter resolution to withdraw the attempt to revive the council. ==Location== Fort St. George where the Tamil Nadu Legislature functioned for 60 years Senate House, Madras University Fort St. George has historically been the seat of the Government of Tamil Nadu since colonial times. During 1921‚Äì37, the Madras Legislative Council met at the council chambers within the fort. Between 14 July 1937 ‚Äì 21 December 1938, the assembly met at the Senate House of the University of Madras and between 27 January 1938 - 26 October 1939 in the Banqueting Hall (later renamed as Rajaji Hall) in the Government Estate complex at Mount Road. During 1946‚Äì52, it moved back to the Fort St. George. In 1952, the strength of the assembly rose to 375, after the constitution of the first legislative assembly, and it was briefly moved into temporary premises at the government estate complex. This move was made in March 1952, as the existing assembly building only had a seating capacity of 260. Then on 3 May 1952, it moved into the newly constructed assembly building in the same complex. The legislature functioned from the new building (later renamed as Kalaivanar Arangam during 1952‚Äì56. However, with the reorganisation of states and formation of Andhra, the strength came down to 190 and the legislature moved back to Fort St. George in 1956. From December 1956 till January 2010, the Fort remained the home to the legislature . In 2004, during the 12th assembly, the ADMK Government under J. Jayalalitha made unsuccessful attempts to shift the assembly (the council had been abolished by then), first to the location of Queen Mary's College and later to the Anna University campus, Guindy. Both attempts were withdrawn after public opposition. During the 13th Assembly, the DMK government led by M. Karunanidhi proposed a new plan to shift the assembly and the government secretariat to the a new building in the Omandurar Government Estate. In 2007, the German architectural firm GMP International won the design competition to design and construct the new assembly complex. Construction began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. The assembly functioned in the new assembly building during March 2010 - May 2011. In May 2011, the Tamil Nadu legislature was moved back to Fort St. George. List of historical locations where the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council has been housed: {  !Duration !Location - 1921‚Äì1937 Council chambers, Fort St. George - 14 July 1937 ‚Äì 21 December 1938 Senate House, Madras University Campus, Chepauk - 27 January 1938 ‚Äì 26 October 1939 Banqueting Hall (Rajaji Hall), Government Estate (Omandurar Estate), Mount Road - 24 May 1946 ‚Äì 27 March 1952 Council chambers, Fort St. George - 3 May 1952 ‚Äì 27 December 1956 Kalaivanar Arangam, Government Estate (Omandurar Estate) - 29 April 1957 ‚Äì 30 March 1959 Assembly Hall, Fort St. George - 20‚Äì30 April 1959 Aranmore Palace, Udhagamandalam (Ooty) - 31 August 1959 - 1 November 1986 Assembly Hall, Fort St. George } ==Chief Ministers from the Council== During its existence as the upper chamber of Tamil Nadu Legislature, the Council has been used twice to appoint non-members of the legislatures as Chief Minister. The first time this happened was in 1952, when C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) was nominated by Governor Sri Prakasa to the Council so that Rajaji could become chief minister. The second time was in 1967 when C. N. Annadurai became the chief minister first and then got himself elected to the Council. ==Presiding Officers== During 1861‚Äì1937, the presiding officer of the Madras Legislative Council was known as the \\"President of the Council\\". From its establishment in 1861 till dyarchy was introduced in 1921, the Governor of Madras was also the President of the Council. After dyarchy introduced, the first and second council presidents, Perungavalur Rajagopalachari and L. D. Swamikannu Pillai, were appointed by the Governor himself. The presidents who came after them were chosen by the Council itself. During 1937‚Äì86, the presiding officer was called as the \\"Chairman of the Council\\".

The southern part of the mountain range forms the easternmost part of the Namib-Naukluft National Park. The northern mountains are occupied by privately held farms. They are known for their wildlife, including mountain zebras and leopards. The mountains have many small streams and waterfalls. ==Geology== The Naukluft Mountains are a nappe complex: a stack of rock units which have been transported toward the southeast on a basal thrust fault. The first geological maps and cross sections of the mountain range were made in the 1930s by Henno Martin and Hermann Korn. The rocks are interbedded sediments, dominated by dolomites, quartzites and shales, deposited in a shallow marine environment in the hinterland of the Damara Orogeny between 700-500 million years ago. The sediments are equivalent in age to the Otavi Mountainlands sediments where evidence for snowball earth climates was described by Paul F. Hoffman. The same lithologies are present in the Naukluft Mountains, but the sediments are folded and faulted so the original stratigraphy is deformed and inverted. The mountain range has been the site of numerous studies seeking to explain the mechanical paradox of overthrusts: how large thin units of rock may be pushed long distances over gently dipping thrust faults. The main basal thrust fault beneath the klippe which forms the mountain range contains an unusual polymineralic granular rock which has been described by some authors as an injected evaporite,Behr and Schmidt-Mumm (1987) The role of sedimentary and tectonic brines in the Damara Orogen, Namibia, Applied Geochemistry v. 2, n. 5-6, 535-542 and by others as a fault rock formed by alteration during earthquake slip.Rowe, Fagereng, Miller and Mapani (2012) Signature of coseismic decarbonation in dolomitic fault rocks of the Naukluft Thrust, Namibia.

The railway hosts a range of scale locomotive which includes an LNER Flying Scotsman and others. The railway has their own engine shed which has a workshop at the back of it. Just outside the engine shed there is a traverser to move the engine. There is also a drop-down pit so the engines can be inspected underneath. The old engine shed has now been converted to the railway's carriage shed. The railway has two stations, Stopham Road Station (where most people will start their journey) and Hardham Halt which is used during gala days and during Christmas as the North Pole. 2020 is the railway's 20th year of operating in its current location and they are hosting a 20th Gala Weekend which will most likely host visiting engines plus special attractions that are yet to be announced by the railway. The railway have announced that this gala weekend will happen in August. The railway has developed a lot since they first opened including a new expansion, new engine shed, new workshop plus a new station (Hardham Halt). ==Route== The railway has two stations: Stopham Road which is the main station, with passenger facilities including the ticket office; and Hardham Halt which is an intermediate station at which trains call during Christmas Services, galas, and other special events. ==Locomotives== The three principal locomotives were all constructed for the line by Exmoor Steam Railway. All three are of the wheel arrangement and built to narrow gauge outline proportions. They are: *Pulborough - 0-4-2 steam locomotive, built 2004, works number 319; *Peggy - 0-4-2 steam locomotive, built 2007, works number 334; *Arun - 0-4-2 diesel hydraulic, built 2015, works number 341. Additionally, several scale-outline steam locomotives (including scale model LNER Flying Scotsman and LMS Mogul engines) are on-site, and may be seen in operation on busy days and for gala events. ==Rolling stock== The railway hosts a range of passenger rolling stock and the railway hosts a scale freight train which can be seen during most of their events. Their passenger rolling stock consists of three different types of coaches. On a regular running day, the train usually consists of two open-top carriages, an open carriage and then, depending on the weather and the date, either a covered break coach or an open-top break coach.

However, the project was cancelled in 1973. In the late 1980s, the expressway portion of Route 3 was extended to terminate at Route 2.

He won the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2003 and 2005, the Tingle Creek Chase in 2003 and 2004 and the Arkle Challenge Trophy in 2002. ==Background== Moscow Flyer was a bay horse with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Edward Joyce. He was sired by Moscow Society, a son of Nijinsky who showed good form in a brief racing career before becoming a successful National Hunt stallion. He was trained by Jessica Harrington, and ridden in most of his races by Barry Geraghty. ==Racing careerEarly career=== Moscow Flyer never won a Bumper. He came third in two of his four bumpers, but never was first past the post. He was quickly changed to hurdling after the usual one season of competing in bumpers. He started off as a close to top-class hurdler. He won the 2000 December Festival Hurdle claiming the notable scalp of Istabraq who fell at the last when in contention. Moscow Flyer himself fell two out in that season's Grade 1 AIG Europe Champion Hurdle when in contention. He was entered in the 2001 Champion Hurdle but Foot and Mouth caused the Cheltenham Festival to be abandoned. ===2001/2002 season: Novice chases=== Moscow Flyer returned in the 2001/2002 season as a novice chaser. His record coming into the Arkle Challenge Trophy was mixed. He had won three races but also fallen twice. Consequently, Seebald went off as favourite. However, Moscow Flyer won easily by four lengths. That year's Champion Hurdle was won with a Racing Post Rating four below Moscow Flyer's highest rating of 170 achieved the previous April at Punchestown. ===2002/2003 season: steeplechases=== Moscow Flyer returned to the Festival for the 2003 Queen Mother Champion Chase having won four races out of five that season. In his only defeat, reigning champion Flagship Uberalles made a very bad mistake at one fence in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown. Moscow Flyer was behind him and was unable to avoid running into the back of him and unshipping Barry Geraghty. He started as a short-priced 7/4 favourite for the Champion Chase and won by 7 lengths. ===2003/2004 season=== Moscow Flyer won his first three races of the season and again was the favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He started at 5/6 while his main rival Azertyuiop was the 15/8 second favourite. His rival had won the previous season's Arkle Challenge Trophy and the race was seen as a match between the two despite the presence of Flagship Uberalles and Tiutchev. However, Moscow Flyer made a mistake four out and gave Geraghty no chance of staying on him. Azertyuiop went on to an easy victory. ===2004/2005 season=== Moscow Flyer returned the next year to try to be the first horse in many years to regain the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He retained his Tingle Creek Chase crown and broke his odd record of falling every four races. Opposing him were Azertyuiop at 2/1 and a new challenger in the previous year's Arkle Challenge Trophy winner Well Chief at 7/2. Strong betting support on the day made Moscow Flyer the 6/4 favourite. Azertyuiop made a mistake at the water jump and although he came third he was not in contention for the last half of the race. Moscow Flyer held off the challenge of Well Chief to the cheers of his fans. His subsequent win at Aintree was his seventh in a row. Moscow Flyer lost by a short-head at Punchestown to Rathgar Beau on 26 April 2005. Many thought that there was a dead heat, but the stewards awarded the race to Rathgar Beau. This horse was the first to beat Moscow Flyer when he didn't fall since Colonel Yeagar on 18 April 2001. ===2005/2006 season=== Moscow Flyer was aimed to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase for a third time. He suffered another defeat to Central House at Navan in the Fortria Chase, a defeat clear from the landing after the last, that silenced the crowd. A further defeat followed in December by Hi Cloy at Leopardstown in a race best remembered for Roger Loughran's mistake as to the whereabouts of the finishing line. Subsequently, Moscow Flyer ran in the Champion Chase, entering the field without a win that year. He went off at 5/1 and finished fifth. He was retired immediately after the race. ==Retirement== Moscow Flyer spent some time as a pin-up pony for retired racehorses in Ireland. He was in good health on a return to Sandown in 2006 for a parade before the Tingle Creek‚Äîand again before the Champion Chase at Cheltenham. In April 2007, in the closing race of the Punchestown Festival, a 2-Mile Charity Flat Race, Moscow Flyer recorded his first ever flat victory. Ridden by the Irish 18-year-old Kate Harrington, Moscow won comfortably and was giving a rousing reception in the winners' enclosure postrace. Moscow Flyer was in retirement with the Irish Horse Welfare Trust (IHWT) at their farm in Woodenbridge, Co Wicklow. He made public appearances for the Charity to help promote the work of the equine welfare charity and had many visitors throughout the year. Moscow Flyer was offered a place at the Irish National Stud in County Kildare, Ireland in spring 2012. His owner, former trainer, and staff at the IHWT decided that this was a great opportunity to afford more people a chance to see a true champion racehorse and an ambassador for equine welfare. He resided at the national stud with a number of other famous racehorses until October 2016 when his death was announced at the age of 22. ==PedigreeReferencesExternal links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Moscow Flyer Category:1994 racehorse births Category:2016 racehorse deaths Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 5 ","title":"Moscow Flyer"},{"id":"7462697","text":"thumb Chen Baozhen (; 1831-1900) was a Chinese statesman and reformer during the Qing Dynasty. Chen was born in a Hakka family in Tingzhou (Now Shanghang County). His family originated from Xiushui County in Jiangxi province. He obtained the second highest degree in the imperial examinations in 1851. During the Self-Strengthening Movement, Chen became closely associated with Zeng Guofan's efforts to rearm China. In 1895, he was appointed governor of Hunan province, where he carried out a reform program with the aid of Tan Sitong and Liang Qichao. Chen's sympathies to the Hundred Days' Reform attracted criticism from his superiors, especially Empress Dowager Cixi who distrusted reformists such as Chen Baozhen. He was dismissed from his post in 1898 after the failure of the Hundred days' Reform. Without the support of Guangxu Emperor Chen was no longer protected from conservatives' criticism. Chen died in Nanjing two years later. During his term in Hunan, Chen promoted his reform with the goal of modernizing Hunan. It was one of the first actual reform carried out in modern China. He also founded the first school in Hunan province which was known for its revolutionary ideals. During the reform, Chen appointed Liang Qichao and Tan Sitong who were active advocator of modernization. Of course, Chen's move met with the resistance from Hunan's local conservative gentries. The conservatives disdained the implementation of Western schools in Hunan and set up obstacles for reformists. In order to silence his conservative opponents, Chen enforced censorship on local news papers. However, the conservative pressure on Chen's reform eventually brought an abrupt end to the reform. Although Chen did not complete the modernization of Hunan, the younger elites of Hunan was influenced by his endeavour. By the early 20th century, Hunan had become one of the most radical reformist provinces in China. Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of China, was among the younger elites who were influenced by the Hunanese reformist ideals. Chen Baozhen's grandson Chen Yinke was an acknowledged historian of Chinese history. One of his great grandsons, Chen Fenghuai, was a pioneer of botanic studies in China. == Reference == Category:Qing dynasty politicians from Jiangxi Category:Politicians from Jiujiang Category:Chinese politicians of Hakka descent Category:1831 births Category:1900 deaths ","title":"Chen Baozhen"},{"id":"7462698","text":"The plush-crested jay (Cyanocorax chrysops) is a jay of the family Corvidae (which includes the crows and their many allies).

Four of the stations would be located underground in the downtown Winnipeg area (Memorial, Donald, Fort, City Hall/Centennial Centre). The line would require 15 trains to start. During peak (rush) hours, trains would operate every two minutes. Park and Ride facilities and feeder buses oriented towards the rapid transit stations would complement the line. It was estimated that, in 1968 dollars the subway line would cost $158 million. The precursor to the planned subway line was the Norman D. Wilson report, Future Development of the Greater Winnipeg Transit System published on March 4, 1959. === Surface bus === The W.A.T.S. report projected the need for 650 buses with a daily ridership of 285,000 by 1991. ==Aftermath== A $330,000 preliminary engineering study for the Sherbrook-McGregor Overpass was budget for in January 1969, the same month the W.A.T.S. study Volume 3 Recommendations were released. Plans to construct the first segment of the W.A.T.S. freeway, the Sherbrook-McGregor Overpass, were continually delayed during the 1970s as the City studied the option of having the CP railyards moved. In 1979 it was estimated to cost about the same to relocate the CP railyards, C33.7 million, as it would be to construct three projects Sherbrook-McGregor Overpass, replace the Arlington Bridge, and upgrade the Salter Street Bridge at C$32.5 million. In 1980-81 city transportation planners tried unsuccessfully to add the Northern Freeway to the city's five year Capital Budget. The Northern Freeway was to connect Sherbrook St. with McGregor St., creating the Sherbrook-McGregor Overpass. However, Sr. McNamara of the Rossbrook House opposed this and City Council ultimately voted against it. Instead, Winnipeg Transit purchased feeder buses built by Orion Bus Industries of Ontario via the Urban Transportation Assistance Program (UTAP). The first of these buses were delivered in July 1981.

The name \\"Sossusvlei\\" is often used in an extended meaning to refer to the surrounding area (including other neighbouring vleis such as Deadvlei and other high dunes), which is one of the major visitor attractions of Namibia. The name \\"Sossusvlei\\" is of mixed origin and roughly means \\"dead-end marsh\\". Vlei is the Afrikaans word for \\"marsh\\", while \\"sossus\\" is Nama for \\"no return\\" or \\"dead end\\". Sossusvlei owes this name to the fact that it is an endorheic drainage basin (i.e., a drainage basin without outflows) for the ephemeral Tsauchab River. ==Environment== The Sossusvlei area. The Sossusvlei pan proper is the flat ellipse in a lighter shade of color seen behind the dune in foreground (mostly on its right) The Sossusvlei area belongs to a wider region of southern Namib with homogeneous features (about 32.000 km¬≤) extending between rivers Koichab and Kuiseb. This area is characterized by high sand dunes of vivid pink-to-orange color, an indication of a high concentration of iron in the sand and consequent oxidation processes. The oldest dunes are those of a more intense reddish color. These dunes are among the highest in the world; many of them are above 200 metres, the highest being the one nicknamed Big Daddy, about 325 metres high, however the highest dune in the Namib Desert, Dune 7, is about 388 metres high. Traces in the sand, left by insects and other small animals The highest and more stable dunes are partially covered with a relatively rich vegetation, which is mainly watered by a number of underground and ephemeral rivers that seasonally flood the pans, creating marshes that are locally known as vlei; when dry, these pans look almost white in color, due to the high concentration of salt. Another relevant source of water for Sossusvlei is the humidity brought by the daily morning fogs that enter the desert from the Atlantic Ocean. Fauna in the Sossusvlei area is relatively rich. It mostly comprises small animals that can survive with little water, including a number of arthropods, small reptiles and small mammalians such as rodents or jackals); bigger animals include antelopes (mainly oryxes and springboks) and ostriches. During the flood season, several migrant bird species appear along the marshes and rivers. Much of the Sossusvlei and Namib fauna is endemic and highly adapted to the specific features of the Namib. Most notably, fog beetles such as the Namib Desert Beetle have developed a technique for collecting water from early morning fogs through the bumps in their back. === Climate === The national park of Etosha has a savanna desert climate. The annual mean average temperature is 24 ¬∞C. In winter, the mean nighttime lows are around 10 ¬∞C, while in summer temperatures often hover around 40 ¬∞C. As it is a desert, there is a large variation between day and night. Rain almost never falls in the winter. ==LandmarksSesriem=== Access to the Sossusvlei area of the Namib-Naukluft National Park is from the Sesriem gate, which is located in the surroundings of the eponymous canyon. From Sesriem, a 60 km tarmac road leads to Sossusvlei proper. ===Elim Dune=== The Elim Dune is a high and relatively isolated dune located 5 km past the Sesriem gate, on a branch of the main road connecting Sesriem to Sossusvlei. The dune takes its name from a farm that used to be in the area before the National Park was established. ===Dune 45=== Dune 45 Dune 45 is so called because it lies 45 km past Sesriem on the road to Sossusvlei. It is 80 meters high and it is composed of 5-million-year-old sands. ===Sossusvlei=== Sossusvlei seen from the dunes Sossusvlei during an occasional flood Sossusvlei is about 66 km past the Sesriem gate. The last 6 km can only be traversed with 4WD vehicles as the metalled road ends and sand begins (the place where the metalled road ends is known as \\"2x4 parking\\" as any non-4WD vehicle must stop there). Sossusvlei is a clay pan, of roughly elliptical shape, covered in a crust of salt-rich sand. While the pan has been shaped over time by the Tsauchab river, the actual flooding of the pan is a relatively rare event, and sometimes several years pass between one flood and the next one. The river is dry most of the year, and even when it is not, it carries relatively little water to the vlei. The vlei is surrounded by high orange-reddish dunes, partially covered by a vegetation comprising grass, bushes, and some tree (mostly of species Acacia erioloba). ===Big Daddy=== Big Daddy is the highest dune in the Sossusvlei area, at about 325 meters. Big Daddy is located past Sossusvlei proper, near Deadvlei. It faces another very high dune known as \\"Big Mama\\". Big Daddy is distinct from Dune 7 in Namibia, near Walvis Bay. ===Deadvlei=== Deadvlei Deadvlei by air acacia trees in Deadvlei Deadvlei is another clay pan, about 2 km from Sossusvlei. A notable feature of Deadvlei is that it used to be an oasis with several acacia trees; afterwards, the river that watered the oasis changed its course. The pan is thus punctuated by blackened, dead acacia trees, in vivid contrast to the shiny white of the salty floor of the pan and the intense orange of the dunes. This creates a particularly fascinating and surrealistic landscape, that appears in innumerable pictures and has been used as a setting for films and videos. ===Hiddenvlei=== Hiddenvlei (or Hidden Vlei) is the third most famous vlei in the Sossusvlei area. It is 4 km from the 2x4 parking, and it is the least visited. ===Petrified dunes=== Petrified dunes are sand dunes that have solidified to rock and are found in several places in the Sossusvlei area. ==Tourism== Since Sossusvlei is possibly the foremost attraction of Namibia, much has been done by the Namibian authorities to support and facilitate tourism in the area. The asphalt road was built in the early 2000s (decade) to connect Sesriem and Sossusvlei's 2x4 parking is one of the very few non-urban metalled roads in Namibia. Numerous places of accommodation are found along the border of the National Park, between Sesriem and the nearest settlement, Solitaire. Recently, accommodation has been built inside the park. It is also possible to take scenic flights over the dunes, either with small planes (mainly from Swakopmund and Walvis Bay) or in hot air balloons (departing from Sesriem in the morning). ==In popular culture== As a consequence of its fascinating and surrealistic landscapes, Sossusvlei is one of the most photographed places in Subsaharan Africa. The area has been the setting of a number of commercials, music videos, and movies, especially of the fantasy genre; one of the most well-known examples is the psychological thriller The Cell (2000), where the Sossusvlei landscape is used to represent an oneiric virtual reality. The nonverbal documentary \\"Samsara\\" depends on a number of shots of the desert for subtle spiritual commentary. Other movies with scenes shot in Sossusvlei include \\"The Fall\\" and \\"Steel Dawn\\". ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * * Sossusvlei attractions * Tsauchab River and Sossus Vlei Lakebed, Namibia at the NASA Earth Observatory website * Images from Sossusvlei * Photos of Spectacular Namib Desert Sand Dunes in Sossusvlei, Namibia * Map of Sossusvlei * Visiting Sossusvlei * Picture Gallery of Sossusvlei Category:Salt pans of Namibia Category:Dunes of Namibia Category:Namib-Naukluft National Park ","title":"Sossusvlei"},{"id":"7462923","text":"Indo-Surinamese or Indian-Surinamese, are nationals of Suriname with ancestry from the Indian subcontinent. Their ancestors were Indian indentured workers brought by the Dutch and the British to the (then) Dutch colony Suriname during the 19th and 20th century. Per the 2012 Census of Suriname, 148,443 citizens of Suriname are of Indo-Surinamese origin, constituting 27.4% of the total population, making them the largest ethnic group in Suriname. == Etymology == Indo-Surinamese are also known locally by the Dutch term Hindoestanen (), derived from the word Hindustani, lit., \\"someone from Hindustan\\". Hence, when Indians migrated to Suriname they were referred to as Hindustanis, people of Indian origin. Since 1947 the official name for the ethnic group in Suriname has been Hindostanen (‚ÄúHindostanis‚Äù). As the term Hindoestanen is mostly associated with followers of Hinduism, Hindostanen also includes the Muslim and Christian followers among the Indian immigrants in Suriname. They were also known as girmityas, a term referring to the Agreements that the labourers had to sign regarding the work and the period of stay, and meaning \\"Someone with an Agreement.\\" ==History== Indian indentured labourers During the British Raj, many Indians were sent to other British colonies for work. After the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the Dutch government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers. Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 from what was then British India as indentured labourers, mostly from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and Tamil Nadu. However, among the immigrants there were also labourers from other parts of South Asia, such as Afghanistan, Nepal . The first ship transporting Indian indentured labourers, the Lalla Rookh, arrived in the Paramaribo. Newly freed slaves in Suriname who witnessed Indian workers disembarking at the harbour, reportedly stated, \\"Jobo tanbasi\\", meaning \\"The white man is still the boss\\", suggesting that they viewed the development as a continuation of the slave trade. Initially, the transport and living conditions of Indian labourers in Suriname was worse than it had been prior to the abolition of the Dutch slave trade. The British Viceroy of India described it as \\"a new system of slavery\\". In 1870s, conditions were improved greatly following the passage of new legislation to protect the Indian workers. The Government of the United Kingdom and the colonial British Government in India feared comparisons to slavery would hurt their reputation, and enacted several legislations to make transportation of Indian workers safer and improve working conditions in plantations. The Dutch government, which had signed the agreement to recruit workers with the British after long and difficult negotiations, also feared jeopardizing the arrangement and meticulously followed the regulations imposed by the British. The Dutch were also concerned that they would be accused of reviving the slave trade. In order to reduce the mortality rate among workers being transported from India, the colonial British government required the presence of at least one doctor on every ship. As regulations required the doctor to be of European-origin, the regulations also required that one Indian indentured labourer be appointed as a translator and that he would be paid for his services at the end of the journey. Other regulations mandated that every ship have distilling apparatus with a capacity to produce at least 500 litres of drinking water from seawater daily, and also required ships to have a sickbay, male and female nursing staff, adequate food and medicine, and artificial ventilation in the passengers' quarters. Another regulation prohibited any ship transporting Indian indentured labourers from setting sail between the end of March and the beginning of August. Any shipping company that violated the regulations would be prohibited from transporting contact workers in the future. While the mortality rate among slaves working on plantations between 1680 and 1807 averaged 50.9 per thousand people, following the passage of the regulations post-1873, it dropped to 7.1 per thousand among Indian workers. Indo-Surinamese made up 37.6% of the population in the 1972 Census. Following the independence of Suriname on 25 November 1975, a significant portion of the Indo-Surinamese population migrated to the Netherlands, thereby retaining their Dutch passport. == Religion == The majority religion among the Indo-Surinamese is Hinduism, practiced by 78% of the people, followed by Islam (13%), Christianity (7%), and Jainism. Among the Hindus about 63% follow orthodox, traditional Hinduism that they call SanƒÅtanƒ´ to differentiate themselves from the 15% who belong to the reform movement Arya Samaj, started by Dayananda Saraswati. Among the Indo-Surinamese Muslims, 60% follow Sunni Islam while 40% identify as Ahmadiyya, of either the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam or the Ahmadiyya community. == Notable Indo-Surinamese people == * Ashwin Adhin, Surinamese Vice President * Errol Alibux, politician, former prime minister of Suriname, suspect in the December murders trial * Robert Ameerali, politician * Kiran Bechan, football player * Paul Bhagwandas Military officer, Football Coach, Suspect of December Murder 1982 * George Hindori, Hindu Brahmin and Surinamese politician * Tanja Jadnanansing, Labour Party politician * Fareisa Joemmanbaks, model and actress * Ricardo Kishna, football player * Jagernath Lachmon, politician, ex-Speaker of the National Assembly of Suriname * Fred Ramdat Misier, politician * Luciano Narsingh, Dutch footballer * Prem Radhakishun, lawyer, columnist, actor and radio and television producer. * Pretaap Radhakishun, former Prime Minister of Suriname * Anil Ramdas, columnist, correspondent, essayist, journalist, and TV and radio host * Chan Santokhi, President of Suriname, ex- chief of police, Progressive Reform Party politician * Ram Sardjoe, politician, ex-Speaker of the National Assembly of Suriname * Ramsewak Shankar, politician * Aron Winter, football player == See also == * Arya Samaj in Suriname * Baithak Gana * Surinamese Immigrants' Association * Indians in the Netherlands * Indo-Caribbean == References Further reading== * Sandew Hira The legacy of 135 years of Indian Immigration in Suriname * Indian Diaspora in Suriname * Indian Diaspora in Netherlands Category:Ethnic groups in Suriname Category:Indo-Caribbean ","title":"Indo-Surinamese"},{"id":"7462942","text":"Alec Dow Smight is an American film editor and television director born on August 30, 1959 in New York City.

He owned Gun Bluff Plantation on Edisto Island and engaged in agriculture issues of the state. For several years, Seabrook was the president of the South Carolina Agricultural Society and he stressed the need upon the farmers of the state for diversification of crop. In addition, Seabrook wrote the History of the Cotton Plant and A concise view of the critical situation, and future prospects of the slave-holding states, in relation to their coloured population. ==Political career== In 1814, at the age of 21, Seabrook gained election to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served until his election to the South Carolina Senate in 1829. After five years in the Senate, the General Assembly elected him as the 36th Lieutenant Governor in 1834. The General Assembly elected Seabrook as Governor in 1848 and he pushed for reform of education in the state. He lamented that only the upper class of South Carolina was provided with education and that the middle and lower classes received almost little if any education. Local officials were even encouraged by Seabrook to pass additional taxes to fund education. Furthermore, Seabrook organized the teachers of the state into the Teachers' Association, but it collapsed after he left office. ==Later life== Upon the expiration of his term in 1850, Seabrook returned to his plantation on Edisto Island.

It is a three-floored school with a theatre attachment. It has an enrollment of about 859 students. Its campus contains a football/soccer/field hockey field and a three-story building. The building includes two full gymnasiums with multiple changing rooms with showers, a weight room, an elevator, and a 500-seat auditorium. The school also is fully wheelchair accessible. ==History== Governor Simcoe opened its doors in 1971; it was the first open concept high school in the Niagara Peninsula. The first principal was Bob Hayes. Since then, the open concept has been replaced with individual classrooms. In 1995, the Grantham Theatre was added to the east end of the school, while originally designed to seat 1000 people, due to budget, it was only built to seat 500. ==Academics== During the 2007/08 school year, Governor Simcoe changed to a Multi-Subject Instructional Period (MSIP) Schedule. This schedule consists of five classes instead of the regular four. The Five-Period Day consists of four instructional periods of 60 minutes and a multi grade supervised MSIP period of 60 minutes. The MSIP class is created by reducing each of the instructional periods from 75 minutes to 60 minutes. The MSIP class is essentially made up of ‚Äòbits‚Äô of instructional time (4 x 15 = 60 minutes), thus its name Multi-Subject Instructional Period. ==Athletics== The \\"Athletic\\" Program provides students with the opportunity to compete at the highest level possible. The underlying goal of such competition is developed within each student life skills such as dedication, teamwork, group dynamics, a sense of belonging, and the importance of hard work.

Formerly the bay was a moderately-sized commercial port based around whaling and small-scale fishing, but it is now best known for its birdlife in the lagoon to the south of the bay. ==Geography== Lying about 80 km south of Walvis Bay, the area is located in the Region of Erongo. The bay opens to the north and is about 4.2 km long and 4 km wide. There is a shallow lagoon lying south of the bay, separated from it by an area of beach ridges and swales with saltpans. The lagoon is 3.7 km in length and 1 km wide and is limited by sandy desert on its eastern side.GoogleEarth Former visitors to the area assumed that the water in the lagoon was fresh, but a recent survey found out that the lagoon is filled with poor quality brackish water that seeps under the dunes and allows the growth of large reed beds at the water's edge. ==History== The area was surveyed in the 1880s by the Royal Navy but it was considered very inferior to Walvis Bay and no development took place. Occasional sealing vessels used the bay as an anchorage, instead of Walvis Bay, and there were some temporary settlements used by seasonal fishermen catching snoek (Thyrsites atun). In the 1930s an ambitious project was started to build a guano island in the lagoon using sand pumps imported from the Netherlands. Unfortunately jackals could cross to the island at low tides and chased the birds away. All that remains of the project is the manager's house. Currently the bay and lagoon are within the Namib- Naukluft National Park. The fauna was surveyed by the South African Museum and the National Museum of Namibia.

Usually when a company raises the amount of its normal dividend, the investor expectation is that this marks a sustained increase. In the case of a special dividend, however, the company is signalling that this is a one-off payment. Therefore, special dividends do not markedly affect valuation or yield calculations, unless the amount is large -- in which case they do markedly affect valuation as they are a direct and large depletion of the assets of the company. Typically, special dividends are distributed if a company has exceptionally strong earnings that it wishes to distribute to shareholders, or if it is making changes to its financial structure, such as debt ratio. A prominent example of a special dividend was the $3 dividend announced by Microsoft in 2004, to partially relieve its balance sheet of a large cash balance. A more recent example of a special dividend is the $1 dividend announced by SAIC (U.S. company) in 2013, just prior to it splitting off its solutions business into a new company named Leidos. == Payment date == For special dividends, the ex-dividend date is set according to the size of the dividend in relation to the price of the security, and dividends or distributions of less than 25% are subject to the 'regular' rules for ex-dividend dates. However, dividends or distributions of more than 25% are subject to 'special' rules for ex-dividend dates. The major difference here is that for these larger distributions or dividends, the ex- dividend date is set as the day after payment (with the day of payment being the \\"payment date\\").http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p003997.pdf For these larger 'special dividends', the ex-dividend date is generally one stock trading day after the dividend payment date. The dividend payment date occurs sometime after the dividend record date. The stock will trade on an ex- distribution basis (adjusted for the amount of the dividend paid) on the trading day after the dividend payment date, and thereafter. To be entitled to a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, you need to be a stockholder on the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date, your purchase would need to have been made a minimum of two business days prior to the record date, and you would still have to own it on that day. The ex- dividend date, i.e. the first date in which a new buyer of shares would not be entitled to the dividend, is the business day prior to the record date (see ex-dividend date for exceptions). In the case of a special dividend of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite different apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a \\"due bill,\\" which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date two business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process. As is the case with all dividends, if you sell your stock prior to the ex-dividend date, within the due bill period, you relinquish your right to the dividend. The earliest you can sell your stock and still be entitled to the special dividend is the date the stock begins trading on an ex-distribution basis, or generally one day after the dividend payment date, on the ex-dividend date. In simplest terms, ownership on the \\"record date\\" usually, but not always (because of the case of large special dividends), determines who is entitled to a dividend. The ex- dividend date always identifies who is ultimately entitled to receive a dividend. == Relationship to stock option contracts == Special dividends are different from regular cash dividends in that only the former cause strike prices to be adjusted on option contracts. http://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/Commentary/OICommentary.aspx?DIR=OICommentary&FILE;=06_07_2012_2.ascx&CreateDate;=07.06.2012&Title;=CBOE This is because special dividends are not expected, and therefore would result in an unexpected transfer of wealth from those owning call options to those who sold them (vice versa for put options). For example, say XYZ is priced at $40 today, and has a special dividend of $1. Since call option holders are not entitled to dividends, a holder of an option to buy stock XYZ at $30 will not receive the $1 special dividend. However, after paying the cash dividend, then (all else being equal) XYZ will drop to $39, as it has paid out $1 of its value. However, the option to buy a $39 stock at $30 is worth less than the option to buy a $40 stock at $30. Therefore, option exchanges have formulas to adjust contracts appropriately when special dividends are paid out. In this case, the call option to buy at $30 will be converted to a call option to buy at $29, which will keep the option value roughly the same. Regular cash dividends do not result in such option contract adjustments. This is because the market expects them to occur, and they are therefore priced into the option premium. In a way, the buyer of a call option for a stock that pays a regular cash dividend gets a \\"buyer's discount\\". ==See also== *Dividend *Dividend cover *Dividend tax *Dividend units *Dividend yield *Dividend reinvestment plan or DRIP *Liquidating dividend *Stock buyback ==Footnotes== Category:Dividends ","title":"Special dividend"},{"id":"7463050","text":"Maeonius (d. 266/267), or Maconius, was a short-lived Roman usurper.

A family of hexlets related by a rotation and scaling. The centers of the spheres fall on an ellipse, making it an elliptic hexlet. In geometry, Soddy's hexlet is a chain of six spheres (shown in grey in Figure 1), each of which is tangent to both of its neighbors and also to three mutually tangent given spheres. In Figure 1, the three spheres are the blue outer sphere and two spheres (not shown) above and below the plane the centers of the hexlet spheres lie on. In addition, the hexlet spheres are tangent to a fourth sphere (red in Figure 1), which is not tangent to the three others. According to a theorem published by Frederick Soddy in 1937, it is always possible to find a hexlet for any choice of mutually tangent spheres A, B and C. Indeed, there is an infinite family of hexlets related by rotation and scaling of the hexlet spheres (Figure 1); in this, Soddy's hexlet is the spherical analog of a Steiner chain of six circles. Consistent with Steiner chains, the centers of the hexlet spheres lie in a single plane, on an ellipse. Soddy's hexlet was also discovered independently in Japan, as shown by Sangaku tablets from 1822 in Kanagawa prefecture. ==Definition== Soddy's hexlet is a chain of six spheres, labeled S1-S6, each of which is tangent to three given spheres, A, B and C, that are themselves mutually tangent at three distinct points. (For consistency throughout the article, the hexlet spheres will always be depicted in grey, spheres A and B in green, and sphere C in blue.) The hexlet spheres are also tangent to a fourth fixed sphere D (always shown in red) that is not tangent to the three others, A, B and C. Each sphere of Soddy's hexlet is also tangent to its neighbors in the chain; for example, sphere S4 is tangent to S3 and S5. The chain is closed, meaning that every sphere in the chain has two tangent neighbors; in particular, the initial and final spheres, S1 and S6, are tangent to one another. ==Annular hexlet== Figure 2: An annular hexlet. The annular Soddy's hexlet is a special case (Figure 2), in which the three mutually tangent spheres consist of a single sphere of radius r (blue) sandwiched between two parallel planes (green) separated by a perpendicular distance 2r. In this case, Soddy's hexlet consists of six spheres of radius r packed like ball bearings around the central sphere and likewise sandwiched. The hexlet spheres are also tangent to a fourth sphere (red), which is not tangent to the other three. The chain of six spheres can be rotated about the central sphere without affecting their tangencies, showing that there is an infinite family of solutions for this case. As they are rotated, the spheres of the hexlet trace out a torus (a doughnut-shaped surface); in other words, a torus is the envelope of this family of hexlets. ==Solution by inversion== The general problem of finding a hexlet for three given mutually tangent spheres A, B and C can be reduced to the annular case using inversion. This geometrical operation always transforms spheres into spheres or into planes, which may be regarded as spheres of infinite radius. A sphere is transformed into a plane if and only if the sphere passes through the center of inversion. An advantage of inversion is that it preserves tangency; if two spheres are tangent before the transformation, they remain so after. Thus, if the inversion transformation is chosen judiciously, the problem can be reduced to a simpler case, such as the annular Soddy's hexlet. Inversion is reversible; repeating an inversion in the same point returns the transformed objects to their original size and position. Inversion in the point of tangency between spheres A and B transforms them into parallel planes, which may be denoted as a and b. Since sphere C is tangent to both A and B and does not pass through the center of inversion, C is transformed into another sphere c that is tangent to both planes; hence, c is sandwiched between the two planes a and b. This is the annular Soddy's hexlet (Figure 2). Six spheres s1-s6 may be packed around c and likewise sandwiched between the bounding planes a and b. Re- inversion restores the three original spheres, and transforms s1-s6 into a hexlet for the original problem. In general, these hexlet spheres S1-S6 have different radii. An infinite variety of hexlets may be generated by rotating the six balls s1-s6 in their plane by an arbitrary angle before re-inverting them. The envelope produced by such rotations is the torus that surrounds the sphere c and is sandwiched between the two planes a and b; thus, the torus has an inner radius r and outer radius 3r. After the re-inversion, this torus becomes a Dupin cyclide (Figure 3). Figure 3: A Dupin cyclide, through which the hexlet spheres rotate, always touching. The cyclide is tangent to an inner sphere, an outer sphere and two spheres above and below the \\"hole\\" in the \\"doughnut\\". ==Dupin cyclide== The envelope of Soddy's hexlets is a Dupin cyclide, an inversion of the torus. Thus Soddy's construction shows that a cyclide of Dupin is the envelope of a 1-parameter family of spheres in two different ways, and each sphere in either family is tangent to two spheres in same family and three spheres in the other family. This result was probably known to Charles Dupin, who discovered the cyclides that bear his name in his 1803 dissertation under Gaspard Monge. ==Relation to Steiner chains== Figure 4: Steiner chain of six circles corresponding to a Soddy's hexlet. The intersection of the hexlet with the plane of its spherical centers produces a Steiner chain of six circles. ==Parabolic and hyperbolic hexlets== It is assumed that spheres A and B are the same size. In any elliptic hexlet, such as the one shown at the top of the article, there are two tangent planes to the hexlet. In order for an elliptic hexlet to exist, the radius of C must be less than one quarter that of A. If C's radius is one quarter of A's, each sphere will become a plane in the journey. The inverted image shows a normal elliptic hexlet, though, and in the parabolic hexlet, the point where a sphere turns into a plane is precisely when its inverted image passes through the centre of inversion. In such a hexlet there is only one tangent plane to the hexlet. The line of the centres of a parabolic hexlet is a parabola. If C is even larger than that, a hyperbolic hexlet is formed, and now there are no tangent planes at all. Label the spheres S1 to S6. S1 thus cannot go very far until it becomes a plane (where its inverted image passes through the centre of inversion) and then reverses its concavity (where its inverted image surrounds the centre of inversion). Now the line of the centres is a hyperbola. The limiting case is when A, B and C are all the same size. The hexlet now becomes straight. S1 is small as it passes through the hole between A, B and C, and grows till it becomes a plane tangent to them. The centre of inversion is now also with a point of tangency with the image of S6, so it is also a plane tangent to A, B and C. As S1 proceeds, its concavity is reversed and now it surrounds all the other spheres, tangent to A, B, C, S2 and S6. S2 pushes upwards and grows to become a tangent plane and S6 shrinks. S1 then obtains S6's former position as a tangent plane. It then reverses concavity again and passes through the hole again, beginning another round trip. Now the line of centres is a degenerate hyperbola, where it has collapsed into two straight lines. ==Sangaku tablets== Soddy's hexlet problem in japanese mathematics book Kokonsankan (1832). Replica of Sangaku at H≈çtoku museum in Samukawa Shrine. Japanese mathematicians discovered the same hexlet over one hundred years before Soddy did. They analysed the packing problems in which circles and polygons, balls and polyhedrons come into contact and often found the relevant theorems independently before their discovery by Western mathematicians. They often published these as sangaku. The sangaku about the hexlet was made by Irisawa Shintar≈ç Hiroatsu in the school of Uchida Itsumi, and dedicated to the Samukawa Shrine in May 1822. The original sangaku has been lost but was recorded in Uchida's book of Kokonsankan in 1832. A replica of the sangaku was made from the record and dedicated to the H≈çtoku museum in the Samukawa Shrine in August, 2009.. The sangaku by Irisawa consists of three problems. The third problem relates to Soddy's hexlet: \\"the diameter of the outer circumscribing sphere is 30 sun. The diameters of the nucleus balls are 10 sun and 6 sun each. The diameter of one of the balls in the chain of balls is 5 sun. Then I asked for the diameters of the remaining balls. The answer is 15 sun, 10 sun, 3.75 sun, 2.5 sun and 2 + 8/11 sun.\\". In his answer, the method for calculating the diameters of the balls is written down and can consider it the following formulas to be given in the modern scale. If the ratios of the diameter of the outside ball to each of the nucleus balls are a1, a2, and if the ratios of the diameter to the chain balls are c1, ..., c6. we want to represent c2, ..., c6 in terms of a1, a2, and c1. If :K=\\\\sqrt{3\\\\left( a_1 a_2+a_2 c_1+c_1 a_1- \\\\left( \\\\frac{a_1+a_2+c_1+1}{2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right)} then, :\\\\begin{align} c_2&=(a_1+a_2+c_1-1)/2-K \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_3&=(3a_1+3a_2-c_1-3)/2-K \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_4&=2a_1+2a_2-c_1-2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_5&=(3a_1+3a_2-c_1-3)/2+K \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_6&=(a_1+a_2+c_1-1)/2+K. \\\\end{align} . Then c1 \\\\+ c4 = c2 \\\\+ c5 = c3 \\\\+ c6. If r1, ..., r6 are the diameters of six balls, we get the formula: : \\\\frac{1}{r_1}+\\\\frac{1}{r_4}=\\\\frac{1}{r_2}+\\\\frac{1}{r_5}=\\\\frac{1}{r_3}+\\\\frac{1}{r_6}. ==See also== *Descartes' theorem *Inversive geometry *Sangaku ==NotesReferences== * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . ==External links== * * * ‚Äì The animation 0 of SANGAKU PROBLEM 0 shows the case which the radiuses of spheres A and B are equal each other and the centers of spheres A, B and C are on the line.

The novel is set in the twenty-seventh century aboard a spacecraft adrift in interstellar space. Robin, the protagonist, has recently had his memory erased. He agrees to take part in an experiment, during which he is placed inside a model of a late twentieth/early twenty-first century Euroamerican society. Robin is given a new identity and body, specifically that of a woman named \\"Reeve\\". Major themes of this novel are identity, gender determinism, self-image and conformity. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a sequel to his 2005 novel Accelerando, although Stross has stated that the two novels are not obviously incompatible. Glasshouse won the Prometheus Award for 2007, and was nominated for the Hugo, Campbell, and Locus Awards in 2007. == Production == Stross wrote of the book's production: ==Plot introduction== It is the 27th century. The culture featured in the novel is based on the culture portrayed in the last chapter of Accelerando, \\"Survivor\\" (full chapter here). Humanity has spread throughout the galaxy using the wormhole technology copied from the alien routers, forming a plethora of societies and 'polities'. Robin, a human male, is recovering from a memory excision process in a rehabilitation centre. Though he remembers nothing of his past life(s), he suspects that he lived through traumatic times as a participant in the series of wars that raged many years before. Suspecting that he has been targeted for assassination by persons unknown, he agrees to sign-up with a radical, isolated social experiment that will attempt to recreate the forgotten \\"Dark Ages\\", the late 20th and early 21st centuries. On being transferred to the polity in which the program is being held, he discovers that he has been given the body of a woman, Reeve. As the experiment unfolds, she begins to suspect that all is not what it seems, and that the founders of the experiment are engaged in a very sinister conspiracy. Slowly, she realizes that her role is not as clear-cut as she originally thought, which leads her to question, and then struggle against the program. ===Explanation of the novel's title=== In the context of the novel, \\"glasshouse\\" refers to a military prison. The polity in which the bulk of the story takes place was formerly a high-security facility for war criminals. The term was first used to describe the glass- roofed military detention barracks based in Aldershot, UK, in the mid-19th century. Stross also refers to the Glasshouse as a type of panopticon, a prison constructed in such a way that the guards in the center can see everything the prisoners are doing, but the prisoners can never tell if the guards are watching. Philosopher Michel Foucault used the model to represent the way humans tend to conform to and internalise societal ideals based on this kind of omnipresent gaze, an idea Stross exploits in the novel. ==BackgroundTimekeeping=== The polities descended from the Republic of Is do not use days, weeks, or other terrestrial dating systems other than for historical or archaeological purposes; however, the classical second has been retained as the basis of timekeeping. Second : The time taken for light to travel 299,792,458 meters in vacuum. Kilosecond : 16 minutes Diurn 100 kiloseconds : 27 hours, 1 day and 3 hours Megasecond (Cycle) 10 diurns : 11 days and 6 hours M-year 30 megaseconds : 337 Earth days, 11 months Gigasecond : approximately 31 Earth years Terasecond : approximately 31,000 Earth years (half age of human species) Petasecond : approximately 31,000,000 Earth years (half elapsed time since end of Cretaceous era) ===Transport technology=== T-gates : (Transporter gates). These are the ubiquitous point-to-point wormholes which link everything from polities that are light-years apart to rooms in habitats to each other. They are also used to enable one to access private storage spaces, even from clothing. Unlike the A-gates, traffic through these is instantaneous and unfiltered, though they can be fitted with firewalls at a variety of strengths. A-gates : (Assembler gates). Nanotechnological arrays that can be used for creating all kinds of objects, goods, and substances very quickly, molecule by molecule, working from a wide series of templates. They are also used by the posthuman populace to create \\"backups\\" of themselves, redesign their physical bodies to whatever parameters they wish, long-distance travel between far-flung polities, and for medical purposes, making them, if they wish to be, virtually immortal. Military-grade versions exist which can be used to download polity-inbound traffic, analyse it for threats/contamination, reroute it to a DMZ, and then reassemble it if all is well. Mobile Archive Suckers : Large spacecraft or mobile habitats which travel at slower-than-light speeds between the brown dwarf stars which most polities orbit. Self-contained and self-sufficient, fitted with their own A-gates, they are fuelled by plasma piped-in by T-gate from nearby stars. Generally, the ships' systems are not connected to the galactic network at large. The crews and/or passengers can, if they do not wish to experience the long subjective timescales of travel by this method, disassemble themselves in an A-gate and \\"sleep\\" throughout the journey. ===Population centres=== The vast majority of posthumanity lives in massive artificial cylindrical habitats, along with a few domed colonies on the planets, moons, and asteroids orbiting brown dwarf stars. These can be linked to each other by T-gates, creating a huge network of interconnected societies, known as the Republic of Is. ===History=== For a variety of reasons, posthumanity has forgotten the history of events preceding, during, and just after the singularity (the \\"acceleration\\") as it occurred back in the Solar System, from around 1950 to 2040. They refer to this period as the Dark Ages. Data-storage methods changed so rapidly that proper backups weren't made; much data was encrypted, or stored on perishable media; many individuals hailing from the period excised their memories too many times, creating a historical \\"bias\\"; and many \\"censorship wars\\" were fought, with computer viruses and worms changing or erasing what was left. ===Censorship wars=== A long series of these wars plagued posthumanity, starting around 300 years before the novel begins, lasting for almost a century (two centuries, according to Yourdon). Censor factions used A-gates to propagate redactive worms throughout the Republic's networks, which targeted historical data and even memories of why the wars had started in the first place. Historians and archaeologists were singled out for annihilation. These events placed a great strain on the political cohesiveness of the Republic of Is ‚Äì but worse was to come. ===Curious Yellow=== Persons unknown created a worm of enormous destructive capability ‚Äì Curious Yellow. Like previous worms it used the A-gates to spread, but it also used the people who travelled with/uploaded to them as transmission vectors. An infected A-gate would surreptitiously delete swaths of personal memory from a victim, particularly memories associated with historical knowledge of pre-Republic times. It would then force a copy of its kernel into the victim's netlink (the Cyberware which everyone uses to connect to and communicate with the gate networks) along with some bootstrap functions. The infected victim, upon encountering a \\"clean\\" A-gate, would then feel compelled to switch the gate into debugger mode, enter a set of commands, then upload him/herself, after which the gate would execute the infected boot-loader in his/her netlink, copy it into its working set, and thus become infected in turn. When a set amount of gates in a network became infected, they would begin communicating with each other and create privileged instruction channels which could be used by shadowy controllers with the correct authentication keys to control them remotely. They could defend themselves against attack, build and direct weapons to selected targets, and netlink to any number of T-gates. Eventually, the republic crumbled under the pressure, converting into a series of isolated, heavily firewalled polities. Curious Yellow is derived from a paper on worm design by Brandon Wiley: Curious Yellow: The First Coordinated Worm Design. ===Recovery=== However, there were those who fought back. A variety of militia groups formed, among them the Linebarger Cats, who specialised in esoteric strategies and psyops. They formed and acted on a plan to \\"repurpose\\" the worm, rewriting its code as an \\"immune system\\" and introducing it, slowly but surely, into the A-gates. Millions died as the worm fought back, but they eventually succeeded. After Curious Yellow's destruction, a number of Quisling dictatorships formed, using hacked versions of the worm to spread in an attempt to form separatist dystopias, populated by brainwashed populations led by sinister \\"cognitive dictators\\". But these were mopped-up one-by-one, and the galaxy returned to a semblance of normality with the firewalled polities building \\"clean\\" A-gates to carefully re-integrate. The Invisible Republic became one of the largest new networks. ==Major characters in Glasshouse== * Robin / Reeve Brown : The main protagonist ‚Äì Male rehabilitation patient / \\"Housewife\\" and librarian within the polity. * Kay : Robin's girlfriend. * Colonel-Doctor Sanni : Linebarger Cats staff-officer. * Colonel-Professor \\"Bishop\\" Yourdon, Major-Doctor Fiore, Doctor Hanta : Founders and controllers of the Glasshouse polity. * Sam Brown : Reeve's \\"husband\\" within the polity. * Janis : Polity librarian; Reeve's co-worker. ==Major themes== Self-concept, self image, the \\"self\\", memory and the self, censorship, historicity, peer pressure, conformity, problem of other minds, redemption, gender roles, abuse of women, the nature of fascism. == Allusions/references to other works == * Cordwainer Smith, aka Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger; SF writer, Political science graduate and expert in psychological warfare.\\"Linebarger Cats\\" (a reference to \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\"); see http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog- static/2010/08/interview-1.html#comment-56799 mentioned throughout.

Apple used PowerPC processors in the Power Mac, iMac, eMac, PowerBook, iBook, Mac mini, and Xserve. Classic Macintosh accelerator boards using PowerPCs were made by DayStar Digital, Newer Technology, Sonnet Technologies, and TotalImpact. There have been several attempts to create PowerPC reference platforms for computers by IBM and others: The IBM PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform) is a system standard intended to ensure compatibility among PowerPC-based systems built by different companies; IBM POP (PowerPC Open Platform) is an open and free standard and design of PowerPC motherboards. Pegasos Open Desktop Workstation (ODW) is an open and free standard and design of PowerPC motherboards based on Marvell Discovery II (MV64361) chipset; PReP standard specifies the PCI bus, but will also support ISA, MicroChannel, and PCMCIA. PReP-compliant systems will be able to run OS/2, AIX, Solaris, Taligent, and Windows NT; and the CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform) is an open platform agreed on by Apple, IBM, and Motorola. All CHRP systems will be able to run Mac OS, OS/2-PPC, Windows NT, AIX, Solaris, Novell Netware. CHRP is a superset of PReP and the PowerMac platforms. Power.org has defined the Power Architecture Platform Reference (PAPR) that provides the foundation for development of computers based on the Linux operating system.

It had seven Par 3 holes and two Par 4 holes set amidst rolling terrain, undulating greens and extensive bunkering. The Skycity Nine Eagles Golf Course closed down on 30 July 2015. The Airport Authority said the site, part of the airport's north commercial district, would be used to accommodate a hotel with some 1,000 rooms, and retail development of some 200,000 square metres. ==TransportationFrom airport=== Shuttle buses are the current options of getting around SkyCity without driving a car. Airport Express, part of the MTR's Airport Express Line, takes only a minute to travel between AsiaWorld- Expo and the Airport. It costs HK$2.5 for Octopus users and HK$5 for others. Automated People Mover is the current People mover in use at the airport and only operates within the terminal. After completion of SkyCity, the Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover will be extended to include Terminal 2 (SkyPlaza) and SkyPier. ===From other areas of Hong Kong=== Because SkyCity is located at Chek Lap Kok, the island Hong Kong International Airport is on, it is easy to reach from other areas of the territory. The Airport Express can be taken from Kowloon, Hong Kong, and Tsing Yi stations. In addition, the Tung Chung Line can be taken from Tung Chung to the same stations (plus others) via buses to Tung Chung at a cheaper price than the Airport Express. The buses that serve the Airport are also options, including the A21 from Hung Hom in Kowloon, which travels to both the Airport and the AsiaWorld-Expo. The common taxis that service Kowloon, Hong Kong, and Lantau are the easiest but also perhaps the most expensive way to get to SkyCity. ==See also== *List of shopping centres in Hong Kong ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel Category:Transport in Hong Kong Category:Marriott hotels Category:Hotels in Hong Kong Category:Chek Lap Kok ","title":"Hong Kong SkyCity"},{"id":"7463238","text":"More Tales of the Unexpected is a collection of short stories by Roald Dahl.

To keep costs low on high-volume competitive products, the CPU core is usually bundled into a system-on-chip (SOC) integrated circuit. SOCs contain the processor core, cache and the processor's local data on-chip, along with clocking, timers, memory (SDRAM), peripheral (network, serial I/O), and bus (PCI, PCI-X, ROM/Flash bus, I2C) controllers. IBM also offers an open bus architecture (called CoreConnect) to facilitate connection of the processor core to memory and peripherals in a SOC design. IBM and Motorola have competed along parallel development lines in overlapping markets. A later development was the Book E PowerPC Specification, implemented by both IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, which defines embedded extensions to the PowerPC programming model. ===AMCC=== * 440SP: 533‚Äì667 MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (2) 64bit PCI-X, 32bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache. * 440SPe: 533‚Äì667 MHz, 10/100/1G Ethernet, (3) 64bit PCI-Express, 64bit PCI-X, XOR engine, 32k L1 Cache. * 440EPx: 333‚Äì667 MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, Hardware Security, PCI, DDR-II, FPU, USB 1.1 or USB 2.0, 32k L1 Cache. * 440GR: 333‚Äì667 MHz, (2) 10/100 Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, 32k L1 Cache. * 440GRx: 333‚Äì667 MHz, (2) 10/100/1G Ethernet, (4) UART, (2) IIC, 53 GPIO, SPI, DDR-II, Hardware Security, 32k L1 Cache. * PowerPC Titan, 32-bit, dual core, 2 GHz.

He is also known as The Living Paper Cartoon. In his one-hour show he goes through more than 50 costume changes, in front of the audience without hiding behind drapes or screens and without any assistance by stage hands. In the last 30 years Marchetto has performed in over 170 countries and has been seen by more than one million people. His shows were honoured with numerous awards and highly praised by international critics. ==Biography Early years === Marchetto was born next to Carlo Goldoni's home. Inspired by cartoons, especially those by Walt Disney - he used to cut paper figures for his sister and decorations for the Christmas tree based on them -, modern dance performances like those choreographed by Pina Bausch and the mime performer Lindsay Kemp, his career began during the 1980s with various performances during the Venetian Carnival. Back then Ennio worked in his father's company, a repair shop for espresso machines. Everyone was convinced that he would carry on the family tradition, but Ennio didn‚Äôt want to. While working there, he was lost in daydreams and in one of these he saw Marilyn Monroe before him - all dressed in paper. On the same day he created his first paper costume, which he showed to friends, family and amused people on the streets during the Carnival. In 1988 he received the Golden Lion prize from the Venice Entertainment Festival for his creations. In subsequent years he created more and more paper figures. With just a few costumes, Marchetto presented his show at the Zanzara d'Oro (the Golden Mosquito), an annual competition for young comedians. Marchetto was awarded the first prize and soon started appearing on television and in cabaret shows. He developed more and more characters and began to think about his own theatre show. His first attempt was a written and staged piece by Daniele Sala, which was about the life of the famous change artist Leopoldo Fregoli at the turn of the century. Marchetto sang, acted and transformed himself in quick succession using his paper costumes. However, he soon realized that this kind of show wasn't what he had in mind and called it off after only four performances. After his last performance he met Dutch costume designer Sosthen Hennekam. This encounter was the beginning of a long and prolific collaboration. Sosthen devised numerous improvements. For example, he introduced the origami technique thanks to which it was possible to change the costumes even faster. After a few months Sosthen and Marchetto had designed enough costumes for a one-hour show. At the moment, he has around 350 characters in his repertoire, often celebrities, but that also include other cultural icons and works of art. Marchetto's first performance of his new show was at the Festa dell'Unit√† in Bologna and it was an instant success, which led to other television and guest appearances throughout Italy. In 1989 the London producer Glynis Henderson saw a video recording of the show and offered Marchetto a spot at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Marchetto accepted the invitation. However, half of his costumes were Italian celebrities, unknown by the international audience of the Festival. In just two weeks Marchetto created 18 new characters, including crowd-favourites like Queen Elizabeth II, Freddie Mercury, Tina Turner and the Venus de Milo. The first few days in Edinburgh were very hard; there were only a few spectators, but then the first critic came in, Malcolm Hay from Time Out Magazine. He wrote an enthusiastic article. A few days later the show was sold out up to the last date and Marchetto became a cult star of the Festival. From then on everything moved on very fast. === 1990s === After several tours of the UK, guest performances in London's West End and at international festivals, Marchetto and Sosthen‚Äôs show was nominated at the Laurence Olivier Awards in 1993 in London for Best Entertainment. In the same year Granada Television Celebrations produced Paper Marilyn, a one-hour documentary about Marchetto's life and his artistic career. At the first MTV Europe Music Awards in Berlin the following year Marchetto joined together on stage with some of the same stars from his repertoire, including Prince, George Michael and Bj√∂rk. Other international engagements followed: a four-month stint at the Th√©√¢tre Grevin in Paris, a Germany tour with Erasure and an appearance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City ‚Äì just to name a few. In 1995 Marchetto won the Performance d‚ÄôActeur prize at the Cannes Festival and in 1996 the FAD Sebasti√† Gasch Award in Barcelona. In 1998 Marchetto was invited to perform with the Spice Girls, Bryan Adams and other artists on the Royal Variety Show for Prince Charles, broadcast by the BBC. He was also commissioned to celebrate the birthday of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands with an exclusive show for the Dutch royal family. With its off-Broadway show Marchetto was nominated for a Drama Desk Award in 1999, followed by guest appearances in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where he received the Garland Award. === 2000s === In summer 2001 he was invited to perform at the White Tie and Tiara Ball, an important AIDS Gala, hosted every year by Sir Elton John at his estate in Oxfordshire. The following year, Marchetto attended an exclusive performance by Elton John and Jos√© Carreras on the luxury liner Seven Seas Mariner. He has toured extensively in Italy and performed in famous theatres such as Teatro Ciak in Milan, Teatro Parioli in Rome and Arena del Sole in Bologna. In Barcelona he appeared for a six-week run at the Club Capitol. He also starred in various television programs in prime time. In 2003 Marchetto returned to the UK and Ireland with sell out shows. His great success was confirmed by appearances in the Live Floor Show on BBC2 and the popular Italian TV show Uno di Noi with Gianni Morandi on Rai Uno. After two months of guest performances in Berlin and Hamburg, Marchetto returned once again to Los Angeles to amuse audiences in packed houses. Furthermore, his performance was the opening show at the Napa Opera House in Napa Valley (California), where seats were sold out for the entire three week run. Further guest performances in Germany and Edinburgh followed in 2004, after the premi√®re of Marchetto‚Äôs new show in Amsterdam in the historic Nieuwe de la Mar Theater. He then performed in Palm Beach (Florida) at the Cuillo Centre for the Arts. Together with Nancy Sinatra, the New York Dolls, Morrissey and Sparks, he appeared at the Morrissey launched Meltdown Festival at the South Bank Centre in London. In addition, he appeared again in the Royal Variety Show. At the beginning of 2005, the 200th birthday of Hans Christian Andersen was celebrated in Copenhagen's Parken Stadium and transmitted on television throughout Europe. For the occasion, Marchetto performed with specially designed costumes to honour the Danish poet in front of the Danish royal family and 40,000 other spectators. Among the guests were also Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Isabel Allende, Jean Michel Jarre and Sir Roger Moore. In Paris‚Äô Auditorium Saint-Germain Marchetto premiered with many new French characters and later in the winter season he returned once again to the city to perform at La Cigale. He was also seen on the popular French television show Star Acad√©mie. Marchetto continued to tour all over the world, in the USA (Los Angeles, Napa Valley and Austin), Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany (Mannheim, D√ºsseldorf and Berlin). At the beginning of 2006 Marchetto continued his successful show in Berlin and started on an extensive tour to Italy. He performed for three weeks in Rome and returned to his hometown to perform at a special Carnival show at the Teatro Goldoni, filmed and broadcast by SkyTV several times. He also took part in various worldwide charities. At Berkeley Repertory Theater in California his show was an absolute summer hit. Marchetto ended the year with full houses in Rome and a special Christmas programme at the South Bank Centre in London, a show with many new pop icons, including Lily Allen, Boy George as a street sweeper and a crazy Vincent van Gogh in the style of Gnarls Barkley. In 2007 Marchetto toured in Italy, Berlin, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Dubai and the USA. He was also a regular guest on the cult show Markette on the Italian television channel La7. In 2008 he appeared in the music video for Blow-Up's song 'John Travolta' for which he created an original costume and in January 2009, Marchetto appeared on the show World of Comedy (RTL) together with celebrities such as Eminem and Gloria Gaynor. === 2010s === Marchetto continues to be extremely popular and tour the world with his show. He is a recurring guest at the Tipi Am Kanzleramt in Berlin ever since 2008 and every year tours extensively in Germany. In 2010 and 2012 he takes part in the Cavalchina Grand Ball at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice to celebrate the Carnival together with Grace Jones and Italian singer Ornella Vanoni. In May 2011 Marchetto goes on a short tour of Spain, followed by an appearance at the Festival Ple de Riure. Later in the year he is invited to perform at the New York Musical Theatre Festival and in October he performs in front of the enthusiastic audience of the J√ºrgen Hart Satire Matinee at the end of the Leipziger Lachmesse. Over the next few years he takes part in several TV programmes in Belgium, Spain, Brazil, the Netherlands and Italy (Zelig). For the first time in 2013 he performed on the Chinese TV's programme CCTV International Humour Festival and again in 2015 he participated to the Chinese New Year's celebrations on the BTV Spring Gala, alongside many Chinese and international artists such as Celine Dion. ==Awards== * 1987: Golden Lion, Venice Entertainment Festival * 1988: Zanzara d'Oro, \\"Best New Comedian\\" category, Bologna * 1994: nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment * 1995: \\"Best Show\\", Cannes Performance d'Acteur * 1996: FAD Sebasti√† Gasch Award, Barcelona * 1999: nominated for Drama Desk Award for a \\"Unique Theatrical Experience\\", New York * 1999: Back Stage West Garland Award, \\"Best Costume Design\\" category, Los Angeles * 2007: Arosa Schneestern, Audience award from the Arosa Humor-Festival * 2008: Nominated for an IRNE Award, \\"Best solo performance at a large theatre\\" category, Boston * 2011: NYMF award for \\"Outstanding Performance\\", New York Musical Theatre Festival, New York ==ReferencesExternal links== *Ennio Marchetto's official web site * *Ennio Marchetto Theatre Trailer HD on YouTube Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Italian performance artists Category:Italian entertainers Category:LGBT people from Italy ","title":"Ennio Marchetto"},{"id":"7463314","text":"Gavin Mitchell (born 28 December 1972) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League.

The film also stars Sherilyn Fenn, who was cast by the director, together with her boyfriend at the time Johnny Depp, who was later rejected by the producer. The Red Hot Chili Peppers also make an appearance in the film as well. Considered to be a cult classic. ==Plot== Cory Webster is an amateur skateboarder from out of town staying in Los Angeles with friends in hopes of competing and winning a downhill competition for which he has been training. During his stay in LA, he falls for a beautiful blonde named Chrissy, who just happens to be the younger sister of Hook, the leader of \\"The Daggers\\", a tough punk rock skateboard gang in the Los Angeles/Venice Beach areas. Chrissy is not a Dagger herself but has come from her home in Indiana to stay with her brother in L.A. for the summer. Cory and his crew \\"The Ramp Locals\\" often have confrontations throughout the film because of Cory's disobedience to Hook when asked not to come around or call Chrissy again. Chrissy, however, can choose her own relationships and has the opposite interest. Cory disobeys and is chased on skateboard through city streets and a parking garage by The Daggers. He barely escapes by boarding a bus and exiting through the back door and onto the roof while the rival gang members search the cabin of the bus. Through all of that memorable scene, the Circle Jerks song \\"Wild in the Streets\\" is played, showcasing the connection between '80s hardcore punk rock and skateboarding culture (Vice Squad, Devo, SST Records and Siouxsie and the Banshees T-shirts can be seen on skateboarders throughout the film as well). Upset at Cory, The Daggers find The Ramp Locals' half-pipe and burn it to the ground, thus creating more drama between the two skate crews. Cory and Hook later meet up that night, after an earlier confrontation, at the \\"Dagger house\\" (a punk rock house overrun with Daggers and graffiti, quite common in the 1980s throughout Los Angeles communities). The rivals joust in the Bronson Canyon ditch until Cory is injured and the police arrive. With Cory's arm broken he is convinced he cannot compete in the downhill, and places blame on Chrissy, who wasn't there to assist him in his time of need; she left with the Daggers as the police were arriving, but in protest reminds him that she had begged him not to engage in the duel in the first place. As Chrissy is driving away, Cory runs outside to try to make up with her, but she doesn't hear him behind her. An emotionally upset Chrissy arrives back at the Daggers' house, tells her brother she is going back to Indiana, and asks to be driven to the bus station in the morning; she goes upstairs to pack. Later, Cory skates over to the Daggers' house looking for Chrissy, but Hook's girlfriend tells him that she has already taken Chrissy to the bus station, that she doesn't have a phone number for Chrissy, and that Chrissy was crying inconsolably when she returned. These are all lies; Chrissy is still upstairs packing. Later that night, Chrissy and her brother have a heart to heart about his protectiveness of her as he drives her to the bus station, where she gets on the bus to Indiana. Meanwhile, Cory mopes around. He starts to miss Chrissy and begins to practice downhill skateboarding. With a broken arm he has to be very cautious and proves to not be able to perform as well. Chrissy, having second thoughts, exits her bus on the highway and hitch-hikes back to Los Angeles just in time to see Cory and Hook battle it out in the last turn of the downhill race. Hook flies over the side of the road and Cory speeds through the finish line at 63 mph off a ramp and into a crowd of fans who cheer him in victory. He is awarded a professional contract with Smash Skates and enough money to rebuild the destroyed ramp burnt by the Daggers. Hook tells Cory that he respects his skill and approves Cory's relationship with Chrissy, seeing Cory as worthy and respectful, and apparently having taken his talk with Chrissy to heart. In respecting Cory, Hook, for the first time, is looked at as respectable as well. ==Cast== * Josh Brolin as Cory Webster * Robert Rusler as Tommy Hook * Pamela Gidley as Chrissy * Chuck McCann as Sam Flood * Brooke McCarter as Tyler * Josh Richman as Radley * Brett Marx as Bozo * David Wagner as Little Stevie * Tony Alva as T.A. * Mark Munski as Monk * Sherilyn Fenn as Velvet * Steve Whittaker as Bus driver * Per Welinder as Himself ==Production== Director David Winters, upset after being overruled on a casting decision for Thrashin, made the professional decision to control all aspects of future projects he worked on. Winters' first choice was a pre-21 Jump Street Johnny Depp who was cast in the film together with Depp's girlfriend at the time, Sherilyn Fenn, but after three attempts to get Depp approved by the producer, Winters had no choice but to recast, ultimately casting Josh Brolin, who would go on to win acting awards for his roles in the films W., No Country for Old Men, Milk and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Brolin was first offered, and turned down, the role of Tom Hansen on 21 Jump Street - which ultimately went to Depp. Winters himself had been in the original cast of \\"West Side Story\\" (on Broadway) as well as appearing in the film, certainly making him an appropriate choice to direct, given the resemblance between that classic \\"competing gangs\\" story - inspired by Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets - and the plot of this film. ==Continuing reaction to the film== Sixteen years after initial release, the MTV series Jackass, in a February 2002 episode, played homage to the \\"jousting scene\\" with \\"maces and man-purse\\" in the film.\\"Episode 9 Season 3\\", Jackass Jonez, Spike, MTV, The Board Sport industry continues to describe this film as \\"legendary\\". ==Soundtrack== The film features a performance from the Freaky Styley incarnation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, with Cliff Martinez and Hillel Slovak, as well as music by Devo, Circle Jerks and Meat Loaf.

In February 1985 Van Aardenne announced that he wouldn't stand for the election of 1986 following a critical parliamentary inquiry and announced his retirement. Van Aardenne semi-retired from active politics at 56 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government and as a occasional mediator for cabinet formations, and worked as a trade association executive serving as Chairman of the Hospitals association from May 1987 until June 1995 and a Member of the Social and Economic Council for the Industry and Employers confederation (VNO-NCW) from May 1987 until June 1995. Van Aardenne returned to active in politics and after the Senate election of 1995 was elected as a Member of the Senate on 13 June 1995. In July 1994 Van Aardenne was diagnosed with a progressive form of ALS which resulted in him bounded to a wheelchair by December 1994, due to the progression of his illness he wasn't able to attend Senate meetings after his installation and died just two months later in August 1995 at the age of 65. Van Aardenne was known for his abilities as an effective consensus builder and skillful manager. He holds the distinction as the longest-serving Minister of Economic Affairs after World War II with 7 years, 153 days. ==BiographyEarly life=== Van Aardenne was the son of a surgeon and studied mathematics and physics at Leiden University. After his studies he was employed at a steel factory in Dordrecht, becoming its general manager from 1967 to 1971. ===Politics=== He joined the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in 1958 and was a Member of Parliament between 1971 and 1977, and again in 1981. He became minister of economic affairs in the First Van Agt cabinet (1977‚Äì81). Nuclear energy and problems in the shipbuilding industry were prominent issues during these years. He took the same post as well as Deputy Prime Minister in the first First Lubbers cabinet (1982‚Äì1986). He got into political trouble for downplaying the financial struggles of the Rijn-Schelde-Verolme shipyard, which would collapse in 1983 in spite of many years of large financial support from the government. For this reason he was omitted from the 1986 Lubbers cabinet. Van Aardenne remained politically active, amongst others acting in the formation of the first Kok cabinet in 1994 and rejecting the post of minister of finances in that. By then he had been diagnosed with ALS, which bound him to a wheel chair and of which he died in 1995. ==Decorations== {  style=\\"width:60%;\\" - ccf; text-align:center;\\"  colspan=5 Honours - ! style=\\"width:80px;\\" Ribbon bar !!

Also known as the Military System. Although supposedly superseded by the FDI World Dental Federation notation, it overwhelmingly continues to be the preferred method used by orthodontists, dental students and practitioners in the United Kingdom. It was originally termed the Zsigmondy system after the Hungarian dentist Adolf Zsigmondy who developed the idea in 1861, using a Zsigmondy cross to record quadrants of tooth positions. Adult teeth were numbered 1 to 8, and the child primary dentition (also called deciduous, milk or baby teeth) were depicted with a quadrant grid using Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, V to number the teeth from the midline. Palmer changed this to A, B, C, D, E. This makes it less confusing and less prone to errors in interpretation. The Palmer notation consists of a symbol (‚îò‚îî ‚îê‚îå) designating in which quadrant the tooth is found and a number indicating the position from the midline. Adult teeth are numbered 1 to 8, with deciduous (baby) teeth indicated by a letter A to E. Hence the left and right maxillary central incisor would have the same number, \\"1\\", but the right one would have the symbol, \\"‚îò\\", underneath it, while the left one would have, \\"‚îî\\". ==Table of codes== Orientation of the chart is traditionally \\"dentist's view\\", i.e. patient's right corresponds to notation chart left. The designations \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" on the chart, however, nonetheless correspond to the patient's left and right, respectively. {  + Palmer notation - ! colspan=16 align=\\"center\\" Permanent Dentition - ! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" upper right !! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" upper left - 8‚îò7‚îò6‚îò5‚îò4‚îò3‚îò2‚îò1‚îò‚îî1‚îî2‚îî3‚îî4‚îî5‚îî6‚îî7‚îî8 - 8‚îê7‚îê6‚îê5‚îê4‚îê3‚îê2‚îê1‚îê‚îå1‚îå2‚îå3‚îå4‚îå5‚îå6‚îå7‚îå8 - ! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" lower right !! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" lower left -  colspan=16 align=\\"center\\" - ! colspan=16 align=\\"center\\" Primary Dentition - ! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" upper right !! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" upper left -    E‚îòD‚îòC‚îòB‚îòA‚îò‚îîA‚îîB‚îîC‚îîD‚îîE   -    E‚îêD‚îêC‚îêB‚îêA‚îê‚îåA‚îåB‚îåC‚îåD‚îåE   - ! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" lower right !! colspan=8 align=\\"center\\" lower left } With the move from written dental notes to electronic records, some difficulty in reproducing the symbols has been encountered. On a standard keyboard 'slash' and 'backslash' may be used as a crude approximation to the symbols with numbers placed before or afterwards; hence 3/ is 3‚îò and /5 is ‚îå5 Daniel Johnson has put together a Palmer Tooth Notation TrueType font called FreePalmer. It can be downloaded: It is covered by the GPL 3 license. This font is descended from FreeSans, part of the A screenshot showing it working in OpenOffice can be seen here: A derivative which enables the grid patterns to be produced that correspond to handwritten Palmer tooth notations is available for download as well One advantage of Palmer notation is that it can produce a very graphical image, akin to a 'map' of the dentition; tooth transpositions or edentulous spaces can easily be depicted if desired. It would also be feasible to introduce additional alphabetic characters or other symbols, for example to denote supernumerary teeth or bridge pontics, to which a purely numerical method such as the FDI system does not lend itself easily. Palmer notation for an upper right first premolar tooth Palmer notation for a deciduous lower right central incisor tooth Palmer notation for a normal adult full set of teeth Palmer notation for a normal child full set of teeth == Victor Haderup notation (Danish variant) == The Danish dentist Victor Haderup devised a variation of the Palmer notation where the (‚îò‚îî ‚îê‚îå) symbols are replaced by plus/minus signs, which can either be placed in front or behind the number. A plus (+) indicates upper position while minus (‚àí) indicates lower. When the sign is in front of the number, it indicates left while after it indicates right. For instance ‚àí6 indicates the 6th lower left tooth, i.e. first mandibular molar. ==See also== * Dental notation * FDI World Dental Federation notation * Universal numbering system ==External links== * Palmer numbering system video demonstration ==References== * ==Footnotes== Category:Dentistry definitions ","title":"Palmer notation"},{"id":"7463395","text":"Queen Kham-Oun I (15 July 1885 - 5 June 1915), was queen consort of Laos from 1904 to 1915 by marriage to king Sisavang Vong.

The small scale (compared to Vaux-le-Vicomte for example) makes it easier to compare it to the approximately contemporary Het Loo, for William III of Orange.

Sculptor Pierre-Charles Simart contributed Hellenic friezes and reliefs for the project. Ingres' Age of Gold remains as testament to the abortive project of decorating it in fresco, not Ingres' habitual medium.

It is found in remote rainforests in the western Amazon basin in South America. Males have black plumage, except for a white crissum (the area around the cloaca), with curly feathers on the head and red bill ornaments and wattles. Females and juveniles are similar but lack the bill ornamentation and have a reddish-buff crissum area. The wattled curassow is the most ancient lineage of the southern Crax curassows. In captivity, it sometimes hybridises with the blue-billed curassow. The habitat of the wattled curassow is gallery forests and seasonally-flooded forests where it feeds in small groups on the ground. The diet is largely fruit, but invertebrates and some small vertebrates are opportunistically taken. Little is known of its breeding habits, but it is known that the nest is built of sticks and leaves and two eggs are usually laid. The population of this species is declining. It is threatened by loss of habitat, as the rainforest is progressively cleared, and by hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \\"endangered\\". ==Description== Head and neck of an adult male The wattled curassow is about long, and weighs around . It is a large curassow lacking the white tail-tips found in many of these birds; the feathers along the crest of its head are curled forwards. Males have black plumage all over except for the white crissum. The irides are dark brown; legs, feet and bill are blackish. It has conspicuous crimson bill ornaments--a round red knob with bony core adorns the maxilla base, while the cere extends apically at least halfway under this knob and below the mandible base forms a small fleshy wattle.del Hoyo (1994a) Females have black plumage just like the male, but their crissal area is reddish buff. In some, the remiges and sometimes the wing coverts have faint brownish marbling. Their bills and irides are also blackish, but their feet and legs are a greyish flesh color. They lack the bill knob and wattles, and their cere is bright orange-red. Young males have less well-developed facial ornaments, usually with a more yellowish hue like females do. The hatchlings are covered in brown down above and whitish down below. ===Similar species=== Adults look very much like those of the red- billed curassow (C. blumenbachii), whose males have only an indistinct maxilla knob. Its females have a blackish cere, rather pale legs and feet, and their wings--particularly the remiges--usually have distinct chestnut brown marbling. The black curassow subspecies C. alector erythrognatha, found north of the Solim√µes, has a cere like the wattled curassow female, but its bill is lighter and the crissum is white in both sexes. Young C. globulosa males are easily confused with those of the yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni), but the latter has a white tail-margin and yellow (not orange) bill wattle. All these similar species are allopatric however, with only C. a. erythrognatha occurring adjacent to the range of C. globulosa.del Hoyo (1994a,b) File:Wattled Curassow Crax globulosa Head 2600px.jpgWattled curassow female Note dark bill and orange cere File:Crax globulosa.jpgA young male wattled curassow.

Smit. The wattled curassow is one of the Crax species described in 1825 by Johann Baptist von Spix; the type locality is the Solim√µes (middle Amazon River) region. Its scientific name Crax globulosa can be translated as \\"knobbed curassow\\". Crax is a term for curassows introduced by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his 1760s Ornithologia and adopted by Linnaeus as a genus name in the Systema naturae. globulosa indicates the possession of one or more prominent round surface features (from Latin globus \\"a globe\\"); it the present case it obviously refers to the adult male's prominent bill knob. This bird, with its remarkable features, was subsequently described as new by several scientists who were unawares of von Spix' description. It has no recognized subspecies. According to cladistic analysis of multisequence mtDNA data, the wattled curassow is the most ancient lineage of the southern Crax curassows. Its origins date back some 6‚Äì5.5 mya ago (Messinian, Late Miocene) when its ancestors became isolated in the western Amazon rainforest. Although a close relationship to the red-billed curassow (C. blumenbachii) has been proposed, the wattled curassow seems to be a quite basal lineage without particularly close relatives. The similarity with the red-billed curassow seems to be mostly due to the fact that these are the most ancient species of the southern lineage, retaining more plesiomorphies. Though externally still fairly alike, the two species have vastly different calls and probably evolved, at about the same time, at opposite ends of the original southern Crax curassow's range.del Hoyo (1994a), Pereira & Baker (2004) From captivity, hybrids with the blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) are known. That species is one of the northern group of Crax. The yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni) is probably closest to it, but regardless, they are quite distinct from the wattled curassow. But viable (though not dependably fertile) hybrids are suspected to be possible between any two species of Cracidae. The color and shape of the bill ornaments of male Crax hybrids are not easily predicted, but character displacement would demand the eastern (if any) subspecies of the black curassow (C. a. alector) to have a red ornamentation, as no red- ornamented congeners occur in or near its range. The red cere of the western black curassow may well be due to occasional hybrid introgression of C. globulosa alleles, as it is unlikely that the Solim√µes is entirely impassable to these birds. ==Distribution== It has been found from the western and southwestern Amazon Basin of Brazil west to the Andes foothills of southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and Peru, and northern Bolivia. Its area of occurrence is essentially delimited by the Caquet√°-Japur√°, Solim√µes, Amazon and Madeira Rivers, and the 300 meter contour line towards the Andes. But its precise distribution is very little-known; most populations were observed by people travelling along the rivers in its range. Most of the northern limit of its range runs along the middle Amazon River, or Solim√µes. In northern Peru where the Mara√±√≥n River becomes the Amazon river (Solim√µes for Brazilians), close to Nauta, the range continues upstream towards eastern Amazonian Ecuador along the Caquet√°-Japur√°; it has been recorded from the Yavar√≠ and middle Napo Rivers. It is probably not found anymore in Ecuador proper, and apart from two small populations--Isla Mocagua in the Amazon River and near the Caquet√°--it is also absent from Colombia.del Hoyo (1994a), Pereira & Baker (2004), Alarc√≥n-Nieto & Palacios (2005) To the eastern limit of its range, the Madeira River, upstream in Bolivia, the wattled curassow occurs patchily across most of northern Bolivia in a 700 km region surrounding the confluences to the Madeira's tributaries, four major rivers of northern Bolivia. In Brazil, the bird is only found in the wild in Amazonas state (it used to occur in Rond√¥nia also), namely near the Juru√°, the Javary, the Japur√°, and at its northeasternmost limit around the confluence regions along the Solim√µes, Madeira, Rio Negro, and the Purus Rivers. ==Ecology== The habitat preference of the wattled curassow is not well studied either. Some have found it in terra firme rainforest on higher ground, but it probably occurs there in any numbers only in the wet season when the lowlands are flooded. Most sightings were in gallery forest along rivers and streams (particularly blackwater), seasonally flooded v√°rzea forest, around lakes, and on river islands. V√°rzea seems to be key habitat for this species, at least seasonally. Mated pairs probably defend a territory as other curassows do, and many seem to be entirely sedentary for their whole life. Young birds would thus have to disperse a bit after growing up, if their parents are still alive. But even then they probably stay in the same general area, moving perhaps a few km/miles from their place of birth at most.del Hoyo (1994a), BLI (2008) As almost all Galliformes do, it eats mostly plant matter, supplemented by some small (typically invertebrate) animals--including at least on occasion crustaceans and fish -, but hardly any actual data exists. When foraging, it has been observed to rummage around on the ground less often than other Crax curassows, indicating that it may favor different food items (e.g. fresh fruit instead of dropped seeds) than its closest relatives.del Hoyo (1994a,b), BLI (2008) The breeding season in the wild is unknown; reproductive activity has been noted between June and August but few records exist and as in many rainforest birds there might not be well-marked breeding and non-breeding seasons. Males court the females by strutting around them and giving booming calls. These birds copulate on the ground, and as in many other Galloanseres and in paleognaths the males have a kind of penis. Couples presumably form for years, often essentially for life, as in other curassows; a change of partners may occur occasionally, and were males are frequently hunted (their loud calls make them easy to stalk) survivors may pair up with more than one female. The nest is a crude flat cup of twigs and leaves, small compared to the bird, built at off the ground in vegetation. As in all curassows, the clutch is generally two white eggs, which in this species probably measure about ; time to hatching is almost certainly around 30 days. Both parents tend for the precocial young, which might become independent at about one year of age or maybe earlier. However, it may also be that few birds less than two years of age are sexually mature, suggesting that the grown-up immatures could just as well spend another year or so living with or nearby their parents. A captive bird lived to an age of more than 20 years. ===Status=== Wattled curassow female at the National Aviary The wattled curassow is rarely found in the wild anymore, due to unsustainable hunting and habitat destruction. While its status has rarely been well studied, the number of old and modern records strongly indicates that it is much rarer nowadays than it was in the late 19th century. The species seems to have disappeared from Ecuador in the 1980s, while populations persist in remote areas of the other countries from which it is known. It is nowhere numerous, and the only known region where it can be encountered reasonably often might be along the Juru√° River in Brazil, in particular in the Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve; it is also present in some numbers near San Marcos in Beni Department, Bolivia. It might occur in unexplored locations; its presence in Colombia for example was only proven around 1950 when a bird was shot in Caquet√° Department, at Tres Troncos on the Caquet√° River (from where the species has since disappeared). But any undiscovered populations are unlikely to be large--and even though they might remain unknown to science as soon as hunting with firearms starts in a region the wattled curassow is liable to get shot more often than it reproduces.Blake (1955), del Hoyo (1994a), BLI (2008) There may be somewhat more than 10,000 adult C. globulosa left in the world, but if few other populations exist apart from those known, it might number less than 5,000 individuals old and young altogether. A captive stock exists and by curassow standards is even reasonably plentiful. The species occasionally breeds in captivity, but this is entirely insufficient to counteract the decline in the wild--in particular as it is receives little legal protection and is not known from any protected area other than the Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve (a population from the Apaporis River near Chiribiquete National Park is apparently gone). The IUCN used to classify the wattled curassow as a Vulnerable species under criteria A2bcd+3bcd+4bcd; C2a(i). This means that its numbers have declined and continue to decline by about one-third every decade, mainly due to hunting, with habitat destruction as another major threat, and that most likely between 2,500 and 10,000 adults exist, but not more than 1,000 in any one subpopulation.BLI (2008) In 2010, this classification was uplifted to Endangered. ==References== * Alarc√≥n-Nieto, Gustavo & Palacios, Erwin (2005): Confirmaci√≥n de la segunda poblaci√≥n del pav√≥n moquirrojo (Crax globulosa) para Colombia en el ri√≥ Caquet√° [Confirmation of a second population for Colombia of the Wattled Curassow (Crax globulosa) in the lower Caquet√° River].

Rescue swimmer is the collateral duty or aircrew position of the AST. They are trained at the U.S. Coast Guard's enlisted Aviation Survival Technician/Rescue Swimmer school at Coast Guard Aviation Technical Training Center, Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The challenging job is featured prominently in the 2006 film The Guardian, starring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. ==History== The rating began in 1968 when the U.S. Coast Guard combined Parachute Rigger (PR) and Aviation Ordnanceman (AO) to create the Aviation Survivalman (ASM) Rating. In 1983, the Marine Electric disaster spawned a Congressional Inquiry that found the USCG was the only military service unable to deploy a member from an aircraft for search, rescue and recovery, and initiated a legal requirement for the armed force to do so. After much internal debate, the collateral duty of \\"Helicopter Rescue Swimmer\\" was issued to the ASM rating. Initially met with significant resistance throughout the USCG, the AST has become a durable and required part of Coast Guard rotary wing operations. Initially, all new ASMs were required to complete US Navy Helicopter Rescue Swimmer school in Pensacola, Florida, prior to reporting to USCG ASM \\"A\\" School and EMT \\"C\\" School. After a few years, the differences between what the candidates were learning in the combat-oriented Navy school and what was being required of them during civilian rescues required an organic Coast Guard helicopter rescue swimmer school to be begun. An aquatic segment of training was merged into ASM \\"A\\" school in the late 1980s, and full initial rescue swimmer training was completed at the USCG's Elizabeth City training center. In 1999, along with the realignment of enlisted aviation rates throughout the USCG, the Aviation Survivalman rating was redesignated to Aviation Survival Technician. ==Training and qualification== The course is 24 weeks long. The course includes instruction on rescue techniques, helicopter deployment techniques, and a myriad of technical skills from small engine repair to parachute packing and maintenance. Successful completion of this course results in being awarded the Aviation Survival Technician rating, the technical rating for a variety of aircraft and survival equipment maintenance.Basic AST school information After completion of A-School, all ASTs are sent to Training Center Petaluma, California to attend the Coast Guard's Emergency Medical Technician school. After seven weeks of EMT training, they must take and pass the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians-Basic (NREMT-B) test as part of their qualification as a helicopter rescue swimmer. Full qualification as a rescue swimmer can take up to a year from graduation of A-School, as graduates must learn the aircraft systems and emergency procedures of their assigned aircraft. The rescue swimmer training program has a high student attrition rate averaging in the 80% range, similar to other special operations schools in the military.Story about the Rescue Swimmer in 2004 Not all ASTs serve as rotary wing helicopter rescue swimmers. Many serve in other roles, including as aircrew on fixed-wing assets, at Coast Guard fire departments and as instructors at any of the various training commands. ==Pop Culture== The 2006 movie The Guardian featured Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher as well as a number of actual ASTs and Coast Guardsmen as extras, and told a fictional story of two rescue swimmers. In 2019, the Amazon Prime reboot of Jack Ryan featured a helicopter rescue swimmer in the pilot episode.

Otto was the eldest son of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt and Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, daughter of Otto I, Margrave of Meissen. After the death of his father-in-law, Magnus, Duke of Saxony, in 1106, Otto inherited a significant part of Magnus' properties, and hoped to succeed him as duke. However, Lothar of Supplinburg was named duke in his stead. In 1112, after Lothar had been banned, Otto was appointed duke of Saxony by Emperor Henry V; but in the same year, he came into a dispute with the emperor and was stripped of his ducal title. He now allied himself with Lothar, and helped Lothar defeat Hoyer I, Count of Mansfeld, who had been named duke of Saxony by the Emperor, in 1115. Otto conquered the areas around Zerbst and Salzwedel from Slavs, and maintained Lothar's support once Lothar became king in 1125. He also claimed the County of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, of which his mother was the heir. ==Family== Otto married Eilika, the daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony, before 1095.

He was brought up in Aberdare, and began playing his rugby at Abercwmboi RFC and then moved to Pontypridd RFC once he was eligible for senior rugby. He quickly made his mark upon Wales' Age-Grade selectors with a succession of athletic and promising performances for the Valleys' team. Joining up with Swansea RFC in 2004, he progressed through the internal system to play for the Ospreys in the Celtic League and Heineken Cup, and has played for the national team. His usual position is at lock. He was the tallest member of the national team at 2.03 meters, but has since been demoted to 2nd tallest with the inclusion of Luke Charteris. He represented Wales at both under-19 and under-21 levels. Evans made his Celtic League debut against Munster as a replacement in September 2005.

It has been adapted into a popular TV drama series of the same name. == Summary == Set in an alternate world where the Korean monarchy still exists, Chae-kyung Shin is an ordinary strong-willed girl who attends the same high school as Shin Lee, the crown prince of Korea. After accidentally witnessing Shin proposing to his girlfriend Hyo-rin and being rejected, Chae-kyung unexpectedly learns that she will marry Shin and become Crown Princess of Korea. Due to a promise between the former king of Korea and her grandfather, Chae-kyung has been betrothed to the seemingly cold-hearted prince of Korea. Meanwhile, Shin's cousin Yul unexpectedly returns from England with his mother, the wife of the king's deceased older brother - both with their own plans to take what they believe rightfully belong to Yul: the position of the crown prince and Chae-kyung, the girl who was intended to be the wife of the crown prince. Both unwilling parties agree to the marriage, each with his and her own different motivations for the agreement to marry. Chae-kyung is forced into the difficult and restrictive role of the crown princess, being forced to live in the palace without permission to return home and learn its endless traditions and rituals. Her only comfort appears to be Shin's assurance that he will divorce her if she cannot adjust to palace life. However, they fall deeply in love with one another, in spite of everything that begins to pull them apart. == Characters == *Chae-kyung Shin (Ïã†Ï±ÑÍ≤Ω, Shin Chae-gyeong) : Chae- kyung is a lively and strong-willed ordinary high school girl who attends the same school as Shin Lee, the Crown Prince of Korea. Although she often seems immature and irritating, she is a kindhearted, innocent, honest person. Because her grandfather was best friends with the previous king of Korea, the previous King dictated that Chae-kyung is to become the Crown Princess, and she will marry the grandson who is the Crown Prince at the time of the marriage. After realizing how her impoverished family would benefit from the marriage, she reluctantly agrees to marry Shin, though palace life causes her to suffer and her health declines. Despite constantly reacting to Shin with irritation, Chae-kyung falls in love with Shin while believing that her love for him is unreciprocated. When Shin finally reveals he returns her feelings, they are forced to divorce due to Yul blackmailing the Queen. Chae-kyung tries to move on with her life, though she finds she is unable to let go of her love for Shin. *Shin Lee (Ïù¥Ïã†, Lee Shin) : The crown prince of Korea, Shin appears to be a cold and indifferent young man. After his girlfriend Hyo-rin turns down his marriage proposal, he decides to go along with his elders' arranged marriage with Chae-kyung to satisfy them. While initially irritated by her naivete and enthusiasm, he recognizes how genuinely sweet she is, he begins to open his heart to her, and falls deeply in love. Throughout the series, it becomes obvious that inside, he is just a lonely, sensitive, warm and kind young man. As his cousin re-enters the picture after being forced out of the country many years earlier, the prince quickly butts head with him, as Yul is a contender not only for the throne, but for the crown princess Chae-kyung's love. After being forced to divorce Chae-kyung, he becomes determined to find a way for them to be together again, but becomes divided by his responsibilities as the crown prince and his love for her. *Yul Lee (Ïù¥Ïú®, Lee Yul) : Yul is Shin's cousin; at birth, he was the son of the current king's older brother, who died before becoming king. After living many years abroad in England with his mother, the widow of the former crown prince, he returns to Korea, apparently set on taking back what he believes rightfully belongs to him: his title as crown prince and Chae-kyung, the girl who was intended for the crown prince. While he expresses a kindhearted personality, charisma and good looks make him an instant hit with the girls, Yul hides his twisted and manipulative true nature. Being born as the crown prince he has a prideful and arrogant demeanor and has great contempt for Shin and his parents for taking what he considers his god given right. Originally uninterested in the throne, Yul decides to follow his mother's wishes and compete with Shin for the throne after falling in love with Chae-kyung and resorts to underhanded tactics to obtain both. *Hyo-rin Seong (ÏÑ±Ìö®Î¶∞, Seong Hyo-rin) : Hyo-rin is a skilled ballerina, as well as a beautiful and intelligent young woman who is Shin's girlfriend at the beginning of the series. However, she rejects Shin's proposal, dismissing it as a joke and being unwilling to give up her dreams to live a cloistered life in the palace. After he marries Chae-kyung, Hyo-rin comes to reject her hasty decision and tries to draw Shin back to her by various means, particularly with the revelation that she can no longer dance due to a leg injury. After realizing that Shin has come to love Chae-kyung, Hyo-rin gives up her attempts, which have come to hurt her more than anyone else. She develops an uncertain friendship with Chae-kyung's younger brother, Chae-jun, who had approached her initially out of fear that Hyo-rin was trying to ruin his sister and brother-in-law's relationship. Though she tries to become Shin's wife after his divorce from Chae-kyung, she ultimately gives up on him after realizing that his heart belongs only to Chae-kyung. *The King (Íµ≠Ïôï, Gugwang) :The current King of Korea, Shin's father. The King was actually the second son of the previous king; the death of his older brother resulted in the King's advancement as crown prince when the senate feared what Yul's mother would do if she were to serve as Yul's regent. Though regarded as a wise and dignified man who is respected for his moderate reforms, the King maintains deep guilt for exiling Yul and his mother, particularly after his father had requested that the King make Yul the crown prince rather than Shin. In hopes of resolving the past, the King eventually elects to make Yul the crown prince and give Shin the freedom to remarry Chae-kyung and live as an ordinary person. *The Queen (Ï§ëÏ†Ñ, Joongjeon) :The Queen of Korea, Shin's mother. Though she comes across as blunt and cold, the Queen loves both her sons greatly and cares for Chae-kyung as her own daughter and is deeply torn when Yul blackmails her into forcing Chae-kyung and Shin's divorce in order to protect the royal family. The incident pushes the queen to move beyond her feelings to only serve as queen to bringing retribution on Yul's mother and Yul for bringing misery upon Shin and the king. Once Yul's blackmail is exposed, the Queen gradually accepts Shin's wish to be with Chae-kyung again and encourages their relationship. *Grand Royal Queen Dowager (ÎåÄÏôïÎåÄÎπÑ, Daewang- daebi) :The dowager queen, Shin and Yul's grandmother. A conservative woman who is the greatest obstacle for the King's attempt to reform the palace and the royal family's role in government, she is a morally upright woman. While in private she is a silly person who is genuinely fond of Chae-kyung's liveliness and appears to want nothing more than for Shin and Chae-kyung to have a child, the Grand Royal Queen Dowager is a politically astute woman who wishes to protect the royal family. Though she was considerably stricter in her youth, the difficulties in Chae-kyung and Shin's relationship has softened her views and she sincerely wants them to be happy together. *Uibin, the Queen Dowager (ÎåÄÎπÑ, Daebi) :Yul's mother, a woman who married the current king's older brother in order to become crown princess. Though she had loved the King in their youth, she chose to marry his older brother out of ambition and the desire to change the palace. However, she and Shin's father maintained an illicit affair for a brief time during their marriages. When her husband died prematurely, she and Yul were exiled to England in order prevent a succession struggle between Yul and Shin. When she and her son return, the beginning of her plan to restore Yul's former position as crown prince is marked by the posthumous promotion of her late husband as a king, resulting in her status as a daebi (queen dowager) in the royal family. She particularly does not like Chae-kyung, regarding her as an empty headed child of common status. Though she is coldhearted and ruthless with her methods, she is a deeply sad woman who only wants Yul to have she believes he deserves. *Chae-jun Shin (Ïã†Ï±ÑÏ§Ä, Shin Chae-jun) :Chae-kyung's younger brother, an innocent boy who is still attending junior high school when Chae-kyung marries Shin. Out of worry for his sister and Shin's relationship, Chae-jun begins following Hyo-rin, believing that she will cause Shin and Chae-kyung to break up. However, Chae- jun begins to fall in love with Hyo-rin after seeing how vulnerable she is under her cool exterior. Though he allows Hyo-rin to depend on him emotionally while she is still interested in Shin, he is angered by Hyo-rin's repeated willingness to take advantage of him in order to separate Chae-kyung and Shin. When Hyo-rin uses his fear that Chae-kyung is the reason behind Yul's attempt to usurp the throne, Chae-jun breaks off their relationship after Chae-kyung is badly injured because of Hyo-rin's machinations. They gradually resume their friendship, once Hyo-rin has given up Shin for good and Chae-jun has managed to forgive her. *Sun Lee (Ïù¥ÏÑ†, Lee Seon) :Shin's younger brother, who is born when Shin and Chae-kyung are about eighteen years old. His birth further complicates the plans Yul's mother has to usurp Shin's position as crown prince. In order to protect his mother and Sun, Shin gives up his plans to leave his position as crown prince, which furthers the strain on his relationship with Chae-kyung. A charming and affectionate child, he is well- loved by his family and he looks up to Shin. After Sun innocently remarks on a national interview that his brother wishes to leave his position to Sun in order to remarry Chae-kyung, Shin notices that Sun is surprisingly ambitious and expresses the desire to become king one day. *Mi-Roo Oh (Ïò§ÎØ∏Î£®, Oh Mi-ru) : The daughter of a rich family, Mi-roo is betrothed to Yul against his will. Because of her immature and haughty attitude, she is disliked amongst the palace maids and even Yul's mother, who had chosen her for her status and ambition to become queen. She appears to trust very few people and often deceives others to her advantage. Though she appears interested in Shin, she devotes her affections entirely to Yul after she witnesses his ambition. When she learns that Yul is unwilling to give up his feelings for Chae-kyung, she deliberately plans for Chae-kyung and Shin to meet and give into their feelings for one another. In spite of Yul's revulsion towards her, his attempts to get rid of her only encourage her feelings for him. Yul gradually develops an attachment to her, though apparently unaware of the extent of her two-sided personality. == Korean terms == The setting of Goong reflects the status of the monarchy of Korea during the Joseon period, seen in most of the titles and styles of the royal family. In Korean, the speech used in the royal household was different from that used by commoners, which served to distinguish and separate the royal family from ordinary citizens. Royal children addressed their parents and grandparents with different terms. Recurring Terms * Seja - Crown Prince * Sejabin - Crown Prince's wife * Uhma- mama - Respectful way to say \\"Mother\\" to the queen by her children. * Ahba- mama - Respectful way to say \\"Father\\" to the king by his children. * Halma- mama - Respectful way to say \\"Grandmother\\" to the royal grandmother by her grandchildren == Live-action adaptations == In 2006, a live-action television adaptation of the manga was broadcast from 11 January to 30 March 2006 on Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), starring Yoon Eun-hye, Ju Ji-hoon, Kim Jeong-hoon and Song Ji-hyo.

It was discovered in 1968 by an amateur archaeologist and excavated from 1978 to 1979. By then, the burial mound covering the grave, originally 6 m (20 ft) in height and about 60 m (200 ft) in diameter, had shrunk to about 1 m (3 ft) in height and was hardly discernible due to centuries of erosion and agricultural use. A man, roughly 40 years of age and 6 ft 2 in (187 cm) tall, was laid out on an exceptionally richly decorated 9 ft (275 cm) bronze recliner with eight wheels inside the burial chamber. Judging by other objects found there, this man probably had been a Celtic chieftain: He had been buried with a gold- plated torc on his neck, a bracelet on his right arm, a hat made of birch bark, a gold-plated dagger made of bronze and iron, rich clothing, amber jewelry, a razor knife, a nail clipper, a comb, fishing hooks, arrows, and most notably, thin embossed gold plaques which were on his now-disintegrated shoes. At the foot of the couch was a large cauldron decorated with three lions around the brim. This cauldron was originally filled with about 100 gallons (400 l) of mead. The east side of the tomb contained an iron-plated wooden four-wheeled wagon holding a set of bronze dishes‚Äîalong with the drinking horns found on the walls enough to serve nine people. After the examination of the grave, the burial mound has been reconstructed to its original height. Nearby a museum about this grave was built, during the construction of which the foundations of an ancient Celtic village were found, probably the one to which the chieftain belonged. These were incorporated into the museum. ==Gallery== Image:Hochdorf keltenmuseum0815.jpgReconstruction of the Celtic Grave in the Museum Image: hochdorf golden shoes ornaments.jpgHochdorf Chieftain's Grave, golden shoes ornaments Image: hochdorf dagger with gold foil.jpgDagger with gold foil Image: hochdorf drinking horn.jpgDrinking horn ==References== *James, Simon. 1993.

The legion's garrison, according to legend, was in the Egyptian town of Thebes. Roman Emperor Maximianus Herculius ordered the legion to march to Gaul and assist in subduing rebels from Burgundy. At some point during their march, the legion refused to follow the emperor's orders either to kill fellow Christians or to worship Maximianus Herculius as a god. As a result, a large number of legionaries were martyred in Agaunum, now named Saint Maurice-en-Valais after Saint Maurice.

He is often regarded as China's first guitar hero. == Early life == Liu was born in Tianjin, China. Most sources list his birth year as 1962, although one source specifies his birthday as 10 January 1963. \\"Lao Wu\\" was the fifth child in the family, and acquired the nickname early in his youth. The family moved to nearby Langfang in 1971, during the Cultural Revolution. Liu's older sister was involved in an arts-and-literature propaganda team; as a result, he grew up surrounded by musical instruments. He studied the erhu for two years during primary school. At the end of 1976, Liu got his first guitar. Upon failing the cutoff for the gaokao by ten points, Liu realized that music was the only way he could make a living, and threw himself into practicing guitar up to fifteen hours a day. Liu's father, who initially disapproved of his son's career path, changed his mind after witnessing Liu's dedication, and agreed to support him. Around 1982 or 1983, Liu left Langfang and moved to Beijing, living in a house with fellow musician Liu Junli. There, he continued to practice guitar, working odd jobs to make ends meet. Liu lived in poverty for over four years, surviving on instant noodles and becoming hospitalized on at least one occasion due to malnutrition. Liu formed a band called White Angel () in 1986 with Zang Tianshuo, Liu Junli, Feng Mantian, and Cheng Jin. The group released one album, Past Rock n' Roll () in 1989, which sold a few hundred copies. White Angel disbanded later that year when Liu Junli left to play bass in Cui Jian's band. Liu briefly played in a group called Shixiao (), a band set up to advertise a local travel agency of the same name. Shixiao featured future Tang Dynasty members Gu Zhong and Zhao Nian at various points. Soon after arriving in Beijing, Liu befriended future Tang Dynasty frontman Ding Wu. Having heard that Ding played guitar, Liu searched all over Beijing on a borrowed bicycle until he tracked down the latter teaching basic art at Beijing's No. 132 Secondary School. This meeting would prove pivotal; after the Tiananmen Square protests forced founding Tang Dynasty guitarist Kaiser Kuo to flee China, Ding Wu invited Liu to replace him. == Musical career  1989-1996: Tang Dynasty === Liu joined Tang Dynasty in October 1989. In 1990, the band signed with Magic Stone Records, which launched a multinational marketing campaign to promote the band. Tang Dynasty quickly attracted international attention. In 1992, Spin magazine labeled Liu \\"hands-down the best guitarist in China\\" ‚Äì an assessment often repeated by Chinese rock fans and journalists. The band's self-titled debut album was released internationally in December 1992, and cemented Tang Dynasty's place in history as one of China's most influential rock bands. Liu's \\"lightning-fast\\" guitar work was central to the band's sound, which combined Western metal and progressive rock with overt influences from Chinese literary, martial, and musical traditions. Over the next three years, Tang Dynasty toured China, as well as overseas in Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong. However, Liu eventually became dissatisfied with the band's music, feeling that it was \\"too Westernized\\" and \\"lacked originality\\". While Tang Dynasty were writing their second album, he stopped playing guitar for about six months, leading his bandmates to think Liu had lost his mind. The death of bassist Zhang Ju in May 1995 dealt a severe blow to the band. Liu subsequently developed personal and artistic conflicts with Ding Wu, who asked him to leave Tang Dynasty in August 1996. === 1996-2001: Solo career === After leaving Tang Dynasty, Liu remained active as a guitar teacher. His first solo album, 1997's Walking in the Fog (), featured appearances from several of his students. The title track and \\"Dance\\" (Ëàû) were featured on the compilation China Fire III, released in 1998. Liu released his second solo album, Return Again () in 1999. The music was largely instrumental and folk-oriented. Both albums were released under the moniker \\"ÂîêÊúùËÄÅ‰∫î\\" (; lit. \\"Tang Dynasty's Old Five\\"). In 2000, he helped establish the School of Modern Culture and Art (), a contemporary music school in Beijing, where he served as principal. Liu formed a solo band which performed sporadically throughout 2001, but disbanded the group at the end of the year. === 2002‚Äì09: Rejoining Tang Dynasty === Liu rejoined Tang Dynasty at the beginning of 2002, sharing lead guitar duties with guitarist Chen Lei. Tang Dynasty's third album, Romantic Knight, was released on 13 June 2008. The album showcased deeper Chinese musical influences than had been on the group's earlier releases. In a 2007 interview with Culture Express, Liu explained that \\"each member tries to cultivate himself in traditional Chinese culture by reading ancient poetry, playing the guqin, practicing calligraphy, and painting. Without these elements absorbed by the heart and soul, everything would be superficial\\". The album sold around 50,000 copies within the first three to four months of release. === 2009‚Äìpresent: Recent activity === On 16 January 2009, Liu announced his second departure from Tang Dynasty due to \\"personal reasons\\" and \\"in cooperation with the idea of music with the band.\\" The same year, he collaborated with Sainkho Namtchylak on an unreleased album. Liu composed the soundtrack for the 2012 drama film Beijing Flickers (), directed by Zhang Yuan. Liu continues to give solo performances under the name \\"ÂîêÊúùËÄÅ‰∫î\\". In 2012, he joined Liu Sola and Friends, a musical collective which combines Chinese folk music with American jazz and blues. == Painting == Liu took up painting around 1992. He works primarily with pencils, ballpoint pens, and ink brushes. In 2015, he opened his first solo exhibit, which contained over thirty paintings dating back as far as 1993. Liu augmented the exhibition by playing a sounding stone during the event. On working within two mediums ‚Äì art and music ‚Äì Liu states \\"I don't belong to rock and roll and I don't belong to art. I belong to my own nature, and I am satisfied if I can mold it into something beautiful.\\" == Musical style == Liu is considered to be one of China's first shredders, and his style was a defining aspect of Tang Dynasty's influential sound. Andrew Jones, in his writeup for Spin, noted that Liu could \\"wrench new sounds out of his instrument that have the power to shock with their strange beauty\\", while Black Panther guitarist Li Tong described Liu's playing as \\"ferocious\\" and \\"full of power\\". A saying among contemporary Chinese rock circles went \\"the South has Laozai, the North has Laowu\\" ‚Äì with \\"Laozai\\" referring to Zhejiang-born guitarist Wu Liqun. Liu's early influences include Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, Michael Angelo Batio, Yngwie Malmsteen, Queensr√øche, and King Crimson. He has played with Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, and Stu Hamm. As time went on, Liu's playing became increasingly influenced by Chinese folk styles, which can be heard in both Tang Dynasty's music and his own solo compositions. He often employs a technique that involved him strumming with his thumb and index finger while using the remaining three fingers to pluck the strings ‚Äì an approach similar to hybrid picking. His solo work heavily utilizes the acoustic guitar, on which he often takes a guqin-inspired approach, and incorporates extended techniques such as tapped harmonics and drumming on the guitar's body. Liu was notably one of the first guitarists in China to make use of a seven-string guitar, which can be heard in his solo work. As early as 1992, Liu expressed a desire to \\"come up with something that goes beyond the boundaries\\" through reconnecting with Chinese musical traditions. He stated that \\"[Modern] Chinese culture has never lived up to the tradition because it's been ruined by all the Western influence. We have to get back to our roots...that's what the mission of [Chinese rock] should be about.\\" == Personal life == On 3 July 2004, Liu married Chen Xiaomu, his longtime girlfriend of 11 years. == Selected discography == A full list of Liu's credits can be found here: === Tang Dynasty === * 1992 ‚Äì ÂîêÊúù (Tang Dynasty) *2008 ‚Äì Êµ™Êº´È™ëÂ£´ (Romantic Knight) === Solo (as ÂîêÊúùËÄÅ‰∫î) === * 1997 ‚Äì Èõæ‰∏≠Ë°åÈõÜ (Walking in the Fog) ‚Äì tracks: \\"Ëàû\\"; \\"Èõæ‰∏≠Ë°å\\" * 1998 ‚Äì ÂÜçÂ∫¶ÂΩíÊù• (Return Again) === Other appearances ===  With White Angel  * 1989 (reissued 1995) ‚Äì ËøáÂéªÁöÑÊëáÊªö (Past Rock n' Roll)  With Zhao Muyang  * 1991 ‚Äì ÊµÅÊµ™ (Wandering)  With He Yong * 1994 ‚Äì ÂûÉÂúæÂú∫ (Garbage Dump)  With Wang Yong * 1996 ‚Äì ÂæÄÁîü (Samsara) ‚Äì tracks: \\"ÊãõÈ≠Ç\\"  Compilations  * 1995 ‚Äì ÂëäÂà´ÁöÑÊëáÊªö (A Tribute to Teresa Teng) ‚Äì tracks: \\"Áã¨‰∏äË•øÊ•º\\" * 1997 ‚Äì ÂÜçËßÅÂº†ÁÇ¨ (Goodbye Zhang Ju) ‚Äì tracks: \\"ÈÇ£‰∏ÄÂ§©\\"; \\"Ê¥ªÂú®‰Ω†ÁöÑÊ¢¶Èáå\\"; \\"ÊàëÁöÑÁù´ÊØõÈÉΩÂø´Ë¢´ÂêπÊéâ‰∫Ü\\"; \\"ÊúàÊ¢¶\\"; \\"ÊÑõÂíåËá™Áî±ÁöÑÁøÖËÜÄÔºçÂñúÈ¶¨ÊãâÈõÖ‰πãÊóÖ\\" * 2005 ‚Äì Á§ºÁâ© (Gift) ‚Äì tracks: \\"Á§ºÁâ©\\"; \\"Êò•Ëöï\\" === Soundtracks === * 2012 ‚Äì ÊúâÁßç (Beijing Flickers) ==See also== *Chinese rock ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese guitarists Category:Chinese rock musicians Category:Chinese heavy metal guitarists Category:People's Republic of China musicians Category:Musicians from Tianjin ","title":"Liu Yijun (guitarist)"},{"id":"7463777","text":"Nagarik (), also spelled as Nagorik, The Citizen in English, was the first feature-length film directed by legendary Indian director Ritwik Ghatak. Completed in 1952, it preceded Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali as perhaps the first example of an art film in Bengali cinema, but is deprived of that honor, since it was released twenty-four years later, after Ghatak's death. On 20 September 1977, it finally premiered at the New Empire theatre in Kolkata, India. Ritwik Ghatak directed only eight feature films, but is generally regarded as one of the auteurs of Indian cinema and virtually unsurpassed as a creator of powerful imagery and epic style by directors such as Satyajit Ray and of transcendental power and extraordinariness by critics such as Derek Malcolm. == Synopsis == Ramu, a fresh graduate is searching for a job like many others in post-Partition Kolkata. The mother is yearnful of older times when the family used to live in a better house, but she bears her suffering quietly, for the most part. The father is myopic and full of cynicism for he does not share the idealistic aspirations of his two children that better times will come. The light of Ramu's life is his girlfriend Uma, who lives in an equally precarious situation with her sister Shephali and her mother. Jatin is an even poorer minor character living near Uma's dwelling who Ramu avoids because he cannot help the former out financially. To make ends meet, Ramu's mother takes in Sagar, a poor chemist, as a paying guest. Ramu does not get a job and cannot pay rent even with the meagre money that he gets from Sagar and is insulted by the landlord. Ultimately the family is evicted. Just before the family has to leave to go stay in slums, Ramu visits Uma and tells him they are moving. Uma offers to help them set up in the new dwelling, an obvious sign of humanism on Ghatak's part. Shephali, her sister, cannot bear to live in poverty any longer, so she leaves home with a shady man. Seeta confesses that she loves Sagar, a love that Sagar reciprocates. However, Sagar, is now rendered homeless and destitute and mentions that he does not have the audacity to expect them to even be united. Ramu overhears parts of Sagar and Uma's conversation and is touched by the moment. He appeals to Sagar for him to come and live with the family. The film ends with the characters walking out in the rain, a symbolic sign of hope and renewal. ==CreditsCast=== * Satindra Bhattacharya as Ramu * Prova Debi as his mother * Kali Banerjee as his father * Sova Sen as his sister, Seeta * Ketaki Dutta as Uma * Geeta Shome as Shephali * Ajit Banerjee as Sagar * Keshto Mukherjee as Jatin * Master Pintoo * Anil Ghosh * Umanath Bhattacharya ===Crew=== * Direction and Screenplay, Ritwik Ghatak * Cinematography, Ramananda Sengupta * Editing, Ramesh Joshi * Sound, Satyen Chatterjee * Narration, Ritwik Ghatak * Music, Anil Chandra Sengupta * Lyrics, Govinda Moonish * Art Direction, Bhupen Majumdar * Production, Film Guild == Soundtracks == All music of the film composed by music director Anil Chandra Sengupta * Majh ye to majhdhar... * Majhu pran kathin kathor... ==Critical analysis== Nagarik is considered a prototype for Ghatak's subsequent films since all of the main ingredients are present. The tone is deliberately didactic and the treatment melodramatic, elements which Ghatak in no way considered inferior to realism. The pain of the Partition is poignant among the protagonists, all refugees from East Bengal, now suffering from the loss of homeland and livelihood. This is a theme that Ghatak helped portray when working on Chinnamul, and one that would permeate most of his later creations. The film is not a study in pessimism but ends on a positive note with a speech by Ramu hoping for a new future. This has been considered overtly Marxist considering Ghatak's involvement with group theatre and the IPTA. The film is thought to be well scripted, acted, and filmed with scenes that show unique visual and aural registers. However, it is also criticized as being slow and long-drawn. Although the film shows the influence of French director Jean Renoir, it lies very much in a developing tradition of Indian film. Its film noir feel and stylised manner has something in common with contemporary works in Hindi cinema by Guru Dutt and Kamal Amrohi. It particularly shows the influence of the latter's Mahal (1949) in its use of narration, use of music, stylised direction of the acting and in several verbal echoes. It was also clearly known to Ghatak's Bengali contemporary Satyajit Ray and strongly influences his The World of Apu (1959), the third in the Apu Trilogy. Nagarik is, therefore, a pivotal work in the history of Indian cinema. ===Remarks=== \\" instead of blind imitation of the realism, the artist here explored the inner essence of the realistic situations. That shows the class of his artistic self.\\"‚ÄîJoshodhra Bagchi \\" No matter how much flaws it has, Nagarik(Citizen) is the reflection of what profound depth an artist's love and honesty could go. If the artist's responsibility is to true to life, being responsible to time,and to guide people on their path, Ritwik's 'Nagarik' not only in 52's context, but equally acceptable in today's generation.\\"‚ÄîSomnath Mukhopadhay \\" The conflict we get in the 50s star-studded so-called unreal 'social' films, was all love or family-centric; mostly stuffed by the conflicts born out of personal feeling or emotion. Material world was almost unsed safeguarded backdrop. In 'Nagarik', Ritwik bound time, society and character in an organic relationship.\\"‚ÄîSomeswar Bhowmick \\" Gifted as he was with a historical vision Ritwik made pioneering use of sound as an instrument of structuring his film in a dialectical framework. In his hands, for the first time,, sound in Indian cinema graduated from merely amplifying dialogue and 'effect' music to becoming a conscious part of the whole design serving as much as to heighten as to comment, analyse and throw into analytical perspective the immediate dialogical and narrative context.Another innovation...in 'Nagarik'...was the device of using deep focus to place his characters firmly in their social environment.\\"‚ÄîSafder Hasmi \\" Nagarik...was not so clearly the product of natural film-maker. But its story of a young man in search of a job, based on the plot of a didactic play, is by no means lacking in interest...the central character reflects the perplexity of Bimal, Ghatak's lower caste taxi-driver, and unquestionably the same feeling for individuals caught up in the toils of a fragmented society is there.\\"‚ÄîDerek Malcolm. == Screening of Nagarik aka The Citizen in different festivals == 2017: Ritwik Ghatak Retrospective UK, at Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee, Scotland, UK, Programme curated by Sanghita Sen, Department of Film Studies, St Andrews University, UK == See also == * List of works of Ritwik Ghatak ==References Notes = Citations === * . * . == External links == * Category:Bengali-language films Category:1953 films Category:Indian films Category:Films directed by Ritwik Ghatak Category:Films set in Kolkata ","title":"Nagarik"},{"id":"7463778","text":"Lee Martin Byrne (born 1 June 1980) is a Welsh former professional rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s and 2010s. Byrne started his career playing rugby union for Bridgend Athletic RFC; and Tondu RFC, as a full-back or wing, and after being spotted playing rugby league for Bridgend Blue Bulls, he signed for the Llanelli Scarlets. Following his good performances for the Llanelli Scarlets in both the Celtic League, and the Heineken Cup during the 2005‚Äì06 season, he was called up to the national squad for the November Test series. He made his d√©but as a replacement against the All Blacks on 5 November at the Millennium Stadium. Wales lost 3‚Äì41. He also played in the win over Fiji, and the defeat by South Africa. He has since played during the 2006 Six Nations Championship, and earned a further two caps in a mid-year series against Argentina. His sole appearance in the 2006 Autumn internationals was on the wing against the Pacific Islands. Byrne was a revelation in the 2008 Six Nations Championship tournament at full back and a key component of Wales' Grand Slam. While playing against Connacht in 2007, Byrne demonstrated his abilities as a stand-in kicker when he kicked two penalties and two conversions after fly-half Shaun Connor went off injured. He scored tries against England and Italy in the 2008 Six Nations Championship. Following his superb performances for Wales in the 2008 Autumn Internationals against South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia (which included a try against the latter), Byrne had been tipped not only for a place in the British and Irish Lions squad, but also a place in the starting 15.Jeremy Guscott column on the BBC This was confirmed on 21 April 2009, when Byrne, along with Ireland's Rob Kearney, were selected as one of the British and Irish Lions' fullbacks for the tour.

He caused controversy again in February 2010 during the Scotland match when Scotland's coach Andy Robinson accused Byrne of diving to get substitute fly-half Phil Godman sent off and give Wales a penalty, from which they scored and went on to win the match. Given permission to seek a new club for the 2011‚Äì12 season, Byrne signed a three-year deal to play for French club ASM Clermont Auvergne, where he will play his club rugby post the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Easter Week is the period of seven days from Easter Sunday through the Saturday following. It follows Holy Week. The term Octave of Easter includes Easter Week and the following Sunday (now called Divine Mercy Sunday in the Roman Catholic Church). ==Western Church== In the Latin Rite of Catholicism, Anglican and other Western churches, Easter Week is the week beginning with the Christian feast of Easter and ending a week later on Easter Saturday. The term is sometimes inaccurately used to mean the week before Easter, which is properly known as Holy Week, and particularly confusing in this context is the secular misuse of the term Easter Saturday to refer to the day known liturgically as Holy Saturday or Easter Eve (the day before Easter), rather than the Saturday following Easter. While the first day of Easter Week is called Easter Day or Easter Sunday, the other days in the week may be designated according to any of the following patterns: (1) Monday of Easter Week (e.g. in the Church of England's Common Worship calendar), (2) Monday in Easter Week (e.g., in the Anglican Church's Book of Common Prayer calendar), or (3) Easter Monday. In former years, Easter, as the most important celebration in Christianity, was observed for a week, and it still is celebrated in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church and Anglicanism with an octave. The Te Deum is sung at the conclusion of Matins/Office of Readings and the Gloria in excelsis Deo is sung at Mass each day of the Octave. The paschal sequence, Victimae Paschali Laudes, may be sung before the Gospel reading on each of these days as well and the gospel readings for each of these days is a scriptural account of the resurrection of Christ (Monday‚ÄîMatthew 28:8-15; Tuesday‚ÄîJohn 20:11-18; Wednesday‚ÄîLuke 24:13-35; Thursday‚ÄîLuke 24:35-48; Friday‚ÄîJohn 21:1-14; Saturday‚ÄîMark 16:9-15). Owing to modern working patterns, many Easter celebrations now occur only on Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (the latter known in some places, especially those under Polish and Bohemian influence, as \\"Dyngus Day\\"). Easter Tuesday is a public holiday in Tasmania observed by some awards/agreements and the State Public Service. Easter Monday is also a national holiday in the Scandinavian countries which have Lutheran state churches, and in The Netherlands. ==Eastern Church== In the Eastern Orthodox Church and in Eastern Catholic Churches, the days of Bright Week are named: Bright Monday, Bright Tuesday, etc. Each day repeats the joyful hymns of Pascha (Easter), with only a few variations, taken from the Octoechos, according to the Eight Tones of the Orthodox liturgy. One tone (with the exception of the Seventh Tone‚Äîknown as the \\"Grave Tone\\") is assigned to each day: * Sunday of Pascha (Tone One) * Bright Monday (Tone Two) * Bright Tuesday (Tone Three) * Bright Wednesday (Tone Four) * Bright Thursday (Tone Five) * Bright Friday (Tone Six) * Bright Saturday (Tone Eight) Bright Week is considered to be one single joyful day, although the celebrations on the Sunday of Pascha are the most solemn. The Divine Services are completely different during this time than any other time of the year. Everything during the service is sung joyfully, rather than read. There is no reading from the Psalter, and the services are much shorter than usual. There is no fasting during Bright Week. The Holy Doors in the iconostasis remain open throughout the entire week, and the Artos (a leavened loaf of bread that was blessed during the Paschal Vigil) remains in the church and is venerated by everyone as they enter the temple as a way of \\"greeting the Resurrected Christ\\". Bright Friday is the annual feast day of the Theotokos (Mother of God), as the \\"Life- giving Spring\\", and there are optional hymns which may be chanted in honor of the feast in addition to the paschal hymns. If any other feasts on the fixed cycle occur during Bright Week, they are transferred to a convenient day after Thomas Sunday. Just before the beginning of the Ninth Hour on Bright Saturday, the Holy Doors are closed, and the services begin to return to their more normal form, although the chanting of the Troparion of Pascha, \\"Christ is risen from the dead...\\", as well as certain other paschal hymns, continue to be chanted until Ascension. ==ReferencesSee also== *Divine Mercy Sunday *Eastertide *Octave of Easter ==External links== Week Category:Weeks Category:Christian processions ru:–°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∞—è —Å–µ–¥–º–∏—Ü–∞ ","title":"Easter Week"},{"id":"7463816","text":"Glenn Martin Roberts (born 4 November 1973) is a former English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1996 and 2002.

He was awarded both the Air Force Cross and the Military Cross during his time in the military. Shakespeare later worked as a civilian pilot for Handley Page, captaining the first passenger flight from London to Athens, and eventually became president of the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA). He also served as president of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, for whom he had earlier played first-class cricket. == Early years == William Shakespeare was the eldest son of William and Barbara Shakespeare of Chadsworth, Barbourne, Worcester. He was educated at Worcester Royal Grammar School and joined the 1/8th Worcestershire Regiment (Territorial Force) at the commencement of World War I. He served with this unit at the front for over twelve months. He was given a commission and attached to the 6th Worcestershire Regiment, and afterwards transferred to the Royal Flying Corps . ==As a pilot== As a pilot, in July 1918 Shakespeare won the Military Cross. His medal was awarded after he successfully carried out two patrols, one in \\"very bad weather\\" and one under intense fire. The citation praised him as \\"a gallant and determined pilot\\". A few months later, he gained the Air Force Cross. \\"T./Capt. William Harold Nelson Shakespeare,R.F.C. was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He carried out a most successful contact patrol in very bad weather at a height of 400 feet and brought back very valuable information. Later, he carried out another successful contact patrol at a low altitude, his machine being subjected to intense rifle and machine-gun fire. He is a gallant and determined pilot and has set a fine example to his squadron.\\" Supplement to the London Gazette. 5. July 1918. He transferred across to the Royal Air Force when the organisation came into being on 01 Apr 1918, and was one of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Hugh Montague Trenchard's first Wing Commanders. After the First World War, he became one of the pioneers of military and civil transport aviation. While still serving in the RAF, his services were employed by Handley Page to promote their new commercial passenger service in the Handley Page 0.400 series, which after the end of the First World War, had been converted from a bomber to a passenger aircraft. He was the captain of the first pan European flight from London to Athens, a flight which took place to promote Handley Page and prove the capability of the Aircraft. While in Athens, he met and flew with the King of Greece who was also a keen aviator. ==As a cricketer== Shakespeare played 26 first-class matches for Worcestershire between 1919 and 1931. He made his first-class debut in August 1919 against Warwickshire; this was a friendly match as Worcestershire did not enter the County Championship that season. Opening the batting with Alfred Cliff, he had a fine match, scoring 62 in the first innings and 67 not out (which was to remain his career best) in the second. His Wisden obituary wrongly states that 62* was his highest score. He played one further match that year and three in 1920 but could not replicate his initial form, with a top score of only 11 in six innings. In 1924, Shakespeare finally returned to first-class cricket, scoring 62* against Glamorgan, and this time -- although he never made any really big scores -- he contributed useful thirties and forties fairly often. From 1926 onwards, however, his powers left him and he passed 20 only once in his last 14 innings. His first-class career really ended in 1928, but he did make one final appearance three years later. Although he never played at such a high level again, Shakespeare did appear for Worcestershire's second XI in the Minor Counties Championship as late as July 1949, when he was nearly 56. He also umpired one first-class game, that between Worcestershire and Combined Services at New Road in May 1950. ==Other activities== After the First World War, he became one of the pioneers of military and civil transport aviation. While still serving in the RAF his services were employed by Handley Page to promote their new commercial passenger service in the Handley Page 0.400 series, which after the end of the First World War, had been converted from a bomber to a passenger aircraft. He was the captain of the first pan European flight from London to Athens, a flight which took place to promote Handley Page and prove the capability of the aircraft. While in Athens, he met and flew with the King of Greece who was also a keen aviator. In later life, Shakespeare became president of RAFA as well as President of Worcestershire County Cricket Club. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1976. He was instrumental in the organising of the Victory test matches versus Australia. Shakespeare, chairman of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, is credited with being responsible for bringing the talents of Imran Khan to the UK. Approaching Khan at the age of 18 prior to the England tour of Pakistan in 1971. Shakespeare arranged that Imran should attend Worcester Royal Grammar School as a boarder, where he would take his A-levels and try for Oxford or Cambridge. A year later, Imran was on his way to Keble College, Oxford. This Oxford experience may have possibly slowed Imran's development as a cricketer, but he developed a broader perspective and gained experience of leadership. When he finally emerged as a top-ranking County and Test player, Imran was in his mid-twenties and was unusually well equipped as a human being for sport at the highest level. His Great Grandson, Flt Lt Keith William Brooke (Will) followed in Wg Cdr W.H.N.Shakespeare's footsteps and graduated RAF Officer training at Royal Air Force Cranwell on 5 November 2009.Royal Air Force : \\"Great-Grandfather's (RFC) sword. - Monday 9 November 2009 : Excerpt from the London Gazette, July 1918.\\" Retrieved 24 January 2010. Throughout the graduation ceremony, Flt Lt Brooke carried Wg Cdr Shakespeares Royal Flying Corps ceremonial sword, which was presented to him in 1914. He joined the RAF in March 1997 as an Assistant Air Traffic Controller and became an Air Traffic Control Officer when he was promoted to Sergeant in 2003, serving at various UK units and overseas, including operations in Iraq, Turkey, Oman, Bahrain and Afghanistan, where he was awarded the US Joint Service Commendation Medal and continues his service in the Royal Air Force as a Flight Operations Officer, currently serving as Military Assistant to the 3* Director General MoD Chief information Officer, MoD Whitehall. ==NotesReferences== * * * Wisden Obituaries in 1976 : William Shakespeare Category:1893 births Category:1976 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:English cricket umpires Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Recipients of the Air Force Cross (United Kingdom) Category:Royal Flying Corps officers Category:English aviators Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:British World War I pilots ","title":"William Harold Nelson Shakespeare"},{"id":"7463831","text":"Azygospore is an asexually formed zygospore in fungi.

In 1897, he moved to Katanning to become the Government Land Agent. In 1936, Industrial Extracts Ltd, which produced tanning extracts from white gum timber, proposed a townsite at the location of their Tannin Extracts Factory. The townsite was gazetted and named Ranford in 1936. The Lieutenant Governor, Sir James Mitchell, opened the factory on 21 April 1937.

Cooley portrayed the character from the show's first season in 2001 until the sixth season in 2007. ==Development== Jake Goldsbie originally auditioned for the role, but would later be cast as Toby Isaacs. Ryan Cooley found out he would leave the show \\"around\\" April 2006, prior to the filming of the sixth season. While surprised his character was being killed off, Cooley was contemplating going to a university and leaving the series. Cooley's last episode was \\"Rock This Town\\" where his character was stabbed. The episode aired in August 2006. ===Personality=== Throughout the series, J. T. is portrayed as a class clown who constantly makes jokes, with usually positive reception by his classmates and not by the person who he is making fun of. His joking often caused much of his own problems, including getting put in detention and even resulted in his relationship with Manny ending. ==Fictional character biography== ;Season 1 J. T. aids Manny and Toby in stopping Emma from being raped during a meeting with a sexual predator who posed as someone her age. When his seventh grade year started, J. T. was asked by Toby to run against his stepsister Ashley Kerwin for class president and he does before Ashley pays him eighty dollars to withdraw. Early in the school year, J. T. and Toby passed on going to the school dance in favor of looking at pornography websites. The two were caught by Toby's parents, who returned home earlier than expected and the pair were made by Toby's parents to look at pornography sites with men, in order to be taught a lesson on objectifying women. Liberty is revealed to be romantically interested in J. T., who does not like her back. After she takes the blame for him during class, her crush becomes obvious to Toby, Manny and Emma. J. T. denies it for a time, but realizes it and tries to act obnoxious to get her to stop liking him. Once this fails to work, he tells her that he is homosexual, which disappoints her but backfires when she asks to do an interview with him and have him come out of the closet and serve as an inspiration for other students struggling with coming to terms with their sexuality. When Emma has her period, J. T. mocks her for coming to class in oversized shorts, not knowing her other clothes were stained. He finds out when she reveals she is having her period to the class. ;Season 2 J. T. gains a crush on Paige, who is raped sometime after the two go on a date together and confesses this to him. When he learns of the rape and the identity of the offender, he attacks him. Despite being outclassed, J. T. is able to get him suspended when the boy attacks him in retaliation. ;Season 3 J. T. changes his appearance from the previous two seasons, abandoning his cap. The character also becomes attracted to childhood friend Manny Santos, who begins to dress more promiscuously. He stops her from exposing herself to the class when she volunteers and has to bend over as a result. When Liberty asks him out, after having crushed on him for years, J. T. rejects her and she asks him if he is rejecting her because of his feelings for Manny. J. T. is featured in a commercial. In anticipation for its premiere, he invites students from Degrassi, including Manny. She is the only one to not laugh at the commercial and even after Sean and Jay both mock him for his role in the commercial, she gives him a positive reception and the pair become friends again. He tries taking this one step further and asking her out to a dance, but backs out after seeing her with Craig, who she got pregnant by. When Manny confronts him about not asking her out, he admits that he chose not to when he saw her with him. Manny reveals that Craig wanted to see how she was doing since the abortion and the following day, J. T. confronts Manny. He apologizes and asks her out, which she accepts. ;Season 4 Early in the season, his relationship with Manny ends after she catches him trying to use a penis pump to make his penis bigger after seeing Craig Manning's, which made him feel his was too small. However, Manny discredited this and said that she was turned off by J. T.'s constant joking. He becomes good friends with Liberty's younger brother Danny Van Zandt and the pair shun Toby for being friends with Rick Murray, who was the perpetrator of the school shooting. After he is confronted by Manny, J. T. makes up with Toby and apologizes for treating him badly. J. T. and Danny had previously expressed dislike for Rick before the shooting and his death. J. T. and Liberty bond while working on a school play based on the school shooting. The pair end up in detention after Liberty sings their rebellion song to the school principal, where they share their first kiss and begin a relationship. The friendship between J. T. and Danny deteriorates after the latter realizes that J. T. is more interested in being with his sister than interacting with him. After Danny purposely fails to alert the pair of when his and Liberty's father is coming home and thus getting the two in trouble, he gets into a fight with J. T. and gets the pair both in trouble with his sister. Danny makes up for it by covering for the two when his father comes home. ;Season 5 J. T. and Liberty become sexually active over the summer and he speaks openly of his relations with her to Toby, frustrating Liberty. She pours a coup of soda down J. T.'s pants after hearing him talk to Toby and leaves. The following day, J. T. and Liberty argue over his immaturity and her controlling ways before she reveals she's pregnant, causing a surprised J. T. to crash his car. J. T. breaks up with Liberty after she continues to ignore his pleas for her to go to the doctor, but he gets a job at a pharmacy and swears to not abandon his unborn child. Danny learns of the pregnancy soon after and attacks J. T. and promises not to tell as long as the latter helps him with an assignment taking care of a baby doll. After the project fails, Danny still chooses not to tell his parents about his sister and J. T.'s secret. J. T. and Liberty argue a bit on whether to keep the baby or put it up for adoption, but ultimately decide to keep the baby. As a result, J. T. quits the job he loves at a children's TV show to pick up more hours at the pharmacy. Jay Hogart persuades J. T. to steal Oxycodone from the pharmacy and sell it to a friend of Jay's at the Ravine. J. T. tells the buyer that he needs more cash, so the buyer agrees to give J. T. an extra $400 as a payment on another score of drugs. When Liberty finds out about J. T.'s drug-dealing, she is infuriated and J. T. begins to regret his decision. He tells Liberty he will buy back the drugs from his buyer and never sell again. Meanwhile, he and Liberty decide it's time to tell their parents. J. T.'s grandmother doesn't take it well, which makes them both nervous about Liberty's parent's reactions. Liberty and J. T. first announce to them that they are moving to an apartment together, and then J. T. reveals that the two are having a child. Liberty's mother is relatively calm, but Liberty's father becomes angry and states he never wants to see J. T. again, but that they will help Liberty. Liberty tells her parents that regardless, she will be moving in with J. T. She storms out of the room and, loud enough so her parents could hear, tells J. T. to help her begin to pack. J. T. asks Toby for financial help in order to buy back the drugs, but Toby refuses and J. T. snaps at him, telling him, \\"This is why you don't have friends.\\" When J. T. confronts the buyer about getting the drugs back, they get in a physical fight which causes J. T. to steal Oxycodone from the pharmacy again because the buyer wants the drugs for which he'd already paid $400. He reveals to Liberty that he has to steal drugs again, and she is again upset with J. T. J. T. brings the pills to the Ravine again, and has some left over after selling several to the same buyer as before. He is distraught because he realizes he has lost everything he cares about, and takes all of the leftover pills as a suicide attempt. He collapses because of the overdose, and he is next seen awake in a hospital bed. It is assumed that Jay Hogart brought J. T. to the hospital. Liberty is seen talking to her parents, and her father, who is a lawyer, tells her he will try to help J. T. out of legal trouble. Liberty talks to J. T. and tells him she has decided to give up their baby for adoption because neither of them can handle raising a child. Liberty has her child later in the season; J. T. is seen at the hospital with her but didn't appear to be present until after the birth. He saw the infant briefly before it was taken out of the room. ;Season 6 J. T. becomes frustrated with the attacks on Degrassi students by students of Lakehurst, a school minutes away from Degrassi. He begins a relationship with Mia Jones, who had previously been in a relationship with a Lakehurst student. He is unfortunately brutally murdered by being stabbed in his aorta by Drake Lempkey, a very drunk student from Lakehurst on the night of Liberty's birthday party while he is looking for her to tell her that he loves her and wants to be with her instead of Mia. Liberty finds J. T. just after he is stabbed and she calls for help. J.T. is rushed to the hospital, and soon pronounced dead, with the original grade 7 class (Emma, Manny, Liberty, Sean, and Toby) at the hospital grieving his death. ;Season 7 A memorial with his picture is shown in the finale \\"We Built This City\\", and is honored by his graduating friends by flipping the tassel on the graduation cap reserved for him. ==Relationships== *Manny Santos **Start Up: Our House (3.21) **Broke Up: Mercy Street (4.04) ***Reason: Manny believed that J.

ASPS arises mainly in children and young adults and can migrate (metastasize) into other parts of the body, typically the lungs and the brain. Typically, ASPS arises in muscles and deep soft tissue of the thigh or the leg (lower extremities), but can also appear in the upper extremities (hands, neck, and head). While ASPS is a soft tissue sarcoma, it can also spread and grow inside the bones. == Etymology == * The term alveolar comes from the microscopic pattern, visible during the analysis of slides of ASPS under the microscope in histopathology. The tumor cells seem to be arranged in the same pattern as the cells of the small air sacks (alveoli) in the lungs. However, this is just a structural similarity. ASPS was first described and characterized in 1952. * ASPS is a sarcoma, and that indicates that this cancer initially arises from tissue of embryonic mesenchymal origin. (The fertilized egg divides and redivides forming a sphere. Early in embryogenesis, dimples appear in the poles of the sphere and burrow through the sphere forming an inner passage that will ultimately form the gut. Malignancies arising from cells that were originally part of the outer layer of the sphere and those that were part of the embryonic tunnel are termed carcinomas; malignancies arising from the cells between the outer layer and the inner burrow are termed sarcomas.) == Causes == Chromosomal analysis of ASPS shows the breaking and joining of two chromosomes in the tumor cells. A piece of chromosome X breaks and is joined to chromosome 17. This translocation creates a fusion between two genes named ASPL and TFE3, which results in the formation of an aberrant protein (termed fusion protein) that is not found in normal cells. Two sorts of fusions between chromosome X and chromosome 17 are found in different ASPS tumors: type one and type two. Dr. Marc Ladanyi at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City, has pioneered this work. The resultant fusion protein ASPL‚ÄìTFE3 is a rogue transcription factor that is the driver of aberrant cellular behavior including uncontrolled cell division and enhanced angiogenesis. == Diagnosis == High-magnification micrograph showing the characteristic large cells with abundant eosinophilic, i.e. pink, cytoplasm and an eccentrically placed nucleus. H&E; stain. ASPS may exist in the patient‚Äôs body for a long time before being diagnosed. It can grow large and push aside surrounding tissues for a long time before causing any discomfort. Therefore, ASPS symptoms may either be a painless swelling, or a soreness caused by compressed nerves or muscles, affecting the range of motion in the area. === Pathology === The definitive diagnosis of ASPS is based on its appearance under the microscope (i.e., its histomorphology), and presence of the characteristic chromosomal translocation (i.e., cytogenetics). ASPS' histomorphologic features include an alveolar-like pattern at low magnification and the presence of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Calcifications are commonly present, as may be seen with slow-growing neoplasms. == Prognosis == Although ASPS displays a relatively indolent course, the ultimate prognosis is poor and is often characterized by late metastases. == Epidemiology == ASPS is an extremely rare cancer. While sarcomas comprise about 1% of all newly diagnosed cancers, and 15% of all childhood cancers, ASPS comprises less than 1% of sarcomas. According to the American Cancer Society, about 9530 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma will be diagnosed in the USA in 2006. This predicts under 100 new cases of ASPS. Such low numbers of occurrence seriously impede the search for a cure by making it hard to gather any meaningful statistics about the disease. As a result, finding the best treatment option often involves making a lot of educated guesses. == Research == * The first xenograft model of ASPS (for type one) was established in mice by David Vistica at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, MD in 2009. The same authors subsequently generated the first publicly available ASPS cell line (designated ASPS-1). * An important advance involved demonstrating that the ASPL‚ÄìTFE3 fusion protein (a transcription factor) enhanced expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET, making ASPS sensitive to small-molecule kinase inhibitor such as sunitinib. * Current clinical trials are exploring the utility of kinase inhibitors (targeting growth factor pathways and angiogenesis); checkpoint inhibitors and cellular immunotherapies in the treatment of ASPS. * Researchers at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) in Utah demonstrated that ASPS might be driven in part by lactate both being used as a fuel and driving angiogenesis. * In terms of origin, it was recently demonstrated that although ASPS generally arises in muscle tissue, the cells do not express muscle markers at the mRNA level and more closely resemble mesenchymal stromal cells. == References  External links == Category:Sarcoma Category:Rare cancers ","title":"Alveolar soft part sarcoma"},{"id":"7463952","text":"Gareth Leon Delve (born 30 December 1982 in Cardiff) is a former Wales international rugby union player, and former captain of Gloucester. In late 2010, he moved to Australia where he went on to captain the Melbourne Rebels. His usual position is number 8. ==CareerWales and England=== Delve was a pupil at Rumney High School in Cardiff and accepted a Rugby scholarship from Colston's Collegiate School in Bristol before signing a professional contract with Bath in 2001. After a few frustrating seasons at Bath, he was named in the Welsh squad for the 2006 Six Nations Championship, and earned two caps during the tournament, making his debut against Scotland. He was also called up for the summer tour to Argentina in June 2006, and earned another two caps, as well as scoring a try in the second Test. In the summer of 2007, he moved from Bath to Gloucester Rugby. He was appointed joint captain of Gloucester in 2009, a position he held in 2010, before he moved to Australia. In March 2010, he was recalled to the Wales squad and selected in the starting line-up for the match versus Ireland. He was named in the preliminary squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup but was ultimately left out of the final squad. ===Australia=== In March 2010, Delve signed with the Melbourne Rebels, and joined the team in October, in preparation for the 2011 Super Rugby season. The move to Melbourne saw Delve reconnect with former Bath Forwards Coach Mark Bakewell. Although there had been speculation that Delve might play blindside flanker, he became the Rebels regular No.8. In February 2011, Delve was appointed the Rebels' vice captain, deputy to former Wallaby captain Stirling Mortlock. In Round 9 of the 2011 season, Delve became the first overseas player to captain an Australian Super Rugby side (v. Highlanders, in Melbourne). In 2011, Delve earned a call up to the initial 45-man Welsh World Cup squad, training in Spala, Poland. He missed the first training session due to Rebels duties. He was to join the squad after the final games for the Rebels against the Western Force. In June 2012, he re-signed with the Rebels for 2013. Rebels CEO Steven Boland said Delve had been wonderful ambassador for the Rebels. \\"His leadership has also been outstanding and given the upcoming retirement of our Captain Stirling Mortlock, Gareth will once again be an important part of our leadership group next year.\\" In May 2013, it was announced that Delve would leave the Rebels at the end of the season,http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/rugby/melbourne-rebels-confirm- departure-of-gareth-delve-ged-robinson-and-richard-kingi/story- fnbzndrd-1226648356160http://www.foxsports.com.au/rugby/super-rugby/melbourne- rebels-confirm-departure-of-former-captain-gareth-delve-ged-robinson-and- richard-kingi/story-e6frf4qu-1226648633937#.UeDWX20kPf0 along with head coach Damien Hill and fellow Rebels players James O'Connor, Cooper Vuna, Ged Robinson, Nick Phipps, Nic Henderson, James King, Tim Davidson and Richard Kingi. His last game as a Rebels player was a home game against New Zealand franchise the Highlanders, a match that also turned out to be the last Rebels match for head coach Damien Hill and players James O'Connor, Cooper Vuna, Ged Robinson, Nick Phipps and Nic Henderson. In front of over 12,000 spectators, the Rebels overcame a 24-point half-time deficit to achieve a remarkable 38‚Äì37 come-from-behind victory over the Highlanders, ending Delve's tenure as a Rebels player on a winning note.http://www.foxsports.com.au/rugby/super- rugby/rebels-give-james-oconnor-and-coach-damien-hill-fairytale-send-off-with- win-over-highlanders/story-e6frf4qu-1226678700085#.UeDPkG0kPf0 ===Japan=== It had been speculated in the Australian press that Delve would continue his rugby union career in Japan. It was officially confirmed that Delve would join NEC Green Rockets in the Japanese Top League for the next season. ===Return to the UK=== On 27 March 2015, it was announced Delve had signed a two-year contract with Welsh region Ospreys. He was released from his contract one year later. ==Personal life== Late in 2010, while house hunting in Melbourne with his partner, Delve chanced upon a man allegedly assaulting a woman and attempting to push her into a car. It's alleged that the man attacked Delve, and was knocked to the ground. Delve called the police. The Melbourne Age hinted Delve behaved like a superhero, but to Delve \\"The good thing was that he started being aggressive towards me instead of towards the woman ... the way I was brought up you don't like seeing things like that happen. In the situation it felt like the right thing to step in.\\" Delve's parents are Steve Delve, a former prop and competitive bodybuilder, and Dolan Delve, n√©e Taylor; both of whom are from Wales. When asked to describe some of his proudest moments, he replied that one was when \\"I [gave] my match jersey to my grandfather before he passed away so that was absolutely massive for me and something I'll always remember.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *Melbourne Rebels Player Profile *Gloucester Rugby profile *Wales profile *WRC Profile Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Bath Rugby players Category:British expatriates in Australia Category:British expatriates in Japan Category:Expatriate rugby union players in Australia Category:Expatriate rugby union players in Japan Category:Rugby union players from Cardiff Category:Rugby union number eights Category:Gloucester Rugby players Category:Melbourne Rebels players Category:NEC Green Rockets players Category:People educated at Colston's School Category:Welsh expatriate rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire ","title":"Gareth Delve"},{"id":"7463957","text":"Zhongdu is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters , meaning \\"Central Capital\\".

The village was founded in 1832 and existed until 1961. It was located in the Nova Crnja Municipality, Central Banat District, Vojvodina Province. The village was abandoned because of groundwater. Today the location of the former village is Molin Forest, which is used as a hunting ground. ==Name== In Serbian the village is known as Molin (–ú–æ–ª–∏–Ω), in German as Mollydorf, and in Hungarian as Mollyfalva. ==Geography== Molin was located at 45¬∞38'37N and 20¬∞32'21E, between Aleksandrovo, Banatsko Karaƒëorƒëevo, Torda, Ba≈°aid, Banatska Topola, Toba, and Nova Crnja. Today, the area of the former Molin village administratively belongs to the settlement of Nova Crnja. ==History== It was founded during Austrian Habsburg administration (in 1832) by German settlers. First census from 1836 registered 558 inhabitants in the village. The village was administratively a part of the Torontal County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848-1849, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, and in 1849-1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian land. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the village was again included into Torontal County. It was also part of the Hatzfeld district within the county. In 1910, the village had German ethnic majority. In 1918, as part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region, the village firstly became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922 Molin was part of the Veliki Beƒçkerek county, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Belgrade oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. During the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944, the village was part of the German-administered Banat region that had special status within the Axis puppet state of Serbia. At the end of World War II, in 1944, one part of local German inhabitants left from the area, together with defeated German army. Those who remained in the region were sent to local communist prison camps, and one of these camps was located in Molin.Molidorf History After communist prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Yugoslavia mainly because of economic reasons. Since 1944, the village was part of Yugoslav Vojvodina, which, from 1945, was an autonomous province of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia. After the war, the village was populated by settlers who mostly came from neighboring settlements. According to the 1953 census, Molin had a Serb ethnic majority. In 1956, the village was devastated by catastrophic flood and was resettled and abandoned in the following year. Most of the residents moved to nearby settlements of Nova Crnja and Vojvoda Stepa.

Her parents were both activists and college graduates of the University of Michigan. Her father was a sociology professor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and her mother earned a master's degree in mathematics. Three years after Cleaver was born, her father, Ernest Neal, accepted a job as the director of the Rural Life Council of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and they moved to a predominantly black community beside the campus. Six years later, Ernest joined the Foreign Service. The family moved abroad and lived in such countries as India, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Philippines. Spending time in India exposed Kathleen to different beliefs, including socialism, communism, and nationalism. The family returned to the United States after her brother died from leukaemia and the family broke apart. Cleaver attended a Quaker boarding school near Philadelphia, George School, which had just been desegregated. She graduated with honors in 1963. She continued her education at Oberlin College, and later transferred to Barnard College. In 1966, she left college for a secretarial job with the New York office of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) after her friend from childhood, Sammy Younge, had been murdered by white supremacists. The shift of the movement was characterized by the change from \\"Freedom Now\\" to \\"Black Power.\\"Mosnier, 2011 - Page 20 == Black Panther Party == Cleaver was in charge of organizing a student conference at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. At the conference, Cleaver met the minister of information for the Black Panther Party, Eldridge Cleaver, who was speaking at the conference. He had just gotten out of jail and published Soul on Ice. She moved to San Francisco in November 1967 to join the Black Panther Party, and just a month and a half later, right after Christmas, Eldridge and Kathleen had married. She joined about three to four weeks after Huey Newton was charged for killing an Oakland policeman in a pre-drawn shootout. It was in San Francisco that Kathleen became the Communications Secretary for the party and worked on organizing demonstrations, creating pamphlets, holding press conferences, designing posters, and speaking at rallies and on TV. Cleaver applied everything that she learned from the SNCC to the Black Panther Party. She created the position herself, motivated by Julian Bond in SNCC. Despite the fact that over two thirds of Black Panthers members were women, Cleaver was one of only a few to hold senior positions within the party. Cleaver became the communications secretary and the first female member of the Party's decision-making body. She also served as the spokesperson and press secretary. Notably, she organized the national campaign to free the Party's minister of defense, Huey Newton, who was jailed. Kathleen Neal Cleaver was among a small group of women who were prominent in the Black Panther Party, which included Elaine Brown and Ericka Huggins. The first major attack against the Black Panther Party was in the 1960s by Los Angeles's first ever SWAT team. As a few years went by, in 1971 almost 30 of the members of the black panther party had been killed. Cleaver had a difficult time healing from the passing of so many of her colleagues and has been emotionally scarred. What helped her the most was going to the root of it all, which was finding where the anxiety and trauma came from. As time went on, there was a group of women from the Black Panther Party, including Cleaver, who would meet up and discuss what happened to them, restore their health, and to recover from the injuries and traumatic experiences they faced In 1968 (the same year her husband ran for president on the Peace and Freedom ticket) she ran for California's 18th state assembly district, also as a candidate of the Peace and Freedom party. Cleaver received 2,778 votes for 4.7% of the total vote, finishing third in a four-candidate race. As a result of their involvement with the Black Panther Party, the Cleavers were often the target of police investigations. The Cleavers' apartment was raided in 1968 before a Panther rally by the San Francisco Tactical Squad on the suspicion of hiding guns and ammunition. Later that year, Eldridge Cleaver staged a deliberate ambush of Oakland police officers during which two police officers were injured. Cleaver was wounded and fellow Black Panther member Bobby Hutton was killed in a shootout following the initial exchange of gunfire. Charged with attempted murder, he jumped bail to flee to Cuba and later went to Algeria. When Cleaver returned to the United States, he stated the shootout was a deliberate ambush against police. The same author who broke the news of this claim doubted its veracity, because it was in the context of an uncharacteristic speech in which Cleaver stated \\"we need police as heroes,\\" and said that he denounced civilian review boards of police shootings for the reason that \\"it is a rubber stamp for murder.\\" The author speculates that it could have been a pay off to the Alameda County justice system, whose judge only just days earlier had given Eldridge Cleaver probation instead of prison time; Cleaver was sentenced to community service after getting charged with three counts of assault against three Oakland police officers.Kate Coleman, \\"Souled Out: Eldridge Cleaver Admits He Ambushed Those Cops\\", New West, May 19, 1980. The PBS documentary A Huey Newton Story finds that \\"Bobby Hutton was shot more than twelve times after he had already surrendered and stripped down to his underwear to prove he was not armed.\\" During Kathleen Cleaver's time with the Black Panther Party she helped feed people, provided medical care to families, and took families to visit loved ones in prison. She also ‚Äúhelped put together healing retreats for women who had been in the Black Panther Party, women who had been living underground, who had been tortured, who had been exiled‚Äù == Living in exile == Kathleen Cleaver delivering a speech in Ruby Diamond Auditorium at Florida State University, November 1971. In 1969 Kathleen reunited with Eldridge in Algeria, which was a single-party socialist regime with revolutionary Third World credentials, though also increasingly authoritarian. Cleaver gave birth to their first son, Maceo, soon after arriving in Algeria. A year later in 1970, she gave birth to their daughter Joju Younghi Cleaver, while the family was in North Korea. Eldridge had increasingly found himself at odds with Huey Newton, one of the party's co-founders and leaders, over the direction the group should take; Newton, recently out of jail, was channeling resources into re- establishing the community outreach \\"survival programmes\\", whereas Cleaver favoured a more direct, and at times violent, approach. In 1971, this discord led to the separation of the International Branch of the Black Panther Party, as the Cleavers formed a new organisation called the Revolutionary People's Communication Network. Cleaver returned to promoting and speaking about the new organization. To accomplish this, she and the children moved back to New York. The Algerian government became disgruntled with Eldridge and the new organisation and he was forced to leave the country secretly and meet up with Kathleen in Paris in 1973. Kathleen left for the United States later that year to arrange Eldridge's return and raise a defence fund. In 1974, the French government granted legal residency to the Cleavers, and the family was finally reunited. However, after only a year, the Cleavers moved back to the United States, where Eldridge was arrested and tried for the shoot-out in 1968 and was found guilty of assault. He was sentenced to five years' probation and 2,000 hours of community service. Cleaver went to work on the Eldridge Cleaver Defence Fund and he was freed on bail in 1976. Eldridge's legal situation was not finally resolved until 1980. Throughout this time, Eldridge shifted his political views to the right. == Later life == Kathleen Cleaver left Eldridge in 1981 and went back to university, receiving a full scholarship from Yale University. She graduated in 1984, Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. In 1987, she divorced Eldridge Cleaver. She had decided she wanted to become a lawyer as she watched the Watergate Hearing in the early 1970s. Therefore, she continued her education by getting her J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1989. After graduating, she worked for the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and followed this with numerous jobs including: law clerk in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia under Judge A. Higginbotham, the faculty of Emory University in Atlanta, visiting faculty member at the Benjamin N.

According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, he became a Carmelite friar and moved to the university town of Oxford, where he developed a great reputation for his scientific work. In 1386, at the request of the powerful lord John of Gaunt, he published a Kalendarium of detailed astronomical tables covering the years 1387‚Äì1462. It survives in sixteen manuscripts and one printed edition. Designed for use in the astrologically-based science of the time, the tables were very sophisticated, even including rules for synchronising medical treatment with astronomical cycles, such as the right phases of the moon for blood-letting. His contemporary Geoffrey Chaucer wrote very approvingly of Nicholas' work, and made much use of it. Nicholas was also supposedly an excellent musician. Later in life he moved to Cambridge, where he was promoted to subdeacon in 1410 and to deacon in 1411. The date of his death is unknown. ==Reputation== What he was not, as far as any early biographers were concerned, was an explorer. The identification of Nicholas as the Franciscan (Minorite) friar who wrote a text called the Inventio Fortunata, allegedly describing a voyage to Greenland and beyond, was first proposed by Richard Hakluyt, the late 16th- century historian of exploration. Hakluyt based the claim on information from mathematician John Dee who, in turn, relied on information obtained from the Dutch cartographer Gerardus Mercator. Nicholas, however, was a Carmelite, not a Minorite, and if Hakluyt and Dee had read Bale (rather than apparently basing their identification on Chaucer's praise for Nicholas' work with astrolabes), they would have discovered an entry about a Franciscan friar named Hugh of Ireland, who wrote \\"a certain journey in one volume\\". ==ReferencesFurther reading== * \\"The Kalendarium of Nicholas of Lynn\\" by Nicholas of Lynn, edited and introduced by Sigmund Eisner.

Taylor, Alan R. Wallace, and Douglas P. Klein, Polymetallic vein and replacement deposits, 1995, US Geological Survey, Open- File Report OFR-95-0831, Chapter 14. A polymetallic replacement deposit, also known as carbonate replacement deposit or high-temperature carbonate-hosted Ag-Pb-Zn deposit,Megaw, P.K.M., Ruiz, J., and Titley, S.R., 1988, High- Temperature, Carbonate-Hosted Ag-Pb-Zn(Cu) Deposits of Northern Mexico: Economic Geology, v. 83, pp.1856-1885 is an orebody of metallic minerals formed by the replacement of sedimentary, usually carbonate rock, by metal- bearing solutions in the vicinity of igneous intrusions.Hal T. Morris, 1986, \\"Polymetallic replacement deposits,\\" in Dennis P. Cox and Donald A. Singer, Mineral Deposit Models, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1693, p.99-100. When the ore forms a blanketlike body along the bedding plane of the rock, it is commonly called a manto ore deposit. Other ore geometries are chimneys and veins.Guilbert, John M. and Charles F. Park, Jr (1986) The Geology of Ore Deposits, W. H. Freeman pp. 77-79 Polymetallic replacements/mantos are often stratiform wall-rock replacement orebodies distal to porphyry copper deposits,Sillitoe, Richard H. \\"Porphyry copper systems.\\" Economic Geology 105.1 (2010): 3-41. or porphyry molybdenum depositsRay, G., Webster, I., Megaw, P., McGlasson, J., and Glover, K., 2001, The Lustdust Property in Central British Columbia: A Polymetallic Zoned Porphyry-Skarn-Manto-Vein System: British Columbia Geological Survey Geological Fieldwork 2001, p. 257-280. The term manto is from the Spanish word for mantle, or cloak, although the geologic manto is more like a mantle roll than a sheetlike structure. Although similar in orebody geometry, host-rock lithology, and the presence of lead and zinc, carbonate hosted lead zinc ore deposits, also known as Mississippi Valley type, are considered a different type of ore deposits. Mississippi valley type ore deposits lack silver and gold mineralization, are lower temperature, and are not associated with nearby igneous intrusions. ==Mineralogy== Polymetallic replacement deposits are significant sources of copper,Loader, S. E. \\"Supergene Enrichment of the Khanong Copper Resource, Sepon Project, Lao PDR.\\" Pacrim'99 Congress: 10‚Äì13 October 1999, Bali, Indonesia. Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 1999. gold, silver, lead, manganese, and zinc. The metallic ore minerals are mostly in sulphides, such as galena, sphalerite, enargite, and argentite. Gangue minerals include quartz, pyrite, rhodochrosite, and barite. The mineralogy changes with distance from the intrusive rock. Closest to the intrusion is the copper-gold zone; next is the lead-silver zone, then the zinc-manganese zone.Hal T. Morris, 1986, \\"Polymetallic replacement deposits,\\" in Dennis P. Cox and Donald A. Singer, Mineral Deposit Models, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1693, p.99-100. == Classification == Manto ore deposits are defined by a strict stratigraphic control on their distribution, generally within a porous formation within a structural trap site. They are distinct from other copper ore bodies in that they are not associated with shear zones, and an intrusive link to manto deposit formation is not conclusively proven, but is often inferred. == Genetic model == The genetic model of manto formation is debated, but consists of the following broad principles; * The source of ore within manto deposits is considered to be interformational, from a sedimentary source within an adjacent sedimentary basin, or from ore fluids driven off from a granite intrusive. * The transport of copper into the manto deposit position was likely hydrothermal, either a metamorphic solution or copper- bearing hydrothermal solutions generated by intrusive granites. * The trap where the ore materials concentrated is typically a coarse-grained member of a carbonate formation, and the manto is usually sited in a stratigraphic or structural pinch-out of this formation although it is now thought that hydrocarbons may have assisted in the migration of metals into favorable trap sites. == Morphology == Manto deposits were first described in great detail in Chile, where they sit within sedimentary strata overlying large granitic intrusions, in regions adjacent to porphyry copper deposits. In Chile, the arid climate and deep regolith development, tended to favor preservation of chalcocite-malachite-azurite assemblages in the manto deposits, leading workers to believe that they were weathered equivalents of primary chalcopyrite deposits of porphyry-copper derivation. However, recent work suggests that there may be primary chalcocite and bornite formed within degraded petroleum within trap sites, with copper precipitating from solution by reduction in contact with the reduced carbon.Wilson N.S.F., & Zentilli M., 2006. Association of pyrobitumen with copper mineralization from the Uchumi and Talcuna districts, Chile. Journal of Coal Geology, 65, pp 158-165. Thus, manto deposits need not be the weathered equivalents of primary chalcopyrite. Manto deposits may be formed in proximity to intrusives, for instance in the La Providencia mine, Mexico, a porphyry stock is the feeder for some twenty mantos as the pipe intersects favorable layers in the sedimentary sequence. However, these manto deposits are analogous to skarn deposits, and in some cases terminology may be misused. In many instances, manto/ polymetallic replacement/ carbonate replacement deposits can be considered as the distal part of a continuum with skarn deposits. == Example manto deposits == * Atacocha, PeruDan L.

Variations on the theme have been performed for hundreds of years, with documented examples appearing in print in the 16th century. The most common modern variation is the finger gullotine or finger chopper, a pocked-sized version that appears to chop off the magician's finger. ==History== The Guillotine is probably the most famous member of a family of illusions featuring the apparent decapitation of a person or other living subject. Decapitation illusions have a long history, with the first documented example dating from the reign of Khufu in ancient Egypt, when a magician named Dedi apparently decapitated and restored birds and other livestock.Donald Mackenzie, Egyptian Myth and Legend, 1907Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 1, p. 219, 1973 Scot's 1584 diagram explaining the \\"Decollation of John Baptist\\" illusion, in which the performer appears \\"to cut off ones head, and to laie it in a platter\\". A method for performing a decapitation illusion, where a person's head is apparently severed and displayed on a plate next to their headless body, was described in The Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot, published in 1584. Scot describes a table with two concealed holes, where the supposed victim sits beneath the table, raising their head through a hole which is surrounded by a platter. A second person lies flat on the table with their head descending into another hole, and their neck may be dressed with \\"a little dough kneded with bul/locks bloud\\" for effect. A decapitation illusion involving the apparent beheading of two boys and a dove was also recorded as being performed by Jacob Philadelphia in 1765.Dawes, E.A., and Setterington, A., The Encyclopedia of Magic, Gallery Books, 1989. Several modern guillotine and chopper illusions were designed by Cincinnati magician Lester Lake (aka Marvelo), who sold/traded some of these designs to Abbott's Magic Co. in Colon, Michigan. Lake's designs included, but were not limited to, the Extended-Blade Chopper (seen in the 1953 film, \\"Houdini\\"), Abbott's \\"Giant Guillotine\\" and \\"Disecto\\" (wrist-cutter illusion). Lake also designed a guillotine illusion in which the assistant's actual head appeared to drop into a waiting bag when the blade fell. ==The traditional Guillotine illusion== In its most familiar form, the illusion uses an apparatus which generally resembles the type of guillotine historically used for executions. This has two uprights, with a stock at their lower end to restrain the neck of the \\"victim\\". The inner faces of the uprights contain tracks within which runs a blade, and the upper end of the uprights supports a mechanism for raising, holding and then releasing the blade. In some versions of the illusion, the apparatus also has a bench attached to the uprights at the same level as the neck stocks, on which the \\"victim\\" lies down - usually in a face-down position. On other versions, the \\"victim\\" simply kneels behind the apparatus and places their neck in the stocks. This version of the illusion has sometimes been presented as an escape, with the magician themselves being locked into the guillotine, and having to attempt to free themselves before the blade falls. As this is usually performed, the magician apparently fails to free themselves in time and their head is apparently severed by the falling blade, only for the magician to dramatically reappear unharmed elsewhere in the theater. One such example was performed by Murray Walters in 1927. Magician/Escape Artist Bruce Bunnell performs a full-view guillotine escape in which he is straitjacketed, chained to the bascule, and the lunette padlocked shut.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wna0V7jn6wc ==The \\"Head Chopper\\"== With the move away from theater-based grand illusion shows to smaller club venues in the 1960s, magicians needed a smaller and more portable version of the guillotine illusion, which led to the invention of the so-called \\"Head Chopper\\" versions. In these, the apparatus is reduced in size by the elimination of the tall uprights, leaving just the stocks, and a smaller blade which is thrust through the stocks manually by the magician. A recent development of the illusion has seen the previously opaque stocks replaced by clear perspex, which allow the blade to be seen as it passes through them. In this version, a large blade is used, which completely fills the stocks when inserted, in place of the narrow blade used in earlier versions. The device described above is patented under the US patent number 5605508.Magicians' Guillotine apparatus ==Finger guillotines== Sold more as a novelty item than a magic trick, finger guillotines are a minor variation on the basic theme. The setup is usually a small version of the full-sized devices, tall, complete with side uprights. The trick is performed by inserting a finger through the \\"head hole\\" and then the blade is activated. In some versions, such as Chance Wolf's ultimate finger chopper, the finger is even seen to fall off. It is also shown in the movie Hostel as part of a torture museum that Paxton and his friends go to on their fateful holiday to Slovakia. ==References== *Dawes, A. E., et al. Making Magic.

He is best known for being executive producer of the teen drama series Degrassi. Until 2018 he was the president of Epitome Pictures Inc., which he and his wife Linda Schuyler founded and which was sold to DHX Media in 2014. On June 7, 2019 he was installed as Chancellor of Trent University (in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada). == Career == Stohn's work in the entertainment industry commenced with part-time appearances as a performing artist, continuing with active work as a songwriter (including two songs that reached the Canadian Top-10, Maybe Your Heart and Once In A Long Time, co-written with Christopher Ward), and a primary career as an entertainment and copyright lawyer since he was called to the Ontario Bar in 1979. Trent University had barely been built when Stohn attended there starting in 1966. He helped found, and named, Trent's student newspaper Arthur. Stohn also helped found the radio station at Trent, now CFFF-FM, along with Peter Northrop and Christopher Ward. In the early 1990s, he helped found the Songwriters Association of Canada along with Donna Murphy, Terry McManus and internationally acclaimed songwriter Eddie Schwartz. Stohn has executive-produced two feature films, Me? and The Clown Murders. He was also executive producer of Riverdale, English Canada's first prime-time soap opera, and of the lifestyle TV series Savoir Faire (hosted by Nik Manojlovich) and Room Service (hosted by Sarah Richardson). === Book === A book of stories from Stohn's life was published by Dundurn Press in March 2018. Entitled Whatever It Takes: Life Lessons from Degrassi and Elsewhere in the World of Music and Television, the book has been written by Stohn with Christopher Ward, and includes a Foreword by Martin Gero. === Degrassi === In early 2000, Linda Schuyler and Yan Moore were developing a new teen TV series with the working title Ready, Willing and Wired, based on the already success. One day Yan came up with the brainstorm that baby Emma, who was born to the then 8th- grade student Spike Nelson in Degrassi Junior High, would be the right age now to be attending high school, and why not make her a main character in Ready, Willing and Wired thus turning the new series into a sequel to the original Degrassi. Inspired by his love for the original Star Trek sci-fi TV series, which had spun into Star Trek: The Next Generation, Stohn suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the title for the new sequel series. By autumn 2001 the title remained, and Degrassi: The Next Generation made its first appearance on air. Stohn co-wrote the opening theme music for Degrassi: The Next Generation with Jim McGrath and Jody Colero. He is also the executive producer of Alexz Johnson's debut solo album Voodoo, and the executive producer of all the various Degrassi soundtracks and Instant Star soundtracks. === Other work === For nearly 20 years, until 2009, he was executive producer of the telecast of Canada's music awards show, The Juno Awards, and during that period was a director and then Chair of Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization responsible for The Juno Awards. He was also Chair of MusiCounts, a charity associated with The Juno Awards, which among other things distributes musical instruments to schools in need. From 2004 to 2008 Stohn executive produced the teen drama television series Instant Star about a young woman (played by Alexz Johnson) who wins a singer/songwriter contest.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831133/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr2 In 2011 and 2012 he executive produced the television series The L.A. Complex (formerly called Highland Gardens) for Bell Media in Canada and The CW in the U.S., about young Canadians dreaming of fame and fortune while struggling to survive in an apartment-style hotel in Los Angeles. His recent projects have included the family mystery series Open Heart for YTV in Canada and TeenNick in the U.S. and the latest incarnation of Degrassi, namely Degrassi: Next Class for Family Channel in Canada and Netflix worldwide. ===Legal background=== Stohn's industry experience includes being a partner for 10 years in Canada's largest law firm, McCarthy T√©trault. He graduated from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law (J.D. 1977) and Trent University (B.A. 1969). He is a founding partner in the Canadian entertainment law firm Stohn Hay Cafazzo Dembroski Richmond LLP, where he provides strategic legal advice to performers, advertising agencies, merchandisers, recording artists, songwriters, multimedia/internet creators, broadcasters and film and television producers. He and two other partners in the firm constitute three of the fourteen entertainment lawyers named in the 2014 Lexpert American Lawyer Guide to the Leading 500 Lawyers in Canada. == Personal life == Stohn was born in Denver, Colorado. He is married to Degrassi creator Linda Schuyler; they have one son, Max. ==Awards== * Stohn has been nominated 28 times in Canada's national television awards ceremony, the Canadian Screen Awards (formerly the Gemini Awards), and has won 14 times. In 2011 he was nominated for a primetime Emmy Award and won a Peabody Award. He was nominated three more times for a primetime Emmy Award, in 2012, 2014 and 2015. * In August 2005, Stohn received a commendation from the Government of Ontario reading in part: \\"You are no stranger to Canadian show business, having worked, and excelled, in nearly all facets of the industry.

The governing body for the college since 1989 has been the One Tree Hill College Board of Trustees. It provides curriculum, discipline and financial oversight but day-to-day management of the college, within the board's policy framework, is handled by the Principal and the Senior Leadership Team. ==History== Penrose takes its name from Penrose Farm carved out of about 400ha (1000 acres) of land purchased by Cornishman William Williams from the Maori owners in 1843. School in February 1955 Williams (1806‚Äì1876), not related to the Anglican missionary of the same name, named the farm after Penrose Farm in the parish of Budock, Cornwall, where he is thought to have been born (though there is no record of this) and where his father was allegedly bailiff. According to Williams it was the ‚Äòbest farm in Budock, and the best in all Cornwall‚Äô. Research by foundation principal Ron Stacey reveals the property on which Penrose High School stands originally formed part of land granted to James Haldane Watt, a settler, on 10 December 1847. When he died in 1876 he left it to his two sons, Robert Henry Watt and David Bruce Watt. It was later mortgaged to Alfred Greatback Glover who gained ownership in 1884 after the Watts defaulted. It was later let to Jane Board of Ellerslie and sold to her in 1896. The land was later subdivided.

The Department of Education‚Äôs standard plans were for schools of 400 and 600 pupils. Penrose, which initially had the working name of ‚ÄòEllerslie Grammar School‚Äô, was built for 750 to 800 pupils and, 58 years after it opened, it retains some of the finest school buildings anywhere in the country. The site was difficult to build on, not least because of the large amounts of volcanic rock that had to be excavated. In the first year, after the initial buildings were opened, ¬£48,000 had to be spent developing the school grounds. It was to take several years before the outworks were completed. Original Whanau House ===Whanau House introduction=== On 20 April 1977 Penrose High School‚Äôs ‚Äòhome within a school‚Äô, Whanau House, was opened by Education Minister Les Gander in keeping with Maori protocol. Maori elder Eruera Kawhia Stirling gave the opening speech in Maori and the minister replied in Maori. Whanau House ‚Äî described as a ‚Äòplace for people to live, learn, laugh, relax and respond and related as an extended family in the true spirit of Whanau‚Äô ‚Äî was the crowning glory of Murray Print‚Äôs principalship. Planned in 1974, the complex initially accommodated 250 pupils between third and seventh form. While it was billed as a world first, the Whanau House concept would reflect as much on European educational tradition as Maori culture. It signalled the introduction of a house system that had been a feature of English private schools (\\"public\\" in British parlance) since time immemorial. (Penrose had already operated a loose house system for its summer sports day from 1969‚Äì75, though it had never been embraced by the school proper). The challenge for Print‚Äôs successor, John Rose, was to extend the Whanau House benefits across the whole school. Whanau House became Hinau House and four other houses were established ‚Äî Kowhai, Miro, Tawa and Rata. By 1979 they each had their designated commons areas and distinct identities, including house colours ‚Äî Hinau (white), Kowhai (yellow), Miro (green), Tawa (blue) and Rata (red). Competition was an important part of the house system from the beginning. In 1977 the houses competed in athletics with Hinau taking first place and it held that lead when a range of non-sporting endeavours were assessed. An Interhouse Shield has been competed for most years. The number of houses was reduced from five to four (with the abolition of Rata) after 1982 because of a drop in the school roll. At this time Tawa's house colour was changed from blue to red, and Hinau from white to purple. The house system, as controversial as it was challenging, came to an end in the late 1990s and Penrose reverted to a more traditional class format. Classes were organised on a house system in 1999 but from 2000 the house system applied to sports competition only, until 2008 when it was reinvented with the $15 million property upgrade. The whanau system is now extremely strong at the college is fundamental to the college's many successes since 2008. ===$15 million property redevelopment=== Between 2006 and 2009, $15 million was spent on redevelopment ‚Äî upgrading the college's buildings, facilities and computer network. The upgrade was aimed to 'modernise the school and ensure that students have access to the very best educational facilities'.School Home Page, retrieved 3 February 2008 ===Rebranding of college=== The name change of Penrose High School to One Tree Hill College took place on 21 July 2008 after extensive consultation with parents, past pupils and the college's wider community. The name was changed as the college re-invented itself in all aspects.Principal's reports to Board of Trustees, 2002‚Äì2008 The college was officially reopened and rededicated on 13 March 2009 by John Key, New Zealand prime minister. A former student, singer Tina Cross, also took part in this ceremony. Afterwards, the college released flyers to over 25,000 homes in the surrounding area promoting the new college. ==TraditionsHouse (Whanau) system=== One Tree Hill College's house system, which dates from 1969, consists of four houses or whanau (Maori for family). The whanau system fell away in 1996 but was reintroduced in 2008 and strengthened by current Principal, Nick Coughlan. The whanau system now is the major underpinning pastoral care system in the college. The name of each house is a Maori word for a New Zealand indigenous tree. { class= !House !Original Colour !Current Colour !Affiliated Tree -    Hinau  style=\\"background:white\\"   style=\\"background:purple\\"  Elaeocarpus dentaus -    Tawa  style=\\"background:blue\\"   style=\\"background:red\\"   Beilschmiedia tawa -    Miro  style=\\"background:green\\"   style=\\"background:green\\"   Prumnopitys ferruginea -    Kowhai  style=\\"background:yellow\\"   style=\\"background:yellow\\"   Sophora microphylla -  style=\\"text- align:center\\"  Rata  style=\\"background:red\\"   Defunct Metrosideros robusta } In 2009 students were placed into their respective whanau as part of a reimplementation of the houses system which the college originally pioneered. In early 2009 each house was given a tree to plant outside its common rooms. The planting of the Tawa, Hinau, Miro and Kowhai trees outside their respective houses symbolised the beginning of a new era of education for One Tree Hill College. ===College crest=== The crest of the college was adopted before the college opened on 1 February 1955.One Tree Hill College 2008 Yearbook It was altered in 1999 when a red band was added but has otherwise remained unchanged The crest depicts the summit of the former Maori pa (fortress), One Tree Hill/Maungakiekie, that overlooks the college, and symbolises the strong connection between One Tree Hill and the community.Our College. One Tree Hill College. Retrieved 2010-04-09 ===College prayer and hymn=== The college has its own prayer, implemented during John Rose's principalship. One Tree Hill also has its own hymn, Martin Shaw's 'Go Forth With God', which came into use during Ron Stacey's foundation principalship. The college prayer is said at the end of every assembly but the hymn is not sung regularly. ==Facilities== Due to the redevelopment, the following facilities were either built or refurbished and renamed in honour of key individuals in the college's history: *Rotary Art Lobby, in recognition of the long friendship and support from the Rotary Club of Penrose to the college. *Marilyn Wales Auditorium recognition of the leadership and governance of Marilyn C. Wales (n√©e Morse), chair of the Board of Trustees from 1999-2006. *Murray Print Memorial Knowledge Centre in recognition of the contribution of the college's second principal, J. Murray Print (1923‚Äì1990). The former library had been dedicated in his honour. *Ron Stacey Memorial Gymnasium in recognition of the leadership of the foundation principal, Ronald S. Stacey (1909‚Äì1983). The former swimming pool (on the site of the new gymnasium) had been dedicated in his honour. *Wallace Crossman Art Department in recognition of Wallace Crossman's contribution during the time he taught art at the college (1961‚Äì1979). Mr Crossman and Mr Print developed the college's art collection. ===Ultrafast Fibre Broadband=== In 2012, One Tree Hill College was connected onto the ultrafast fibre broadband network. This allows the college to develop a full wireless network to allow students to utilise their own devices across the entire college. ===Art collection=== One Tree Hill College has a significant New Zealand art collection, which was started in 1969 by the former principal Murray Print, with the aid of Wallace Crossman (head of art). The collection was originally funded by proceeds from the college 'tuckshop' (canteen) and has subsequently received gifts and donations but no public money. Over the years it expanded to include works by Gretchen Albrecht, W.A. Sutton, Colin McCahon, Patrick Hanly, Robin White, Toss Woollaston, Allen Maddox, Don Peebles and Ralph Hotere. There is also an important collection of ceramics by Len Castle. The much-loved art collection is an important part of One Tree Hill College's culture. It is managed and curated by an independent trust. ==Education Review Office Report (ERO)== In 2009 the college received a glowing report from the New Zealand Education Review Office. Its final report described the college as having strong governance and leadership, effective teaching, a 'safe' college culture, high staff and student morale and improved academic results. The office praised progress at the college, noting that staff and students were proud of their campus and had a strong sense of belonging. It identified improvements in the teaching of Maori and Pacific Island students as contributing to the college's turnaround. In 2012 the subsequent ERO report was exceptional, focussing on the very good teaching which was evident across the college. All aspects of the college were highlighted and praised. In 2015 the ERO report was outstanding, highlighting the excellent teaching and learning which was evident across the college. ERO placed the school on the highest 4-5 year review cycle for high performing schools. ==Academic achievement== One Tree Hill College's results have continued to reflect the strong teaching occurring at the college. The NCEA results are now above national means. There has also been a significant increase in the number of students achieving their NCEA endorsed with merit and excellence.\\"Excellent Academic Results Just Released\\". One Tree Hill College. Retrieved 2010/04/09. == Student life == The college provides a wide variety of opportunities for learning. Students will soon be able to use their laptops and tablets to access the campus-wide wireless network and broadband internet service. Teachers encourage students to get involved in school-life. Students also participate in numerous musical and cultural events such as the Auckland Secondary School's Polyfest and Stage Challenge. ===Cultural groups=== A French club, Le Club Fran√ßais, was formed in 1965 but the oldest of Penrose High School‚Äôs indigenous cultural groups, the Polynesian Club, was formed in 1970. By 1985 it had Maori, Tongan, Samoan and Cook Island sections and by 1988 Niuean culture was also included. These sections later became independent groups. By 1993 there was also an Indian culture group. The groups played an important part in the school‚Äôs cultural life, performing a cultural/festival week which started in the mid-1970s and was held most years. By 1999 an Arabic Group and a separate Kapa Haka Group had been formed. The college now boasts cultural groups in various cultures, including a Filipino and Spanish group. ===Interact Club=== One Tree Hill College provides many extracurricular opportunities for service. In 2009, the Interact Club of One Tree Hill College was founded in conjunction with the Penrose Rotary Club.Interact Club. One Tree Hill College. Retrieved 2010-04-09 It gives One Tree Hill College students an opportunity to serve and give back to their local community as well as organises other service events such as the annual World Vision 40 Hour Famine, which raises money for international projects. Other service projects organised by the Interact Club include fundraising events for certain charities and organising members for annual appeals. === Duke of Edinburgh's Award=== One Tree Hill College encourages personal development by offering students the Duke of Edinburgh's Award programme.\\"Enrol for Duke of Edinburgh\\". One Tree Hill College. Retrieved 2009/04/09 It motivates young people to become involved in a programme of voluntary and self-development activities. The award helps takes students through a potentially difficult period of schooling. It is a major international programme that is recognised by organisations around the world. Depending on the varying ability and commitment level, there are three levels, bronze, silver and gold. Students participate out of school hours in numerous community services, physically challenging and personal skill-based activities. It is an optional extension to the existing Outdoor Education Programme of Year camps. ==Sporting achievement== One Tree Hill College participates in several interschool sports competitions. Despite having a relatively small student body, the college achieves exceptionally well in many competitions. One Tree Hill College are four time New Zealand Baseball Champions and the college's girls' softball team again won the New Zealand national championship in 2007 (runner-up in 2017 & 2019), reflecting a strong softball tradition at the college. In 2009 the first XI football (soccer) team won the northern regional championship.Penrose High School - School - General Information Between 1969‚Äì78 rugby union was especially strong, despite competition from club rugby league outside the college, with the first XV twice being runner-up in the senior A competition. In 2018 the 1st XV competed in the Auckland 1A Competition. Over the years the college has produced five rugby league Kiwis (internationals) and numerous professional rugby league players. (The former principal, Iva Ropati, is also a former professional rugby league footballer who played for New Zealand.) ==Weekend programmes== The Auckland Japanese Supplementary School (AJSS; „Ç™„Éº„ÇØ„É©„É≥„ÉâÊó•Êú¨Ë™ûË£úÁøíÂ≠¶Ê†° ≈åkurando Nihongo Hosh≈´gakk≈ç), a Japanese supplementary school, holds its classes at One Tree Hill College.\\"„ÅäÂïè„ÅÑÂêà„Çè„Åõ\\" (Archive).

The street now called Rua S√£o Sebasti√£o, in Urca, which leads from behind the fort to the Urca casino, was originally a trail from the Portuguese fort skirting the edge of the sea to the mainland along the peninsula that houses the Sugar Loaf and a smaller hill, the Morro da Urca.

In the background, commercial buildings. Praia Vermelha (Red Beach) with vision of Urca and Sugar Loaf hills Building space in Rio is restricted by the city's geography, which offers formidable physical barriers to urban expansion. The notion of filling in part of the shallow bay around the Morro Vermelho and building a neighborhood on it was mooted periodically in the nineteenth century, and in the 1880s a development company was formed for the purpose, Urbaniza√ß√£o Carioca, whose acronym Urca gave the neighbourhood its name. But, some historians contest this version, identifying the name Urca already stamped in 18th century maps.Thiesen, I. (1998). Urca, fragmentos discursivos. UniRio. \\"Urca\\", in old Portuguese tradition, designates a small and large cargo ship. Legal wrangles over financing and land titles delayed work for a generation, but the landfill began shortly after the conclusion of World War I and the first houses were built in 1922. The centrepiece of the new neighbourhood was a cassino, originally conceived as a competitor to the newly installed cassino in the luxury Copacabana Palace hotel, in those days a rather longer and more inconvenient haul from downtown Rio. The neighbourhood's origin as a 1920s urban development is very evident. Photos of the area on the 1930s show lots divided up, a low sea wall, individual houses and the trees so characteristic of the area now mere saplings. It is perhaps second only to Santa Tereza as a carioca urban neighbourhood in its pleasantness, architectural unity and lack of the crass development which has scarred so much of the city. Part of this is explained by the neighborhood's insularity. The developers of Urca made their money by dividing up the neighbourhood into lots and selling them to small investors, many of them recent European immigrants, especially Portuguese, of relatively modest means ‚Äì the richer middle class headed for the more glamorous neighbourhoods of Copacabana and Leme, the other side of Praia Vermelha. The heavy military presence around Urca in the coup-prone 1920s was also a disincentive for those with money to afford a beach house elsewhere. Many of the present inhabitants of Urca are the descendants of families who bought houses or plots when the area was originally developed. It is easy to see the successive phases of Urca's development strolling around the neighbourhood. Most of the residential houses date from the late 1920s to the late 1940s and are a portfolio of house styles popular at the time: art deco houses and apartment buildings, the faux Spanish colonial style, so popular throughout the Americas in the 1930s and 1940s, but locally called Manuelino style (after the 16th-century Portuguese king Manuel I) and mock Tudor houses cheerfully aping the English interwar suburbs, often painted with a very un-English flair and color. The seafront Avenida Luis Alves has a number of modest apartment buildings, most from the 1950s and 1960s, but to a far lesser extent than any other neighbourhood in the Zona Sul. The commercial Rua Marechal Cantu√°ria which leads traffic into the heart of Urca is the only street to have suffered significant redevelopment, but even then at a low level and very little since the 1960s. It is much used by filmmakers and 'novela' producers looking for period settings. The casino flourished and was a fixture of Rio's social scene in the prewar and immediate postwar period. Urca's most famous resident, Carmen Miranda, was discovered by a Hollywood producer visiting the casino in 1938, where she was a singer. She rented a small house on Rua S√£o Sebasti√£o, on the left walking up from the casino, where a plaque on the wall, the only one in Rio commemorating a famous person's house, remembers the \\"pequena not√°vel\\", the \\"little wonder\\". The casino also played a minor role in the history of astrophysics. Two scientists in the casino, discussing a model explaining neutrino emission patterns in the cooling of stars, called it after the casino when they noticed how rapidly money, like energy pulsing from a dying star, disappeared from the roulette table. But astrophysics notwithstanding, the money ran out in the end. In 1946 a federal ban on casinos put the Cassino da Urca out of business. The building was later acquired by TV Tup√≠, a pioneering Brazilian television station owned by Assis Chateaubriand, the first Brazilian media mogul. TV Tupi built a new frontage for the building onto the beach, increasing its internal space and turning the curved 1930s exterior into a plain right-angled building. The TV Tupi studio became best known as the location of the Chacrinha program, a variety program which ran on weekend afternoons from the 1960s to the 1980s, with an enormous national audience. A slot on Chacrinha for any musician, dancer, actor or starlet was a sign they had finally arrived. The ageing inhabitants of Urca were, however, never entirely at ease with the crowds of screaming teenagers who regularly invaded their tranquil streets chasing their idols. Many greeted the closure of the studios in the late 1980s with relief, but the abandonment of the cassino and its being left to rot until 2008 was unfortunately typical of the misgovernment and neglect which has blighted modern Rio. It is currently being renovated to serve as a design institute. Urca's long association with entertainment is reflected in the number of Brazilian musicians and artists who live there. The most famous is Roberto Carlos, who lives in a relatively modest penthouse apartment on the seafront and, devout Catholic as he is, can sometimes be caught singing in Urca's only church. Although Forte S√£o Jo√£o is a military base, visitors are allowed in on weekday afternoons if they say they want to visit the fort's museum, the 'Museu do Forte\\". The walls we can see today are a typical early seventeenth-century Portuguese fort, like many others around the country, with several original cannons. But the main attraction is the extraordinary location. The Sugar Loaf plunges down to the beach behind the fort, the Praia de Fora. A number of fine Art Deco buildings are next to the fort, notably a gymnasium built in 1932. The inevitable football field next to the gymnasium, with the Sugar Loaf behind one goal, the fort behind the other and the beach looking out across the entrance to Guanabara bay parallel to one sideline, is arguably the most spectacularly located football pitch in the world. It was used as a training ground by the England squad in the 2014 World Cup, who predictably failed to draw any inspiration from it on their way to an ignominiously early elimination. ==See also== * Pista Cl√°udio Coutinho ‚Äì local walking trail * Escola de Comando e Estado-Maior do Ex√©rcito (Brazil) - Brazilian Army Command and Staff College * Military Institute of Engineering == References == Category:Neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Guanabara Bay ","title":"Urca"},{"id":"7464246","text":"Huw Bennett (born 11 June 1983) is a former Wales international rugby union hooker, who played most of his rugby career for the Ospreys.

Essentially, it utilized a model that allowed customers to pay for a designated driver. The business employed drivers equipped with collapsible, motorized scooters. The drivers drove customers home in their own vehicles, stowing the scooters in the customer's trunk. Upon arrival to the customer's destination, the driver collected the fare, assembled the scooter, and rode off to the next customer. ==Awards & media coverage== *TIME magazine - January 17, 2005 - \\"And One More For The Road\\" TIME magazine - January 17, 2005 - \\"And One More For The Road\\" *Inc.

The Contarini‚ÄìRosselli map was designed by Giovanni Matteo Contarini and engraved by Francesco Rosselli. It is a copper-engraved map and was published in Venice or Florence in 1506. The only surviving copy is in the British Library. ==Age of discovery== There had been many voyages of discovery in the immediately preceding years: * Dias‚Äô rounding of Africa (1487) * the discovery of Newfoundland by John Cabot (1497) * Vasco da Gama‚Äôs travel to India (1499) * the explorations of the Caribbean and South America by Columbus (1492‚Äì93, 1493‚Äì94, 1498, 1502‚Äì04) * visits to the Caribbean and South America by Vespucci (1499, 1501‚Äì02) Although there had been maps created after these voyages, such as Juan de la Cosa‚Äôs map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus' second voyage) and the Cantino world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely guarded. These maps were commissioned by the Portuguese and Spanish governments, which wanted to create trade monopolies over the regions they depicted. The royal powers worried that leaked information about geography could make it easier for other nations to challenge their supremacy. Often a limited number of copies was made, to be held under lock and key. == Publicizing the shape of the world == This situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The Contarini-Rosselli map of 1506 (now in the British Library) and Martin Waldseem√ºller's map of the world and globe of 1507 were influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. By contrast, Johannes Ruysch's 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence. ==References== * A Map of the World Designed by Gio Matteo Contarini Engraved by Franc.

I. King Jordan, Gallaudet University's previous president who was brought into the office as a result of the Deaf President Now Movement announced his retirement for the end of 2006. His successor was narrowed to three possible candidates‚Äîthe two that were eliminated were Ronald Stern and Stephen Weiner, leaving Fernandes the presidency. Critics of the protest, including Jordan, claimed that the protestors felt Fernandes was \\"not deaf enough\\", because despite being born with a hearing impairment, she did not learn ASL until adulthood. However, many of the protestors objected to Fernandes on organizational grounds, claiming that she was not in touch with the students, and ill-liked by the faculty. Ultimately, these protests forced the board of trustees to rescind its appointment of Fernandes, and the board appointed Robert Davila as the interim president of the college for the following two years. ==Fall protest== On 20 September 2006, the Gallaudet Student Congress passed a resolution stating that they did not recognize Jane K. Fernandes as the 9th president of Gallaudet University. Ryan Commerson, LaToya Plummer, Leah Katz-Hernandez, and Delia Lozano-Martinez were named as Faculty, Students, Staff, and Alumni (FSSA) spokespersons. Chris Corrigan was described as the \\"Mayor of Tent City\\" and largely responsible for rallies. Noah Beckman, in his role as Student Body Government president, and Tara Holcomb, as Student Body Government's Director of Ethics and Conduct, emerged as strong voices for the students the SBG represented. The participation of former SBG president/alumna Tawny Holmes and graduate student Erin Moran were also critical. They encouraged the students to speak out about Dr. Jane Fernandes as the 9th president. During October, Commerson essentially filled the role as the democratic leader of the protest, with Holmes as the active alumnus leader and Moran as the coordinator of Tent City. Alumnus Sean Moore was also involved in organizing the impetus to move forward the protest activities. Plummer was key in negotiations with the DC police and the short-lived Fernandes transition-administration. On October 1, 2006, Tent City was in the process of being revived by students when they ran into problems. Campus workers had put down a highly concentrated liquid fertilizer called Earth Juice. The administration claimed that the fertilizing was planned months in advance. The next day, the Tent City was revived to protest the 9th president selection. Eventually the students seized the Hall Memorial Building (HMB), and locked it down in order to prevent any classes from resuming and force the university administration to the negotiation table. On October 6, 2006, officers from the Department of Public Safety raided the Hall Memorial Building in an attempt to break up the lockdown. The students later alleged that the officers assaulted several students. I. King Jordan has ordered an independent investigation. On October 12, 2006, police were called in to arrest the students. ==Black Friday: October 13, 2006== Marking a historical moment in Gallaudet history, 133 protesters were arrested for civil disobedience by the 6th Street gate on October 13, now known as \\"Black Friday\\". The arrests were due to insistent orders by I. King Jordan to the reluctant DC police, who tried to avoid as much involvement with the arrests because, in their words, \\"Those students aren't doing anything wrong.\\" While thousands of alumni and Gallaudet supporters watched, both via the internet and in person, each protester was quietly picked up and carried by campus security officers across the line separating the campus from the public street of DC into a DC Police van. Protest leaders went first, followed by waves of students, alumni and prominent community members. Tim Rarus, one of the 1988 Deaf President Now leaders, was one of the first people arrested. Just prior to being arrested, he shouted \\"I helped put you in office, now you're arresting me!\\". ==Aftermath== National Association of the Deaf's president Bobbie Beth Scoggins of Kentucky cut her vacation short and flew in to declare NAD's support of the students' demands. On October 19, 2006, the Washington Post reported that \\"[o]f the 20 trustees, three of whom are members of Congress, perhaps as many as seven do not support Fernandes becoming president\\". This article was the catalyst in shaking the Board of Trustees up and creating unease in their firm stand to not condone the protest for the first time. On October 21, 2006, more than 4,000 people from around the nation attended a protest march to the Capitol, in Washington D.C. On October 29, 2006, the Board of Gallaudet withdrew its appointment of Fernandes, without naming an alternative. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, Jordan defended Fernandes's remarks and denounced the board's decision and the actions of the protesters, saying, \\"I am convinced that the board made a serious error in acceding to the demands of the protesters by terminating Fernandes's presidency before it began.\\"Gallaudet Chooses Interim President, Washington Post, December 11, 2006 On December 10, 2006, the Board of Trustees announced that Robert Davila would serve as interim president for a period of up to two years. He was formally installed on May 9, 2007, during a ceremony that included a speech by D.C. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who spoke positively of the 2006 protest. He stepped down on December 31, 2009. On June 29, 2007, in the aftermath of the controversy over the university's presidency, Gallaudet was temporarily placed on probation by its accreditation organization, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.Inside Gallaudet ‚Äì Gallaudet University It was also reported that in 2006, the Office of Management and Budget had found that \\"Gallaudet failed to meet its goals or showed declining performance in key areas, including the number of students who stay in school, graduate and either pursue graduate degrees or find jobs upon graduation.\\"On Probation, Washington Post, July 14, 2007. In January 2007, former president Jordan wrote an editorial on the topic that appeared in the Washington Post. The Middle States Commission later reaffirmed Gallaudet's accreditation on June 27, 2008. On October 18, 2009, the Board of Trustees announced that Gallaudet's tenth president would be T. Alan Hurwitz. He began his tenure on January 1, 2010. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Unity for Gallaudet contemporaneous documents, May 2006. * Holmes, Tawny. 2006. Unity for Gallaudet: A Review.

He was killed in action at the Second Battle of Manassas, one of only a handful of well-known pre-war politicians to perish during the conflict. ==Early life and career== Born in the Fairfield District of South Carolina, Means was educated at Mount Zion College in Winnsboro and he graduated from South Carolina College in 1832. He became a planter and his outspoken support of States' rights led him to his election in the General Assembly. During the agitation for secession in the decade prior to the Civil War, Means was elected in 1850 as Governor of South Carolina by the General Assembly, with Lieutenant Governor Joshua John Ward. He presided over a state convention in 1852 that passed a resolution stating that South Carolina had the right to secede if the Federal government sought in any way to disturb the institution of slavery. Furthermore, Means prepared the state for war by increasing the funding of the state militia. ==Civil War== Means signed the Ordinance of Secession in 1860 and enrolled in the Confederate Army, being elected to colonel of the 17th South Carolina Infantry. The regiment saw action in Virginia at the battles of Malvern Hill during the Peninsula Campaign and then at the Rappahannock Station in prelude to the Second Battle of Manassas. As a part of Longstreets corps, the 17th Regiment arrived at 11 a.m. on August 29, 1862, to repulse an attack by Pope on the Confederates' right flank.

It is northeast of Dock Square and southwest of Goose Rocks Beach. The village occupies the mainland adjacent to Cape Porpoise Harbor. More than a dozen islands protect the deep natural harbor. Goat Island Light marks the harbor entrance between Goat and Folly islands. ==History== The area now known as Cape Porpoise was occupied by communities of the Abenaki people when Europeans first made contact in 1602. The primary settlement in the area was Sowocatuck, at the mouth of the Saco River, occupied by the Sokoki band of Abenakis. Cape Porpoise was named by explorer Captain John Smith in 1614 during his exploration of New England. English fishermen began making seasonal residences in the area beginning about 1619 until a year-round European settlement was established in 1629, based on a land grant from the Plymouth Colony. The town was incorporated as \\"Cape Porpus\\" under the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1653. During King William's War in 1689, Indians forced the settlers off the mainland and onto Stage Island until rescued by the English. English settlers abandoned the town until 1699. The Wabanaki Confederacy, which had been created among Abenaki to resist English encroachment, had prevailed in the northern theater of King William's War and continued to push for the removal of European settlers from the area after that war ended: Indians drove settlers away from Cape Porpoise in 1703 until their return in 1717 and made further attacks against settlers in 1723-1727. Active hostilities only stopped when France, the Indians military ally, ceded southern Maine to England after King George's War. During the American Revolutionary War, on August 8, 1782, the English 16 gun brig Meriam and the schooner Hammond entered the harbor and attempted to take a schooner and sloop as prizes. The English took the schooner but ran the sloop aground. The town militia had assembled and fired shore cannons and muskets at the English. The English burned the sloop and then returned to their brig but couldn't escape the harbor because of a growing southern breeze. Over the next few hours, the English towed and warped the brig out of the harbor under musket and cannon fire even as they tried to return gun fire. All combined, more than 20 men were killed during the battle, including Captain James Burnham, one of the town leaders, and the only American casualty.Melville Chase Freeman, History of Cape Porpoise, 1955 In July 2010, singer Taylor Swift filmed the music video for her hit single \\"Mine\\" here.

Harts experienced rapid growth, as Big Bear often opened grocery stores along with a Harts Department Store in an adjacent space as well as many free-standing locations usually vacated by other department stores. At its peak in the late 1980s, there were a total of 29 Harts Stores, but towards the end of 1990, the company decided to favor the Big Bear Plus store format over the Harts general merchandise format and started to slowly shutter or convert all remaining Harts locations.

Dick. It was first published in Astounding SF magazine in June, 1953. Spence Olham, a member of a team designing an offensive weapon to destroy invading aliens known as the Outspacers, is confronted by a colleague and accused by security officer Major Peters of being an android impostor designed to sabotage Earth's defenses. The impostor's ship was damaged and has crashed just outside the city. The android is supposed to detonate a planet-destroying bomb on the utterance of a deadly code phrase. Olham, in an attempt to clear his name and prove his humanity, manages to escape his captors and return to Earth after they fail to kill him on the Moon. Upon reaching Earth, Olham contacts his wife, Mary, but is soon ambushed by security officers waiting for him by his house. Out of options and with Major Peters' forces closing in, Olham decides to prove he is a human by finding the crashed Outspacer spaceship and recovering the android's body from the wreckage. The discovery of a bloody knife by the wreckage indicates to Olham that Peters was correct and that the real Spence Olham had already been killed. The android, now aware of the truth of its existence, proclaims \\"If that's Olham, then I must be...\\" causing the bomb to detonate, the explosion visible even to the Outspacers of Alpha Centauri. ==Adaptations== The story was adapted in 1962 as an episode of the British science fiction television series Out of This World.
